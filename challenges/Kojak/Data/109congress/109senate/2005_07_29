Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2361, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2361) making appropriations for the Department of the \n     Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes, \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 28, 2005.)\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have several unanimous consent requests \nwith respect to our schedule today. Following the time for the two \nleaders, we will consider the Interior appropriations conference report \nunder a 20-minute time limit. Following that debate, we will return to \nthe energy conference report for final closing remarks. At the \nconclusion of that debate, we will have a series of rollcall votes on \nthese measures. I would anticipate those votes occurring sometime \naround 10:45 or so this morning.\n  After those votes are completed, we will return to the gun \nmanufacturers liability bill. We have an agreement for a limited number \nof amendments, with time agreements on each of those. Therefore, we \nwill have votes throughout the afternoon until passage of that \nlegislation.\n  Finally, we will also consider the highway conference report when it \nbecomes available from the House. It is not yet here. All Senators \nshould be aware that we will have a substantial number of rollcall \nvotes today, as many as 13 over the course of the day. Therefore, we \nask that Senators remain close to the Chamber throughout the day to \nfacilitate the votes and our remaining business.\n\n\n          Vitiation of Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 2985\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order with \nrespect to the Legislative branch appropriations conference report be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           stem cell research\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, since 2001 when stem cell research first \ncaptured our Nation's attention, I have said many times the issue will \nhave to be reviewed on an ongoing basis--and not just because the \nscience holds tremendous promise, or because it is developing with \nbreathtaking speed. Indeed, stem cell research presents the first major \nmoral and ethical challenge to biomedical research in the 21st century.\n  In this age of unprecedented discovery, challenges that arise from \nthe nexus of advancing science and ethical considerations will come \nwith increasing frequency. How can they not? Every day we unlock more \nof the mysteries of human life and more ways to promote and enhance our \nhealth. This compels profound questions--moral questions that we \nunderstandably struggle with both as individuals and as a body politic.\n  How we answer these questions today--and whether, in the end, we get \nthem right--impacts the promise not only of current research, but of \nfuture research, as well. It will define us as a\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\ncivilized and ethical society forever in the eyes of history. We are, \nafter all, laying the foundation of an age in human history that will \ntouch our individual lives far more intimately than the Information Age \nand even the Industrial Age before it.\n  Answering fundamental questions about human life is seldom easy. For \nexample, to realize the promise of my own field of heart \ntransplantation and at the same time address moral concerns introduced \nby new science, we had to ask the question: How do we define ``death?'' \nWith time, careful thought, and a lot of courage from people who \nbelieved in the promise of transplant medicine, but also understood the \nabsolute necessity for a proper ethical framework, we answered that \nquestion, allowed the science to advance, and have since saved tens of \nthousands of lives.\n  So when I remove the human heart from someone who is brain dead, and \nI place it in the chest of someone whose heart is failing to give them \nnew life, I do so within an ethical construct that honors dignity of \nlife and respect for the individual.\n  Like transplantation, if we can answer the moral and ethical \nquestions about stem cell research, I believe we will have the \nopportunity to save many lives and make countless other lives more \nfulfilling. That is why we must get our stem cell policy right--\nscientifically and ethically. And that is why I stand on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate today.\n  Four years ago, I came to this floor and laid out a comprehensive \nproposal to promote stem cell research within a thorough framework of \nethics. I proposed 10 specific interdependent principles. They dealt \nwith all types of stem cell research, including adult and embryonic \nstem cells.\n  As we know, adult stem cell research is not controversial on ethical \ngrounds--while embryonic stem cell research is. Right now, to derive \nembryonic stem cells, an embryo--which many, including myself, consider \nnascent human life--must be destroyed. But I also strongly believe--as \ndo countless other scientists, clinicians, and doctors--that embryonic \nstem cells uniquely hold specific promise for some therapies and \npotential cures that adult stem cells cannot provide.\n  I will come back to that later. Right now, though, let me say this: I \nbelieve today--as I believed and stated in 2001, prior to the \nestablishment of current policy--that the Federal Government should \nfund embryonic stem cell research. And as I said 4 years ago, we should \nFederally fund research only on embryonic stem cells derived from \nblastocysts leftover from fertility therapy, which will not be \nimplanted or adopted but instead are otherwise destined by the parents \nwith absolute certainty to be discarded and destroyed.\n  Let me read to you my fifth principle as I presented it on this floor \n4 years ago: No. 5. Provide funding for embryonic stem cell research \nonly from blastocysts that would otherwise be discarded. We need to \nallow Federal funding for research using only those embryonic stem \ncells derived from blastocysts that are left over after in vitro \nfertilization and would otherwise be discarded (Cong. Rec. 18 July \n2001: S7847).\n  I made it clear at the time, and do so again today, that such funding \nshould only be provided within a system of comprehensive ethical \noversight. Federally funded embryonic research should be allowed only \nwith transparent and fully informed consent of the parents. And that \nconsent should be granted under a careful and thorough Federal \nregulatory system, which considers both science and ethics. Such a \ncomprehensive ethical system, I believe, is absolutely essential. Only \nwith strict safeguards, public accountability, and complete \ntransparency will we ensure that this new, evolving research unfolds \nwithin accepted ethical bounds.\n  My comprehensive set of 10 principles, as outlined in 2001 (Cong. \nRec. 18 July 2001: S7846-S7851) are as follows: (1) ban embryo creation \nfor research; (2) continue funding ban on derivation; (3) ban human \ncloning; (4) increase adult stem cell research funding; (5) providing \nfunding for embryonic stem cell research only from blastocysts that \nwould otherwise be discarded; (6) require a rigorous informed consent \nprocess; (7) limit number of stem cell lines; (8) establish a strong \npublic research oversight system; (9) require ongoing, independent \nscientific and ethical review; (10) strengthen and harmonize fetal \ntissue research restrictions.\n  That is what I said 4 years ago, and that is what I believe today. \nAfter all, principles are meant to stand the test of time--even when \napplied to a field changing as rapidly as stem cell research.\n  I am a physician. My profession is healing. I have devoted my life to \nattending to the needs of the sick and suffering and to promoting \nhealth and well being. For the past several years I have temporarily \nset aside the profession of medicine to participate in public policy \nwith a continued commitment to heal.\n  In all forms of stem cell research, I see today, just as I saw in \n2001, great promise to heal. Whether it is diabetes, Parkinson's \ndisease, heart disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, or spinal cord injuries, \nstem cells offer hope for treatment that other lines of research cannot \noffer.\n  Embryonic stem cells have specific properties that make them uniquely \npowerful and deserving of special attention in the realm of medical \nscience. These special properties explain why scientists and physicians \nfeel so strongly about support of embryonic as well as adult stem cell \nresearch.\n  Unlike other stem cells, embryonic stem cells are ``pluripotent.'' \nThat means they have the capacity to become any type of tissue in the \nhuman body. Moreover, they are capable of renewing themselves and \nreplicating themselves over and over again--indefinitely.\n  Adult stem cells meet certain medical needs. But embryonic stem \ncells--because of these unique characteristics--meet other medical \nneeds that simply cannot be met today by adult stem cells. They \nespecially offer hope for treating a range of diseases that require \ntissue to regenerate or restore function.\n  On August 9, 2001, shortly after I outlined my principles (Cong. Rec. \n18 July 2001: S7846-S7851), President Bush announced his policy on \nembryonic stem cell research. His policy was fully consistent with my \nten principles, so I strongly supported it. It federally funded \nembryonic stem cell research for the first time. It did so within an \nethical framework. And it showed respect for human life.\n  But this policy restricted embryonic stem cell funding only to those \ncell lines that had been derived from embryos before the date of his \nannouncement. In my policy I, too, proposed restricting number of cell \nlines, but I did not propose a specific cutoff date. Over time, with a \nlimited number of cell lines, would we be able to realize the full \npromise of embryonic stem cell research?\n  When the President announced his policy, it was widely believed that \n78 embryonic stem cell lines would be available for Federal funding. \nThat has proven not to be the case. Today only 22 lines are eligible. \nMoreover, those lines unexpectedly after several generations are \nstarting to become less stable and less replicative than initially \nthought; they are acquiring and losing chromosomes, losing the normal \nkaryotype, and potentially losing growth control. They also were grown \non mouse feeder cells, which we have learned since, will likely limit \ntheir future potential for clinical therapy in humans (e.g., potential \nof viral contamination).\n  While human embryonic stem cell research is still at a very early \nstage, the limitations put in place in 2001 will, over time, slow our \nability to bring potential new treatments for certain diseases. \nTherefore, I believe the President's policy should be modified. We \nshould expand federal funding--and thus NIH oversight--and current \nguidelines governing stem cell research, carefully and thoughtfully \nstaying within ethical bounds.\n  During the past several weeks, I have made considerable effort to \nbring the debate on stem cell research to the Senate floor, in a way \nthat provided colleagues with an opportunity to express their views on \nthis issue and vote on proposals that reflected those views. While we \nhave not yet reached consensus on how to proceed, the Senate will \nlikely consider the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which passed\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\nthe House in May by a vote of 238 to 194, at some point this Congress. \nThis bill would allow Federal funding of embryonic stem cell research \nfor cells derived from human embryos that: (1) are created for the \npurpose of fertility treatments; (2) are no longer needed by those who \nreceived the treatments; (3) would otherwise be discarded and \ndestroyed; (4) are donated for research with the written, informed \nconsent of those who received the fertility treatments, but do not \nreceive financial or other incentives for their donations.\n  The bill, as written, has significant shortcomings, which I believe \nmust be addressed.\n  First, it lacks a strong ethical and scientific oversight mechanism. \nOne example we should look to is the Recombinant DNA Advisory \nCommittee--RAC--that oversees DNA research. The RAC was established 25 \nyears ago in response to public concerns about the safety of \nmanipulation of genetic material through recombinant DNA techniques. \nCompliance with the guidelines--developed and reviewed by this \noversight board of scientists, ethicists, and public representatives--\nis mandatory for investigators receiving NIH funds for research \ninvolving recombinant DNA.\n  Because most embryonic stem cell research today is being performed by \nthe private sector--without NIH Federal funding--there is today a lack \nof ethical and scientific oversight that routinely accompanies NIH-\nFederal funded research.\n  Second, the bill doesn't prohibit financial or other incentives \nbetween scientists and fertility clinics. Could such incentives, in the \nend, influence the decisions of parents seeking fertility treatments? \nThis bill could seriously undermine the sanctity of the informed \nconsent process.\n  Third, the bill doesn't specify whether the patients or clinic staff \nor anyone else has the final say about whether an embryo will be \nimplanted or will be discarded. Obviously, any decision about the \ndestiny of an embryo must clearly and ultimately rest with the parents.\n  These shortcomings merit a thoughtful and thorough rewrite of the \nbill. But as insufficient as the bill is, it is fundamentally \nconsistent with the principles I laid out more than four years ago. \nThus, with appropriate reservations, I will support the Stem Cell \nResearch Enhancement Act.\n  I am pro-life. I believe human life begins at conception. It is at \nthis moment that th organism is complete--yes, immature--but complete. \nAn embryo is nascent human life. It is genetically distinct. And it is \nbiologically human. it is living. This position is consistent with my \nfaith. But, to me, it isn't just a matter of faith. It is a fact of \nscience.\n  Our development is a continuous process--gradual and chronological. \nWe were all once embryos. The embryo is human life at its earliest \nstage of development. And accordingly, the human embryo has moral \nsignificance and moral worth. It deserves to be treated with the utmost \ndignity and respect.\n  I also believe that embryonic stem cell research should be encouraged \nand supported. But, just as I said in 2001, it should advance in a \nmanner that affords all human life dignity and respect--the same \ndignity and respect we bring to the table as we work with children and \nadults to advance the frontiers of medicine and health.\n  Congress must have the ability to fully exercise its oversight \nauthority on an ongoing basis. And policymakers, I believe, have a \nresponsibility to re-examine stem cell research policy in the future \nand, if necessary, make adjustments.\n  This is essential, in no small part, because of promising research \nnot even imagined four years ago. Exciting techniques are now emerging \nthat may make it unnecessary to destroy embryos--even those that will \nbe discarded anyway--to obtain cells with the same unique \n``pluripotential'' properties as embryonic stem cells.\n  For example, an adult stem cell could be ``reprogrammed'' back to an \nearlier embryonic stage. This, in particular, may prove to be the best \nway, both scientifically and ethically, to overcome rejection and other \nbarriers to effective stem cell therapies. To me--and I would hope to \nevery member of this body--that's research worth supporting. Shouldn't \nwe want to discover therapies and cures--given a choice--through the \nmost ethical and moral means?\n  So let me make it crystal clear: I strongly support newer, \nalternative means of deriving, creating, and isolating pluripotent stem \ncells--whether they are true embryonic stem cells or stem cells that \nhave all of the unique properties of embryonic stem cells.\n  With more Federal support and emphasis, these newer methods, though \nstill preliminary today, may offer huge scientific and clinical pay-\noffs. And just as important, they may bridge moral and ethical \ndifferences among people who now hold very different views on stem cell \nresearch because they totally avoid destruction of any human embryos.\n  These alternative methods of potentially deriving pluripotent cells \ninclude: (1) extraction from embryos that are no longer living; (2) \nnon-lethal and nonharmful extraction from embryos; (3) extraction from \nartificially created organisms that are not embryos, but embryo-like; \n(4) reprogramming adult cells to a pluripotent state through fusion \nwith embryonic cell lines.\n  Now, to date, adult stem cell research is the only type of stem cell \nresearch that has resulted in proven treatments for human patients. For \nexample, the multi-organ and multi-tissue transplant center that I \nfounded and directed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center performed \nscores of life-saving bone marrow transplants every year to treat fatal \ncancers with adult stem cells.\n  And stem cells taken from cord blood have shown great promise in \ntreating leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders and congenital immune \nsystem disorders. Recently, cord blood cells have shown some ability to \nbecome neural cells, which could lead to treatments for Parkinson's \ndisease and heart disease.\n  Thus, we should also strongly support increased funding for adult \nstem cell research. I am a cosponsor of a bill that will make it much \neasier for patients to receive cord blood cell treatments.\n  Adult stem cells are powerful. They have effectively treated many \ndiseases and are theoretically promising for others. But embryonic stem \ncells--because they can become almost any human tissue \n(``pluripotent'') and renew and replicate themselves infInitely--are \nuniquely necessary for potentially treating other diseases.\n  No doubt, the ethical questions over embryonic stem cell research are \nprofound.They are challenging. They merit serious debate. And not just \non the Senate floor, but across America--at our dining room tables, in \nour community centers, on our town squares.\n  We simply cannot flinch from the need to talk with each other, again \nand again, as biomedical progress unfolds and breakthroughs are made in \nthe coming years and generations. The promise of the Biomedical Age is \ntoo profound for us to fail.\n  That is why I believe it is only fair, on an issue of such magnitude, \nthat senators be given the respect and courtesy of having their ideas \nin this arena considered separately and cleanly, instead of in a whirl \nof amendments and complicateliamentary maneuvers. I have been working \nto bring this about for the last few months. I will continue to do so.\n  And when we are able to bring this to the floor, we will certainly \nhave a serious and thoughtful debate in the Senate. There are many \nconflicting points of view. And I recognize these differing views more \nthan ever in my service as majority leader: I have had so many \nindividual and private conversations with my colleagues that reflect \nthe diversity and complexity of thought on this issue.\n  So how do we reconcile these differing views? As individuals, each of \nus holds views shaped by factors of intellect, of emotion, of spirit. \nIf your daughter has diabetes, if your father has Parkinson's, if your \nsister has a spinal cord injury, your views will be swayed more \npowerfully than you can imagine by the hope that cure will be found in \nthose magnificent cells, recently discovered, that today originate only \nin an embryo.\n  As a physician, one should give hope--but never false hope. \nPolicymakers, similarly, should not overpromise and give false hope to \nthose\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\nsuffering from disease. And we must be careful to always stay within \nclear and comprehensive ethical and moral guidelines--the soul of our \ncivilization and the conscience of our nation demand it.\n  Cure today may be just a theory, a hope, a dream. But the promise is \npowerful enough that I believe this research deserves our increased \nenergy and focus. Embryonic stem cell research must be supported. It is \ntime for a modified policy--the right policy for this moment in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the distinguished majority leader \nleaves the floor, I want to, through the Chair, express to him my \nappreciation for the courageous statement he made. It was a moral \ndecision made by the majority leader of the Senate. His decision will \nbring hope to millions of Americans who face these terrible diseases, \nand it has even more meaning as a result of the medical background the \nSenator from Tennessee has.\n  I know there is still a long way to go legislatively, but a large \nstep has been taken by the majority leader today to give hope to the \npeople of Nevada who suffer from these diseases, the people from \nGeorgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and all over America. I admire the \nmajority leader for doing this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Frist. I believe the speech which he has made on the \nSenate floor is the most important speech made this year and perhaps \nthe most important speech made for many years because this issue of \nembryonic stem cell research is the difference between life and death.\n  When Senator Frist says what he has stated this morning, it has an \nenormous impact as to science because of his unique position and \nrespected position as a scientist, as a doctor, as a medical \nresearcher, but enormous impact on Government. I use the word \n``government'' instead of ``politics'' because this has an impact on \nGovernment when the majority leader is taking the position which he has \ntaken. I believe it is especially weighty because of the \nthoughtfulness, the deliberation, and the time he has utilized bringing \nall of his abilities to bear--his considerable abilities to bear. The \nthoughtfulness and deliberation emphasizes the importance of what he \nhas said.\n  On a personal note, I have had an opportunity to talk with Senator \nFrist about it many times over the course of the past 4 years. I know \nhow he has wrestled with this issue and how conscientious he is in his \njudgment.\n  One final comment, and that is, Dr. Frist, Senator Frist, Majority \nLeader Frist's comments will reverberate far and wide, around the \nworld. This is a speech which will be heard around the world, including \nat the White House. I have had the opportunity to talk with the \nPresident on this issue on a number of occasions. He was in \nPennsylvania 44 times last year, and I had a good opportunity to talk \nwith him in the car and on the plane. The President made a very \nimportant decision on August 9 of 2001 on liberating some 63 stem cell \nlines. There is some discussion as to how many there were. Sixty-three \nwas the initial line. I know the President will listen to what Senator \nFrist has to say. I am not saying he is going to agree with it. But \nwhat Senator Frist has had to say is weighty and I think may bring us \nall together on this issue. So I congratulate my distinguished leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I, too, wish to recognize the comments \nmade by the majority leader this morning and to thank him for his call \nfor a ban on human cloning, which was one of the principles that he \noutlined when he spoke this morning. I am interested in bringing this \nimportant topic to the Senate floor for debate.\n  I would note a couple of points about the different issues we face \nwhen we consider the many new aspects of evolving science. Yesterday \nmorning's Washington Post found pluripotent adult stem cells being able \nto make eggs. Also, the June edition of the Science journal talks about \nthe antibodies and the alleged problems with embryonic stem cell lines \nthat are currently being developed. This article states that the \nconcern with the lines being built on mouse feeder cells is overblown, \nand that those concerns are overstated. In addition, I think more of \nthese lines may end up being available.\n  I note for my colleagues and the Majority Leader, whom I regard very \nhighly--he is a brilliant individual and works very hard--that he \narticulated 10 principles regarding ethics in research and medical \ntreatment, and I appreciate them. I was there 4 years ago when the \nMajority Leader articulated the 10 principles--this is before he was \nMajority Leader--and he has stuck by them today.\n  However, there is a basic principle involved that is here, and that \nis whether or not a young, living human embryo is a life or a piece of \nproperty. And how is it going to be treated? I think we have to deal \nwith the precursor principles before we can go ahead with unrestricted \nresearch on this issue. Even as carefully as such research may be \ndrawn, one has to make this determination: Is it life?\n  Is it person or property? It is one or another. If it is person, \nrespect it as a person. If it is property, it can be done with as its \nmaster chooses. That is the principle we have to dig into first. I hope \nwe can get into that in the upcoming debate we will conduct on the \nentire range of these issues, hopefully on the entire range of human \ncloning and adult stem cell research--adult stem cell research, where \nwe have 65 human treatments currently taking place.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. I do differ on the need \nto expand embryonic stem cell research.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the three items that I \nreferenced.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nBenefits of Stem Cells to Human Patients--Adult Stem Cells v.

Human ES Cells Head Toward the Clinic\n\n       Shortly before Congressman James Langevin cast his vote \n     last month to relax federal rules on funding of stem cell \n     research, the Rhode Island Democrat told his colleagues, ``I \n     believe one day I will walk again.'' Langevin, who has been \n     paralyzed since a gun accident at age 16, pleaded with his \n     colleagues to vote with him. ``Stem cell research gives us \n     hope and a reason to believe. . . . We have a historic \n     opportunity to make a difference for millions of Americans.''\n       With impassioned pleas like this, high-stakes battles in \n     Congress, and billions of private and state dollars pouring \n     into research on human embryonic stem (hES) cells, it often \n     seems their therapeutic applications must be just around the \n     corner. But a careful parsing of the claims from even the \n     strongest advocates reveals the caveat ``someday.''\n       How soon that someday might arrive is far from clear. \n     Scientists are nearly unanimous that the study of hES cells \n     will illuminate human development and disease. But whether \n     the cells will actually be used to cure patients like \n     Langevin is less certain. Cell therapies are more complicated \n     than drugs, and hES cells, which have the potential to become \n     any cell type in the body, carry special risks.\n       ``The most sobering thing about [hES] cells is their \n     power,'' says neuroscientist Clive Svendsen of the University \n     of Wisconsin, Madison, who works with both fetal and \n     embryonic stem cells. The extreme flexibility and capacity \n     for growth characteristic of ES cells makes them ideal for \n     producing large quantities of therapeutic cells to treat, \n     say, diabetes or spinal cord injuries. But these same traits \n     also increase the risk that renegade cells could, as they \n     have in animal studies, cause unwanted side effects, \n     ending up in the wrong place or even sparking cancerous \n     growth. ``You have to learn to control that power in the \n     dish'' before thinking about putting the cells into \n     patients, says Svendsen.\n       For that reason, most groups say they are at least five or, \n     more likely, 10 years away from clinical trials. But one \n     company is challenging that timeline. Geron in Menlo Park, \n     California, says its animal studies suggest that stem cell \n     therapy can be safe and might be effective for a select group \n     of patients. The company hopes to start clinical trials of \n     hES cells to treat spinal cord injuries as early as summer \n     2006. Already, the company is in discussions with the Food \n     and Drug Administration (FDA), which is attempting to set \n     safety standards for the field. Potential treatments with \n     human ES cells face the same difficulties as all cell \n     therapies, notes Malcolm Moos of FDA's division of cellular \n     and gene therapies: There are few standardized techniques to \n     measure the purity or potency of a cell population that would \n     be delivered to a patient.\n       Most stem cell researchers view Geron's plans with hefty \n     skepticism and caution that a premature rush to patients \n     could seriously damage the already-controversial field. And \n     it is far from clear whether FDA will allow the trial to \n     proceed. But Geron, which funded the researchers who isolated \n     the first hES cells in 1998, has several reasons to push \n     ahead; the company holds a number of patents and exclusive \n     licenses that give it more freedom--and more incentive--to \n     develop possible products from hES cells. And whatever the \n     outcome, scientists agree, Geron's ambitious plans will offer \n     a test case of the hurdles scientists will have to overcome \n     to prove that hES therapies are both safe and effective.\n       Even the skeptics say Geron chose a plausible target for \n     the first trial, as spinal cord injuries may be significantly \n     easier to tackle than diseases such as diabetes or \n     Parkinson's. The trials would be based on work led by Hans \n     Keirstead, a neuroscientist at the University of California, \n     Irvine, who proved a persuasive spokesperson for the field \n     during the campaign for California's Proposition 71, which \n     provides $3 bil1ion in funding for hES cell research.\n       During last fall's campaign, Keirstead described his then-\n     unpublished work, showing videos of rats with spinal cord \n     injuries that had regained some mobility after injections of \n     cells derived from hES cells. ``I am extremely \n     enthusiastic,'' Keirstead says. ``I am past the point of \n     hope. In my mind the question is when. What we are seeing in \n     these animal models is tremendous.''\n       Keirstead and his colleagues, with funding and technical \n     support from Geron, have developed a protocol that encourages \n     hES cells to differentiate into cells called oligodendrocyte \n     precursors. These cells can form oligodendrocytes, the cells \n     that, among other functions, produce the protective myelin \n     sheath that allows neurons to send signals along their axons. \n     This sheath is often lost during spinal cord injuries.\n       In a paper last month in the Journal of Neuroscience, \n     Keirstead's team reported that these precursors, when \n     injected into the spinal cord, could help improve recovery of \n     rats that had suffered spinal cord injury. The cells aren't \n     replacing injured neurons, Keirstead says, but are \n     encouraging the natural healing process, presumably by \n     restoring some of the myelination. Earlier studies in mice \n     (Science, 30 July 1999, p. 754) showed that injecting mouse \n     cells destined to form oligodendrocytes into injured or \n     diseased animals could restore some myelination; Keirstead's \n     team is the first to show that human ES cells can have \n     similar effects.\n       For newly injured rats, the results are promising. In \n     animals that received oligodendrocyte precursors 7 days after \n     their injury, the cells survived and apparently helped repair \n     the spinal cord's myelin. Within 2 weeks, treated rats scored \n     significantly better on standardized movement tests than \n     control animals, which had received human fibro-blasts or a \n     cell-free injection.\n       But when the researchers injected cells 10 months after the \n     injury, they saw no effect-sobering news for people \n     like Langevin suffering from old injuries. The cells \n     survived but were apparently unable to repair the long-\n     term damage. For that reason, Keirstead says, Geron's \n     proposed clinical trial would target newly injured \n     patients.\n       The phase I trial, if it goes forward, will probably \n     include only a handful of patients and, most importantly, \n     Keirstead emphasizes, will not cure anyone. Its primary goal \n     is to show that the treatment can be safe. ``The public and \n     scientists must realize that these are the first attempts,'' \n     Keirstead says. ``No one is expecting them to cure. We are \n     expecting them to treat, but we have no idea what the level \n     of response is going to be.''\n       Proving safety is a tall enough order. In numerous animal \n     studies, ES cells from mice and humans have proved difficult \n     to control, differentiating into the wrong kind of cell, for \n     instance, or migrating away from the injection site.\n       In its spinal cord trial, Geron plans to inject ES-derived \n     cells that can form just a single cell type, an approach that \n     may circumvent some of these problems. For a full recovery, \n     patients are likely to need new neurons as well as other \n     support cells called astrocytes, but using precursors that \n     differentiate into all three types of nerve cells can be \n     problematic. In several rodent studies, partially \n     differentiated mouse ES cells injected into the spinal cord \n     have formed neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and \n     have helped animals recover from spinal cord injuries. But \n     more recently, neural stem cells derived from adult animals \n     which also differentiate into the three cell types-have \n     caused problems. As Christoph Hofstetter of the Karolinska \n     Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and his colleagues reported \n     in Nature Neuroscience in March, neural stem cell treatments \n     led to some recovery in rats' paralyzed hind legs, but the \n     animals also developed a chronic pain sensitivity in their \n     forelegs, which had been unaffected by the injury. In other \n     experiments, preventing the formation of astrocytes seemed to \n     eliminate the side effect, highlighting the importance of \n     proper differentiation, Svendsen says.\n       Perhaps the biggest worry is that hES therapies will spur \n     tumor formation. One of the defining characteristics of ES \n     cells is that they form disorganized tumors, called \n     teratomas, when injected in undifferentiated form under the \n     skin of immune-compromised mice. ``The ES cell is basically \n     a tumor-forming cell,'' says neuroscientist Anders \n     Bjorklund of Lund University in Sweden. ``This aspect has \n     to be dealt with seriously before the cells are applied in \n     the clinic.'' Even a benign tumor in the central nervous \n     system would be serious, says Svendsen: ``Any sort of \n     growth in the spinal cord is not good news.''\n       But Keirstead believes he has solved those problems. The \n     key, he says, is a differentiation procedure that he claims \n     produces cell populations in which 97% of cells express genes \n     typical of oligodendrocyte precursors. ``Teratomas are a real \n     possibility if you put in naive stem cells,'' he \n     acknowledges. ``But that is the science of yesteryear. No one \n     is even considering putting in any naive ES cells.'' \n     Keirstead and his colleagues say in their paper that they \n     found no evidence that their specialized cells formed \n     astrocytes or neurons after injection. The team is also \n     checking whether any of the injected cells leave the spinal \n     cord. So far, Keirstead says, they seem to stay close to the \n     site of injection.\n       Keirstead's paper is promising, Svendsen says, but he's not \n     convinced the work is ready for patients. ``It didn't go into \n     the detail you'd like to see before a clinical trial,'' he \n     says. The catch is that it's hard to be sure that a \n     population of several million cells is free of any \n     undifferentiated stragglers. To evaluate the risk of tumors, \n     Keirstead and his colleagues are testing the differentiated \n     cells in nude mice: animals bred to lack an immune system. If \n     the animals live for a year without signs of teratomas, then \n     Keirstead says he will feel confident that the cells are safe \n     to try in humans.\n       Several teams are making headway addressing another \n     problem: possible animal contamination. To date, almost all \n     human ES cell lines have been exposed to animal products. \n     Cultured cells are often kept alive with fetal calf serum, \n     for instance, and most hES cell lines have been grown on \n     layers of mouse cells called feeder cells, which provide the \n     key proteins that prevent ES cells from differentiating.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n       These techniques have sparked worries that hES cell \n     therapies could introduce exotic animal viruses into \n     patients. In response, several teams, including Geron, \n     have recently developed ways to grow new cell lines either \n     on human feeder layers or without feeder cells at all.\n       But the older cell lines have the advantage of being better \n     characterized, says Geron CEO Thomas Okarma. That's why the \n     company plans to use one of the original lines derived by \n     James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in its \n     first clinical trial. To reduce the risk of contamination, \n     the company has been growing these cells for more than a year \n     without any feeder cells. That may suffice for FDA, which has \n     said that past exposure to animal cells does not disqualify \n     ES cell lines from clinical use as long as certain safety \n     standards are met.\n       Okarma says Geron can demonstrate that its cells are \n     uncontaminated. His claim is bolstered by a paper by another \n     group published last week in Stem Cells. Joseph Itskovitz-\n     Eldor of Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa and \n     his colleagues tested five hES cell lines and several \n     cultures of mouse feeder cells for signs of murine \n     retroviruses, which lurk in the genome of all mouse cells. \n     Although the team identified receptors for the so-called \n     mouse leukemia viruses, they found no evidence that the virus \n     had infected any of the human cells, even after growing on \n     mouse feeders for years. Animal products still may pose a \n     risk, says Itskovitz-Eldor. But the new work shows that ``the \n     cells can be tested, and we believe it will be possible to \n     use them clinically.''\n       More recently, researchers identified another potential \n     downside to using mouse feeder cells. In February, Fred Gage \n     and his colleagues at the Salk Institute for Biological \n     Studies in La Jolla, California, reported that hES cells \n     grown with mouse feeders expressed a foreign sugar molecule \n     on their cell surface. Because humans carry antibodies to the \n     molecule, the researchers suggested that it might tag the \n     cells for destruction by the human immune system. If so, then \n     any therapy created with existing cell lines was unlikely to \n     succeed. But Keirstead, Okarma, and others now say that those \n     concerns, widely reported, may have been overstated. Gage and \n     his noted that the sugar gradually disappears once cells are \n     removed from the feeder layers. Keirstead says that once \n     cells are removed from mouse feeder layers for several \n     months, the sugar disappears. Okarma adds that cells in \n     Geron's feeder-free cultures have no sign of the foreign \n     molecule.\n       Finally, some scientists worry that ES cells might acquire \n     harmful new mutations in culture, a common phenomenon with \n     almost all cultured cells. Although ES cells ``are probably \n     100 times more stable than adult stem cells in culture, \n     they're not perfect,'' cautions Mahendra Rao of the National \n     Institute on Aging in Baltimore, Maryland. Such mutations \n     would be particularly hard to detect ahead of time.\n       FDA, meanwhile, is trying to set safety standards for this \n     burgeoning field. The agency announced in 2000 that cell \n     therapies involving stem cells from embryos or adults would \n     be regulated as drugs, not as surgical techniques. That means \n     that researchers will have to meet certain standards of \n     purity and potency. For most drugs, those standards are \n     straightforward to set and easy to measure. Cellular products \n     are much more complicated, * * *\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Still Waiting Their Turn\n\n       Even enthusiasts agree that Geron's goal--to begin testing \n     a human embryonic stem (hES) cell therapy in patients with \n     spinal cord injury within a year--is a long shot. Prospects \n     are more distant for using stem cells to treat other \n     diseases, such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic \n     lateral scleroris (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). None is \n     likely to reach the clinic for at least 5 to 10 years, most \n     scientists in the field agree. And that's assuming abundant \n     funding and faster-than-expected scientific progress.\n       Some of the strongest advocates for hES cell research are \n     those hoping to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. The driving \n     force behind California's Proposition 71, Robert Klein, says, \n     for example, that his primary motivation is to find a cure \n     for his diabetic son. Diabetes kills the pancreas's B cells, \n     which regulate the amount of insulin in the blood. Patients \n     have to take frequent insulin injections and face many \n     complications, including kidney failure and blindness. \n     Replacing the missing cells could cure the disease. Initial \n     trials using B-cell transplant from cadavers have shown \n     promise, but side effects and the transplants' limited life \n     span has dampened enthusiasm (Science, 1 October 2004, p. \n     34). And even if the therapy worked perfectly, each \n     transplant requires cells from multiple cadavers. So \n     researchers are looking for renewable sources of cells that \n     could treat the millions of patients who might benefit.\n       In theory, hES cells fit the bill nicely. In practice, \n     however, although several groups have managed to coax mouse \n     ES cells to differentiate into cells that make insulin, no \n     one has yet managed to derive bona fide B cells from either \n     mouse or human ES cells. One reason may be that unlike nerve \n     cells or heart muscle cells, pancreatic cells are some of the \n     last to develop during pregnancy. In mice, the cells appear \n     on day 15 or 16, just a day or two before birth, and in \n     humans, they appear in the 5th or 6th month. ``If the road is \n     longer, the possibility of getting lost is much higher,'' \n     explains Bernat Soria of Miguel Hernandez University of \n     Alicante, Spain, who has tried to produce B-like cells from \n     both mouse and human ES cells. Fortunately , says Soria, the \n     cells may not have to be perfect; several types of insulin-\n     producing cells have helped alleviate diabetes symptoms in \n     mice.\n       But there is no leeway when it comes to safety. Diabetes is \n     a chronic but not inevitably deadly disease, so any cell \n     therapy must be safer and more effective than insulin shots. \n     ``We don't have a cure, but we have a treatment,'' Soria \n     says. ``Despite the strong pressure we have from patients and \n     families, the need for cell therapy is not as strong.\n       Scientists have already attempted to use cell therapies to \n     treat Parkinson's disease, which attacks neurons in the brain \n     that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, leaving patients \n     increasingly unable to move. In a handful or clinical trials \n     in the last decade, physicians implanted dopamine-producing \n     cells from fetal tissue--with decidely mixed results. Whereas \n     some patients showed significant improvement, others show \n     little or none. And some developed serious side effects \n     including uncontrollable jerky movements. Scientists \n     aren't yet sure what went wrong, although some suspect \n     that patients may have received either too many or too few \n     fetal cells, which are difficult to characterize in the \n     lab.\n       Dopamine-producing neurons derived from ES cells could \n     provide an unlimited and well-characterized source of cells. \n     And a trial in monkeys from a team at Kyoto University found \n     that dopamine-producing neurons grown from monkey ES cells \n     could improve animals' symptoms. But before ES-derived cells \n     are tested in Parkinson's patients, scientists need to \n     understand more about how the transplanted cells are behaving \n     in the brain, says neuroscientist Anders Bjorklund of Lund \n     University in Sweden. ``The knowledge is just not good enough \n     yet to justify any clinical trials'' with hES cells, he says.\n       Patients and doctors facing the nightmare of ALS may be \n     willing to accept higher risks associated with early hES cell \n     treatments. There is no effective treatment for this \n     invariably fatal disease that kills motor neurons, and \n     patients usually die within 5 years of a diagnosis. But ``ALS \n     is an order of magnitude harder than other diseases'' to \n     treat with cell therapy, says motor disease specialist \n     Douglas Kerr of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, \n     Maryland. Doctors still aren't sure what causes the disease, \n     and even if scientists could coax stem cells to replace the \n     lost motor neurons--``a pretty tall order,'' Kerr says--any \n     new neurons could be subject to the same deadly assault. More \n     promising, he says, would be a cell or a mixture of cells \n     that might somehow help slow the damage, but no one is sure \n     what that might look like.\n       Treating MS has similar challenges, says Hans Keirstead of \n     the University of California, Irvine, who is working with \n     Geron on its possible spinal cord injury trial. ``We're much \n     farther away from treating MS with stem cells,'' he says. \n     Like spinal cord injuries, the disease attacks the myelin \n     sheath around nerve cells, and injected oligo-dendrocyte \n     precursors have shown positive effects in animal models. But \n     the human situation is more complicated, Keirstead says. \n     Nerves damaged by MS are already surrounded by \n     oligodendrocyte precursors, but something stops the cells \n     from working. Indeed, Keirstead, who is relentlessly \n     optimistic about the prospects of helping spinal cord injury \n     patients, sounds much more sober about the prospects for \n     other patients. ``When I look at the work with Parkinson's, \n     MS, and stroke, I think spinal cord injuries are very \n     amenable to these strategies. The rest of the central nervous \n     system is not.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 28, 2005]\n\n       Scientists Claim To Find Cells That Restore Egg Production\n\n                             (By Rob Stein)\n\n       A team of Harvard scientists is claiming the discovery of a \n     reservoir of cells that appear capable of replenishing the \n     ovaries of sterilized mice, possibly providing new ways to \n     help infertile women have babies.\n       While cautioning that more research is needed to confirm \n     that similar cells exist in women and that they can safely \n     restore fertility, the researchers said the findings could \n     revolutionize the understanding of female reproduction and \n     the power to manipulate it.\n       ``This may launch a new era in how to think about female \n     infertility and menopause,'' said Jonathan L. Tilly, a \n     reproductive biologist at Harvard Medical School and \n     Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who led the \n     research. It is being published in tomorrow's issue of the \n     journal Cell.\n       Other researchers agreed that the findings could have \n     profound implications, but several expressed caution and \n     skepticism, saying many key questions remain about whether \n     the researchers have proved their claims.\n       ``This is really exciting and a revolutionary idea. The \n     implications are potentially huge,'' said Lawrence Nelson of \n     the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \n     ``But before this could have any type of application to \n     humans, a whole lot of work has to be done. We have to be \n     careful not to get ahead of ourselves.''\n       But Tilly said he was confident of his findings, which \n     could, for example, enable women to bank egg-producing cells \n     when they are young in case they have health\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\n     problems that leave them infertile or they get too old.\n       ``In theory, these cells could provide an insurance policy. \n     We could harvest them and store them away for 20 years. Then \n     you put them back in, and they are going to do exactly what \n     they are supposed to--find the ovaries and generate new \n     eggs'' to restore fertility, Tilly said.\n       The discovery could also lead to ways to prevent, delay or \n     reverse menopause, perhaps by stimulating dormant cells in \n     the bone marrow or ``tweaking'' the ovaries to accept them, \n     Tilly said. It may also be possible to transplant them from \n     one woman to another, he said.\n       In addition, because the cells appear to be a particularly \n     versatile type of adult stem cell, they could provide an \n     alternative to those obtained from embryos, avoiding the \n     political and ethical debates raging around the use of those \n     cells.\n       ``The implications are mind-boggling, really,'' Tilly said.\n       The research is a follow-up to results the team reported in \n     March 2004, when it claimed it had shown that mice can \n     produce eggs throughout their lives. For decades, scientific \n     dogma has been that female mammals such as mice and humans \n     are born with a finite number of eggs. To alleviate doubts \n     about their original claim, the researchers conducted another \n     round of experiments, which they said confirm the findings \n     and explain how it might work.\n       First, the scientists sterilized female mice with a cancer \n     chemotherapy drug that destroyed eggs in the ovaries but \n     spared any egg-producing cells elsewhere. They tested the \n     animals' ovaries 12 to 24 hours later and found signs their \n     egg supply was rapidly regenerating. Two months later, the \n     animals' ovaries looked normal, and they remained that way \n     for life.\n       After tests indicated the source of the cells may lie in \n     the animals' bone marrow, the researchers infused marrow from \n     healthy mice into those that were either genetically \n     engineered to be infertile or had been made infertile with \n     chemotherapy. Two months later, the recipients' ovaries \n     looked normal, whereas those that had not received the \n     transplants remained barren, the researchers reported. Blood \n     transfusions produced similar results, they said.\n       The researchers then infused blood into infertile mice from \n     animals that had been genetically engineered so that their \n     reproductive stem cells glowed fluorescent green. Within two \n     days, green egg cells appeared in the recipients' ovaries, \n     which the researchers said indicated the cells had traveled \n     through the blood to the ovaries.\n       Finally, the researchers screened human bone marrow and \n     blood from healthy women and found that both tested positive \n     for biological markers indicating the presence of immature \n     reproductive cells.\n       ``Mice and humans appear to be the same--they appear to \n     have a set of genes in bone marrow consistent with . . . \n     cells that can make themselves a new egg,'' Tilly said.\n       The findings could help explain previously mysterious cases \n     of women sterilized by cancer treatment who spontaneously \n     became pregnant after receiving bone marrow transplants, \n     Tilly said. This may happen only rarely because some, but not \n     all, techniques used to process bone marrow before \n     transplantation may destroy the cells in some cases, he \n     speculated.\n       The research triggered a mixture of excitement, caution and \n     deep skepticism.\n       ``It's quite amazing,'' said Hans Schoeler of the Max \n     Planck Institute in Germany. ``The idea that cells from bone \n     marrow may be a reservoir for egg cells would be quite \n     astonishing.''\n       But Schoeler and other researchers cautioned that many \n     crucial questions remained. Several researchers had doubts \n     about some of the techniques the researchers used. Others \n     were puzzled by the speed with which the ovaries appeared to \n     be repopulated with eggs. Many pointed out that the \n     researchers had failed to show the eggs were viable, the mice \n     were ovulating or that they could give birth to healthy \n     offspring.\n       ``I'm very skeptical,'' said David F. Albertini of the \n     University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. \n     ``There are a lot of holes in the research.''\n       Tilly attributed the skepticism to the radical nature of \n     the findings and said he already had work underway to address \n     the concerns, including breeding studies aimed at producing \n     healthy offspring.\n       ``We hope we will have the answers very soon,'' Tilly said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this morning, the majority leader made some comments \nregarding stem cell research. I appreciate his comments. It was a \nstatement of conscience. I think for each of us in the Senate this \nissue comes down to a statement of conscience. I believe we need to \ntake additional steps in support of stem cell research and control it \nin an ethical way because it has the promise of saving lives. I \ntherefore support the House-passed legislation that Senator Specter and \nSenator Hatch have introduced. I support the legislation that our \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has reported to the \nSenate for Federal support for cord blood research. I am looking \nforward to seeing more from Senator Coleman regarding his work to \ndevelop an alternative way of supporting Federal research for stem \ncells which already exist, but not in the future. In other words, I am \nlooking for ways to support this important research because it has the \npromise of saving lives.\n  I am pro-life, Mr. President. I am opposed to human cloning. I will \nvote to criminalize human cloning. But I support this legislation that \nis offered by Senator Hatch and Senator Specter. President Bush has \nalready said that Federal funds may be used in some cases for research \non some stem cell lines derived from fertilized eggs. With the help of \nfertility clinics, some prospective parents use fertilized eggs to help \nthem have children. Those excess eggs that these parents do not use are \noften thrown away. I support using some of those fertilized eggs that \nwould otherwise be thrown away under carefully controlled conditions \nwith the consent of the donors for potentially lifesaving research that \nmay help cure juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's disease, spinal injuries, \nand other debilitating diseases.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nstatement. I think it is extremely important that he has joined a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate to make progress on a critically \nimportant issue.\n  Senator Frist and I have our differences politically, but I respect \nand admire him very much, particularly in his humanitarian efforts as a \ndoctor. All of us in the Senate know while we may be back home in our \nStates, he is off in some of the poorest places in the world using his \nmedical skill to save lives. It says a lot about him. It says a lot \nabout his heart, as does his statement this morning.\n  The fact he would come out and suggest that we need to move forward \nin stem cell research is going to give new hope to people who \nabsolutely count on medical research for their future and for the life \nand well-being of members of their families.\n  I have had roundtable discussions in my State. I have invited people \nwho are suffering from diabetes, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, and \nfrom spinal cord injuries. They have all come forward to tell me how \ncritically important stem cell research could be to making their lives \nwhole and better.\n  Senator Frist's decision today will move us toward a goal, a very \nimportant goal of establishing good lines for pursuing this research. \nThe Castle-Degette bill, which comes from the House of Representatives, \nprovides a conscience clause. It says neither the sperm nor egg donor \ncan be asked to give up anything they put into the in vitro process \nwithout their consent. There must be a conscience clause included in \nthis process. I agree with that.\n  We also must establish that we are opposed to human cloning, which I \nam, and I don't know of any Senator who disagrees. Human cloning is \nwrong, and we must draw strict ethical guidelines to make sure we do \nnot cross that line.\n  Also, we never want to see the commercialization of this process. \nThis is about scientific research. It is not about who is going to make \na profit, and the Castle-Degette bill is very explicit in that regard.\n  My colleague from Kansas raises an important point. It is one he and \nI can debate and it can be debated for centuries about when life \nbegins. I am not sure we will ever come to the same conclusion, but it \nis important we talk about it.\n  The thing that troubles me about this debate is that those who oppose \nstem cell research apparently are not prepared to criminalize in vitro \nfertilization. They are prepared to allow the process to move forward \nknowing full well in the ordinary course of events in the laboratory, \nthere will be stem cells that cannot be used to impregnate the woman \nwho is seeking to have a baby.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will my colleague yield for a comment on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When I finish my remarks, I will be happy to do so.\n  The point I am making is this: I have a friend, a woman I have known \nsince\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\nshe was a young girl. She is married. She and her husband were unable \nto bring a child into this world. They went to the doctor and said: \nCould in vitro be the answer? The doctor said: We can try.\n  They spent $40,000 trying unsuccessfully. Heartbroken, they went home \nand waited and saved up enough money and borrowed enough money to try \nagain, and they were successful. They have a beautiful baby whom they \nlove to pieces.\n  They went to those extraordinary lengths because of their love for \none another and their desire to bring life into this world together. I \ncannot believe there is anything immoral about that motive or that \neffort by this couple and hundreds or thousands of other couples across \nAmerica.\n  The Senator from Kansas knows and I know that in the course of in \nvitro fertilization for these good reasons, there will be stem cells \nthat are not going to be used to impregnate the woman who is seeking to \nhave the baby. Some of them are frozen for future use, many are \ncurrently discarded. If the argument from the Senator from Kansas is \nthat they are life and, therefore, cannot be used for research, then I \ncan't understand why the Senator is not calling for the criminalization \nof in vitro fertilization which necessarily leads to excess stem cells.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Without my yielding the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Illinois for engaging in the debate because I think that it is a \ndebate that we have needed for a long time.\n  It appears we have agreement that life does begin at conception. \nSenator Kerry campaigned on that running for President.\n  I presume my colleague from Illinois agrees similarly. Others have \nargued, yes, an embryo is alive but it is not yet a life.\n  To say that a young human embryo is alive, but it's not yet a life, \nseems to be a bit of a legal fiction--if we are going that route. A \nyoung human embryo is biologically and genetically distinct. It is a \nseparate entity. It is alive. It should be treated as either a person \nor a piece of property.\n  My colleague may know that in some countries in Europe on this IVF \nprocedure, they are very careful about the number of eggs that can be \nharvested and fertilized before they are implanted. I think that would \nbe a good process for us to pursue and to look at so that it is not a \nhuge multiple set of lines but a much narrower group that are created--\nso that they are treated with the dignity and respect that life should \nmerit and that life should have.\n  I think my colleague from Tennessee was saying this since he \nobviously referred to the entity in question as a nascent life. So let \nus look at that and let us start going at those areas. Would you try to \nlead to criminalization, and I recognize that may be a good point in \nthe debate but that is not anywhere near where we are today. Let us \nbegin with the young humans with respect and dignity that life merits.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could reclaim my time and respond, and then I would \nrespond to a question from the Senator from North Dakota. The point I \nam making to the Senator from Kansas is--and I think probably Senator \nFrist, even as a medical doctor, would say that we struggle to figure \nout at what moment this is life. When we are dealing with the sperm and \nsemen and the ovum, are they live cells? Certainly, they are live \ncells. There is life in those cells. If they were not, they would have \nno value in this process.\n  So to say there is life in the cells does not necessarily say we are \ndealing with a person. At what point does this become a person? This \nhas been debated for as long as humans have been on Earth.\n  The point I am trying to make is I believe we should protect life, \nbut we better be careful that in protecting life we are not avoiding \nour responsibility to protect the living. What Senator Frist is \nsuggesting--I do not want to put words in his mouth. What I believe is \nthat stem cell research helps us to protect the living.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I looked forward very much to having a debate on stem \ncell research in the month of July. It now appears that that will not \nbe the case. Nonetheless, I compliment the Senator from Tennessee, the \nmajority leader, on his statement this morning.\n  I did want to make this point and ask a question of the Senator from \nIllinois. Is it not the case that those unused frozen embryos at in \nvitro fertilization clinics can become one of a couple of things? First \nand foremost, at the moment when they are unused and discarded, they \nbecome hospital waste. Second, and importantly, they can, if used in \nstem cell research, be used in the important medical research to \npreserve and to save lives.\n  I say to my colleague from Kansas, I have lost a daughter to heart \ndisease--many of us have lost loved ones. I will never, ever, on the \nfloor of this Chamber, be a part of those who wish to shut down \npromising medical research, especially when the ability to provide that \nresearch comes from embryos that otherwise would become hospital waste.\n  My colleague from Illinois asked the pertinent question, and perhaps \nwhen we have this debate some day we will have a greater description of \nthat, but if in fact that is a human life which is now thrown in the \nwaste basket as hospital waste, unused embryos that are discarded, if \nin fact that is a human life--it is not, by the way--should the \ndestruction of that as hospital waste not be treated criminally? That \nwould be the logical extension of some of those who are on the Senate \nfloor wishing to shut down this promising area of research.\n  My hope is that we can thoughtfully, with ethical guidelines, proceed \nwith research that is pro-life, that will save lives, that will give a \nlot of Americans greater hope for the future who suffer from dreaded \ndiseases. I look forward to this debate. I wish very much it had been \nin the month of July, but nonetheless we will have this debate. When we \ndo, I hope we will have a full and open discussion about it and advance \nthe cause of saving lives in this country and around the world.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could, I will say very briefly in response, I am \ndisappointed that we did not resolve this issue favorably in the month \nof July in the Senate, but I am heartened by the statement made by the \nmajority leader today. It is my belief that we have set the stage to \nreturn in September and take up this important lifesaving issue, with a \ncritical bipartisan debate on the Senate floor, for the good of medical \nresearch and to bring hope to a lot of people who watch every move we \nmake on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleagues and the distinguished Senator from Kansas, really all of my \ncolleagues who have spoken. This is a very important issue that we will \ncome back and address, and I appreciate their comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9330-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9330-S9331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROVIDING FOR CORRECTION TO ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 226) providing for a \n     correction to the enrollment of H.R. 3.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of critical \nimportance to my constituents in Montana. Early this morning, in the \ndead of night, the House of Representatives took an extraordinary \naction to delete a commonsense provision in the transportation \nconference report that would have reopened the runway at Malmstrom Air \nForce Base in Great Falls, MT. I am sorry the House acted as if it \nknows what is best for Great Falls, MT.\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\n  I cannot possibly put into words my outrage for the extraordinary \naction that the House took early this morning. My amendment would have \nopened the runway that is in the heart of Malmstrom Air Force base, \nwhich is active, healthy, and vibrant. Malmstrom is located outside of \nGreat Falls, MT, and is a highly secure missile facility, employing the \nlargest number of security forces in the entire U.S. Air Force.\n  Currently, the roadways and the infrastructure of Great Falls are \nstrained due to the frequent crosstown movement of heavy cargo and \nequipment during deployments of the 219th and the 819th Red Horse \nSquadrons of the U.S. Air Force and National Guard. They must travel \nfrom Malmstrom to the other side of town on a congested roadway in the \nmiddle of town to fly out of a municipal airport. The Montana Air \nNational Guard conducts all of their missions out of the same municipal \nairport.\n  This amendment would have enabled those units to deploy from a runway \nwithin their secured perimeter. Despite the mischaracterization of the \nHouse, this provision would not overturn a BRAC decision, nor would it \ninfluence the current BRAC round. It could not. Malmstrom is not on the \nBRAC list. The amendment was drafted, discussed, and deliberated in the \nlight of day, agreed to by the relevant committees and conferees.\n  I was also pleased to have worked with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the conferees of the \nhighway bill, all of whom accepted this amendment. To now have the \nHouse of Representatives cut this provision in the dead of night is an \noutrage.\n  My amendment would have simply provided a commonsense solution to a \nlocal problem. Local elected officials, civic leaders, the U.S. Air \nForce, and the National Guard have all requested that I find a way to \nopen the runway at Malmstrom. Senator Burns and I are dedicated to \nmaking this commonsense solution happen. But I cannot allow the highway \nbill to be a victim of the House's actions after the countless hours I \nhave spent making sure it is right for America and right for the State \nof Montana.\n  The House actions in the dead of night have put in jeopardy our \nnational highway bill. This bill will pump more than $2.3 billion into \nmy State economy, and I am proud of this bill. It will help sustain and \ncreate more than 18,000 jobs and boost safety on Montana's roads. I \ndare say that very few in this Congress have worked harder to get this \nhighway bill across the finish line than has this Senator. I will not \ngive up the fight to reopen Malmstrom's runway. I have given it my \nbest, but I cannot, in good faith, derail this important bill for the \ncountry at this late hour. My colleague from Montana, Senator Burns, \nand I will continue to work to find another way to make this happen.\n  This action by the House shows how important was the Founders' genius \nin creating the Senate, where States with real needs but small \npopulations, such as Montana, have their champions. I will never \napologize for fighting for Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would inquire of the Chair the order of \nbusiness now is the Interior conference report; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nconference report of Interior, Environment and Related Agencies for \nfiscal year 2006 . This bill provides more than $26 billion for the \nDepartment of Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. \nForest Service, the Indian Health Service, and a number of other \nagencies that play vital roles in protecting our Nation's natural and \ncultural heritage.\n  Conferencing this bill with the House was not an easy matter, to say \nthe least. The bill, as a whole, is close to $600 million below the \nfiscal year 2005 level. Our conference allocation was $50 million below \nthe Senate's original allocation, and we have had to shoehorn both \nHouse and Senate priorities into that reduced amount. To hit our \nnumber, we had to eliminate or reduce a number of items in the Senate \nbill that I would have preferred that we had kept. I suspect the House \nhas similar feelings about some of their priorities, but we made these \nchoices in as fair a manner as possible, both from the House and Senate \nperspective and the majority and minority perspective.\n  Lest I sound too negative, let me be clear that there are some good \nthings and important things in this bill. We improved upon the budget \nrequest in a number of places, such as tribally controlled schools and \nIndian schools and hospitals and the community colleges that are \nlocated on our several reservations across the country. We have \nincreased funding for our national parks. We preserved funding for \nlocal park programs. As my colleagues know, that was zeroed out. We \nhave boosted funding for a number of Forest Service programs that \nreceived pretty rough treatment from the White House in their budget \nrequest.\n  This bill also provides an additional $1.5 billion for veterans \nhealth care, funding that is sorely needed to ensure that our veterans \nreceive the kind of care they so richly deserve. Given the continued \nsacrifices being made by our men and women fighting in Afghanistan and \nIraq, it is an honor to have the Interior bill serve as the vehicle for \nthis critically important funding.\n  Finally, I want to thank my ranking member, Senator Dorgan from North \nDakota. Not only are we neighbors in our home States, but we are \nneighbors here also and work in cooperation. Without his leadership, we \ncould not have completed this bill. He has been a tireless champion for \nthe tribally controlled community colleges and Indian health care and a \nnumber of other programs in this bill. Throughout the conference \nreport, there is ample evidence of his hard work and his advocacy.\n  Let me also thank the majority and minority staffs of the \nsubcommittees. I do not think we thank our staffs enough. They work \nlong hours, crunching numbers, getting them to balance, and working to \nfigure out where do we take what and put it where. They have been \nworking for weeks producing this bill and then just several hours to \nproduce this conference report. Conferencing with the other body is no \neasy matter, and I appreciate the staffs' work to get us to this point.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report so we can \ndevote our attention to other spending bills that await us. We have a \ngreat deal of work yet to do on appropriations bills, so I am quite \nhappy to get this one out of the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana.\n\n\n                               Dru's Law\n\n  Before I comment on this piece of legislation, let me mention that \nlast evening we passed a piece of legislation called Dru's Law, that \ndeals with sexual predators. I did not say, and I should have last \nevening, that Senator Dayton, Senator Coleman, Senator Conrad, and \nothers were cosponsors. But especially, although I mentioned Senator \nSpecter, I did not say that Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania played a \nvery significant role. I want to make sure the Senate and the American \npeople understand that Senator Specter played a very significant role, \nnot only being an original cosponsor with me of Dru's Law, but also \nallowing it to pass the Senate last evening. I thank him for his \nwonderful leadership.\n  This Interior appropriations bill was a hard bill to get done because \nwe have\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nover one half billion dollars less in spending than the previous year. \nIf anybody asks is anybody cutting any spending any place, you don't \nhave to ask beyond this bill. This bill cuts one half billion dollars \nplus out of what we are spending in the current fiscal year. That means \nwe will spend half a billion dollars less in the next fiscal year. It \nis not easy to put a bill together under those restraints, but we did \nit. It is not a perfect bill. Some things in it I feel good about, some \nI feel not so good about. I will talk about that in a moment. This bill \ncarries the $1.5 billion appropriation for veterans health care. That \nis very important. We need to keep our promise to America's veterans. \nThis country cannot fight wars and ask young men and women to serve \ntheir country if we do not demonstrate we are going to keep our \npromises. One of those promises is providing veterans health care to \nthose who served.\n  No one has been more tireless, no one, perhaps, has offered more \namendments on the floor of the Senate on this subject--relentlessly, \nover time--than my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  I yield 4 minutes to Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, the ranking member, \nand chairman of the Interior appropriations bill for their \naccommodation on this.\n  The Senate has done the right thing now for American veterans. I \nstand in support of this bill because it does represent a step in the \nright direction for our veterans. Today when we pass the Interior \nappropriations bill, it will include my amendment to fix the VA's \nfunding shortfall by providing $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2005. This \nvictory is long overdue and I thank Senator Craig, Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Akaka, Senator Feinstein, Senator Burns, and Senator Dorgan for \ntheir work on this critical issue within this bill.\n  I want to make sure, however, that the VA uses this money in the way \nCongress intended. As the author of this amendment, I can tell you \nthese dollars have to go to helping our veterans. They cannot be used \nfor budget shell games to make the VA look solvent and they should not \nbe used for red tape or accounting tricks and they should not be used \nas a rainy day fund. The money we have put in this bill is there to \nhelp veterans get the medical care they need. It should be used to end \nthe hiring freeze, to provide mental health services for our veterans, \nand expand the VA's outpatient clinic initiative.\n  I want my colleagues to know I am going to be watching to make sure \nthis money is used in the way we have all voted for it to be used. Now \nthat we have taken care of the shortfall for fiscal year 2005, we have \nto turn our attention to fiscal year 2006. I want to make sure we do \nnot make the same mistakes that left our veterans so vulnerable this \nyear.\n  I have to say I am very troubled by what I hear coming out of the \nadministration so far. With all of our new veterans returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan every day, this problem is only going to get more \nsevere. Veterans funding has not kept up with medical costs. When \nadjusted for inflation, the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient \nthan it did in fiscal 2000. That is having a huge impact on our \npatients and on VA health care personnel. In my home State of \nWashington, at the VA's American Lake facility, you can only get an \nappointment now if you are 50 percent or more service-connected \ndisabled. In Puget Sound, as of January there was an $11 million \ndeficit, forcing our VA hospital to leave positions vacant. The VA has \ndedicated, highly professional employees and they work very hard every \nday to help our veterans. We have to make sure the VA system helps them \ndo that and not get in their way.\n  Now as we look toward fiscal year 2006, I want to be clear that \nveterans need real funding, not budget games. Congress cannot accept \ngimmicks such as forcing higher fees and copayments on our veterans and \ncalling that new revenue. Any plan that increases the burden on our \nveterans is a nonstarter in my book.\n  What is needed now is for us to step up and meet our responsibility \nto our men and women in uniform and that requires an infusion of cash \nto stop the bleeding at the VA, and a real investment toward assisting \nour veterans. Now is the time we have to come together and provide the \nneeded dollars so our veterans have the quality accessible care they \nneed and they deserve.\n  The security and integrity of our Nation depends on our willingness \nto keep our promise to our veterans. We have all heard of the military \nreports that recruiting is not meeting its goal, and each day we limit \nveterans' access to care, we are sending the wrong message to the \ntroops of tomorrow.\n  As I have done before, I want to quote President George Washington, \nwho knew that helping veterans helps America's security when he said:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  I call on my colleagues to support this bill and work with me to keep \nthe full $1.977 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the \nVeterans' Administration for fiscal year 2006. We have to do everything \nto assist the VA with this funding now so we do not face future \nshortfalls. I hope everyone will continue to support that funding in \nthe coming year as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes, and more if needed, to \nthe Senator from Texas, who has been a real champion for veterans \nbenefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified in 5 minutes, \nin case the distinguished chairman of the Interior subcommittee needs \nany extra time.\n  First, let me thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Interior subcommittee for assuring that their conference report \ncame out in a timely way, not only for the Interior funding but \nespecially for this veterans' funding which is fiscal year 2005 money, \nmeaning it can be spent right away.\n  We know there is a deficit at the VA because Secretary Nicholson told \nus there is a deficit. So I do thank Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan \nfor coming forward and helping us with this extraordinary measure so \nthe Veterans Administration will be able to have full flexibility to \nfill the coffers from which they have been borrowing, and also to go \nforward.\n  I also thank those who have worked so hard to get the Veterans \nAdministration the money they need. That would certainly be Senator \nMurray, who has just spoken, Senator Feinstein, my ranking member on \nthe Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Craig, \nwho is the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. We have all \nworked together in a bipartisan way because, frankly, Secretary \nNicholson came forward in a most forthright manner to tell us of the \nproblems we had at the Veterans Administration.\n  When we first started working on the supplemental appropriation, \nSecretary Nicholson thought there was not a deficit in the Veterans \nAdministration, that with the model they had always used they had \nplenty to cover until October 1. But in June when Secretary Nicholson \nlearned that in fact they did not have enough to fully treat the new \nveterans coming into the system, he stepped right up and said we have a \ndeficit and we need to fix it. He came to Congress to ask for the help \nto do that. I think it is admirable that Secretary Nicholson didn't try \nto fudge, he didn't try to sweep it under the rug. He came out.\n  He took some heat for it. I saw some Members criticizing him, but I \nhave to say I admire him. I think what he did was exactly the right \nthing to do. He is a veteran. He is a decorated veteran. And he is not \never going to sweep under the rug a deficit in the Veterans \nAdministration. He also is going to spend the money wisely.\n  So I thank everyone who helped bring this to the forefront. I have to \nsay that OMB Director Josh Bolton also tried to be very helpful, giving \nus an amendment that would raise the limit we could spend on veterans. \nThe total for both fiscal years will be approximately $3 billion. The \ntotal for\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\ngetting through this problem we have for the fiscal year we are in is \ngoing to cost about $900 million, they estimate, to get to October 1 to \nfinish this fiscal year--almost $1 billion, which we are giving them \nwhen we vote on this bill today and send it to the President.\n  But in the 2006 budget, which we are now going to pass in the Senate, \nprobably in September--this is the committee I chair--we have what will \nbe another $1.5 billion, depending on how much is left of what we are \npassing today that can go into 2006. We believe it will be about half a \nbillion dollars, so that the total would be the $1.977 that was \nmentioned earlier for fiscal year 2006. We will monitor this as we go \ninto the new fiscal year to assure that the Veterans Administration for \n2006 has the full amount they need.\n  I also thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nfull Appropriations Committee. When Senator Feinstein and I went to \nChairman Cochran and asked him for more money in our original 2006 \nbudget for the veterans part of the appropriations bill, he immediately \nagreed. He immediately agreed that we would get the money we need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I will take the rest of the \ntime.\n  Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd stepped right up to the plate to \nassure that the veterans had their first boost of $1.2 billion. Then \nworking with Secretary Nicholson and OMB Director Bolton, we now have a \ntotal of almost $3 billion more in additional funding for the veterans \nin both fiscal years.\n  We are going to do right by our veterans. We appreciate that we have \npeople with boots on the ground, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan \ntoday. They are fighting for our freedom. We will never let them down. \nThe bill we are passing today, in addition to the Interior part of this \nappropriation, is going to fully fund Veterans for the fiscal year we \nare in and take us with a cushion into the next fiscal year so every \nveterans' clinic that is being built continues to be built, so that \nevery veteran who walks in the door is going to get the care to which \nhe or she is entitled, to assure that nothing falls through the cracks \nfor our veterans. Our President would do nothing less. Our Secretary, \nSecretary Nicholson, will do nothing less. I assure you the Senate will \ndo nothing less. We are going to do right by our veterans and the bill \nwe are passing today is a start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me say a special thank you to my \ncolleagues from the State of Washington and the State of Texas. They \nhave said it well. Again, I am enormously proud our bill has carried \nthis $1.5 billion for veterans health care. There is a verse that goes:\n\n       When the night is full of knives, and the lightning is \n     seen, and the drums are heard, the patriots are always there, \n     ready to fight and ready to die, if necessary, for freedom.\n\n  Our soldiers are our patriots and when they come back from duty, duty \nour country called them for, we must keep our promise for veterans \nhealth care and that is what this $1.5 billion helps to do.\n  Let me for a moment talk about the underlying bill again. There are \nsome good things and some things I wish were better in this bill. I \ncompliment my colleague, Senator Burns from Montana and his staff: \nBruce Evans, Virginia James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Ryan Thomas, Rebecca \nBenn; and also on this side, Peter Kiefhaber and Rachel Taylor.\n  We worked very hard to put a bill together with over $500 million \nless money than in the past year. That was not easy.\n  Indian Health Service--I regret to say, we are still underfunded. I \nam told we are funding about 60 percent of the need in Indian Health \nService. We just must do better in the years ahead. We have \nresponsibility for Federal prisoners' health care. We also have trust \nresponsibility for the health of American Indians. We spend twice as \nmuch per person on Federal prisoners' health care than we do in per \ncapita spending for American Indians for whom we have trust \nresponsibility for health care.\n  My colleague described the tribal colleges, and we have together been \nable to increase that funding for tribal colleges. That is a good \nfeature in this bill. The reason we have done this is that it is a \npriority to help people step out of poverty and toward opportunity, and \nthat comes from the tribal colleges. There are so many stories of \npeople whose lives have improved by the ability to access tribal \ncolleges.\n  We have some other areas in the bill that I wish were better.\n  BIA school construction, we need funding increases, not funding cuts, \nand yet the President's budget proposed very significant cuts and we \nwere not able to add all of that back. Also building for new hospitals \nand health clinics is down. My hope is that in the next year, we can \nfind a way to add back some funding in these critical Indian health \nareas.\n  Having said all that, this is a big bill, dealing with so many other \nareas of the Government--EPA, the Forest Service, and so many other \nareas of Government. We have worked in a bipartisan way.\n  Let me also say that Senator Byrd wishes consent to speak for 5 \nminutes prior to vote on Interior at some point later this morning. I \ntalked to the ranking member and also the chairman of the full \ncommittee.\n  Finally, let me say the chairman of the full committee should \nunderstand that this is the first time in 17 years that we have gotten \nto the Senate floor this early with an Interior appropriations bill. \nThe last time Congress passed an Interior appropriations bill this \nearly, those pages who serve in the Chamber were not yet born. So I \nthink that says something about the leadership of Senator Cochran and \nSenator Byrd, who are the two leaders on the Appropriations Committee, \nand I for one like the notion that we are going to make the trains run \non time in the appropriations process. It is the right thing to do and \nthe right way to do it, and I am very blessed that in the month of \nJuly, we are in the Chamber passing this conference report. So hats off \nto Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd as well.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not know whether we have any more time \nremaining. The time has been set aside for Senator Byrd. Seeing no one \nto speak on this bill, I will yield back the remainder of my time also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator want to make a formal \nunanimous consent request for the Senator from West Virginia?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thought I had done that, but if I have \nnot asked that consent, I so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield back my time and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9333-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9333-S9334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2985\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Chairman Hutchison \nwas in the Chamber, and Senator Murray has spoken to that. I appreciate \nall of their cooperation. We have tried to get our arms around this \nfunding issue at Veterans, and I now believe we have. We are going to \nbe very insistent on good numbers in the future. I have asked the \nSecretary to report to the authorizing committee on a quarterly basis. \nI think he will do the same to the appropriating committee.\n  Beyond that, this is a tremendously important bill for my State of \nIdaho.

Because of this \nveterans funding that is critical and the way that it has been handled, \nI know it has been unique to Interior at this time and place, but it \nwas also necessary to complete it.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we now have the legislative \nconference report before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nlegislative branch fiscal year 2006 appropriations conference report. \nThis is my first year as chairman of this subcommittee and I am \ndelighted we'll be able to send the bill to the President prior to the \nbeginning of the fiscal year. I very much appreciate the support of my \nranking member, Senator Durbin, as well as the full committee chairman, \nSenator Cochran, and ranking member, Senator Byrd.\n  In general, I believe this is a fair agreement. It provides $3.8 \nbillion for the Congress and its support agencies. Funding in the \nconference agreement is $198 million above the fiscal year 2005 enacted \nlevel and a reduction of $225 million below the request. While there \nare very few programmatic increases in the bill, funding is sufficient \nto maintain current operations in all agencies. Significant increases \nabove the fiscal year 2005 budget are recommended in only a few areas, \nsuch as funding to complete the Capitol Visitor Center.\n  Highlights of the bill include funding of $250 million for the \nCapitol Police, which will enable the Capitol Police to maintain its \ncurrent staffing level of 1,592 police officers and ensure appropriate \nlevels of security for the Capitol complex. The Capitol Police salaries \nfunding has increased by almost 100 percent since fiscal year 2002, and \nthe number of officers has increased by about one-third. This indicates \nour support for Capitol Police and all the good work they do to protect \nthis great institution.\n  The recommendation also includes $428 million for the Architect of \nthe Capitol, including $42 million for Capitol Visitor Center \nconstruction and $2.3 million for initial operational costs of the CVC. \nThe Architect believes this amount will be sufficient to complete the \nCVC construction. Also within the AOC budget is storage modules for the \nLibrary of Congress at Ft. Meade, totaling $40.7 million. While this is \nan expensive project, it is critically needed to take care of \nburgeoning storage requirements at the library\n  For the Library of Congress, funding would total $560 million, \nincluding funding for the Library's highest priorities such as the new \nNational Audio-Visual Conservation Center and Congressional Research \nService enhancements.\n  Funding for the GPO would total $123 million, including $2 million to \nretrain staff for the new digital environment; the Government \nAccountability Office would receive $482 million, and the Open World \nLeadership Program would be funded at the budget request level of $14 \nmillion.\n  I do have some concerns about this conference agreement which I would \nlike to bring to my colleagues attention. First, I am deeply \ndisappointed that the House insisted on the elimination of the Capitol \nPolice mounted unit. I believe, as my predecessor Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell did, that there are some significant benefits to the Capitol \nPolice having a mounted unit, and the costs are relatively small--about \n$150,000 a year. The officers who are part of this unit have received \nextensive training, the horses and attendant equipment have been \npurchased. This investment will be down the drain just 1 year after the \nunit became operational.\n  We reluctantly went along with the House only because this bill needs \nto get done. But I believe it is a short-sighted decision that we will \nall regret.\n  Another regret I have with this conference agreement is the \nelimination of Senate language authorizing the Architect of the Capitol \nto hire an executive director for the Capitol Visitor Center. The CVC \nproject is something I have been following closely, with monthly \nhearings in our subcommittee. In addition to concerns regarding the \nmanagement of this mammoth construction project, I am very concerned \nthat the Architect hasn't been given direction and authority to make \noperational decisions including the hiring of an executive director. \nGAO has reported it is critical AOC develop a strategic plan for moving \nfrom construction to operations. Without an executive director such \ndecisions will surely languish.\n  Despite these concerns, I believe it is a fair and balanced \nconference agreement and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my honor to serve as the ranking \nmember on this appropriations subcommittee with the Senator from \nColorado as my chairman. I have had the distinction of being on this \ncommittee for several years with several different chairs. Senator Bob \nBennett of Utah, who was the dedicated leader of this subcommittee for \nmany years, became quite expert on all of the areas that it covered, \nand I learned a lot from him. In fact, many of his suggestions are \nstill being followed; for example, the integration of security forces \non Capitol Hill between the Library of Congress and the U.S. Capitol \nBuilding.\n  I also salute particularly my colleague from Colorado. He has done a \ngreat job. Our friendship has grown through this relationship. His \ndedication is exemplary. When it came to the Capitol Visitor Center, \nthis was a mammoth project which he inherited from decisions made years \nago. He has shown personal attention to it, given of his time over and \nover to make sure\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\nthat we end up with a Capitol Visitor Center that is a source of great \npride to everyone on Capitol Hill and is not an embarrassment to the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  It calls for a fantastic amount of oversight on his part and the part \nof the committee staff. Senator Wayne Allard has done that. I joined \nhim partially in his efforts, but he has really led the way. He has \nbeen diligent in holding monthly meetings on the Capitol Visitor \nCenter, and I think they have been a great benefit for the public \nunderstanding of what is happening underground, as well as holding all \nof those accountable who were involved in the process. I thank him so \nmuch.\n  Our Senate bill that we brought into conference was a good and fair \nbill. I thought it addressed all of the demands of maintaining this \ngreat Capitol Building and all of the buildings nearby in a very \nprofessional way.\n  There is one aspect of this bill which troubles me, and that is the \nfact that there is some negative language in the conference committee \nreport relative to our Capitol Police. What frustrates me about this is \nit was not done in the normal fashion. We did not have time to weigh \nthe wording of this conference report. I think we should have been a \nlittle more circumspect in the language used. My reason for saying it \nis this: The men and women on the Capitol Police Force understand, as \nall of us who work here understand, we go to work every single day in \nwhat has to be described as one of the leading international targets \nfor terrorism. The U.S. Capitol Building is a great symbol of freedom \nand democracy, and as a result is a great target for those who hate the \nUnited States and want to engage in terrorism. What keeps this building \nand those working here functioning is the men and women of the Capitol \nPolice Force who night and day, around the clock, risk their lives for \nthe visitors and staff who work here. These are fine people. They work \nextraordinarily long hours at great personal and family sacrifice. They \nask little from us, other than the recognition that they are doing a \ngood job. This conference committee report does not give them the \nrecognition they are due.\n  Let me add another element. The Capitol Hill Police chief is Terry \nGainer, a man I have known from Illinois for years. He was \nsuperintendent of the Illinois State Police. It is a large and \nprofessional organization that he handled extremely well as \nsuperintendent. When he was an applicant for this job at the Capitol \nPolice Force, I thought you could not find a finer law enforcement \nofficial to professionalize this police force right at the moment when \nit needed to happen. He came to Capitol Hill, and he achieved that \ngoal. I don't say that just because we are personal friends. I have \nspoken to many members of the Capitol Hill Police Force who do not know \nmy relationship with him, and I ask them, What do you think of the \nCapitol Hill Police? And they say it is a truly professional law \nenforcement organization.\n  It is true that mistakes are made in a large organization that is \ngrowing so fast with so many extraordinary external demands, but \neveryone who is honest has to concede that Chief Gainer and his \nprofessional staff have done an excellent job of putting together an \nextraordinary police force that protects this building and the people \nwho visit and work here every single day.\n  I add my words to those that have been spoken and probably will be by \nothers, we owe a great debt of gratitude to the chief. I thank him \npersonally for coming here and taking on such an awesome responsibility \nnot long after September 11 and really bringing peace of mind to those \nwho get up and come to work in this building every single day.\n  If I can say a word or two about the mounted police, Chairman Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, who was a predecessor to Chairman Allard from the \nsame State of Colorado, has a passion for the mounted police. He loved \nhorses and believed they were an important symbol in terms of the \npolice force on Capitol Hill. Although we only have five horses--it is \nhardly a cavalry--the fact is, I think they achieved the goal that \nSenator Campbell set out for us to reach. They have become friends of \nvisitors to Capitol Hill. I watch as the throngs of tourists gather \naround our mounted police, petting the horses, feeling as if they are \npart of an experience, a good and positive experience.\n  Almost from the start there have been people who have not given this \nmounted police force a fair chance. I hope we reconsider this someday. \nI understand the House Members were adamant that the mounted police be \nremoved from the Capitol Hill Police Force. I hope we can reconsider. I \nhonestly believe they could be critically important at important \nhistoric moments.\n  When we evacuated this building on September 11 and sent thousands of \npeople out in front of this building, there was clearly a need for some \ncrowd control and some crowd direction. These mounted police would have \nbeen invaluable at that moment. Because of this appropriations bill, \nthey will not have the chance to serve in that capacity in the future \nunless we make a change.\n  I will close and yield to the chairman again and particularly thank \nthe staff on both sides of the aisle: Carrie Apostolou, Fred Pagan, \nChristen Taylor, as well as Terry Sauvain, Drew Willison, Nancy \nOlkewicz of the minority staff, and Sally Brown-Shaklee and Pat Souders \nof my personal staff for the extraordinary work they put into this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I have cherished our \nrelationship in being able to work with the Senator from Illinois on \nthis bill.\n  I agree we have a lot of dedicated police officers out there and the \nMembers of Congress need to appreciate all they are doing to maintain \nour safety, not only for us but for the visiting public.\n  Finally, I thank our full committee chairman, Senator Cochran, as \nwell as the staff who were involved: Carrie Apostolou, Lance Landry, \nChristen Taylor, Fred Pagan, and from Senator Durbin's staff, Nancy \nOlkewicz and Drew Willison.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9335-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9335-S9367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have some remarks to make, about 10 \nminutes of remarks. I want to commend Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan \nfor their work on the Interior appropriations bill. When might I make \nthose remarks?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, there is a \nunanimous consent agreement here that has\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\nthe time allotted until we are finished with the Energy bill, and the \nvotes thereon. That will not be a long time. But everybody knows we \nhave 30 minutes right now for the Energy bill, and after that we will \ncommence voting on three bills that are before us. I would think the \nSenate would want to stay to that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Senator from \nWest Virginia was granted a unanimous consent order that he would have \n5 minutes before the Interior conference report was voted on, which \nwill take place after the 30 minutes allocated for final debate on H.R. \n6.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please. Surely.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I make a further inquiry? Then, I am correct in \nunderstanding the Chair to say that I will have 5 minutes prior to the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. That vote will be on what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Interior conference report.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Interior conference report.\n  Mr. President, with the indulgence of the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, I ask unanimous consent that at that time I have 10 minutes \nrather than 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I see Senator Bingaman in the Chamber. \nHe is going to proceed, first, with the allocation of some of the time \non his side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member, Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman. They made a statement on the floor of the Senate in a \ncolloquy with this Senator when the Energy bill was on the floor, and \nthose two Senators kept their word. It had to do with drilling off the \ncoast of Florida. I have said to those Senators how much I appreciate \nwhat they, in fact, have done, under considerable pressure in the \nconference committee.\n  I want them to know personally how appreciative I am that they held \nfast and prohibited, in the conference committee, for an issue to be \ninjected that was neither in the House bill nor the Senate bill that \nwould cause the drilling off the coast of Florida.\n  Why is this important to us? This Senator has made this statement \nmany times, but there is a new wrinkle that I wanted to explain to the \nSenate, not having to do with geology that shows that there is not much \noil and gas off of Florida, not having to do with the delicate \necosystem, not having to do with the $50 billion-a-year tourism \nindustry that depends on pristine beaches, but a reason for the \npreparation of our U.S. military in a time when we are at war.\n  We have these ranges that are off the coast of Florida. Is it any \nwonder that, in fact, when Vieques was shut down off the coast of \nPuerto Rico, they sent most of that training off of the Gulf of Mexico, \noff the coast of Florida, because of this Joint Gulf Range Complex. It \nis joint with all branches of Government. It involves land-, sea-, and \nair-coordinated training. If drilling were allowed in what is known as \nlease sale 181, that is what would happen. Smack-dab in the middle of \nthat restricted airspace, that training area that is 180,000 square \nmiles in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Smack-dab in the middle of it \nwould be the drilling for oil and gas. This portion in red was already \nagreed to back in 2001. This portion in the red hatch is the additional \n4 million acres that would be added smack-dab in the middle of our \nmilitary training complex.\n  The significance of it is that it has 724 square miles of additional \nland range. It has 3,200 square miles of airspace over adjacent land \narea. It has 17 miles of Government shoreline, with connected \nprohibited and restricted water areas. The combination of air, land, \nand water is the best location for the United States for extremely \nlong-range precision weapons testing, such as the high-performance \ncombat aircraft live-fire testing and training and large-scale complex \njoint training exercises and experimentation.\n  Given the thrust of DOD's recent BRAC recommendations, there will be \nmore testing, training, and operations in the eastern Gulf, not less. \nSo oil drilling in the eastern Gulf, as proposed by the administration, \nis the greatest encroachment threat to the Nation's largest \nunrestricted air and sea space for weapons testing and combat training.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Oil drilling is not compatible with weapons \ntesting and combat training. Military leaders have been fighting this \nfor years. Yet here we go again. The encroachment this time is even \nmore serious because we are at war. This Senator, on behalf of the \npeople of Florida--and, I hope, on behalf of the U.S. military \nestablishment--will continue to oppose this. I thank the chairman and \nthe ranking member for their holding fast in the conference committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, to explain his motion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \nhave a number of concerns about the conference report we debated last \nnight and that we will vote on today. I intend to raise a point of \norder that it violates the Budget Act. I do, however, want to recognize \nthe hard work that Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman have \nput into this process. We all know that they have spent many long days \nand late nights to reach this point. The bipartisan manner in which \nthey work is a definite improvement over previous Energy bills. I \napplaud their efforts.\n  Mr. President, Energy policy is an important issue for America and \none which I can tell you my Wisconsin constituents take very seriously. \nCrafting an energy policy requires us to address important questions \nabout, for example, the role of domestic production of energy resources \nversus foreign imports, the importance of ensuring adequate energy \nsupplies while protecting the environment, the necessity for domestic \nefforts to support improvements in our energy efficiency, and the \nwisest use of our energy resources. Given the need for a sound national \nenergy policy, a vote on an Energy bill is a very serious matter and I \ndo not take a decision to oppose such a bill lightly. In my view, \nhowever, the conference report we consider today does not achieve the \ncorrect balance on several important issues, which is why I have to \noppose it.\n  I have four fundamental concerns. This bill digs us deeper into a \nbudget black hole. It fails to decrease our dependence on foreign oil. \nIt rolls back important consumer protections. And finally, it \nundermines some of the fundamental environmental laws that our citizens \nrely upon.\n  First, Mr. President, the costs of this conference report are \nstaggering. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that enactment \nwill increase direct spending by $2.2 billion between 2006 and 2010, \nand by $1.6 billion between 2006 and 2015. Additionally, the CBO and \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that this bill will reduce \nrevenues by $7.9 billion between 2005 and 2010 and by $12.3 billion \nfrom 2005 to 2015. On top of the direct spending, the conference report \nauthorizes more than $66 billion in Federal spending, according to the \nwatchdog groups The National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common \nSense, and Citizens Against Government Waste. Our Nation's budget \nposition obviously has deteriorated significantly over the past few \nyears, in large part because of the massive tax cuts that were enacted, \nand we now face years of projected budget deficits. The only way we \nwill climb out of this deficit hole is to return to the fiscally\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nresponsible policies that helped put our Nation on a sound fiscal \nfooting in the 1990s, and that simply means that we have to be sure \nthat the bills we pass are paid for. To do otherwise is to simply dig \nour deficit hole even deeper, thus adding to the massive debt already \nfacing our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, second, the conference report we consider today will \ndo nothing to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. I cannot return to \nmy home State of Wisconsin this weekend and say that I participated in \na rushed effort to accept a 1,700-plus page conference report that will \nnot do a thing to increase our oil independence. The conference did not \naccept the 10-percent renewable portfolio standard passed by the \nSenate, nor did it accept an amendment instructing the President to \ndevelop a plan to reduce U.S. oil dependence by 1 million barrels per \nday by 2015. I supported efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil when the Senate debated its bill, and I am extremely disappointed \nthat the conference committee could not accept a reduction of 1 million \nbarrels per day through 2015.\n  Third, the bill rolls back important consumer protections. The \nconference committee retained repeal of the pro-consumer Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, important New Deal-era legislation which has \nprotected electricity consumers. My State of Wisconsin is acutely \ninterested and concerned about the repeal of PUHCA and about ongoing \nabuses involving the unregulated corporate affiliates of regulated \nutilities. In addition to hearing from Wisconsinites, I have heard from \ncontractors and other small businesses across the Nation that have been \nharmed by this unfair competition by affiliates of public utilities. I \nmust say that I don't understand how we can give the nuclear industry \nloan guarantees and over $2 billion in risk insurance, but we can't \neven give small businesses the assurance that unregulated affiliates of \npublic utilities will not unfairly outcompete them.\n\n  I do, however, recognize the efforts of the chairman and the ranking \nmember to protect language providing the Federal Government more \noversight of utility mergers, which is important and I support. I am \ngrateful for their willingness to further look into my concerns on \nunfair competition by public utility affiliates.\n  Fourth and finally, Mr. President, the energy conference report \nincludes provisions that significantly weaken our commitment to the \nenvironment and to the health of U.S. citizens. Section 328 of the \nEnergy conference report weakens the Clean Water Act by exempting \ncertain oil and gas industry activities from compliance with both phase \n1 and phase 2 storm water programs and, in the process, rolls back 15 \nyears of protection. This is not an insignificant issue. Storm water \nrunoff is a leading cause of impairment to our streams, rivers, and \nlakes.\n  The bill also exempts hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, and by doing so, risks contaminating drinking water \nsupplies. Over 95 percent of Wisconsin communities and about 75 percent \nof Wisconsin residents rely on groundwater for their supply of drinking \nwater. Nationally, approximately half of the U.S. population obtains \nits drinking water from underground water sources, according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office. Wisconsin citizens and all U.S. \ncitizens deserve more than exemptions that could threaten the water \nthey drink.\n  There are provisions of the bill that I fully support, and I am \npleased that the conference committee included, but I can't support \nthis conference report. According to estimates by the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Energy bill conference report includes direct \nspending of more than $2.2 billion over the 2006-2010 period, exceeding \nthe amount allocated by the budget resolution. I hope my colleagues \nwill note this and will join me in sustaining a budget point of order.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending conference \nreport violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point of order must come at the \nconclusion of debate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will defer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the Senator concluded?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume that Senator Bingaman has another person he \nwould like to yield to. I will yield to one of his, Senator Cantwell or \nSenator Salazar.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ranking member has 2 minutes and 2 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In light of that, I know there are other Members, \nparticularly on the Democratic side, who wish to speak. I believe \nSenator Domenici has some time to provide.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their hard \nwork on this important legislation. We are here to talk about passing \nan Energy bill that is not a complete answer to all our energy needs. \nThis is not the end of discussion about energy independence and getting \noff our overdependence on foreign oil, but it is an important first \nstep. My colleagues need to understand that the provisions in this bill \nare nuts-and-bolts important for our energy economy, moving forward. As \na Senator who supports this legislation, there are certain \ntechnologies, certain investments in this legislation that I hope will \nwin the day and will help us build a different kind of energy economy, \nbased on newer technologies and energy supplies than the ones we have \ntoday. But this bill represents a compromise that was forged in the \nSenate and was fought hard for by my colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, when they went to conference.\n  I am proud that it has an extension of renewable production tax \ncredits so that our utilities can continue to invest in even more \nrenewable energy; that for the first time it has a renewable clean \nenergy bond section, so that local governments and public power can \nmake greater investments in renewable energy; that it has an extension \nof the renewable energy production incentive program for public power; \nthat there are efficiency provisions in the bill for appliances and \nother types of standards that will save 3.5 quads of energy.\n  That is the same as building 85 powerplants. It has a hybrid vehicle \nincentive provision. It has a biodiesel incentive program. It \nreinstates the oil spill liability trust fund, which was going broke \nand which helps us clean up oil pollution, and taxes those who are the \npolluters. It has research on the smart grid technology that is going \nto get us more efficiency in our transmission system, and it has \nincremental steps to push the States toward better standards on net \nmetering. For the Northwest, the electricity title in this legislation \nis clearly a victory, and I would say the efficiency title in this bill \nis also a victory.\n  We are moving closer to the key tools we need to upgrade our \ntransmission system. We will have many more debates about what this \nbody can do, though, to continue to diversify off of foreign oil. But \nwe should take the step today to secure that transmission system and \nget reliability standards in place, something this body has debated now \nfor more than 5 years. After a Western blackout, after a New York \nblackout, after people in Ohio and Michigan have been affected, the \nleast we can do is push this legislation to improve the security and \nreliability of our electricity grid.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation as a first step, a \nshort stroke of success, and get about going back to the broader \ndecisions we need to make truly start moving in the direction toward \nenergy independence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I seek 5 minutes under the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time remaining is 11 minutes 44 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry.\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not correct that the point of order is going to \nbe made? Can that point of order be made so the Senator will not have \nto wait? Can it be made just before the vote on the Energy bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By consent, it can be made now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Otherwise it will be made then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator can make it just before the Energy bill \nvote and we have 2 minutes on each side then. So the Senator will not \nhave to wait now on that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate that and I intend to make that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to support this Energy \nbill. I heard my colleague from Washington State speak beautifully and \npassionately about many of the important aspects of this bill. There \nare Members who can come to this floor and pick out one or two things \nthey had hoped to get in that did not make it. We had a lot of \narguments about this bill, a lot of debate, but overall it is very \nbalanced legislation. It does look to the future, as well as holding on \nto some of the things in the past that have served us well.\n  It seeks to increase independence of the United States of America so \nwe can produce more energy on our shore, under our control, to not only \nhelp boost our economy, make our industries more competitive, but most \nimportantly make this Nation more secure when it comes to international \ninvolvements. Americans want lower prices at the pump, but they want to \nknow that this Congress is taking action to make them more secure \nnationally. By being more self-reliant, we can.\n  Now, yes, we have to open up our shores to liquefied natural gas \nbecause our price is going through the roof, and unless we increase \nsupply substantially and rather quickly, that price will remain high. \nIt will put almost every industry in this country at a very serious \ndisadvantage for international competition.\n  As Senator Cantwell stated, it does give new protections for \nconsumers from market manipulation. Senator Dorgan has led the fight \nwith regard to hydrogen, with Senator Bingaman's help. It has opened up \nnew frontiers for that. We have opened up new frontiers for renewable \nenergy sources. As a Senator from an oil-and-gas-producing State, we do \nneed to get beyond petroleum and this bill is helping us to do that.\n  Under Senator Domenici's leadership, we are expanding in an \nextraordinary way the nuclear industry, which is going to help Japan, \nFrance, and others who have been leading the way. It is time for \nAmerica to get with the program.\n  In my last 1 minute, let me compliment these leaders. We have not had \nan energy bill for 13 years. For 5 years, we have literally been \nlaboring mightily to get a bill. Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, \nChairman Barton, and Mr. Dingell, ``the big four'' as they have been \ncalled, have worked tirelessly, their staffs have worked tirelessly, \nand I might say with the patience of Job. This bill is balanced because \nthese two leaders said they were going to build a bill together for the \nfuture of our country. As a Senator on that committee, I am so proud of \nthe honesty in which they built this bill, the openness in which they \nbuilt this bill, and the fact that no deals, to my knowledge, were cut \nbehind closed doors. It was all open and actually on television so \npeople could see the results of this work.\n\n  I commend that process to the Senate and the whole Congress and thank \nthem for their extraordinary leadership and thank them, too, on behalf \nof the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast States for recognizing \nthe contribution we have made of offshore oil and gas drilling and to \nget a very robust coastal impact assistance program that is going to \nmean a great deal to us and to the wetlands of America.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \njunior Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nbill. I start first by congratulating my colleagues, the two Senators \nfrom New Mexico, the Land of Enchantment, Mr. Domenici and Mr. \nBingaman, for their leadership in helping us get together what has been \na true bipartisan effort. I commend them both for the process as well \nas for the end result of this legislation.\n  As I look at this legislation, it seems to me what we are embracing \ntoday is a vision for energy independence. I think Democrats and \nRepublicans all agree what we need to do is to get to a point where \nthis country gets rid of its overdependence on foreign oil. We need to \ndo that for national security reasons, we need to do that for economic \nreasons for our country, and we also need to do it for environmental \nreasons.\n  From my point of view, this legislation is based on four \ncornerstones. One of those cornerstones is conservation and efficiency. \nThere are more important measures in this bill that deal with \nconservation and efficiency. It is a new ethic for the 21st century. \nSecondly, embracing renewable energies from the ethanol provisions to \ndealing with the development of cellulosic ethanol, this bill gets us \non the right direction where America can grow its way toward energy \nindependence. Third, technology, research and development, we have lots \nof resources in America we can use to make sure we are having the \nenergy we need for our country. The new technology that includes coal \ngasification and other kinds of technologies will help us move in that \ndirection. And finally, balanced development, we need to continue to \ndevelop our natural resources in this country.\n  So from my point of view, this bill is a good bill and is moving us \nin the right direction. It is not a perfect bill and there are aspects \nof this bill some of us advocated for that we hoped would have been a \npart of this bill, but they are issues we can continue to work on. We \ncan use this as a foundation from which to build. There is the issue of \nthe renewable portfolio standard which was adopted by this Senate and \nwe need to move forward continuing to try to address that issue in the \nway it has been addressed in my State. Finally, the issue of global \nwarming and how we deal with that issue in the future is very \nimportant.\n  With that, again I commend the Senators from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici \nand Mr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nObama be given 2 minutes and it not be included in the majority time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator from \nIllinois being granted 2 additional minutes beyond the time originally \ngranted to both sides?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to commend the chief sponsors of \nthis bill in the Senate, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, who I think \nhave displayed the sort of statesmanship and civility in working out \nthis difficult legislation that I think all of us expect from this \nbody. I also want to indicate the degree to which this bill takes \nsignificant steps in the right direction on energy policy. It helps us \nrealize the promise of ethanol as a fuel alternative by requiring 7.5 \nbillion gallons to be mixed with gasoline over the next few years. It \nprovides a tax credit for the construction of E85 stations all over \nAmerica--E85, a blend of ethanol and gasoline that can drastically \nincrease fuel efficiency standards for our cars.\n  It will provide funding for the clean coal technologies that will \nmove America to use its most abundant fossil fuel in a cleaner, \nhealthier way, including more low emission transportation fuels, and it \nwill support the development of what we hope ultimately will be a 500-\nmile-per-gallon automobile technology.\n  All of these things are wonderful and worthy of support. But I do \nhave to say we have missed an opportunity and\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nthat is not the fault of the sponsors of this bill who have done \nyeoman's work. Rather, I think it is the timidity of all of us as a \nbody in not addressing what has to be one of the most significant \nproblems we face as a nation.\n  The Department of Energy predicts that American demand for fossil \nfuels will jump 50 percent over the next 15 years. The Heritage \nFoundation says this bill will do virtually nothing to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. Even President Bush and supporters of the \nbill in Congress concede as much.\n  As we debate this bill today, the price of crude oil has surpassed a \nrecord high of $60 a barrel, and gas is now up to $2.28 per gallon. At \nthis price, the United States is sending $650 million overseas every \nsingle day.\n  As demand continues to skyrocket around the world, other countries \nhave started to realize that guzzling oil is not a sustainable future. \nWhat is more, these countries have realized that by investing early in \nthe energy-efficient technology that exists today, they can create \nmillions of tomorrow's jobs and build their economies to rival ours.\n  China now has a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and it has \n200,000 hybrids on its roads. Japan's Toyota is doubling production of \nthe popular Prius in order to sell 100,000 in the U.S. next year, and \nit is getting ready to open a brand new plant in China. At the same \ntime, Ford is only making 20,000 Escape Hybrids this year, and GM's \nbrand won't be on the market until 2007.\n  So here we are. People paying record prices at the pump and America \nsending billions overseas to the world's most volatile region. We have \ncountries like China and India using energy technology to create jobs \nand wealth, while our own businesses and workers fall further and \nfurther behind. And we have the energy bill that is before us today.\n  So I ask, is this the best America can do? The country that went to \nthe moon and conquered polio? The country that led the technological \nrevolution of the 1990s?\n  It would be one thing if the solutions to our dependence on foreign \noil were pie-in-the-sky ideas that are years away. But the technology \nis right at our fingertips. Today, we could have told American car \ncompanies, we will help you produce more hybrid cars. We could have \nmade sure there were more flexible fuel tanks in our cars. And so \nAmerica has a choice.\n  We can continue to hang on to oil as our solution. We can keep \npassing energy bills that nibble around the edges of the problem. We \ncan hope that the Saudis will pump faster and that our drills will find \nmore. And we can just sit on our hands and say that it is too hard to \nchange the way things are and so we might as well not even try.\n  Or we could accept and embrace the challenge of finding a solution to \none of the most pressing problems of our time, our dependence on \nforeign oil. It will not be easy and it will not be without sacrifice. \nGovernment cannot make it happen on its own, but it does have a role in \nsupporting the initiative that is already out there.\n  I vote for this bill reluctantly today, disappointed that we have \nmissed our opportunity to do something bolder that would have put us on \nthe path to energy independence. This bill should be the first step, \nnot the last, in our journey towards energy independence.\n  I close by saying I hope we do not wait another 5 years before we \nwork on the important issue of energy independence. I plan to support \nthis bill because of the fine work that was done by the sponsors, but I \nwould insist that in the next year or two we immediately address the \nissue of how we can wean ourselves off of Middle Eastern oil.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I firmly believe our Nation needs a sound \nand balanced national energy plan, emphasizing a clean, reliable, \nsustainable, and affordable energy policy. Unfortunately, this bill \nfails to do that. The Senate sent a good energy bill to conference, and \nwe got back a frog. This conference report fails to reduce our \ndependence on imported oil, fails to address the threat of global \nwarming, fails to make much needed new investments in clean energy \nproduction and fails to provide any help to consumers that are \nsuffering from record high gas prices.\n  Specifically, this conference report does not include the Senate's \nmandatory oil savings clause, which would have reduced oil use by 1 \nmillion barrels per day. The bill also deletes the renewable energy \nstandard that would have required utilities to obtain at least 10 \npercent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Increasing \nthe production of electricity from renewable energy sources will help \nimprove the quality of our country's water and air. Instead of \nsupporting the advancement of renewable energy technologies to create \njobs and reduce pollution, we have a bill that gives oil, gas, ethanol, \nand nuclear companies enormous subsidies.\n  In addition, the bill does not include any provisions to address \nglobal warning. I believe we have a responsibility to act now to curb \ngreenhouse gases; thus, I was pleased the Senate bill agreed on the \nneed for mandatory programs to address greenhouse gases. Two major \nscientific reports released last fall warned that global warming is \noccurring more rapidly than previously known, and that the effects of \nsuch warming trends are widespread. In Vermont, we will also see \necological and economic consequences of these alarming trends. \nVermonters working in our ski and maple syrup industries have already \nreported changes they have been forced to make in recent years to \nadjust to climate change. This bill's refusal to take any steps to \ncombat global warming is not only disappointing, but dangerous to our \nfuture generations. One hundred years from now, it may turn out that \nglobal warming was the single most important problem that the United \nStates almost totally ignored. At that stage I will not be able to say \n``I told you so,'' but some academic scholars might note my timely \nwarmings. Indeed, when I was chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry Committee, I included a provision on the impacts of global \nwarming in U.S. food production in the 1990 farm bill--15 years ago.\n  The bill also contains a number of anti-environmental provisions that \nwere not included in the Senate's bill. It threatens drinking water by \nallowing the underground injection of diesel fuel and other chemicals \nduring oil and gas development and exempts oil and gas construction \nactivities from the Clean Water Act. It also includes a seismic \ninventory of oil and gas resources in sensitive Outer Continental Shelf \nareas.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that this Energy Bill doesn't take a \nsingle concrete step to address the high and rising cost of gasoline \nfor American consumers. The Senate unanimously adopted my amendment to \nallow the Federal Government to take legal action against any foreign \nstate, including members of OPEC, for price fixing and other \nanticompetitive activities. It is high time we say, ``no!'' to OPEC's \nillegal price fixing schemes. Yet, due to opposition from the Bush \nadministration, under whose tenure the average price of gasoline has \nskyrocketed from $1.45 per gallon to more than $2.30 per gallon, this \nprovision was deleted from the Energy bill conference report.\n  This bill fails on almost every count. Yet, almost unbelievably, it \ncould have gotten much worse. Under the leadership of my friend from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Gregg, we were able to stop the House GOP \nleadership from letting MTBE polluters off the hook for contaminating \nour ground water and drinking water. I understand that the conferees \ncame to an agreement which in no way impacts the rights of citizens and \nlocal governments to pursue all available State and Federal remedies \nwhere there is environmental harm and other injury that results from \nleakage of MTBE into the ground water. While I was concerned about any \neffort to alter the subject matter jurisdiction of these cases, I am \nrelieved to learn that they did not do so in conference. I understand \nthat nothing in the current language will alter the substantive law \nthat courts currently apply in these cases and that they will apply to \nfuture claims.\n  After a colloquy between conferees on the record, Representative \nStupak did not offer his amendment clarifying their unanimous \nunderstanding of the relevant section. The amendment that he withheld \nwould have simply added the phrase ``under applicable state or federal \nlaw'' to the permissive removal provision. I am told by Senator \nBingaman that the conferees found this amendment unnecessary because it \nwas\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\nclear to them, as it is to me, that the relevant language adopted does \nnot change the substantive law that applies and it does not change the \ncurrent law that applies in consideration of removal petitions.\n  This administration and this Congress had a real opportunity to \nproduce a bill that would lead the Nation towards balanced, \nsustainable, clean energy production. Instead, we have 1,700 pages \nworth of policies that will increase our dependence on fossil fuels, \nprovide billions to wealthy energy corporations, and threaten \nenvironmental and public health. I do not see how my Republican \ncolleagues can any longer justify their drastic cuts to vital social \nprograms while pushing through this multibillion dollar legislation \nthat does nothing to secure our energy future.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to today in support of the Energy \nbill and to provide some perspective on the conference report for H.R. \n6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  I have been in Congress since 1976, serving first in the House of \nRepresentatives, and since 1990 in the Senate. I have served with many \noutstanding Congressmen, Congresswomen, and Senators who have advanced \nmy knowledge and appreciation for comprehensive energy policy in the \nlong-term. I served with Representative Jim Lord, who was my mentor in \nthe House when I first arrived. I saw him again just before I stepped \ninto last Sunday's conference committee meeting in Rayburn. I served \nwith my good friend and colleague, John Dingell, from Michigan, and I \nserved with the dedicated and ever-insightful Congressman from \nMassachusetts, Ed Markey. Both of them have made enormous contributions \nto this year's energy bill, as have all the House Members.\n  I have served on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nfor more than 10 years. I was here when the Senate passed the last \nenergy bill, the Energy Policy Act of 1992. That bill was a benchmark \nthat established a range of energy efficiency, conservation, renewable \nenergy, research and development, and regulatory frameworks for energy \nthat are still in place today.\n  My observation is that the compromise that we have now may be the \nbest we can get in the next 5 to 10 years, given the regional nature of \nenergy and the partisan nature of politics. Energy is an issue with \nregional, special interest, and State and local ``tugs'' and ``pulls'' \nunlike other national issues. The breadth of this energy bill is almost \nincomprehensible. An energy policy sounds simple, but it is a complex, \ninterlocked patchwork of agreements, prohibitions and incentives.\n  If we do nothing, we will be worse off than when we started. We will \nnot advance energy conservation, efficiency, or production of \nalternative fuels if we do not pass the bill. I urge members to \nremember that we have spent over 5 years debating an energy bill and we \nhave seen bills that are much, much worse. This bill represents a \nvictory in many ways.\n  It is victory of democratic process over regional politics. This bill \nwas fully heard by the committee and fully debated and amended in the \nSenate. It was a bipartisan effort on which we spent 3 months exploring \nthe topics making a comprehensive bill. We spent another 2 weeks \ndebating and changing this bill in the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources. We accepted many amendments on the Democratic side. The \nSenate debated the bill for another 2 weeks, changing it and improving \nit again.\n  I applaud the efforts of Senators Domenici and Bingaman, the chair \nand ranking member of the Energy Committee, for upholding the promise \nof the Senate energy bill in the conference discussions. They showed \ngreat leadership in holding firm to the Senate bill, rejecting House \nprovisions that were unacceptable. Their staffs were determined to \nprovide us an energy bill that did not include excessive spending or \ndestructive environmental compromises.\n  The energy conference report is not perfect, but its a good bill. I \nknow the bill does not have provisions for fuel efficiency standards \nfor cars, SUVs, and trucks, provisions which I supported in the \nCommittee and on the floor. It does not have controls on carbon dioxide \nor standards for renewable electricity, although the latter was \napproved in the Senate.\n  In many respects, these are small steps, but important ones, in the \nright direction to meet our energy challenges. It encourages cleaner \nalternative energy initiatives such as hydrogen, solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and natural gas resources. It emphasizes greater use of \nrenewables. It promotes greater efficiency in the way we currently use \nappliances, home heating and cooling, with more stringent standards. It \nencourages more efficient cars, homes, and commercial appliances such \nas dishwashers. It strengthens the reliability of our electricity grid, \nencourages more transmission lines, and protects ratepayers from market \nabuses. These are things that are needed now, not in another 5 years \nwhen the composition of Congress or the White House might change.\n  The bill does not go as far as I would have liked to address some of \nthe biggest energy problems our Nation faces. It seems Congress cannot \nmobilize the political will to take the difficult steps needed to \nreduce our reliance on foreign oil, improve vehicle fuel efficiency or \ndeal with global warming. I supported those amendments, both on the \nSenate floor and in conference committee deliberations, but we lost in \nfair votes in an open process.\n  What we have before us, in the long run, is a bill that is balanced \nin terms of production of energy from a variety of sources and it uses \nappropriated funds and tax expenditures to encourage research, \ndevelopment, and production. There will always be detractors who can \nfind problems with particular pieces of this far-reaching energy bill. \nThe comprehensive bill is so broad that I do not believe it will ever \nsatisfy the positions of every interest group. The bottom line is that \nthis bill does not include the onerous provisions of an MTBE liability \nwaiver, an ozone bump-up, and it does not include categorical waivers \nfor NEPA for oil and gas developments.\n  It does include many tax provisions to encourage alternative and \nrenewable fuels, nuclear energy, and oil and gas industries. But the \nproportions allocated to the renewable sector, clean coal, and energy \nefficiency are greater than the tax credits and royalty relief for oil \nand gas, particularly when you consider that a large portion is for a \nrefining capacity incentive, badly needed to increase the efficiency of \noil and gas refineries. I greatly appreciate the efforts of Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, and their staffs, who bore the responsibility of \ncrafting the finance portion of the bill under great pressure with \ngrace and generosity.\n  In this era of alarming Federal budget deficits and declining \ndomestic discretionary spending, we have to look to tax incentives and \nloan guarantees to mobilize capital investment in new and cleaner \nenergy. For the Nation to maintain our leadership in technology and \nengineering, we must spend money. Because of many circumstances, namely \nthe war in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and future extensions of tax \ncuts, we do not have adequate funds to spend on this effort. The only \nplace we can find revenue to encourage the adoption of new technologies \nis through tax incentives. To me, this is an innovative way to create \nopportunity out of hardship.\n  The bill the Senate will consider today, on balance, improves our \nenergy policy and deserves to be enacted. Enormous credit for the \nsuccess of the conference and the development of the bill goes to my \ncolleagues from New Mexico, Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, \nand their staff, who worked long and hard around the clock to bring \nthis bill to fruition. Senator Domenici has taken a fresh look, from \nthe beginning of the 109th Congress, and changed his entire approach to \nthe energy bill. I greatly appreciate his orientation and his strategy \nworking with his colleagues on this energy bill. I also extend my great \nappreciation to Chairman Joe Barton and Ranking Member John Dingell for \ntheir openness and willingness to work with members on the special \nneeds of their States. Their leadership ensured that the conference was \nfair, open, and bipartisan from start to finish. I look forward to \nvoting for this bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\n     Clarification Of Section 1287 Of The Energy Policy Act Of 2005\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, would the gentleman from New Mexico yield \nto me for purposes of engaging in a colloquy?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be happy to yield to the gentleman for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the gentleman. Section 1287 of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 6 includes rulemaking authority for the \nFederal Trade Commission to adopt rules protecting the privacy of \nelectric consumers in connection with their receipt of electric utility \nservices. Am I correct in understanding that it was the conference \ncommittee's intent to grant the FTC rulemaking authority with respect \nto the information practices of ``traditional'' utility companies and \nnot financial institutions regulated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The gentleman is correct. We did not intend to revisit \nissues regulated under the GLBA, or provide the Commission with \nrulemaking authority over financial institutions regulated under Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Am I further correct that it was not your intention that \nutility companies be restricted in their ability to report payment \nhistory information to consumer reporting agencies, as such information \ncan be very beneficial to consumers, such as those consumers with \n``thin'' files at credit bureaus?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The gentleman is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Am I further correct that it was not your intention that \nthe FTC be given broad rulemaking authority with respect to the goods \nor services that can be offered to any utility customer, but rather the \nFTC has the authority to regulate the products or services offered by \n``traditional'' utility companies and not financial institutions \nregulated by the GLBA?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The gentleman is correct.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the gentleman for his clarifications.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the gentleman for bringing these issues to my \nattention.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to finish \na very long journey in the quest to build a dynamic, comprehensive \nenergy policy for the United States of America. I can say with pride \nthat this Congress, through many trials and tribulations, has now \nperformed admirably in its duty to the American people. This is a \nbalanced energy bill that focuses as much on the future as it does the \npresent. We have the opportunity with the passage of this legislation \nto safely produce more energy from more sources and with more \ninfrastructure security then ever before.\n  On June 21st, the Senate passed H.R. 6 which included the Energy \nPolicy Tax Incentives Act of 2005. The tax provisions were a bipartisan \nproduct formulated with Senator Baucus, after consultation with many \nMembers of the Senate.\n  In my estimation, the energy policy tax incentives reflected in this \nconference agreement are a fair balance of the interests of the Members \nand effectively supports the development of energy production from \nrenewable and environmentally beneficial sources.\n  I would like to briefly describe these tax incentives that are \nincluded in the final energy Conference agreement.\n  For years, I have worked to decrease our reliance on foreign sources \nof energy and accelerate and diversify domestic energy production. I \nbelieve public policy ought to promote renewable domestic production \nthat uses renewable energy and fosters economic development.\n  Specifically, the development of alternative energy sources should \nalleviate domestic energy shortages and insulate the United States from \nthe Middle East-dominated oil supply. In addition, the development of \nrenewable energy resources conserves existing natural resources and \nprotects the environment.\n  Finally, alternative energy development provides economic benefits to \nfarmers, ranchers and forest landowners, such as those in Iowa who have \nlaunched efforts to diversify the State's economy and to find creative \nways to extract a greater return from abundant natural resources.\n  Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code currently provides a \nproduction tax credit for electricity produced from renewable sources \nincluding wind, biomass, and other renewables. The final Energy Tax \nIncentives Act extends the section 45 credit through the end of 2007.\n  I have been a constant advocate of alternative energy sources. Since \nthe inception 13 years ago of the wind energy tax credit, wind energy \nproduction has grown considerably. In addition, wind represents an \naffordable and inexhaustible source of domestically produced energy.\n  Extending the wind energy tax credit until 2008 will support the \ntremendous continued development of this clean, renewable energy \nsource.\n  The conference agreement supports a maturing green energy source. \nExperts have established wind energy's valuable contributions to \nmaintaining cleaner air and a cleaner environment. Every 10,000 \nmegawatts of wind energy produced in the United States can reduce \ncarbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing the \ncombustion of fossil fuels.\n  In addition, this agreement helps to empower our rural communities to \nreap continued economic benefits. The installation of wind turbines has \na stimulative economic effect because it requires significant capital \ninvestment which results in the creation of jobs and the injection of \ncapital into often rural economic areas.\n  In addition, for each wind turbine, a farmer or rancher can receive \nmore than $2,000 per year for 20 years in direct lease payments. Iowa's \nmajor wind farms currently pay more than $640,000 per year to \nlandowners, and the development of 1,000 megawatts of capacity in \nCalifornia, for example, would result in annual payments of \napproximately $2 million to farm and forest landowners in that State.\n  Environmentally friendly biomass energy production is a proven, \neffective technology that generates numerous waste management public \nbenefits across the country.\n  The biomass definition covers open loop biomass. Open loop biomass \nincludes organic, nonhazardous materials such as sawdust, tree \ntrimmings, agricultural byproducts and untreated construction debris.\n  The development of a local industry to convert biomass to electricity \nhas the potential to produce enormous economic benefits and electricity \nsecurity for rural America.\n  In addition, studies show that biomass crops could produce between $2 \nand $5 billion in additional farm income for American farmers. As an \nexample, over 450 tons of turkey and chicken litter are under contract \nto be sold for an electricity plant using poultry litter being built in \nMinnesota. This is a win-win. Not only do the farmers not have to pay \nto dispose of this stuff, they get paid to sell the litter. You could \nfind similar examples throughout the Midwest and other farm regions \nacross America.\n  Finally, marginal farmland incapable of sustaining traditional yearly \nproduction is often capable of generating native grasses and organic \nmaterials that are ideal for biomass energy production. Turning tree \ntrimmings and native grasses into energy provides an economic gain and \nserves an important public interest.\n  I am very proud of a long history of supporting new alternative \nenergy concepts in the production of electricity. The energy conference \nagreement continues that commitment.\n  By using animal waste as an energy source, an American livestock \nproducer can reduce or eliminate monthly energy purchases from electric \nand gas suppliers and provide excess energy for distribution to other \nmembers of the community.\n  Swine and bovine energy is truly green electricity, as it also \nfurthers environmental objectives.\n  Specifically, anaerobic digestion of manure improves air quality \nbecause it eliminates as much as 90 percent of the odor from feedlots \nand improves soil and water quality by dramatically reducing problems \nwith waste runoff. Maximizing farm resources in such a manner may prove \nessential to remain competitive in today's livestock market. In \naddition, the technology used to create the electricity results in the \nproduction of a fertilizer product that is of a higher quality than \nunprocessed animal waste.\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\n  The Energy Tax Incentives Act is important to agriculture, rural \neconomy and small business. It is also important for domestic supply \nand energy independence.\n  Rural America can play an important part in energy independence and \ndomestic supply. In addition to the production of electricity, this \nagreement includes additional tax incentives for the production of \nalternative fuels from renewable resources.\n  We continue the small producers credit for the production of ethanol. \nWe continue the incentive for the production of biodiesel. Biodiesel is \na natural substitute for diesel fuel and can be made from almost all \nvegetable oils and animal fats. Modern science is allowing us to slowly \nsubstitute natural renewable agricultural sources for traditional \npetroleum. It gives us choices for the future and it can relieve the \nstrain on the domestic oil production to fulfill those important needs \nthat agricultural products cannot serve.\n  Renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel will improve air quality, \nstrengthen national security, reduce the trade deficit, decrease \ndependence on the Middle East for oil, and expand markets for \nagricultural products.\n  This package is fiscally responsible. The conference report provides \na net $11.5 billion in tax relief over 10 years. That figure aligns \nwith the budget resolution. Over 5 years, the package loses only about \n$6.9 billion.\n  The Energy conference agreement is a balanced package. I would like \nto note, with some satisfaction, that today we have performed the \npeople's business in the way they want us to do business. This Energy \nTax Incentives Act was crafted in a bipartisan, bicameral way on an \nimportant initiative, in a way that reflects the diversity of our views \nand the diversity of our Nation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman \nfor insisting upon a more open, bipartisan conference than we have seen \nin a number of other important bills.\n  Chairman Domenici deserves great credit for making sure that this \nconference report does not include some of the most egregious House \nprovisions, particularly retroactive liability protection for MTBE \nproducers and broad Clean Air Act exemptions.\n  However, I am extremely concerned that this bill does nothing to \naddress global warming and fuel economy standards. I believe that \nclimate change is the most urgent energy-related problem of my \nlifetime.\n  This bill refuses to accept responsibility or chart a course to deal \nwith the United States' profligate use of emissions-producing energy \nsources.\n  The United States is the largest consumer of energy, yet this bill \ndoes nothing to reduce our energy consumption. This bill deletes a very \nmodest oil savings provision that would have required us to save 1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day in 2015.\n  Nor does it include a renewable portfolio standard that I would have \nrequired that 10 percent of the nation's electricity come from \nrenewable resources by 2020. California will achieve a renewable \nportfolio standard of 20 percent by 2017. It is doable nationally.\n  Climate change is the most important energy and environmental issue \nfacing us today. The earth's temperatures are expected to rise between \n2.5 degrees and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.\n  During the same time period, the American Southwest could see a rise \nof 14 degrees or more.\n  Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, and water supplies in \nthe West are at severe risk.\n  By not acting to aggressively reduce our emissions, we are putting \nCalifornia's water supplies at severe risk.\n  California depends on the Sierra Nevada snowpack as its largest \nsource of water. It is estimated that by the end of this century, the \nshrinking of the snowpack will eliminate the water source for 16 \nmillion people--equal to all of the people in the Los Angeles Basin.\n  We must act now. Carbon dioxide emissions accumulate in the \natmosphere--the more we emit, the worse the impacts on our environment. \nIf we curb our emissions now, we may have a chance to limit the damage \nwe are causing to our fragile ecosystem.\n  Yet this bill does not include the Sense of the Senate on climate \nchange that recognizes that climate change is being caused by man-made \nemissions, and that Congress must pass legislation that establishes a \nmandatory cap on emissions.\n  The lack of action on climate change and fuel economy is an enormous \ndeficit of the bill.\n  Increasing fuel economy standards is the single most important step \nwe can take to reduce our dependence on oil. We have the technology now \nto increase the fuel economy of our vehicles.\n  GM, DaimlerChrysler and Honda have already developed something known \nas cylinder cut-off technology that provides the fuel efficiency \nsimilar to a vehicle with a smaller engine, but with all the power of a \nbig engine. The auto manufacturers could use a more fuel efficient \ndesign, using lighter materials that increase fuel economy without \nsacrificing safety.\n  The list goes on and on, yet the auto manufacturers will not act \nunless Congress forces them to. We are missing a huge opportunity to \naddress the real problem that consumers are facing--rising gas prices. \nThose gas prices are not going to fall until or unless we reduce our \ndemand for oil by increasing our fuel economy.\n  I am also concerned about the following provisions in the bill:\n  Ethanol--the bill has an egregious 7.5 billion gallon mandate for \nethanol. My State does not need the fuel additive to meet clean air \nstandards.\n  I thank the conferees for retaining an amendment I offered to protect \nCalifornia's air quality. It waives the requirement that California use \nethanol in the summer months when it can end up polluting the air more \nthan protecting it.\n  However, I believe that this mandate will raise gas prices for \nCalifornians. So far, ethanol in California's gasoline has increased \nthe cost of our gasoline by 4 to 8 cents per gallon.\n  Further, the ethanol mandate maintains the 54 cent-per-gallon import \nduty that prevents oil producers from buying ethanol on the global \nmarket, or wherever it is cheapest.\n  Moreover, ethanol receives a tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. A 7.5 \nbillion gallon mandate means an almost $2 billion loss to the U.S. \nTreasury over today's receipts. I believe this mandate is an \nunnecessary giveaway.\n  In addition, increasing the use of ethanol will not decrease our use \nof oil. When this mandate is fully implemented in 2012 it will only \nreduce U.S. oil consumption by less than one-half of one percent.\n  I believe this is bad public policy and that it is an unnecessary, \ncostly mandate that should not be in the energy bill.\n  LNG Siting--this bill gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nexclusive authority over siting LNG terminals. There are three projects \nproposed in California. It seems to me that the location of these \nprojects should be left up to the State, not to the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should ensure that the \ntechnicalities of natural gas delivery are taken care of, not where \nthese facilities are located on the coastlines of our states.\n  Outer Continental Shelf--this bill provides for an inventory of the \nresources off our shores. This is not necessary unless we plan on \ndrilling, to which I remain very much opposed.\n  I strongly oppose lifting the moratoria on drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and my State is unified in its opposition as well. \nOur coast is too important to California's economy and to our quality \nof life.\n  Environmental Rollbacks--the bill exempts the underground injection \nof chemicals during oil and gas development from regulation under the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, and waives the storm water runoff Clean Water \nAct regulations for oil and gas construction sites.\n  These are unnecessary environmental rollbacks that should not have \nbeen included in the Energy bill conference report.\n  I reluctantly voted for the Energy bill when it was considered on the \nSenate floor. The reason I voted for it was because it included strong \nconsumer protections, and great energy efficiency tax incentives that \nSenator Snowe and I have been pushing for the past several years.\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\n  While I am pleased that the strong consumer protections are still \nincluded in the bill, I am extremely disappointed with the energy \nefficiency tax incentives.\n  The tax incentives for energy efficiency in the Senate bill were the \ncornerstone of a sensible energy policy to address high natural gas \nprices, peak power reliability, and global warming. It would have saved \nover 180 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually in the year \n2025--some 10 percent of U.S. emissions for all purposes, while saving \nconsumers over $100 billion annually.\n  But the Energy bill conference report cut these incentives back by \nover two-thirds, leaving the Nation with only the skeleton of an \neffective energy efficiency tax program. While it is possible that this \nhobbled program could still work, it is so under-funded that it could \nalso fail.\n  The Senate bill provides performance-based incentives of up to $2,000 \nfor retrofits made to homes that would achieve a 50 percent energy \nsavings, and applied to all types of homes, whether owner-occupied or \nrenter-occupied, whether owned by families or by businesses, and \nwhether the tenant or the landlord performs the retrofit.\n  The conference report gutted this program--providing cost-based \nincentives limited to 10 percent of the cost of the retrofit, or a \nmaximum of $500. This is problematic because nearly identical cost-\nbased tax incentives for home retrofits were tried in 1978. They cost \nthe Treasury over $5 billion and not a single study has found that they \nproduced any energy savings.\n  The Senate bill also provided 4 years of eligibility for high \ntechnology air conditioners, furnaces, and water heaters. The \nconference report cut this eligibility back to 2 years.\n  This is a big problem because an equipment manufacturer has to make a \nlarge investment to mass-produce the efficient equipment.\n  If that investment must be fully amortized over two years of \nincentivized sales, manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to make \nit.\n  A 4-year amortization period would cause much more manufacturer \ninterest and spur the energy efficiency that we want to promote with \nthese tax credits.\n  In other words, these energy efficiency tax credits may be \nmeaningless when it comes time to implement them. That would be a \nterrible shame--energy efficiency has been a huge success in reducing \nCalifornia's demand for energy.\n  In California, efficiency programs have kept electricity consumption \nflat for the past 30 years, in contrast to the rest of the United \nStates, where consumption increased 50 percent.\n  During the Western energy crisis, California faced energy shortages \nand rolling blackouts, but it could have been much worse. Ultimately, \nthe State was able to escape further blackouts because Californians \nmade a major effort to conserve energy. This reduced demand for \nelectricity and helped ease the crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report dramatically reduced the \neffectiveness of the most important step this nation could take to \nreduce our energy usage--incentivizing energy efficiency.\n  By not including the oil savings amendment, the renewable portfolio \nstandard, the Sense of the Senate on climate change, and by gutting the \nenergy efficiency tax incentives, this bill preserves the status quo \nand does nothing to reduce our dependence on oil or on other fossil \nfuels.\n  This bill will not solve our Nation's energy problems, lower gas \nprices, or reduce emissions. And while I thank Senators Domenici and \nBingaman for the fair, open process by which they brought us this bill, \nI will cast my vote against the conference report.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nreport on H.R. 6, the Comprehensive Energy Policy Act of 2005. I stand \nbefore my colleagues today with very mixed feelings about this \nlegislation. This conference report has many meaningful achievements \nand measures that can help provide this Nation, our researchers, and \ninnovators, with the basic tools to start moving America forward toward \na new energy strategy for the 21st century. Yet it is far from perfect. \nIt sidesteps many of the most fundamental energy security challenges we \nface--challenges like our dependence on foreign oil and global climate \nchange, which grow more intractable the longer we wait to address them. \nIt contains provisions that I simply do not support. It is certainly \nnot the Energy bill that this Senator would write if I alone held the \ndrafting pen--the kind of legislation that would put this Nation on a \nfar more ambitious path toward greater energy security in the global \neconomy. I know many of my colleagues feel exactly the same way.\n  And yet I believe all Senators must clearly acknowledge that this \nlegislation is in many ways superior to the Energy bill conference \nreport we considered during the 108th Congress. And that is true in \nsome very meaningful ways for my region, the Pacific Northwest.\n  When the Senate, last month, approved its version of this \nlegislation, I noted that I appreciated the skill and thoughtfulness \nwith which the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee, \nSenators Domenici and Bingaman, had navigated a path forward for this \nbill. I suggested at the time that they would need every bit of that \nskill in coming to resolution with the House of Representatives, on a \npiece of legislation worthy of this Senate's support. Frankly, I \ndoubted very much that it could be done.\n  But I stand here today ready to vote for this conference report--with \nreservations, of course--but in recognition of the fact that this \nlegislation is probably better than many of us had reason to expect; \nand as good as the current political will of Congress would allow. For \nthat, I give enormous credit to the chairman and ranking member. As a \nmember of the Senate Energy Committee, I want to say that I have \nappreciated the bipartisan nature in which they have handled this bill \nfrom the outset. At every turn, they have treated this Senator--and her \nconstituents' interests--with complete fairness. The process by which \nthis legislation was assembled should serve as a model for this body.\n  I want to talk briefly about what I view as some of the most \nimportant achievements of this legislation--particularly for my region \nand the great State of Washington. These are some of the basic tools \nthat can help serve as building blocks to a more ambitious energy \nstrategy for America.\n  First and foremost, it is important to understand that the Pacific \nNorthwest is a region completely unique when it comes to our energy \nsystem. More than 70 percent of the electricity production in \nWashington State is derived from hydroelectric sources--designed around \nour great river, the mighty Columbia. This was a system built as part \nof President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's efforts to electrify the West. \nAs a result, we are a region with a rich and diverse energy history, an \nuncommon collection of public and private institutions, a large Federal \npresence that starts with the Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, and \na diverse array of stakeholders rightly concerned about the river's \nmultiple uses. I know all of my colleagues from the Northwest who sit \non the Energy Committee--there are five of us, in fact--appreciate this \ntremendous heritage, our region's history of cost-based power, and the \nvaluable asset that we inherited from our predecessors, great leaders \nlike Senators Jackson, Hatfield, and Magnuson.\n\n  That is why we worked hard, in a bipartisan manner at every turn, to \nsafeguard the Northwest's system of cost-based power--the engine of our \nregional economy. That is why the electricity title of this legislation \nis so important to my region, and to the ratepayers of Washington \nState.\n  I am proud this legislation specifically protects the Northwest's \ntransmission system, by prohibiting the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, from converting the Bonneville Power Administration's \nexisting system of cost-based, firm transmission contracts to a market-\nbased auction of financial transmission rights.\n  Now, this auction of financial transmission rights was a central \ntenet of FERC's controversial and ill-fated standard market design, \nSMD, proposal. All of us from the Northwest were united in our \nopposition to SMD because we recognized right away that it was a scheme \nwith the potential to result in tremendous amounts of cost-\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\nshifting onto our ratepayers, and to substantially undermine our cost-\nbased system. The provision that protects the Northwest's existing \nsystem is thus an important achievement because it slams the door on \nany sort of future FERC-imposed proposal like standard market design. I \nwould also note that the Senate-passed Energy bill would have slammed \nthe door on SMD once and for all. This became unnecessary, however, \nwhen FERC's new chairman officially terminated the commission's SMD \nproceeding earlier this month. I think that was a very wise choice and \nthink it speaks quite well of the commission's new leadership.\n  Also important to my region are provisions that this bill does not \ncontain. Specifically, this conference report omits the \nadministration's legislative proposals--unveiled earlier this year--to \nhamstring BPA's ability to invest in regional infrastructure and upend \nBonneville's system of cost-based power sales. The Northwest Power and \nConservation Council has estimated the administration's proposal would \nraise regional power rates by $1.7 billion. That would translate to a \n$480-a-year rate hike for families in some of Washington's most rural \ncommunities. Again thanks to the bipartisan efforts of Northwest \nSenators, those legislative proposals were dead on arrival.\n  When it comes to protecting Washington State consumers, I must also \nmention a number of other provisions. At long last, the bill \nestablishes mandatory, enforceable reliability rules for operation of \nthe Nation's transmission grid. This effort also began in the Pacific \nNorthwest--after an August 1996 blackout resulting from two overloaded \ntransmission lines near Portland, OR which caused a sweeping outage \nthat knocked out power for up to 16 hours in 10 States, including \nWashington. As a result, both a DOE task force and the industry itself \nin 1997 recommended mandatory reliability rules for operating the \ntransmission grid. The Senate first passed this legislation just over 5 \nyears ago, in an effort begun by my predecessor, Senator Slade Gorton. \nIt is legislation that I have championed since I have arrived in the \nSenate, an effort that gained more urgency with the Northeast blackouts \nof two summers ago; and I will be very pleased to see this measure \nthrough to the end.\n\n  This bill also takes steps to respond to the disastrous western \nenergy crisis, which extracted billions of dollars and hundreds of \nthousands of jobs from our regional economy. As I have recounted many \ntimes on this floor, the illegal and unethical practices of Enron and \nothers sent Washington power rates through the roof. This Energy bill \nputs in place the first ever broad prohibition on manipulation of \nelectricity and natural gas markets. These provisions are modeled on a \nmeasure that I have authored that has now passed the Senate twice, and \nI am pleased that they are included in this conference report--\nparticularly given the far inferior provisions contained in the House \nlegislation, which would have in many ways gone in the entirely \nopposite direction.\n  In light of the now-infamous audiotapes of Enron traders and others \nconspiring to gouge consumers, the legislation also gives Federal \nregulators new authority to ban unscrupulous energy traders and \nexecutives from employment in the utility industry. In addition, it \nsubstantially increases fines for energy companies that break the \nrules. And importantly for my constituents, this legislation prohibits \na Federal bankruptcy court from enforcing fraudulent Enron power \ncontracts, including $122 million the now-bankrupt energy giant is \nattempting to collect from Snohomish PUD. That would translate to more \nthan $400 from the pockets of every family in Snohomish County, WA, who \nhave already seen their utility bills rise precipitously as a result of \nthe western energy debacle.\n  For all these provisions, I am tremendously grateful to the chairman \nand ranking member. I know they faced a steep uphill battle with the \nHouse in retaining these measures, and I applaud and thank them for \ntheir efforts in ensuring that the Senate positions prevailed.\n  I should also mention the renewable fuels provisions of this bill, \nwhich I believe will help put Washington State farmers and \nentrepreneurs in the biofuels business. Today, production of biofuels \nis dominated by the midwestern region of the country, as traditional \npolicies have supported corn- and soy-based fuel production and helped \nthat technology gain maturity. However, the key to lowering costs and \nestablishing a truly national strategy is to make an investment in new \ntechnologies that will diversify biofuels production in the United \nStates.\n  Researchers at Washington State University estimate that our State \nhas the capacity to produce 200 million gallons of ethanol from wheat \nstraw, and up to 1.2 billion gallons with technology improvements. \nMeanwhile, biodiesel is another emerging opportunity for Washington \nState farmers, using canola or yellow mustard. These crops are \nparticularly well-suited to Washington State, providing high yields \nwithout irrigation.\n  Around Spokane, it is estimated that 500,000 acres a year could be \nput into oil seed production, enough oil to produce 25 million gallons \nof biodiesel. Statewide, at least 2 million acres could be put into \noilseed production for biodiesel.\n  There are a number of very important provisions in this bill that \nwill help my State capitalize on the promise of biofuels, including an \nAdvanced Biofuel Technology Program I authored, to help demonstrate \nthese new technologies; important market-based incentives for refiners \nto diversify the types of biofuels they use; and financial support in \nmany forms for cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel production.\n  These are very important achievements that will help transform \nbiofuels from a boutique regional industry to something that can become \npart of a truly national strategy to help supplant our Nation's \npetroleum imports--lowering costs and helping provide greater economic \nsecurity to our farmers at the same time.\n  But in addition to renewable fuels, we should acknowledge the \nprovisions of this legislation promoting renewable electricity \ngeneration. Obviously, this legislation does not go as far as I would \nlike. I vigorously support a renewable portfolio standard--even a more \naggressive standard than what passed the Senate. It is unfortunate, \nindeed, that the House would not accept this provision, and those of us \nwho strongly advocate it will continue to attempt to move the RPS \nforward.\n  But this legislation does extend through the end of 2007 the existing \nproduction tax credit for renewable energy, such as wind resources. It \nis estimated that this credit can help save Washington State ratepayers \n$260 million over the next 10 years. As Northwest utilities add wind \nresources to help bolster regional power supplies, these investments \nare also helping fill the coffers of local communities. For example, a \nnew wind project near Ellensburg, WA, has generated an additional $2 \nmillion in revenue for Kittitas County. Similarly, wind energy is \nhelping provide another source of income for Northwest farmers. Growers \nin Columbia County, WA, home to the new 150 Megawatt Hopkins Ridge wind \nproject, receive about $5,000 per turbine located on their land. One \nfarmer estimates the revenue generated by the project will equal the \nincome generated by 250 acres of harvest.\n  For the first time, the Energy bill creates clean renewable energy \nbonds, to support investment in renewable energy resources by \ngovernmental entities, including tribes, agencies such as BPA and other \npublic power entities. I am also pleased that for 20 years the \nRenewable Energy Production Incentive, REPI, Program, which provides a \ndirect payment to public power entities, which do not qualify for tax \ncredits, for renewable electricity production. Eligible resources are \nexpanded to include ocean energy. The REPI Program has already been \nused by multiple Washington State public utilities to make renewable \nenergy investments.\n  Washington State is also home to the Pacific Northwest National Lab, \nand for that reason, the research and development title of this \nlegislation bears mentioning. The Energy bill conference report \nauthorizes hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in research \nongoing at the Pacific Northwest National Lab and Washington State \nuniversities, including systems biology research, distributed and smart \nenergy technology research and development; bio- and nanotechnology \nrelated to the production of bioproducts; and advanced scientific \ncomputing.\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\n  The Energy bill's ``personnel and training'' title is also worth \nnoting, since it will help provide a skilled energy workforce for the \n21st century, as the energy industry braces for a critical shortage. \nWashington State is poised to help train the next generation of \nengineers and innovators in this area. The legislation requires the \nSecretaries of Energy and Labor to monitor workforce trends in the area \nof electric power and transmission engineers and identify critical \nnational shortages of personnel. It also authorizes the Secretaries to \nestablish a grants program of up to $20 million a year to enhance \ntraining--including distance-learning, such as the program now being \npioneered at Gonzaga University--in electric power and transmission \nengineering fields. While fewer than 15 universities nationwide offer \nworld-class, Ph.D.-level programs in power engineering, both Washington \nState University and the University of Washington offer strong programs \nin this area. In addition, Gonzaga University this year established a \nspecialized masters of science degree and certification program in \ntransmission and distribution engineering.\n  This conference report also streamlines technology transfer rules for \nnational labs such as PNNL, and extends the 20 percent R tax credit \nto energy research done by nonprofit consortiums involving small \nbusinesses, National Labs, and universities to promote interaction and \ncollaboration between public and private researchers. The research and \ndevelopment and workforce provisions of this bill hold some of the most \npromise in putting in place the building blocks for a real, innovative \nenergy strategy for the 21st century.\n  Years in the making, the Energy bill also includes bipartisan reform \nof the hydroelectric relicensing process. The hydro provisions included \nin this legislation are designed to improve the accountability and \nquality of Federal agencies' decisions. At the same time, the \ncompromise restores the rights of the public to participate in the \nprocess on equal footing with license applicants--provisions that have \nbeen missing in previous versions of the bill. Over the next 15 years, \n70 percent of Washington State's non-Federal hydro must go through the \nhydro relicensing process.\n  Another provision of importance to my State is this legislation's \nreinstatement of the oil spill liability trust fund, OSLTF. Earlier \nthis year, a Coast Guard report found that the OSLTF--which has been \nused to clean up spills in the Puget Sound--would run out of money by \n2009. The OSLTF was established in the 1990 Oil Pollution Control Act, \nand has been funded through a per-barrel fee on oil companies until it \nreached its statutory cap of $1 billion. The fund was designed to be \nmaintained from interest on that original $1 billion, but increasing \ncleanup costs and low liability caps have eroded the principal amount. \nThe Energy bill would reinstate the fee in April 2006 or thereafter, \nonce the Secretary finds that the balance in the account falls below $2 \nbillion. The bill authorizes application of the fee through 2014.\n  Lastly, I want to mention this legislation's provisions to provide \nenergy assistance to some of our Nation's neediest families. The Energy \nbill would boost authorization for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP, from its traditional level of $2 billion to \n$5.1 billion, for 2005-2007. LIHEAP funding is critical for some of \nWashington State's most vulnerable citizens. As a result of the western \nenergy crisis, electricity rates have gone up more than 20 percent \nstatewide while 72 percent of low-income families in Washington use \nelectricity to heat their homes. And already, the 105,000 \nWashingtonians with incomes below 50 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel spend 34 percent of their entire annual pay on home energy bills. \nIn recent years, less than 30 percent of Washington's eligible families \nhave been able to receive energy assistance--as demand has for LIHEAP \ndollars has far outpaced their availability. More than doubling \navailable LIHEAP funding would provide a much-needed boost to local \norganizations in Washington struggling to meet the needs of their \ncommunities.\n  As my colleagues can see, this legislation is tremendously complex. I \nhave listed many of the provisions important to my constituents. Of \ncourse, there are a number of other measures with which I simply \ndisagree. Perhaps that is to be expected of a 1,700-page piece of \nlegislation that touches every sector of the American economy. For \nexample, the inventory of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas resources \nis wrong-headed, and I oppose it. I would note, however, that in order \nfor the inventory to move forward, it must be funded. I know this \nSenator believes any such inventory would constitute a tremendous waste \nof taxpayer funds, and the fight is far from over on this issue.\n  Similarly, I oppose the liquefied natural gas provisions of this bill \nbecause I believe States and local communities need a bigger role in \nthese decisions. Some of the nuclear provisions of this bill are \nparticularly offensive, in that they create an inherent conflict of \ninterest at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which should not be \nsubject to the cross pressures of protecting public safety and the \npublic interest, at the same time the commission is under fiscal \npressure to unwisely accelerate its proceedings under the guise of some \nnew form of ``risk insurance.''\n  I oppose the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act rollbacks in \nthis bill. The National Energy Policy Act provisions are similarly \nunnecessary. But I recognize that they are far less sweeping than those \noriginally proposed by the House. If this Senator had her way, we would \nnot be repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Yet I am at \nleast comforted by the fact this legislation hews closely to the \ncompromise on utility mergers reached by the Senate.\n  Moreover, the tax package does not resemble the tax package I would \nhave written. On this point, I agree with the President: The oil and \ngas industry does not need these incentives, given where prices are at \ntoday.\n  I am not the first Senator to say it, and I won't be the last. This \nbill is not as I would have written it. It has the flaws that I have \nlisted. It is also incomplete. It is a status quo bill when it comes to \none of the most difficult challenges to our economic and national \nsecurity faced by this generation: America's dangerous dependence on \nforeign oil. This bill does not address this festering problem. It will \nnot provide relief to consumers at the gas pump. Any suggestion to the \ncontrary would be simply false.\n\n  It is clear to this Senator that if this body is truly serious about \nputting in place a framework that will allow the United States to \ncompete in the global marketplace; a framework that will allow America \nto control its own destiny in the coming decades as it relates to our \nenergy security, our work is not done. Tomorrow isn't soon enough to go \nback to the drawing board and get serious about our dependence on \nforeign oil. And this Senator will keep fighting to do just that. Our \nwork on energy security has hardly begun--it is far from finished if we \nwant to live up to our responsibilities to future generations of \nAmericans. We must not leave to them a Nation crippled by its addiction \nto foreign sources of oil--an over-dependence that jeopardizes our \neconomic future and national security.\n  On the contrary, it is our responsibility to face up to a simple \nfact: The accidents of geology make it impossible for this Nation to \ndrill its way to energy independence, since we are situated on just 3 \npercent of the world's proven oil reserves. We must recognize that fact \nand read the economic indicators. We must consider emerging competitors \nsuch as China and India, and recognize the seismic shifts that are \nlikely to occur in the dynamics of world energy markets.\n  I firmly believe that future generations of Americans will measure us \non how we choose to address the challenges of energy security and \nclimate change. They are that vital to this Nation's security and our \neconomic future.\n  But this Senator also recognizes that the leadership of this Congress \nis not yet prepared to take that step; that my colleagues and I who \nbelieve so fundamentally in the importance of enhancing our oil \nsecurity have more work to do to change the hearts and minds of our \ncolleagues. The American people must also demand better leadership from \ntheir elected officials when it comes to energy security. And this \nSenator stands ready to work across\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\nthe aisle to do what is necessary to make meaningful progress on these \nissues.\n  This bill is not perfect. We have much more work to do to bolster our \nenergy security, and this Senator is ready to roll up her sleeves and \ndo it. But on the whole, this bill provides some basic building blocks \ntoward a better energy future. For that reason, I will support the \nEnergy bill conference report and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Energy bill that \nthe Senate will be voting on today. Unfortunately, I cannot support \nthis bill.\n  The bill does include some worthy provisions. For example, the bill \nincludes the major provisions of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology \nAct of 2005 that I have worked on for years with Senator Dorgan. It \nincludes my Dirty Bomb Prevention Act of 2005, as well as a provision \nthat I authored to require backup power for emergency sirens around the \nIndian Point nuclear powerplant. It extends and expands the wind \nproduction tax credit, and includes a provision to help us continue to \ndevelop and commercialize clean coal technology. It will push energy \nefficiency standards of air conditioners and other appliances forward. \nIt will establish mandatory, enforceable reliability standards, \nsomething that I have been pushing for since the August 2003 blackout. \nAnd it includes a bill I introduced with Senator Voinovich to create a \ngrant program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to promote \nthe reduction of diesel emissions.\n  In spite of these positive measures, I oppose the bill for two \nreasons. First, it contains a number of highly objectionable \nprovisions. Second, it simply ignores several of our most pressing \nenergy challenges, such as our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I won't list all of the problematic provisions here, but I want to \nhighlight a couple of the most troubling. The bill includes billions in \nsubsidies for mature energy industries, including oil and nuclear \npower. These are giveaways of taxpayer money that do nothing to move us \ntoward the next generation of energy technologies. The bill accelerates \nthe siting procedures for liquid natural gas terminals and weakens the \nState role in the process, something I am very concerned about, given \nthe Broadwater proposal looming off the Long Island shores. As ranking \nmember of the Water Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I object to the provisions that exempt hydraulic fracturing \nfrom coverage under the Safe Drinking Water Act and exempt oil and gas \nconstruction sites from stormwater runoff regulations under the Clean \nWater Act. Despite a long-standing moratorium on oil drilling off most \nof the U.S. coast, including the New York coast, the bill authorizes an \ninventory of oil and gas resources there.\n  None of these provisions should be in the bill. But the main reason \nthat I must oppose this bill is that it simply doesn't address the most \npressing and important energy challenges that we face. It is a missed \nopportunity to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, spur the \ndevelopment of renewable resources, and address climate change.\n  While the Senate-passed bill did not go as far as I would like in \nterms of reducing our dependence on foreign oil, it did contain a \nprovision that would reduce U.S. oil consumption by 1 million barrels \nof oil per day by 2015. That was dropped in conference.\n  The Senate bill had a modest provision to increase the percentage of \nelectricity generated from renewable sources to 10 percent by the year \n2020. That, too, was dropped in conference.\n  In addition, the Senate went on record as supporting a mandatory \nprogram to start reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are \ncontributing to climate change. That is gone as well.\n  So as I look at the bill as a whole, I see a major missed \nopportunity. By the President's own admission, this bill won't do \nanything to reduce gasoline prices, but we know for a fact that it will \ngive billions in tax breaks to companies like Exxon Mobil. It doesn't \ndo nearly enough to push the development and commercialization of \nclean, next-generation energy technologies, but it gives huge tax \nbreaks to nuclear power, a technology that has been with us for 50 \nyears. And given what we now know about the looming threat of climate \nchange, it makes no sense to make energy policy without integrating a \ncost-effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But that is \nexactly what this bill does.\n  In short, this bill simply misses the mark. It ignores our biggest \nenergy challenges, subsidizes mature energy industries like oil and \nnuclear, and rolls back our environmental laws. I know it will pass \ntoday, but I will not be voting for it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to share my views on the final \nEnergy bill conference report now before us. I regret that I will be \nunable to support this legislation, and I will explain my substantive \nconcerns about the bill in greater detail. But, first, I want to \ncomment on the process that brought us to this point because the \nprocess has been very different than the last energy conference report.\n  The last energy conference report to come before the Senate in the \n108th Congress contained more than 100 provisions in the jurisdiction \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee. In my role as the \nranking member, I came to the floor to share with the Senate that the \nEPW Committee was not consulted in the development of any of those \nprovisions.\n  That closed-door process did not occur with this conference report, \nand I believe that was due to the efforts of Senators Domenici and \nBingaman. Though neither Senator Inhofe nor I were conferees, we were \napprized of conference discussions. Our staff reviewed and provided \ntechnical assistance on provisions. For example, we agreed to revise \nthe House's nuclear title to incorporate three nuclear bills reported \nby the Environment and Public Works Committee. We also worked closely \non the ethanol provisions, given their implications for the Clean Air \nAct.\n  The Senators from New Mexico worked hard to limit the items in the \nconference report in the EPW Committee's jurisdiction. They faced a \nvery uphill task. The House bill had many troubling environmental \nprovisions that were strongly supported by House conferees. \nUnfortunately, though, many troubling environmental provisions were \nremoved during conference negotiations, several provisions of concern \nto me and to several other Democratic members of the EPW Committee \nremain in the final conference report.\n  I say all this to make clear to the Senate that I am not opposing \nthis bill on process, but on policy. It contains bad environmental \npolicy. It is a missed opportunity with respect to our energy policy. \nIt contains the wrong fiscal priorities with $80 billion in giveaways \nto the oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries. And, for those reasons, \nI feel it is not the right energy policy for America today, and \ncertainly not for the future.\n  I am deeply concerned that the conference report before us does not \nrepresent the kind of forward looking, balanced energy policy that our \nNation needs. It does not go far enough in reducing our country's \nreliance on imported oil. Provisions to set a goal to curb our Nation's \noil use, overwhelmingly supported in the Senate, were defeated. \nProvisions in the Senate bill to set a national goal to obtain 10 \npercent of our Nation's electricity from renewable sources were also \nstripped in the conference.\n  I have spent my congressional career promoting the use of renewable \nenergy in our country. This Nation has abundant renewable energy \nsources, from wind to animal methane to geothermal, in every State, and \nit is in our economic and environmental interest to use them. It is \nvery disappointing to me, as we stand here on the threshold of passing \nan energy bill that will likely serve as our country's energy policy \nwell into the next decade, that many of the same polluting coal-fired \npower plants that were operating when I came to Congress are still \noperating without modern pollution controls. Though this conference \nreport takes an important step by asking the Federal agencies to get \nroughly 8 percent of their energy from renewable sources in 2020, this \nshould have been an economy-wide goal.\n  It also fails to substantively address many other important issues, \nsuch as climate change and the need to improve vehicle fuel economy to \ngive consumers more affordable and less-polluting choices when they buy \ntheir family's next automobile.\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\n  But worst of all, this bill seriously harms the environment. During \nthe conference, along with the majority of Senate Environment Committee \nminority colleagues, I wrote the conferees listing six of what I \nbelieved to be the most troubling environmental provisions of the \nHouse-passed bill. Several remain in this bill.\n  I am disappointed that the renewable fuels provisions in the \nconference report continue to differ significantly from the provisions \nthat were reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee in the \nlast three Congresses. The provisions that my committee reported were \nthe ones contained in the energy legislation that the Senate passed \nthis year and last year.\n  Though we know methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, is \nenvironmentally harmful, the conference report does not phase out its \nuse.\n  The Senate bill would have phased out MTBE use nationwide over 4 \nyears. The conference report contains no such ban. In addition, \ncritical language allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to \npull future gasoline additives off the market if they caused water \npollution problems was eliminated.\n  The conferees have included language similar to a provision in the \nHouse-passed bill that exempts oil and gas exploration and production \nactivities from the Clean Water Act storm water program.\n  The Clean Water Act requires permits for storm water discharges \nassociated with construction. The conference report changes the act to \nexempt oil and gas construction from these permits.\n  The scope of the provision is extremely broad. Storm water runoff \ntypically contains pollutants such as oil and grease, chemicals, \nnutrients, metals, bacteria, and particulates.\n  According to EPA estimates, this change would exempt at least 30,000 \nsmall oil and gas sites from clean water requirements. In addition, \nevery construction site in the oil and gas industry larger than 5 acres \nare exempt from permit requirements. Some of those sites have held \npermits for 10 years or more. This is a terrible rollback of current \nlaw and an unneccessary one. These permits have not been hampering \nproduction by these drilling sites, but they do protect the fragile \nwater resources around them.\n  Section 327 of this conference report exempts the practice of \nhydraulic fracturing to extract coalbed methane from the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. This practice involves injecting a fluid under pressure into \nthe ground in order to create fractures in rock and capture methane.\n  The primary risk with hydraulic fracturing is drinking water \ncontamination that occurs when fluids used to fracture the rock remains \nin the ground and reach underground sources of drinking water. \nAccording to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, approximately \nhalf of the U.S. population obtains its drinking water from underground \nwater sources. In rural areas, this percentage rises to 95 percent. In \nits June 2004 study, the EPA reported studies showing that 18-65 \npercent of injected chemicals can remain stranded in hydraulically \nfractured formations.\n  This is wrong. The American people do not want enhanced energy \nproduction at the expense of the environment, particularly if it \njeopardizes their drinking water wells.\n  And, they also do not want enhanced energy production at the expense \nof their own pocketbook, especially in these times of high energy \nprices. This bill contains several very costly provisions that are more \nof a giveaway to energy companies than a guarantee of new energy for \nthe American people. One of the most concerning of these are new \nprovisions that provide risk insurance for the construction of six new \nnuclear power plants.\n  Now, I agree that siting an energy project is a risky and time-\nconsuming investment. But this provision, in my view, goes too far. \nThis provision would allow the Secretary of Energy to enter into a \ncontract with private interests for the construction of six advanced \nnuclear reactors. Further, it authorizes the payment of costs to those \nprivate interests for delays in the full operation of these facilities.\n  The payments are up to 100 percent of the delay costs, or a total of \n$500 million each for the first two facilities. The next four plants \nwould get a payment of up to 50 percent of the delay costs, up to a \ntotal of $250 million for each facility. This is a total of $2 billion.\n  The ``delays'' for which private interests can be compensated include \nthe inability of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to comply with \nschedules that it sets for the reviews and inspections of these \nfacilities.\n  If the NRC finishes its work on time, but the full operation of one \nof these facilities is delayed by parties exercising their democratic \nright to seek judicial review to ensure the safe operation of a nuclear \nfacility in their community, the plant owners can be compensated while \nthe case is litigated.\n  Nuclear powerplants are large capital investments and risky \ninvestments. But so are other energy projects. Just ask anyone who \ndrills for oil, sites a windmill, or seeks to deploy a new energy \ntechnology. We do not provide any other type of energy facility this \ntype of guarantee. And what a guarantee, while the Federal Government \nprocesses your permit, or if the Federal Government gets sued, the \ntaxpayers will pay you, not for generating energy but for doing \nnothing.\n  This is an enormous Federal spending commitment, and one we really \nare not likely to be able to afford. The intent really is to put \npressure on the NRC to approve these new reactors and get them on line. \nIf that is our intent, we should do so without obligating taxpayers to \npay for the appropriate process to get them sited and built.\n  I also am disappointed that the recycling tax credit provisions I \nauthored to preserve and expand America's recycling infrastructure were \nstripped from the final bill. In a bill that provides $14.5 billion in \ntax incentives for energy production, these modest provisions would \nhave gone a long way to encourage energy savings and job creation \nthrough investment in state-of-the-art recycling technology.\n  In conclusion I try not to support legislation that exploits our \nnatural resources and pollutes our environment. This bill contains too \nmany provisions that represent real departure from current \nenvironmental law and practice to garner my support. Other Senators who \nbelieve that we can obtain energy security for America while preserving \nour environment should vote no as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some additional materials clarifying my \nviews on several bill provisions in the jurisdiction of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Additional Views of Senator Jeffords on the Conference Report \n           Accompanying H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2005\n\n       Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as I indicated to the Senate \n     in my remarks, this conference report fails to properly \n     balance the need for energy exploration and production with \n     important environmental and conservation concerns. There are \n     a number of environmental provisions in this bill that were \n     either considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee or are in the jurisdiction of that Committee, on \n     which I serve as Ranking Member. Given that the conference \n     report contains no detailed statement by the conferees \n     regarding how these provisions are to be implemented by the \n     relevant federal agencies, I felt it important to provide \n     additional comment on these provisions to serve as \n     legislative history.\n\n\n            MTBE and Motor Vehicle Fuels and Fuel Additives\n\n       The conference report fails to ban methyl tertiary butyl \n     ether (MTBE), an important and constant element of the Senate \n     bill reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee \n     in the 109th Congress. While I am pleased that an MTBE \n     liability waiver is not included in this bill, I am concerned \n     that MTBE will continue to be used in gasoline, leak from \n     underground storage tanks and continue to pose significant \n     and costly drinking water problems.\n       The elimination of the oxygen-content requirement for \n     reformulated gasoline and the new ethanol mandate (Section \n     1504) may result in oil companies reducing the amount of MTBE \n     used, but it is unlikely to eliminate its use entirely since \n     it was used as an octane enhancer and anti-knock agent by \n     petroleum refiners long before the Clean Air Act requirements \n     of 1990. The continued use of MTBE in gasoline means that \n     drinking water supplies will continue to be in jeopardy. \n     Therefore, the Environmental Protection Agency and state \n     regulatory agencies should continue with their efforts to ban \n     and limit the use of MTBE.\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\n       I am pleased to see that the bill includes several \n     provisions from the bill, S. 606, which was reported out of \n     the Environment and Public Works Committee, that are intended \n     to protect public health and the environment. Perhaps most \n     important of these is the toxics anti-backsliding language to \n     ensure that the elimination of the oxygenate requirement and \n     the growing number of States' MTBE bans will not encourage \n     refiners to use toxic replacement materials. The baseline \n     against performance is judged is set at the average of the \n     years 2001 and 2002, though EPA has evidence of continued \n     improvement in toxics reduction performance in later years. \n     Thus, setting a baseline even a few years old may allow \n     refiners to backslide on performance and increase toxic air \n     emissions from fuels.\n       For unknown reasons, the conferees failed to adopt an \n     important Senate provision that would prevent MTBE-like water \n     contamination problems from occurring in the future. As was \n     recommended in 1999, by the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates \n     in Gasoline, the Senate provided EPA the clear authority \n     under the Clean Air Act to regulate fuels and fuel additives \n     due to their impact on water quality and resources. Sadly, we \n     will be doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past on into the \n     future, because the conferees have apparently not learned \n     enough from the $25-85 billion remediation costs facing \n     municipal and residential water systems around the country.\n       Another Senate bill improvement to current law which was \n     retained in the conference report was making EPA regularly \n     require manufacturers registering fuels or fuel additives to \n     conduct tests publicly to determine public health and \n     environmental effects before registration and use. The report \n     also requires EPA within two years of enactment to conduct a \n     study of the effects on air and water and sensitive \n     subpopulations of fuel additives (Section 1505). Today there \n     are a dozen or so different types of fuel additives and \n     little is known about the toxicological effects of these \n     chemicals on human health and the environment. These studies \n     will help us better understand where MTBE and other fuel \n     additives have leaked and contaminated water resources and \n     how these chemicals are affecting our nation's water \n     resources.\n       As in the Senate bill, the conference report provides that \n     EPA must update its complex emissions model to reflect \n     vehicles in the motor vehicle fleet from the 1990 baseline to \n     a more accurate 2007 fleet, and study the permeation effects \n     of increased ethanol use on evaporative emissions. \n     Unfortunately, in section 1513, the conferees opted for the \n     less protective House provision on blending and comingling.\n       The Senate bill, consistent with the recommendations of the \n     Government Accountability Office June 2005 report on \n     ``Gasoline Markets,'' directs EPA to study the air quality \n     and public health impacts of reducing the number of fuel \n     formulations in the market, as well as looking the effects on \n     refiners and gasoline supply and price. This report is due in \n     mid-2008. The conferees wisely included this useful provision \n     in the report, which will provide the information necessary \n     for EPA, the States and Congress to eventually make sound \n     judgments about reducing the number of fuel formulations. \n     However, the conference report also includes an illogical and \n     unnecessarily complex system in section 1541 for limiting the \n     fuel formulations in advance of data to be collected pursuant \n     to the Senate report and the GAO recommendation. That same \n     section also provides unnecessarily expansive and confusing \n     waiver authority for the Administrator to allow increases in \n     pollution from fuels and fuel additives.\n\n\n                            Coal (Title IV)\n\n       This bill authorizes $3 billion in grants and loans through \n     the Department of Energy and $2.9 billion in tax credits to \n     assist coal-fired power plant owners in installing more \n     modern pollution control equipment and to develop better \n     control technologies. Unfortunately, most of these funds are \n     not directed at truly advanced and significantly cleaner and \n     more efficient electricity generation from coal. As a result, \n     taxpayers will be heavily subsidizing only incremental \n     improvements, rather than the substantial and radical \n     improvements that need to be made in thermal efficiency to \n     combat global warming and in state-of-the art technology to \n     reduce other harmful air pollutants, like mercury, ozone, and \n     particulate matter. This Title will not prepare the United \n     States to live up to its responsibility to be a global \n     leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our \n     heavily coal-based electricity-generating base.\n\n\n       Underground Storage Tank Compliance (Title 15, Subtitle B)\n\n       Leaking underground storage tanks present a significant \n     threat to drinking water supplies nationwide. EPA estimates \n     that there are approximately 150,000 leaking underground \n     storage tanks currently needing cleanup. While I feel that \n     the twenty-year old law needs more comprehensive changes, I \n     am pleased with many of the underground storage tank \n     provision included in this bill.\n       This bill will for the first time set a mandatory \n     inspection frequency for all federally regulated underground \n     storage tanks. Unfortunately, this requirement falls short of \n     the every two-year inspection requirement unanimously \n     approved by the Senate in the 108th Congress. Instead, tanks \n     that were last inspected in 1999 may be able to evade re-\n     inspection until 2010 or 2011. EPA believes tanks should be \n     inspected at least once every three years to minimize the \n     environmental damage caused by undetected leaks. I encourage \n     EPA and the states to meet the three-year inspection \n     frequency upon enactment of this legislation.\n       I am pleased with the increased authorization provided from \n     the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund and \n     the flexibility given to EPA and the states to use the money \n     not just for cleanups but also for compliance activities. \n     Increased authorization is meaningless, however, unless the \n     President and Congress fulfill their responsibilities to \n     appropriate adequate resources to carry out these activities. \n     To ensure that adequate money is provided in the future, I \n     encourage EPA to work with the states to improve data \n     collection to demonstrate the public health and environmental \n     benefits of increased funding.\n       The bill contains an important new provision to protect \n     groundwater by requiring secondary containment of new tanks \n     within 1,000 feet for a community water system or potable \n     drinking water well. I'm concerned, however, about an \n     exemption from this modest secondary containment provision \n     that allows owners and operators to install underground tanks \n     without secondary containment if the manufacturer and \n     installer of the new tank system maintain evidence of \n     financial responsibility to pay for cleaning up a potential \n     spill. This exemption foolishly emphasizes cleanup over leak \n     prevention. In addition, this financial responsibility \n     requirement is likely to lead to delayed cleanups while \n     owners, manufacturers and installers fight in court over who \n     is responsible for the leak.\n       EPA and the states should work closely to encourage owners \n     and operators of underground storage tanks to opt for the \n     secondary containment of new underground storage tank systems \n     rather than face potential legal complications in the future \n     when the less protective systems leak. EPA should also work \n     with the states and owners and operators to identify whether \n     this provision results in litigation or delays cleanups and \n     to identify, address and share information about common \n     manufacturing and installation problems with the states and \n     other owners and operators.\n       I also question the wisdom of limiting the secondary \n     containment requirement to systems within 1,000 feet of a \n     community water system or potable drinking water well as \n     leaks, especially MTBE, which quickly moves beyond 1,000 feet \n     radius of the facility. A broader provision requiring \n     secondary containment on all new tanks has proven very \n     effective in Vermont. EPA and the states should carefully \n     identify all potable drinking water sources in these areas \n     and monitor whether the 1,000 feet radius is adequate to \n     protect public health.\n\n\n   Western Michigan (Title IX Research and Development--Section 996)\n\n       Hidden as a demonstration project in the Research and \n     Development Title is a provision that provides an exemption \n     from any new specifically ozone-related requirement or \n     sanctions under the Clean Air Act for counties in \n     southwestern Michigan that have been designated as non-\n     attainment for the 8-hour ozone standard. These areas are not \n     given a free pass from any existing Federal or State \n     requirement or enforcement of such existing requirement, \n     including any that the counties may face as ozone maintenance \n     areas or as part of any conditions in the state's ozone \n     implementation plan in place at the time of enactment of this \n     Act. No pollution source in those counties is provided any \n     exemption of any kind from requirements or sanctions related \n     to any other pollutant except as it directly relates to \n     ozone.\n       The two-year hiatus in enforcement or application of new \n     requirements is unwisely provided to several counties with \n     large populations that are contributing to or causing \n     nonattainment in areas downwind from those counties. This is \n     in direct contradiction to the purposes of the Clean Air Act, \n     particularly as amended in 1990, which recognize the need for \n     all states and areas to be sensitive to the transported \n     pollution that they inflict on downwind areas. The Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, which has \n     jurisdiction over matters such as this and on which I serve \n     as the ranking member, has never had a hearing on this \n     provision, nor would I have supported such a broad and poorly \n     drafted temporary exemption.\n       I expect that in the ``demonstration'' project process over \n     the next two years, EPA and the Governor of Michigan will not \n     only assess the difficulties such areas may experience in \n     meeting the 8-hour ozone standard because of transported \n     ozone pollution, but also the extent of the downwind damage \n     and pollution caused by this ``demonstration'' project \n     exemption and the adequacy of the EPA's SIP review process \n     under section 110(a)(2). In addition, I would note for any \n     electric generating unit or any similar major stationary \n     source in these counties, that the ``demonstration'' period \n     designation does not permit evasion of existing New Source \n     Performance Standard requirements in these counties or any \n     other such programs.\n\n\n    Refinery Revitalization (Title III Oil and Gas--Section 391/392)\n\n       I refute the implication in the findings that environmental \n     regulations have limited the U.S. refining capacity. \n     Therefore, I find the Refining Revitalization provisions in\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\n     this bill to streamline environmental permitting unnecessary, \n     preferential treatment for the oil and gas industry.\n       While it is true that 175 refineries closed in the last 22 \n     years and no new refineries opened, it is also true that at \n     the same time refining capacity has grown steadily from 6.2 \n     billion to 8.2 billion barrels per day. In fact, the Energy \n     Information Administration earlier this year projected that \n     refining capacity will increase and that refining costs are \n     expected to remain stable or decline.\n       Despite industry attempts to cut costs and achieve greater \n     efficiencies through rampant mergers--over 2,600 oil \n     companies merged in the 1990s--low returns on investment \n     inhibited expansion in the refinery sector, not overly \n     burdensome environmental regulations.\n       Proponents of streamlining environmental permitting argue \n     that a large number of closed or idle refineries seeking to \n     reopen are having difficulties obtaining environmental \n     permits. Yet, neither EPA nor the states currently have \n     permits pending to restart refineries.\n       To address this perceived problem, this energy bill \n     encourages Governors to request that EPA and the state \n     regulatory agencies streamline environmental permitting by \n     accepting consolidated permit applications and tells EPA to \n     find ways to better coordinate among state and federal \n     agencies and to provide additional financial assistance, \n     without providing EPA and the states additional resources to \n     accomplish this task. I am also concerned that this focus on \n     refinery permitting without additional resources will be done \n     at the expense of other important environmental priorities. \n     Refineries are getting preferential treatment that other \n     energy sectors will not be getting and just another example \n     of how this bill is just a transfer of taxpayer dollars to \n     the wealthiest energy companies in the country.\n       When submitting its budget for next year, EPA should \n     include a large enough request to ensure that adequate \n     resources will be available to conduct expedited review of \n     new and expanding refinery capacity in the United States. Due \n     to the serious environmental impacts these facilities have on \n     our nation's air and water, EPA and the States must ensure \n     that adequate resources are available at the Federal and \n     State level to conduct expedited, but comprehensive and \n     complete reviews to ensure that the American people are \n     protected from the hazards these facilities present.\n\n\n                        Nuclear Title (Title VI)\n\n       This title adopts the majority of the provisions of Senate \n     Environment and Public Works Committee reported nuclear bills \n     in the 109th Congress: the Nuclear Fees Reauthorization Act \n     of 2005 (S. 858), the Nuclear Safety and Security Act of 2005 \n     (S. 864) and the Price Anderson Amendments Act of 2005 (S. \n     865).\n       In particular, Section 651 of the conference report \n     includes provisions of S. 864 that would regulate \n     accelerator-produced material, discrete sources of radium-\n     226, and discrete sources of naturally occurring radioactive \n     material (NORM) under the Atomic Energy Act. The section does \n     so because these materials pose a ``dirty bomb'' risk. There \n     is wide agreement that radium, accelerator-produced materials \n     and naturally occurring radioactive materials could be used \n     in a dirty bomb and therefore should be regulated by the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Even so, some have raised \n     questions about why we need to address the disposal of these \n     materials in the conference report.\n       The conference report addresses the waste disposal issue \n     because some of the materials which are not now regulated \n     under the Atomic Energy Act can currently be disposed of \n     under the authority of Acts such as the Resource Conservation \n     and Recovery Act, as long as their activity levels are \n     sufficiently low. Since the provisions agreed to by the \n     conferees place these materials under the jurisdiction of the \n     Atomic Energy Act, they would no longer be able to be \n     disposed of under the authority of Acts such as the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act without the additional \n     provisions we included in the language.\n       Though the conferees included this language, neither the \n     NRC nor the Environmental Protection Agency and the states \n     should conclude that the intent of the disposal provisions is \n     to expand or alter the waste disposal requirements associated \n     with these materials. This language is not intended to alter \n     current disposal practices in any way, but is rather intended \n     only to preserve the disposal options that are currently \n     available under existing authority for this material.\n       In all discussions with the conferees, it was my intent \n     that these provisions to remain neutral on the issue of waste \n     disposal, and to ensure that there are no new restrictions \n     and no new authorities granted by this language. To make it \n     clear, these provisions would in no way result in granting \n     new authority for materials that are currently regulated \n     under the Atomic Energy Act to be disposed of in facilities \n     not licensed to accept radioactive waste by the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission or an Agreement State under the Low \n     Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (LLRWPA).\n       Bringing accelerator-produced material, discrete sources of \n     Radium-226, and discrete sources of naturally occurring \n     radioactive material (NORM) under the Atomic Energy Act \n     because they pose a dirty bomb risk, without making special \n     provision for their disposal, would mean that in accordance \n     with the LLRWPA, as amended, these materials would have to be \n     disposed of at low-level radioactive waste disposal \n     facilities licensed by either the NRC or an Agreement State. \n     Because of interstate import and export restrictions adopted \n     by compacts under the LLRWPA, bringing radium 226, \n     accelerator-produced materials and NORM under the \n     jurisdiction of the Atomic Energy Act could eliminate for \n     generators in the majority of States a disposal capability \n     for these materials that is currently available to and being \n     used by generators across the nation. In addition, regulating \n     these materials under the Atomic Energy Act might result in \n     making any Act that excludes Atomic Energy Act material from \n     the Act's coverage (such as the Solid Waste Disposal Act, \n     popularly referred to as the Resource Conservation and \n     Recovery Act (RCRA)) inapplicable. These provisions are \n     intended only to preserve the disposal options that are \n     currently available under existing authority for this \n     material, such as those that are available under the \n     authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, \n     and would not affect the disposal of Atomic Energy Act \n     materials not covered by this section.\n\n\n               Hydraulic Fracturing Title III/Section 327\n\n       By excluding hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \n     underground injection, Section 327 changes how the \n     Environmental Protection Agency can regulate this practice \n     under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Hydraulic fracturing \n     involves injecting diesel fuel or potentially hazardous \n     substances such as benzene, toluene, and MTBE underground to \n     fracture rock and release oil and gas. It is clear this \n     language allows the EPA to restrict the use of diesel as a \n     hydraulic fracturing fluid, and the agency should continue to \n     use its existing authorities under the Clean Water Act and \n     the Safe Drinking Water Act to reduce loadings of these \n     pollutants associated with these activities from reaching \n     surface and drinking water.\n       Hydraulic fracturing has historically been performed in \n     very deep wells. Today, it is also used in coalbed methane \n     extraction that occurs at much shallower depths. This \n     practice leaves hazardous substances in the ground that leach \n     into groundwater and jeopardize drinking water. Groundwater \n     provides drinking water for half the U.S. population. In \n     rural areas, 95 percent of drinking water comes from \n     groundwater.\n       More than 167,000 oil and gas-related injection wells are \n     currently regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act and \n     pose no impediment to oil and gas production. As they \n     implement this regulation, EPA and the States should continue \n     to monitor these activities to ensure that drinking water \n     sources are protected and report to Congress and the public \n     all incidences where harmful chemicals from hydraulic \n     fracturing leach into drinking water sources.\n\n\n                   Stormwater (Title III/Section 328)\n\n       Title III of the conference report also changes how the \n     Environmental Protection Agency is able to regulate oil and \n     gas construction activities under the Phase I and Phase II of \n     the Clean Water Act Stormwater Program. Since 1990, the Phase \n     I Stormwater Program has required permit coverage for large \n     municipal separate stormwater systems and 11 categories of \n     industrial discharges, including large construction sites \n     disturbing five or more acres of land. In 2005, GAO reported \n     that over a one-year period, in three of the six largest oil \n     and gas producing states, 433 oil and gas construction \n     activities obtained Phase I Stormwater Permits. Some of those \n     sites have held permits for ten years or more.\n       Phase II of the program, adopted in 1999, requires permits \n     for small municipal separate stormwater systems and \n     construction sites affecting one to five acres of land. EPA \n     extended the Phase II permitting deadline, originally March \n     10, 2003, to June 12, 2006 for just the oil and gas industry. \n     EPA's rationale was that it needed more time to complete its \n     legal and economic analysis of the rule.\n       The water quality implications from exempting the oil and \n     gas industry from stormwater permitting are significant. Over \n     a short period of time, storm water runoff from construction \n     site activity can contribute more harmful pollutants, \n     including sediment, into rivers, lakes, and streams than had \n     been deposited over several decades. Sediment clouds water, \n     decreases photosynthetic activity, reduces the viability of \n     aquatic plants and animals; and can ultimately destroy \n     animals and their habitat. These permits have not been \n     hampering production by these drilling sites, but they do \n     protect the fragile water resources around them.\n       The EPA should construe any exemption for oil and gas \n     construction activities contained in this conference report \n     as very limited. The agency should continue, as appropriate, \n     to require stormwater discharge permits for oil and gas \n     construction activities that are similar to those performed \n     at other construction sites such as the construction of \n     roads, clearing, grading, and excavating. The Clean Water Act \n     requires that construction sites of all types obtain \n     stormwater discharge permits. When oil and gas construction \n     activities are similar to other construction activities they \n     should continue to be regulated.\n       Mr. President, it is my hope that I have clarified for my \n     colleagues how these provisions were developed and the effect \n     of these provisions on the environment. It is my hope\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\n     that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency will review and incorporate my statement as \n     they implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Energy bill \nconference report.\n  For many years, I have supported passage of a comprehensive national \nenergy policy. Such a policy is necessary to reduce our increasing \ndependence on foreign energy sources. A comprehensive energy policy \nwill help lower energy prices in the long run. Furthermore, any far-\nreaching bill will move us toward newer technologies that will keep our \neconomy growing strong while making us more energy independent.\n  Although not perfect, this Energy bill moves us in the right \ndirection. It will expand our electricity transmission system and make \nit more reliable. The bill contains incentives for renewable energy, \nincluding the renewable energy production tax credit that I helped \ninclude. It will also spur an increase the production and use of \ndomestic biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Because of this bill, \nour coal-burning plants will improve their efficiency and emit less \npollution. Finally, the bill provides needed incentives to increase \nnatural gas infrastructure, measures that will lead to lower prices for \nnatural gas consumers in the long run.\n  Equally important, this bill benefits North Dakota for a number of \nreasons. The transmission incentives will enable my State's power \nproducers to export electricity to distant markets. In this way, \ntransmission incentives benefit the lignite and wind energy sectors in \nmy State. The clean coal production incentives will make it easier to \nbuild advanced clean coal power plants. The inclusion of the wind \nenergy production tax credit will help North Dakota realize its \npotential to be the biggest producer of wind energy in the country. The \nRenewable Fuels Standard and tax incentives for ethanol and biodiesel \nwill aid my State's farm economy, create more jobs, and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. In addition, the bill will assist my state \nin developing exciting new technologies, such as coal-to-liquid fuel \nplants.\n  I believe we still have a lot of work to do in order to make our \nNation less dependent on foreign energy. However, this bill takes \npositive steps to address our energy needs. As I just mentioned, this \nbill will provide significant benefits to my State.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I support the conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 6, the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005.\n  I do so because this bill fails to move us beyond the status quo of \ntoday's energy situation. Congress rarely steps forward to address our \nNation's energy policy, and I believe when we do so we should provide \nreal direction that addresses real problems. Unfortunately, that is not \nthe case here.\n  I voted for the bill as reported by the Senate, but only narrowly. A \nfew provisions in the Senate bill attempted to address our need to \npromote renewable energy resources and decrease our consumption of \nforeign oil. Those few forward-looking provisions have been dropped \nfrom this final bill, leaving me with little choice but to vote no for \nour failure to truly provide some new direction to our Nation's energy \npolicy.\n  Crafting comprehensive energy policy should offer the opportunity to \naddress the most difficult issues facing our country. The bulk of this \nbill sidesteps those tough issues and in place of solutions it offers \nbandaids. Moving toward independence from foreign oil should be a top \npriority, but it is not addressed meaningfully.\n  Climate change is a serious issue that Congress simply refuses to \naddress. While some voluntary measures are included, these are simply \nnot enough. We must have meaningful action if we are to protect our \nhealth, environment, and economy of our country.\n  Gone from this bill is the renewable portfolio standard promoted by \nthe Senate. The Senate's provision would have increased the penetration \nof alternative energy sources. This bill also fails to take adequate \nsteps to develop conservation and efficiency technologies, and yet it \noffers substantial subsidies to the fossil fuels industry.\n  This is not the bill I would have written, and this is no longer a \nbill I can support.\n  There are sections of the bill that are positive. For example, I am \npleased that the conference bill contains provisions protecting the \nPacific Northwest's electricity system from unwarranted interference by \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, and protects Washington \nratepayers from excessively high electricity rates. I am also pleased \nthat the current bill contains a fair and balanced hydroelectric \nrelicensing process and sets new grid reliability standards. I commend \nmy colleague, Senator Cantwell, who championed Washington State \ninterests.\n  This bill in particular supports cutting edge research and \ndevelopment at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Washington \nState universities in the areas of smart energy, advanced scientific \ncomputing, and systems biology.\n  I am equally pleased to see that the bill does not provide MTBE \nliability protections.\n  As the world's leading energy consumer, the United States should lead \nby example and innovation. However, this bill stops short of taking \ncommonsense measures that would truly reduce foreign oil dependence and \nmitigate the looming threat of climate change. To diversify energy \nsources in America, fossil fuel use must be offset by conservation, \nenergy efficiency, and clean and renewable fuels.\n  Yet proposals to set ambitious, yet achievable, targets for reduced \noil imports, tighter fuel economies for cars and trucks were defeated. \nInstead, oil and gas companies will be allowed to scour our fragile \ncoastlines for more oil and gas reserves. Furthermore, this bill awards \nmultimillion dollar tax breaks to those same companies, which are \nreaping windfalls from record-high oil prices at the expense of \nWashington consumers, to continue us down the path of fossil fuels, \nwhich are a key contributor to climate change. This bill also rolls \nback significant clean water laws that keep our water safe to drink.\n  Despite ample protections for Washington ratepayers, it is hard to \nignore that this bill, this national energy blueprint, does absolutely \nnothing to improve energy security or reduce dependence on foreign oil. \nWe need a national energy policy but one that acknowledges the needs \nfor the future, sets a plan, and moves us forward, not a bill that \ndelivers the status quo.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today the Senate is poised to pass the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005, the most sweeping comprehensive Energy bill \nin over a decade. We need a comprehensive set of policies to attack the \nenergy crunch facing Americans on multiple fronts.\n  Electricity systems on the West Coast are strained as electrical \ntransmission lines lack capacity and interconnection to move power \nthroughout regions. The dependence of our economy on foreign sources of \nenergy continues to climb unabated, with close to 60 percent of the oil \nused to power the economy originating from foreign ports and oil \nfields.\n  As a Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nas Member of the conference committee charged with hammering out an \nagreement, I have steered my colleagues in the House and in the Senate \nto look toward the Heartland as a rich land ready to contribute to our \nenergy security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 incorporates many of the \nideas I have long championed to spring forward South Dakota and the \nGreat Plains as a key future energy producer.\n  First and foremost, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 establishes a \nrobust Renewable Fuel Standard that will lessen imports of foreign \nsources of energy and encourage the use of clean-burning renewable \nfuels.\n  Beginning in 2006, the Energy bill establishes a robust renewable \nfuels standard requiring refiners to blend 4 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel. That standard would be \nincreased over the next several years until 2012, when refiners would \nbe required to blend a total of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels.\n  Just in South Dakota alone, over 8000 farm families are invested in \nethanol facilities through direct deliveries of corn or in more \nindirect paths, such as equity shares. The Nation's economy will get a \nsignificant and positive boost from enactment of the RFS.\n  There are several other provisions in the bill that bring South \nDakota's\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\nstrength to solving the Nation's energy challenges.\n  Key tax incentives included in the final version of the Energy bill \nextend the tax credit for small ethanol producers and expand the \neligibility of that credit to plants with an annual capacity of up to \n60 million gallons is a major victory.\n  The conference report also provides incentives for bio-diesel. \nEthanol is not the only renewable fuel that can be produced in the \nUnited States soybean-based bio-diesel holds great promise for use in \nthe Nation's fuel supply.\n  We focused also on tapping wind energy resources by extending for 2 \nadditional years the production tax credit for wind energy facilities. \nThe production tax credit is a tool used by developers of wind energy \nprojects, such as the wind energy farm near Highmore, SD.\n  One final tax provision that I feel holds particular promise is the \nauthorization of $800 million in tax credit bonds to finance the \nconstruction of renewable energy projects by not-for-profit utilities \nand rural electric cooperatives.\n  I have heard from dozens of electric cooperative and municipal \nutilities that want to undertake the construction of wind energy \nprojects. However, until this bill, these non-profit entities were \nexcluded from some of the incentives provided for Investor-Owned \nUtilities pursuing similar renewable energy projects. Now, rural \ncooperatives can finance, construct, and operate clean energy projects, \nsuch as wind turbines and geo-thermal facilities.\n  The conference report does not include what I believe is an important \nprovision to set benchmarks and targets for producing electricity from \nrenewable energy resources. Like a renewable fuels standard, a \nrenewable portfolio standard would not only reduce the use of fossil \nfuel sources, but increase economic activity in South Dakota through \nwind energy and biomass projects.\n  A modest renewable portfolio standard of 5 or 10 percent is \nachievable and can be done without increasing retail electricity rates. \nThe benefits of balancing traditional energy sources, such as coal, \nnuclear, and natural gas, with new technologies will reduce air \nemissions and spur the creation of jobs in developing energy technology \nsectors. I include clean coal technologies, such as Integrated \nGasification Combined-Cycle as an emerging clean coal technology that \nalong with wind and geothermal plants hold the promise of producing \nclean-burning electricity.\n  As Congress and the States and cities move forward on addressing the \nenergy challenges of the 21st Century, policy-makers and industry \nleaders can lose sight and leave behind developing renewable energy \nsources. As the Nation and world strain finite fossil fuel resources \nthe need to bring on-line these technologies will only become more \nacute and practical.\n  I intend to vote for the Energy Policy Act of 2005. As a Member of \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am proud of the \njob we did in fashioning a bill that will make strong strides forward \nin tackling the disparate parts of energy supply, transmission, and \ndistribution. The bill also holds strong promise for making South \nDakota a substantial energy producer of clean energy and renewable \nfuels. I urge my colleagues to support the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Domenici and \nBingaman for their efforts in securing an energy bill that retains many \nfeatures important to the Senate. Had I been present for the final vote \non the Senate bill 1 month ago, a vote I missed because of the passing \nof my mother, I would have voted ``yes'' because I believed that the \nSenate bill took positive early steps toward development of a \ncomprehensive energy policy, including an important initiative for \nrenewable energy development.\n  I consulted urgently with Senator Bingaman during the House-Senate \nConference on an issue that was put before the conferees by the House \nthat would have undermined the Clean Air Act and worsened air pollution \nin Connecticut and a number of other States. Senator Bingaman was able \nto keep that proposal out of the conference report and I thank him for \nthat. I learned, through that bit of first-hand experience, how hard \nboth Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman worked to keep faith with \nthe Senate in producing a conference report that reflected some of the \nSenate's chief concerns. For that I believe we owe them both a debt of \ngratitude.\n  Senators Bingaman and Domenici are to be commended for recognizing \nthe deep concerns that public officials across New England have about \nthe LICAP proposal and for including a sense-of-the-Congress resolution \nin the bill directing FERC to reevaluate this proposal in light of \ntheir concerns. I note that the sense-of-the-Congress resolution \nspecifically draws to FERC's attention the objections of all six of New \nEngland's governors--both Democrats and Republicans.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters, from those \ngovernors to the Chairman of FERC expressing their objections to LICAP, \nbe inserted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I cannot emphasize enough the need for FERC to \nreconsider this deeply flawed proposal--a proposal that would cost New \nEngland ratepayers more than $12 billion over the next 5 years. The \ngovernors rightly argue that there are much more cost-effective \nalternatives to achieving the goal of ensuring our region of the \ncountry has adequate electricity that FERC should consider. And I am \npleased that conference report directs FERC to address the governors' \nobjections and recommendations.\n  While I am disappointed with many of the changes made in the final \nversion of the bill emerging from conference, and feel that we are \nstill far from developing the bold national energy policy we so \nurgently need, I am voting ``yes'' today because this bill at least \nstarts the process of changing the status quo.\n  Still, it is my strong hope that having addressed issues of \nconventional energy supply through this legislation, we will turn, in \nthe very near future, our urgent attention to the most pressing \nissues--the clear and inextricable linkage between energy supply and \nnational security, the resulting urgent need for aggressive development \nof a portfolio of alternative and renewable fuels and conservation \nstrategies, and the need to take comprehensive steps to set mandatory \ncaps on greenhouse gas emissions. Solving these problems--and soon--is \na responsibility that we have to today's public as well as our children \nand grandchildren, an obligation that we will not have fulfilled when \nthis legislation passes.\n  When this bill becomes law, new energy efficiency standards for \nappliances will be put into place and businesses, homeowners and \nconsumers will see a range of new incentives to invest in and adopt in \ntheir homes, factories and automobiles, clean technologies, such as \nfuel cells, solar energy, alternative fuel vehicles and hybrids. All \nthis will be done without forcing the Senate and the States to accept a \nnumber of provisions that would have done damage to the environment and \nto the treasuries of State and local governments contending with \ngroundwater contamination, from MTBE. Finally, the bill offers some \nhope that we will get at least a little bit further in developing some \nof the technologies that can help combat climate change. Again, it \nincludes a sense-of-the-Congress resolution regarding LICAP, an issue \nnow important to the State of Connecticut but potentially important to \nus all.\n  There is also good news to be found in what this bill does not do. It \ndoes not include provisions for drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. It avoids rollbacks to the Clean Air Act, rollbacks \nharmful to not just the Northeast, but to all who live and work in \nareas downwind of pollution sources.\n  Despite these positives, I am disappointed by the missed \nopportunities for setting a bold, forward-looking 21st century energy \npolicy. Opportunities to establish a renewable portfolio standard. \nOpportunities to protect the Outer Continental Shelf fully from \npotential exploration and drilling. Opportunities to develop clear \nsteps to reduce our dependence on oil. Opportunities to protect our \ndrinking water from possible contamination by toxic hydraulic \nfracturing fluids. Opportunities to take our first real steps to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this a beginning, and to continue in \nearnest our work to reduce the dependence on oil that is so undermining \nof our national and economic security, to develop alternative and \nrenewable energy sources as well as conservation techniques, and to \naddress the problem of climate change with mandatory steps that are so \nclearly required, as clearly expressed in the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution passed by this body last month.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               The Commonwealth of\n\n\n                                                Massachusetts,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, June 24, 2005.\n     Re ISO-New England LICAP Proposal, Docket No. ER 03-563, \n         NESCOE Petition, Docket No. EL04-112.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Wood, III,\n     Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Wood: As you know, Massachusetts has been \n     closely monitoring the proposal of ISO-New England (ISO-NE) \n     to develop and implement a locational capacity (LICAP) market \n     in the New England region. Recently, my New England \n     colleagues wrote to you on this important issue expressing \n     their concerns, and I want to take this opportunity to do the \n     same.\n       While Massachusetts shares the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission's (FERC) interest in an effective capacity \n     mechanism to secure an adequate supply of electricity to \n     serve our region, it is our view that the LICAP proposal is a \n     broader, more costly approach than is necessary to assure the \n     region's reliability. Cost estimates of the LICAP proposal \n     range from $10 to $13 billion across New England over the \n     next five years, or approximately a 25 percent increase in \n     the energy portion of the average ratepayer's electricity \n     bill--both residential and commercial customers. This figure \n     translates to approximately $6.4 billion over five years for \n     Massachusetts alone, which is simply unacceptable. This type \n     of rate shock will have a detrimental effect on Massachusetts \n     and the region's economy.\n       Massachusetts strongly believes that the ISO-NE has \n     prematurely pursued the development of a LICAP market, rather \n     than first pursuing the development of other solutions that \n     may be less costly for our consumers. The ISO-NE is in the \n     process of developing a locational reserves market to address \n     specific, targeted operating reserve needs that would support \n     fewer required generators. The development of an appropriate \n     capacity market to address regional adequacy issues should be \n     viewed in the context of a regional market plan that \n     considers the existing locational energy market and the \n     development of the locational reserves market, in addition to \n     other contemplated mechanisms. If after the implementation of \n     more cost-effective solutions a resource adequacy issue \n     persists, a further intervention can be developed to solve \n     these problems, while minimizing consumer costs and market \n     disruption.\n       Given the significant cost associated with this issue to \n     our region, it is important that the FERC consider the other \n     proposals currently under development that may in fact \n     provide a more cost effective solution, while ensuring the \n     adequacy of the region's electricity supply. As always, we \n     look forward to working with the FERC on these important \n     matters so that our consumers and businesses are well served \n     by these important policy initiatives.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                      Mitt Romney.\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            New England Governors'\n\n\n                                             Conference, Inc.,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, June 23, 2005.\n     Re ISO New England LICAP Proposal, Docket No. ER 03-563, \n         NESCOE Petition, Docket No. EL04-112.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Wood, III,\n     Chairman, Federal Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Wood: The New England states, through their \n     regulatory agencies, have been litigating the proposal of ISO \n     New England (ISO-NE) to develop and implement a specific type \n     of locational capacity market in the region (LICAP). We share \n     the Commission's interest in an effective capacity mechanism \n     to assure an adequate supply of resources to serve the \n     region's load. It is we governors, after all, on whom \n     citizens ultimately rely to provide for the public health and \n     safety. However, we do not believe that ISO-NE's LICAP \n     proposal is that mechanism. ISO-NE's proposal: (1) does not \n     provide any assurance that needed generation will be built in \n     the right place at the right time; (2) is not linked to any \n     long-term commitment from generators to provide energy; and \n     (3) is extremely expensive for the region. In short, ISO-NE's \n     LICAP is a costly scheme that offers little in terms of true \n     reliability benefits.\n       The Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) recommended decision, \n     issued on June 15th, adopted the ISO's proposal and rejected \n     the arguments of state regulators with little or no \n     discussion of the rationale for rejecting the arguments and \n     despite extensive evidence provided in support of their \n     positions. As you can see, we have serious reservations about \n     the efficacy of the demand curve mechanism, we are alarmed by \n     the financial impact on our citizens and businesses, and we \n     are troubled by the process that was employed to arrive at \n     this result. Accordingly, we are obliged in the best \n     interests of our constituents to oppose this decision.\n       Late last year we answered your invitation and presented a \n     proposal to you for a regional state committee (RSC). Per \n     your suggestion, we identified resource adequacy assurance as \n     a core area of policy leadership we would provide. Many \n     months have passed since we filed our proposal but the \n     Commission has yet to act on the matter. The purpose of this \n     letter is to urge you to defer action on ISO-NE's deeply \n     flawed LICAP proposal, to issue an order authorizing the RSC, \n     and to direct the RSC to develop a proposal that serves the \n     region.\n       Deferring immediate action on ISO-NE's LICAP proposal will \n     not undermine system reliability. Short-term contractual \n     arrangements are available to ensure reliability in any sub-\n     regional zone that may, during peak periods, require \n     additional support. In addition, New England currently has \n     adequate overall capacity and a surplus of generation in some \n     states.\n       ISO-NE's LICAP proposal is only one of many capacity market \n     proposals that could assure long-term resource adequacy in \n     the region. The specific proposal before the Commission is \n     based on an administratively set pricing system that we fear \n     will set capacity charges too high. This fear appears well \n     grounded in light of estimates we have seen that show \n     increased costs in the vicinity of $10 billion for the \n     region's constituents over the next five years. In isolation \n     these numbers are disturbing enough but imposition of LICAP \n     charges of this magnitude on top of the increases we are \n     already experiencing in energy commodity prices will place \n     serious stress on our state economies. Indeed, in Maine alone \n     up to 1,500 jobs could be lost as a result of the decrease in \n     consumer spending resulting from LICAP price shock. In \n     Connecticut, there is a significant risk that large \n     industrial customers will relocate out of state due to the \n     projected massive price increase resulting from the LICAP \n     charge. Given these high cost estimates and the lack of any \n     assurance that new capacity will indeed be built, it is \n     essential to allow the states, through the regional state \n     committee, to fully consider all alternatives to the ISO-NE \n     proposal--something which has not been allowed in the current \n     proceeding.\n       We write today not only to highlight the real world effects \n     that your decision in this case may have on our constituents. \n     As governors of the New England states, we also stand ready \n     to assist the Commission in developing a sensible approach to \n     New England's capacity needs through the vehicle you \n     identified as responsible for formulating resource adequacy \n     policy--namely the RSC. We, through the regional state \n     committee, are prepared to lead.\n       We are hopeful that you will take our concerns to heart by \n     deferring action on this matter until you have permitted the \n     regional state committee to have the opportunity to propose a \n     more effective, less costly approach.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Donald L. Carcieri,\n       Chairman, Rhode Island.\n     Governor John Lynch,\n       New Hampshire.\n     Governor M. Jodi Rell,\n       Connecticut.\n     Governor James H. Douglas,\n       Vermont.\n     Governor John E. Baldacci,\n       Maine.\n                                  ____\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the United States needs an energy plan \nthat balances traditional sources of energy with alternative energy \nsources and conservation. The energy conference report is not a perfect \nbill, but it is the result of true bipartisan compromise that managed \nto put some of the most harmful provisions on the cutting room floor.\n  On balance, I support this bill because it moves us towards a more \nstable, reliable electricity grid, protects our consumers, and includes \nmuch needed investments in renewable sources of energy.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill strengthens the reliability of \nour electricity grid and protects ratepayers from market abuses, \nparticularly in the wake of Enron and the massive blackouts that struck \nparts of the Midwest and Northeast 2 years ago. I am also pleased that \nthe bill reauthorizes the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. This program protects our most vulnerable citizens by assisting \nthem with their heating and cooling bills.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report does not contain many of \nthe most harmful provisions that were included in this legislation in \nthe past. The bill does not allow for drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, ANWR. The bill also does not include provisions that \nwould shield producers of gasoline additives from lawsuits. I strongly \nopposed these provisions in the past and am pleased they are not \nincluded in this bill.\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the bill does contain some questionable environmental \nprovisions. I am also disappointed that the bill does not include \nimportant provisions I supported in the Senate bill, particularly the \nrenewable portfolio standard, steps to deal with global warming, and \nrequirements that would have lessened our dependence on foreign oil.\n  In the end, this is not the bill that the Democrats would have \nwritten. It doesn't address the most pressing issues facing our country \ntoday: sky-high gas prices, global warming, and our growing dependence \non foreign oil. But the bill does take important steps to strengthen \nthe reliability of our electricity grid, protect consumers from market \nabuses, and move us towards greater use of renewable sources of energy. \nThis is just the beginning of a serious debate that will continue in \nthe halls of Congress and in communities all across the country in the \ndays to come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the conference report on \nthe Energy bill. The conference report includes provisions that will \nincrease the diversity of our Nation's fuel supply, encourage \ninvestment in infrastructure and alternative energy technologies, \nincrease domestic energy production, take steps to improve the \nreliability of our electricity supply, and improve energy efficiency \nand conservation. This conference report is far from perfect but on \nbalance it moves toward a sounder energy policy that will lead the way \nto greater energy security and efficiency for the United States.\n  Our policies have long ignored the problem of U.S. dependence on \nforeign oil, and we remain as vulnerable to oil supply disruptions \ntoday as we have been for decades. Taking the steps necessary to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil is an important objective for this \ncountry. We need a long-term, comprehensive energy plan, and I have \nlong supported initiatives that will increase our domestic energy \nsupplies in a responsible manner and provide consumers with affordable \nand reliable energy.\n  There are some positive provisions included in the conference report \nin this regard, particularly those provisions that address energy \nefficiency and will lead us toward greater use of advanced vehicle \ntechnologies and alternative fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. I \nhave also long advocated Federal efforts that will lead to \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technology that will in turn \nhelp us reduce our oil consumption. We need a level of leadership \nsimilar to the effort of a previous generation to put a man on the \nmoon.\n  The conference report includes a wide-range of energy efficiency \nprovisions that will make conservation and efficiency a central \ncomponent of our Nation's energy strategy. These provisions address \nFederal, State, and local energy efficiency programs, provide funding \nfor important programs such as home weatherization, and establish \nefficiency standards for a wide variety of consumer and commercial \nproducts. I am particularly pleased that the conference report \nauthorizes both the weatherization program and the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, at higher levels of funding than the \nCongress has provided in recent years.\n  The conference report takes critical steps to improve the reliability \nof our electrical grid and promote electricity transmission \ninfrastructure development. Our economy depends upon electric power, \nand, in some cases, electric power literally saves lives. Failures in \nthe electric system interrupt many crucial activities, and the need for \nimprovement was underscored painfully by the August 2003 blackout. \nThere were 2 key lessons from the blackout--the need for strong \nregional transmission organizations to ensure that reliability \nstandards are carried out and enforced, and the need for additional \ntransmission upgrades to maintain reliability. I regret that it has \ntaken 2 years to legislate on these issues, but I am pleased that the \nconference report includes the steps necessary to ensure there will be \nmandatory and enforceable reliability standards.\n  The conference report also puts increased emphasis on diversity of \nsupply and includes a range of provisions intended to encourage the use \nof new and cleaner technologies, particularly for power generation. \nNearly 60 percent of electricity generation in Michigan is generated \nfrom coal, which will remain a vital resource well into the future. \nPrograms authorizing research in clean coal-based gasification and \ncombustion technologies will ensure that the most advanced technologies \nare developed for power generation. Other provisions of the conference \nreport also encourage the use of innovative technologies for both power \ngeneration and other end-uses.\n  Increased emphasis on diversity of fuel supply will help to take the \npressure off our tight natural gas supply, which is important for \nStates such as Michigan with a large manufacturing base. Over the past \n6 years, the tight natural gas supply and volatile domestic prices have \nhad significant impacts on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which depends \non natural gas as both a fuel source and a feedstock and raw material \nfor everything from fertilizer to automobile components. As domestic \nproduction of natural gas has declined, demand for natural gas has \nincreased dramatically, particularly in the area of power generation. \nToday, U.S. natural gas prices are the highest in the industrialized \nworld, and many companies have been forced to move their manufacturing \noperations offshore. More than 2 million manufacturing jobs have been \nlost to overseas operations in the 5 years, in part no doubt because \nnatural gas prices jumped from $2 per million Btu to more than $7 per \nmillion Btu.\n\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes significant \nprovisions from the Senate bill for research, development, \ndemonstration and commercialization effort in the area of hydrogen and \nfuel cells. I believe that this program will help us make critical \nstrides toward realizing the goal of putting hydrogen fuel cell \nvehicles on the road over the next 10 to 15 years. The conference \nreport also includes an amendment I offered in the Senate to have the \nNational Academy of Sciences conduct a study and submit a budget \nroadmap to Congress on what level of effort and what types of actions \nwill be required to transition to fuel cell vehicles and a hydrogen \neconomy by 2020. If hydrogen is the right answer, we will need the \nequivalent of a moon shot to get there. We will need a significant \nFederal investment--well beyond anything we are doing today--in \nconjunction with private industry and academia to reach that goal. This \nstudy and roadmap will be an important step toward determining if that \nis the right path to follow.\n  We also need to put greater Federal resources into work on other \nbreakthrough technologies such as advanced hybrid technologies, \nadvanced batteries, advanced clean diesel, and hybrid diesel \ntechnology. Federal Government investment is essential not only in \nresearch and development but also as a mechanism to push the market \ntoward greater use and acceptance of advanced technologies. Expanding \nthe requirements for the Federal Government to purchase advanced \ntechnology vehicles will help provide a market for advanced \ntechnologies. Encouraging and supporting State and local efforts is \nalso important in the effort to push these advanced technologies \nforward. Therefore, I am pleased the conference report includes the \namendment offered by Senator Voinovich in the Senate to authorize $200 \nmillion annually for 5 years to fund Federal and State grant and loan \nprograms that will help us to replace older diesel technology with \nnewer, cleaner diesel technology. These initiatives will help the U.S. \nto develop advanced clean diesel technology, which can make a major \ncontribution toward our meeting stricter emissions standards in a cost-\neffective manner.\n  Finally, the conference report also includes important tax incentives \nfor advanced technology vehicles--including advanced clean diesel, as \nwell as hybrid and fuel cell vehicles--that are critical to encourage \nconsumers to make the investment in these technologies. I would have \nliked for the tax package to have included more generous tax credits \nfor consumers and to have included an investment tax credit to \nmanufacturers to help defray the cost of re-equipping or expanding \nexisting facilities to produce advanced technology vehicles. The tax \nincentives included in the conference report are a modest first step. I \nwill continue to\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\npress for an investment tax credit for manufacturing of advanced \ntechnology vehicles because I believe it is necessary to offset the \nhigh capital costs of such an investment and to ensure that these \nvehicles will be made in the U.S.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes an amendment that I \noffered in the Senate with Senator Collins to direct the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to develop and use cost-effective procedures for \nfilling the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This provision requires \nDOE to consider the price of oil and other market factors when buying \noil for the SPR and to take steps to minimize the program's cost to the \ntaxpayer while maximizing our energy security. Since early 2002, DOE \nhas been acquiring oil for the SPR without regard to the price or \nsupply of oil. During this period the price of oil has been very high--\noften over $30 per barrel--and the oil markets have been tight. Many \nexperts have stated that filling the SPR during the tight oil markets \nover the past several years increased oil prices. With this provision, \nthe conference report directs DOE to use some common sense when buying \noil for the SPR.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report provides at least a \nshort-term approach to some air quality issues in West Michigan. \nInterstate pollution from upwind areas such as Chicago and Gary, has \nresulted in several Michigan counties being designated by the EPA as in \nnonattainment with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This \ninterstate pollution not only has environmental and health \nramifications, but also has economic development implications because \nnonattainment regions are required to comply with more stringent \nregulatory standards. The 2 year respite from these additional \nregulatory provisions for West Michigan counties whose air quality \nproblems were caused by upwind sources will provide temporary \nregulatory relief. However, these counties are still burdened with air \npollution they did not cause. I am hopeful that EPA's 2 year \ndemonstration study of the long-range transport of ozone and ozone \nprecursors required in the Energy bill will provide helpful information \nfor addressing the source of the pollution and result in improved air \nquality for downwind areas. Until the source pollution is addressed, \nWest Michigan will continue to be plagued by pollutants from upwind \nareas. I am hopeful that this study and 2 year delay in regulatory \nrequirements will provide the motivation for addressing the broader \nproblems of interstate air pollution.\n  I am pleased that the conference report contains a ban on future \ndrilling in the Great Lakes. Millions of people rely on the Great Lakes \nfor drinking water, and it is simply irresponsible to risk \ncontamination of this source of drinking water, tourism and recreation. \nPreventing future drilling does not jeopardize more than a minute \namount of our energy supply, and the bill does that for a very good \ncause, which is the protection of one of the world's truly great \nnatural assets, the source of about 20 percent of the world's fresh \nwater.\n  The conference report puts some increased emphasis on renewable \nenergy technologies, such as wind, biomass, and solar power. These \ntechnologies are becoming more economical every year. In fact, in some \nareas of the country these technologies are competitive with \ntraditional fuels such as coal and natural gas. However, I regret that \nthe conference report deleted the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which I \nsupported in the Senate bill that would have pushed the sellers of \nelectricity to obtain 10 percent of their electric supply from \nrenewable energy sources by the year 2020. I believe that these goals \ncould have been met and that an increased use of renewable technologies \nwill both reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lead to the creation \nof tens of thousands of new jobs.\n  I regret that the conference report does not include a comprehensive \neffort to adequately address the impact of global climate change. For \nyears, almost all scientists have agreed that human actions are causing \ntemperatures around the world to increase. Experts also agree that this \nglobal climate change will lead to environmental problems and economic \nhardship, but there has been no consensus in the United States about \nwhat we should do to stop climate change.\n  The threat is real and growing, and the longer we wait to reach a \nreasonable consensus, the more painful the solutions will be. I believe \ntwo major policy changes are needed at the Federal level: support for a \nnew, binding international treaty that includes all countries, and a \nmassive new Federal investment in research, development and \ncommercialization of new technologies. Both of these steps would \nprovide real environmental and economic benefits while being fair to \nAmerican workers. The Senate considered several well-intentioned \nproposals on this issue, though I did not believe they would have taken \nus in a comprehensive direction. I supported a Sense of the Senate \nresolution that acknowledges the problem and calls on the \nadministration to work with the Congress to enact a comprehensive \nnational program to address this issue. I regret that the conference \nreport did not include such a modest provision.\n  Finally, I am disappointed the provision allowing continued export of \nhighly enriched uranium was included in the conference report. The \namendment that Senator Kyl and Senator Schumer offered to strike this \nprovision from the Senate passed bill was adopted by the Senate by \nrollcall vote. It is unfortunate that this provision, which is a \nspecial interest provision, granting relief to one Canadian company was \nreinserted in the final agreement. This provision undermines \nlongstanding U.S. efforts to eliminate highly enriched uranium in \ncommerce, and increases the possibility that highly enriched uranium \ncould be stolen by terrorists and used in a nuclear weapon or \nradiological device.\n  The energy bills considered by the Congress over the last couple of \nyears have been doomed by a heavy-handed, partisan approach. We lost \nvaluable time in putting us on the course toward a sounder energy \npolicy. The conference committee pursued a different approach this \nyear, and as a result, was able to produce a bill with bipartisan \nsupport, which, while far from perfect, on balance, is an improvement \nover current policy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank both the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, for working together in a \nmore open and bipartisan way in developing the bill we are considering \ntoday.\n  While there are many provisions that should be in this bill but \naren't and many other provisions in here that I don't agree with, this \nbill could have been worse. There are numerous extraneous and \nenvironmentally harmful provisions that were in previous energy bills \nbut are not included here. I appreciate both of my colleagues' efforts \nto avoid those pitfalls and produce the Energy bill we are now \nconsidering.\n  However, there remains one very large and glaring omission in this \nbill. While framed as a ``comprehensive national energy policy,'' this \nbill completely ignores the most important energy issues facing \nAmerica, our growing dependence on foreign oil and the impact this \ndependence has on our economic security and national security.\n  I have no doubt that our Republican colleagues will go home and hold \npress conferences claiming victory. They will say that they finally \nbroke through the obstructionism and passed an energy bill that will \nreduce America's dependence on foreign oil; a bill that will make \nAmerica more secure.\n  I wish that were true--but it is not. This is not an energy policy \nfor America in the 21st century. And that is very unfortunate.\n  The price of a barrel of oil is above $60 and rising, gas prices are \nagain reaching record highs, yet this bill offers no solution. In all \nof the pages of text, there is no meaningful program or plan to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. There is no provision that increases \nfuel efficiency or promotes oil conservation. There is no provision to \ncreate a comprehensive, long-term program for the development of \nrenewable, sustainable fuels.\n  This bill could have been a roadmap to a new energy future in \nAmerica, but instead it leaves us stuck in our current energy mess.\n  Supporters of this bill will claim that it can reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic oil production. But I \nwould point out a\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\nwell-known fact--the U.S. contains only 3 percent of the known global \noil reserves in the entire world. No matter how much we drill here, we \nwill never drill enough to meet our growing thirst for oil.\n  As long as we continue to consume as much oil as we do today, without \naddressing the hard issues such as fuel economy standards, we will \nbecome more, not less, reliant on foreign oil. With global demand for \noil steadily increasing, this continued dependence on imported oil \ncould have devastating economic consequences.\n  Today we import 58 percent of our oil. The Department of Energy's \nEnergy Information Administration projects that the U.S. will import 68 \npercent of our oil by 2025--more than \\2/3\\ of our oil consumption.\n  Former CIA Director James Woolsey, Robert McFarlane, former President \nReagan's National Security Adviser, and other national security experts \nhave created a group they call the Set America Free Coalition. \nAccording to them, ``It is imperative that the nation's energy policy \naddress the national security and economic impacts of growing oil \ndependence.''\n  Imagine what would happen to the U.S. economy if there were a major \ndisruption in oil supplies in a foreign producing country--perhaps in \nthe Middle East. Can you imagine what could happen to our economy?\n  I can. Thirty years ago, war in the Middle East caused oil prices in \nthe U.S. to increase by 70 percent. Overnight, the price of oil rose \nfrom $3 per barrel to $5.11 per barrel. Just a few months later, oil \nprices more than doubled again to $11.65 per barrel.\n  At the time of the 1970s oil embargo the U.S. imported less than a \nthird of our oil. This embargo hit Americans hard, as many remember \nwell. Back then, Congress recognized the economic impact of oil \ndependence and took steps to address oil consumption in America. Among \nother actions, Congress passed national fuel economy standards, raising \npassenger cars from an average 12.9 miles per gallon in 1973 to 27.5 \nmiles per gallon by 1985.\n  Increasing fuel economy standards for cars is one of the most \neffective steps we can take to reduce oil dependence. Unfortunately, \nthis Congress has rejected that goal.\n  Listen to this, from an article published in BusinessWeek about a \nmonth ago:\n\n       As Congress puts the final touches on a massive new energy \n     bill, lawmakers are about to blow it. That's because the bill \n     almost certainly won't include one policy initiative that \n     could seriously reduce America's dependence on foreign oil: A \n     government-mandated increase in the average fuel economy of \n     new cars, SUVs, light trucks and vans.\n\n  BusinessWeek was right, Congress did blow it.\n  Congress has blown it at a time when the National Academy of Sciences \nand many other energy and engineering experts tell us the technology is \navailable today to reduce our need for oil by 3 million barrels per day \nby 2015.\n  Not only is there no new fuel economy standard, the energy conferees \neven rejected a modest provision that would have reduced oil \nconsumption by 1 million barrels per day by 2015--just 4 percent of the \npetroleum it is projected we will use by 2015.\n  Incredibly, it is President Bush's stated policy to oppose any fuel \nsavings measures.\n  Does this make any sense?\n  There is only one provision in this entire bill that may--may--reduce \nAmerica's dangerous dependence on foreign oil: a renewable fuels \nprovision that requires a doubling in ethanol production by 2012. This \nprovision will reduce oil consumption by about 1 percent over the next \n7 years.\n  But does this limited 1-percent reduction in imported oil over 7 \nyears represent the best we can do for America's energy security? \nEconomic security? National security?\n  Senate Democrats believe that Americans can do better than we are \ntoday.\n  We offered a plan to reduce America's dependence on imported oil by \n40 percent by 2025. This goal was a realistic goal--with realistic \nchanges in the way we use energy, advance the production and \napplication of energy technology, and promote energy efficiency and \nconservation.\n  Nearly half of the Members of this body voted for our plan.\n  But big oil companies, car companies, and their allies in the White \nHouse and Congress rejected even setting a goal.\n  How is it that the same administration that talks about sending a man \nto Mars does not have enough faith in American genius and American \nknow-how to believe that our scientists and engineers can determine how \nto increase the fuel efficiency of our automobile fleet safely?\n  Almost 3 months ago, I spoke to an auditorium of scientists at the \nArgonne National Energy lab--America's first national energy lab just \noutside of Chicago. The scientists there do not think that decreasing \nAmerica's over-reliance on foreign oil is impossible. They think it is \nimperative.\n  Instead of shoveling billions of dollars at oil and energy companies, \nwe ought to be investing in the work of those and other scientists. \nYet, the Republican leadership, from the White House on down, is \ncutting public investments in scientific research and providing \nbillions of dollars in tax incentives to big oil companies that have \nbeen recording record profits.\n  This bill takes much of the $11.5 billion in tax incentives that \ncould have been used to develop renewable and alternative energy \nsources and instead gives it to big oil and energy companies.\n  For instance, there are generous royalty payment relief provisions \nfor energy companies that drill on Federal lands. A better bill would \nhave maintained royalty payments and used these funds to extend the \nproduction tax credit for wind generation beyond the 2 years written in \nthis bill. Unfortunately the 2-year extension will continue the boom \nand bust cycle we've witnessed in the investment of wind generation.\n  The President himself says that oil and energy companies do not need \ntax cuts--but he will sign this bill anyway, even if they are included.\n  Think about that: the upcoming reconciliation bill will contain $10 \nbillion in cuts in health care for the poor while this bill provides \nover $10 billion in tax breaks, mostly for big oil and energy \ncompanies.\n  Talk about a Congress out of touch with America.\n  And we will have to borrow the money to pay for those tax breaks and \npay interest on that money too, so the true cost is even higher.\n  This is a failure in leadership.\n  From the day they took office, the Bush administration made passing a \nnew national energy bill a top priority. The President put the Vice \nPresident in charge of getting the job done. We still don't know how \nmuch of this bill can be traced back to the Vice President's secret \nenergy task force because the administration has gone to extraordinary \nlengths--all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court--to keep all of its \nrecords about the task force secret.\n  There are at least two things the big oil and energy companies wanted \nthat are not in this bill.\n  For 5 years, MTBE manufacturers prevented the passage of an energy \nbill by demanding that they be shielded from liability for groundwater \ncontamination caused by their product. Thankfully, the liability waiver \nis not in this bill--so Americans won't have all the cleanup costs \nshifted onto the taxpayers.\n  Oil companies also fought hard against increasing ethanol \nproduction--knowing that this renewable fuel would replace some of \ntheir products. The oil companies wanted only a token nod toward \nethanol.\n  Thankfully, this bill contains a renewable fuel standard that \nincreases the use of domestically produced renewable fuels to 7.5 \nbillion gallons by 2012. This change will be good for America's \neconomy, good for our energy security and good for Illinois farmers.\n  Illinois farmers grow corn that provides 40 percent of the total \nethanol consumed in the U.S. annually. They stand ready and eager to \nmeet the new challenges in this bill.\n  I believe the renewable fuels standard can lead to greater energy \nsecurity for our Nation.\n  I will vote for this bill for one reason. After 4 years of fighting \nthis battle, it is clear we are not going to get an energy plan for the \n21st century as long as Texas oil men are in charge of the Federal \nGovernment. This is as good as we are going to get.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  It has been 13 years since the last time America passed a national \nenergy plan. I can guarantee you, it will not be another 13 years \nbefore this plan is abandoned and replaced with a more visionary and \nresponsible plan.\n  We should have increased America's national and economic security by \nreducing our reliance on oil imported from Saudi Arabia and other \npolitically volatile nations. We have the scientific ability to meet \nthat challenge. Unfortunately, we lack the political leadership to do \nso.\n  The price we will pay for this failure of leadership in rising gas \nprices and increased risk to our national economy and national security \nwill far exceed the cost of the wasteful tax breaks this bill gives to \nbig oil.\n  This bill does not reduce gas prices at the pump, it does not reduce \ndependence on foreign oil, it does not address fuel efficiency and \nconservation, and it does not increase America's economic and national \nsecurity. It is not an energy plan for the 21st century.\n  And it is definitely not the end of the energy debate--only the \nbeginning.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Senate is poised to pass the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 and send it to the President, Utahns should sit up \nand take notice, because our State is at the heart of this legislation. \nSo many of the problems in our energy structure have solutions that can \nbe found in Utah, whether it is the need for more clean coal, more \nclean geothermal energy, more natural gas, better hydroelectric, more \nrefining capacity, or more major sources of domestic oil, Utah will \nplay a major part in the solution.\n  I want to talk more about some of these solutions, but first, let me \ntake a moment to thank Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman of the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for leading us to this \npoint. The Senate Finance Committee, on which I sit, has made a major \ncontribution to the bill with its tax incentives title. Chairman \nGrassley and Senator Baucus deserve just as much praise for their \noutstanding coordination and hard work on that important part of this \nbill.\n  As the ranking member of the Finance Committee and as a Conferee on \nthis legislation, I was able to watch all 4 of these men work together \nunder pressure, and I could not be more impressed with their leadership \nand the work their excellent staffs have provided to our nation at this \ncritical time. Working together, they have given us what I consider to \nbe one of the most important bills to be enacted in a long time.\n  I have, at times, been criticized for reaching across the aisle to \naccomplish important policy goals. Some believe that compromise signals \nweakness. Well I just plain disagree, and after 4 years of failing to \npass a major Energy bill with a simple majority, I think the Senate has \nproven that we stand the strongest when we stand together. And our \nenergy situation calls for this type of leadership and strength.\n  Over the last decade, American consumers have increased their demand \nfor oil by 12 percent, but domestic oil production has grown by less \nthan \\1/2\\ of 1 percent. Is it any wonder that we rely on foreign \ncountries for more than half our oil needs? We import 56 percent of our \noil today, and it is projected to be 68 percent within 20 years.\n  On the larger scale, global demand for oil is growing at an \nunprecedented pace--about 2\\1/2\\ million barrels per day in 2004 alone. \nWhile global oil production is increasing, the discovery of new oil \nreserves is dropping off at an alarming rate. Moreover, trends indicate \nthat the global thirst for petroleum will continue to grow, especially \nin Asia.\n  If our Nation must rely on oil imports to meet our future energy \nneeds, we are headed for trouble, because, unless something changes, a \nsufficient oil supply will not be there. We should keep in mind that \nthe transportation sector in the U.S. accounts for nearly \\2/3\\ of all \nof our oil consumption, and that sector is 97 percent dependent on oil. \nIt could not be more clear: if we want to improve our energy security, \nwe must focus on our transportation sector, and we must focus on \ndiversifying our transportation fuels.\n  Recently, we heard President Bush call on our Nation to ``develop new \nways to power our automobiles,'' and he spoke of his proposal to \nprovide $2.5 billion over 10 years in tax incentives for the purchase \nof hybrid technologies. The President also called for a better \nalternative fuel infrastructure and the need to develop hydrogen fuel \ncell vehicles.\n  As for these policies the President addressed, my legislation, S. \n971, the Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car \nTechnologies Act, or CLEAR ACT, is exactly where the rubber meets the \nroad. The CLEAR ACT, now a part of this Energy bill, is the most \ncomprehensive and effective plan put forward by Congress to accelerate \nthe transformation of the automotive marketplace toward the widespread \nuse of fuel cell vehicles. And it does so without any new Federal \nmandates. Rather, it offers powerful market incentives to promote the \nadvances in technology, in our infrastructure, and in the alternative \nfuels that are necessary if fuel cells are to ever reach the mass \nmarket. With the CLEAR ACT we accomplish this goal, but in the \nmeantime, we also get cleaner air, we reduce our dependency on foreign \noil, and we help lead our Nation into the future.\n  Historically, consumers have faced three basic obstacles to accepting \nthe use of alternative fuels and advanced technologies. These are the \nhigher cost of the vehicles, the lack of an infrastructure of \nalternative fueling stations, and the higher cost of alternative fuels. \nThe CLEAR ACT will lower all three of these market barriers through the \nuse of tax incentives.\n  First, we provide a tax credit for the purchase of alternative fuels. \nNext we promote a new infrastructure of alternative fuel filling \nstations by extending an existing tax deduction for the purchase of the \nnecessary equipment and providing a new tax credit for the cost of \ninstalling it.\n  Finally we provide a Clear Act Credit to consumers who purchase \nalternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. This includes fuel \ncell, hybrid electric, alternative fuel, and battery electric vehicles.\n  All of the technologies promoted in the CLEAR ACT--whether they be \nbattery or electric motor technologies or advances in fuel storage and \nalternative fuel infrastructure--lead us closer to the hydrogen fuel \ncell vehicle. I believe fuel cells are in our future. However, even if \nthe widespread use of fuel cell vehicles never becomes a reality, \nadvances in these other technologies provide a dramatic social benefit \non their own.\n\n  I have heard from some who question the need for incentives for \nhybrid vehicles when they are popular in some areas. It may be true \nthat demand for these vehicles is high in a few regions. However, these \nhigh-demand areas tend to have local or state incentives in place for \nthe purchase of these vehicles. Where incentives are not in place, \nhybrid sales are minimal. This demonstrates that incentives can indeed \nprovide a market breakthrough to consumer acceptance of alternative \nvehicles.\n  With the CLEAR ACT, we are trying to provide that breakthrough on a \nnational scale. And the numbers show that a breakthrough is desperately \nneeded. It may be true that hybrid sales have doubled in the last \ncouple of years, but they still represent a minuscule 0.48 percent of \ncars that were sold in 2004. So I am very pleased, Mr. President, that \nthe energy bill will lead us into the future in this regard.\n  We should also be using more clean alternatives when we generate \nanother form of energy--electricity. I am very pleased that the Energy \nbill includes S. 1156, my legislation that extends and expands the \nproduction tax credit for electricity from renewable sources, including \ngeothermal. This is particularly important to my home State of Utah, \nwhich has vast potential for the creation of electricity from \ngeothermal sources, along with other renewable energy sources, such as \nwind and biomass.\n  While this production tax credit has been in the tax code for some \ntime, it had an unfair feature that provided the tax credit for 10 \nyears for electricity produced from wind, but only for 5 years for \nelectricity produced from most of the other renewable resources. This \ninequity has skewed investment in these resources unfairly and in a way \nthat has not led to the best use of these national assets.\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\n  I am happy to see that this provision has survived in conference. \nThis should result in a better-balanced and higher output of \nelectricity from all our renewable resources.\n  And, I have highlighted just two among many important provisions in \nthis bill that will promote the greater use of alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy.\n  We cannot escape the fact that our nation remains reliant on oil and \ngas, and we absolutely must increase our supply of these resources in a \nbig way.\n  It is a little known fact that the largest hydrocarbon resource in \nthe world rests within the borders of Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. I \nknow it may be hard to believe, but energy experts agree that there is \nmore recoverable oil in these 3 states than there is in all the Middle \nEast. In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that recoverable \noil shale in the western United States exceeds 1 trillion barrels, but \nit is not counted among world reserves, because it is not yet \ncommercially developed. If anyone is wondering what the significance is \nof that number, he or she should know that the world's oil reserves \nstand at just about 1.6 trillion barrels. That means we have almost as \nmuch unconventional oil in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming as the rest of \nthe world's conventional oil combined.\n  Companies have been waiting for the Federal government to recognize \nthe potential of this resource and allow access to it. My legislation, \nS. 1111, the Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development Act, will do just \nthat, and more.\n  Some have been understandably hesitant to develop this resource. \nDuring the 1970s, there was a very large and expensive effort in \nwestern Colorado to develop oil shale there. When the price of oil \ndropped dramatically, though, the market for oil shale went bust and \nthe region suffered an economic disaster.\n  We need to remember that our past failure in this area was not \nnecessarily a failure of technology, but was due to a dramatic slump in \ngas prices. We now have a different scenario. Today, the world is \nreaching peak oil production of conventional oil, and cheap oil prices \nare nowhere in sight.\n  We have already seen that a shift in focus to unconventional fuels \nsuch as tar sands produce mind-boggling results. Only a few years ago, \nAlberta, Canada recognized the potential of its own tar sands deposits \nand set forth a policy to promote their development. As a result, \nCanada has increased its oil reserves by more than a factor of 10, \ngoing from a reserve of about 14 billion barrels to its current reserve \nof more than 176 billion barrels in a very short period. And just \nthink--we are sitting on a similar resource of oil shale and tar sands \nin the United States.\n  It is frustrating to learn that Utah imports about one-fourth of its \noil from Canadian tar sands, even though we have our own very large \nresource of tar sands in our own state sitting undeveloped. I look \nforward to the day in the not-too-distant future, when Utah's oil shale \nand tar sands are developed to their potential. If it happens, and I \nbelieve that it will, Utah will become a world leader in oil \nproduction.\n  But even if we do solve the oil importation issue, we still have \nanother problem. Our Nation is so lacking in refining capacity for \ncrude, that we are forced to import 10 percent of our refined fuel. We \ncould produce all the domestic oil in the world, but until we can \nrefine it, we cannot use it.\n  It is clear that one of the reasons we currently have sharply higher \ngasoline prices is that we simply do not have enough refining capacity \nin this country. This is both a short-term and a longer-term concern \nfor our economy and national security.\n  Regrettably, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and home heating oil supplies \nare simply too tight in America today. There is not a lot that can be \ndone in the very near term to address the higher cost of fuel that is \nattributable to refining bottlenecks. However, ensuring the long-term \nviability of the U.S. refining industry should be at the very heart of \na smart national energy policy.\n  One of the major problems with our refining capacity is that industry \nprofitability has been poor over the past several decades. This has \ncontributed to the steady decline in the number of operating refineries \nin America from more than 300 in 1980 to less than 150 today. I am told \nthe last major refinery to be built in America came on line in the \n1970s.\n  Earlier this year, the National Petroleum Council reported that U.S. \nrefining capacity growth was not keeping pace with demand growth, that \npoor historic returns in the refining sector was impeding further \ninvestment, and that major expenditures in new regulations were \nlimiting the funds available for capacity expansions. This was bad news \ncrying out for a solution.\n  Another problem mentioned in the report is that the 10-year \ndepreciation schedule prescribed by the current tax law for refining \nassets is much longer than the write-off periods for similar process \nequipment in other manufacturing industries. Also, the tax code does \nnot contain any incentives to encourage new investment in refining \ncapacity, which is an endeavor that carries high costs and risks.\n  With these facts in mind, I introduced S. 1039, the Gas Price \nReduction Through Increased Refinery Capacity Act of 2005. S. 1039 \nwould adjust the depreciation period for assets used in refining from \n10 years to 5 and would allow an immediate write-off of these assets if \ncompanies made an early and firm commitment to invest in new capacity \nwithin a relatively short time.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for including the temporary refinery \nexpensing provisions of S. 1039 in the Chairman's mark of the tax title \nto the Energy bill. This provision passed the Senate as part of the \nenergy tax package. I am pleased the Conference Committee accepted this \nprovision even though cost constraints forced us to limit the incentive \nto 50 percent expensing.\n  This is the first provision passed by Congress in the past half \ncentury that gives the U.S. refining industry a specific tax incentive \ndesigned to spur investment in increased refining capacity. The \nNational Petrochemical & Refiners Association, which represents \nvirtually all U.S. refineries, has indicated this measure will help \nstimulate facility expansions and output. It is the only provision in \nthe entire Energy bill that encourages refining capacity growth and \nincreased gasoline, diesel and jet fuel supply for consumers. This \nprovision alone should make a significant difference in fuel supplies.\n  Utah is a major gas producer. But most of Utah's natural gas lies \nunder our vast public lands. Utah has a large supply, but as you might \nguess, Federal red tape is the number one obstacle to supplying the \ncountry with the natural gas it demands.\n  One example is the natural gas found within Utah's tar sands. \nHistorically, extracting natural gas from tar sands has required a dual \napplication requiring both a permit for gas extraction and mineral \nextraction. I introduced a bill that amends the Mineral Leasing Act to \nallow a company only going after the gas to forgo the permitting for \nmineral extraction, while fully leaving in place every relevant \nenvironmental law and regulation. This legislation, S. 53, was included \nin the energy bill.\n  In another effort to create a lose-lose situation, the Department of \nthe Interior recently published a rule that would tack on a new and \nexpensive fee on new Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) for \nnatural gas development. As members of the Conference Committee, \nSenator Craig Thomas and I joined forces to put an end to this fee for \nat least 10 years.\n  We do not need another hurdle to obtaining gas from our public lands. \nThe Federal government receives about $1.6 billion every year in \nroyalties from gas production on public lands. With every new well in \nUtah, gas companies pay a generous royalty to Federal and State \ngovernments. It is simple math--in the long run, Utah and the Nation \nloses money when wells are stopped because of fees. We also suffer from \nthe resulting slow down in the supply of natural gas.\n  Finally, I was a proponent of an item in the Energy bill that reduces \nthe depreciable lives of natural gas gathering and distribution lines. \nBy being able to depreciate their equipment more quickly, companies are \nbetter able to invest in future production activity. This provision \nshould help spur investment in more exploration and production of this \nclean and important fuel.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, the Energy Policy Act \nwill have a very large impact on Utah,\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\nnot only in positive economic growth and jobs, but also in the benefits \nof cheaper and cleaner energy costs for families and businesses. Again, \nI thank the leaders in the Senate who have brought us to this point, \nalong with their counterparts in the House of Representatives. I think \nwe have proven today, that Congress can respond to the needs of the \nnation and our citizens when we work together with that goal in mind.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 13 years have passed between the time \nCongress passed national energy legislation and the conference report \nwe are taking up today. This conference report is not perfect, and it \ndoes not go as far as I would have hoped in terms of moving the U.S. \ndown a different energy path. It does, however, include a number of \npositive elements, including several relating to coal and clean coal \ntechnologies that I have supported for a number of years. But, if we \nwait another 13 years and continue to ignore the looming energy threats \nthat remain unaddressed, we may find ourselves woefully behind the rest \nof the world.\n  If the U.S. is to remain competitive and keep pace with our growing \nenergy demands, then we must take stock, as a Nation, of our energy \nsecurity and make it a top national priority. We cannot achieve energy \nindependence with continued incremental, piecemeal efforts. It is time \nto devote new innovation and ingenuity to energy policy and blaze a \npath forward. We need to be free of the chains of foreign oil. To do \nthat, we must invest in the energy resources that we have here at home. \nCoal is at the heart of that effort.\n  By encouraging the cleaner, more efficient use of coal in powerplants \nand other facilities, we help to ensure jobs in West Virginia's coal \ncommunities for many years to come. At the same time, we must find more \nways to utilize coal as an energy source in the 21st century. West \nVirginians know that, for the United States to be free of our heavy \nreliance on Middle Eastern oil, we must make investments in coal, \nbiomass, and other domestic, power-producing resources. We must be \nprepared to make the hard decisions to make energy security a national \npriority, not a mere afterthought.\n  For many years, the Middle East has been a hotbed of tumult and \nstrife. An underlying reason for our continued presence in this region \nis the protection of our oil lifeline. Unfortunately, even if the \nCongress passes this energy legislation, it will do little, if \nanything, to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. In fact, we will \ncontinue to become more dependent by the day. Instead of disentangling \nourselves from this foreign oil dependency, we will be sinking our \nmilitary and energy fortunes deeper and deeper into the sands of the \nMiddle East.\n  West Virginians and Americans everywhere should understand that there \nare some very good features of this conference report, but they should \nnot be fooled. Our citizens will see little change in terms of gas \nprices or natural gas prices. There will likely be few changes in our \nproduction or use of energy. I fear the U.S. will continue to ride down \nthe same rocky road for years to come.\n  Regrettably, House Republicans also objected to including in the \nEnergy conference report my commuter tax benefit to help rural workers \nwho are paying exorbitant prices at the fuel pump. Big Oil, which is \nreaping huge windfalls from fuel prices this year, is denying modest \nrelief to working Americans. This is but one of the many examples of \nhow this bill sidesteps the difficult decisions that ultimately must be \nmade to address energy costs, to reduce our reliance on foreign energy, \nto substantially improve our domestic energy supply and energy \nefficiency needs, and to deal with global climate change. We are doing \nlittle, if anything, to address seriously these critical challenges.\n  I am delighted to support the inclusion of certain targeted tax \nincentives that will help promote the next generation of clean coal \ntechnologies. I have been working on these issues for more than 6 years \nand am delighted that the Congress has recognized their value. This \nwould include, for the first time, $1.3 billion to help fund the \ndeployment of the ``next generation'' of powerplants, including \nintegrated gasification combined cycle and advanced combustion-based \npowerplants. There is also $350 million for a new program to accelerate \nthe use of coal and other domestic resources at industrial gasification \nfacilities. I note that several important coal research, development, \nand demonstration programs, especially the clean coal technology \ndemonstration program, have been reauthorized and improved upon in this \nconference report.\n  This legislation makes many promises to the country on energy policy. \nIt makes promises to the men and women who pull the coal from the \nground and to those who are finding ways to use that coal more cleanly \nand more efficiently. To make good on those promises, the \nadministration must be willing to put financial support behind these \ninitiatives. Will this administration do that? Is the President going \nto request the funding required in his budget to make the clean coal \nand other important energy programs a reality? In the end, the \nPresident will likely have a Rose Garden ceremony and press releases \ntouting its accomplishments. But, given this administration's track \nrecord, is this energy bill simply a soapbox to stand on?\n  The final legislation before us is only a way station on a long \njourney and more work remains ahead. This bill is not the whole answer. \nIt is a start, and I am committed to continuing to work toward that \ngoal. I want to thank Senators Domenici and Bingaman for their \ncontinued diligence and hard work in this endeavor. I applaud their \nefforts to ensure that the consideration of this legislation was open \nand bipartisan from start to finish. I will vote to support H.R. 6, the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005.\n\n\n                tax incentives for commercial buildings\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank you for your dedicated work \nin defending the Senate-passed Energy bill language in conference, \nparticularly concerning the energy efficiency tax incentives. For the \nfirst time, there will be energy efficiency tax incentives for \ncommercial buildings for each of the three energy-using systems of the \nbuilding--the envelope, the heating, cooling and water heating system, \nand lighting. Each is eligible for one-third of the $1.80 per square \nfoot tax incentive if it meets its share of the whole-building savings \ngoal. This will apply to buildings that cut energy use by 50 percent, \nan ambitious but very important target as buildings account for 35 \npercent of our Nation's energy usage, and commercial buildings are a \nlarge part of that percentage.\n  My concern is that, because the eligibility period was cut back from \nthe end of 2010 to just 2 years, this shorter window of effectiveness \ncould undercut the program, since the time it takes to design and \nconstruct these large buildings and skyscrapers could take longer than \nthe 2 years of eligibility. This is especially a concern as the \nincentives for commercial buildings is one of the fastest ways in the \nentire Energy bill that we can cut down the Nation's energy usage in \nthe short term.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are committed to this as the correct policy for \nlarge scale commercial projects. In addition, we are committed to \nseeing energy-efficient skyscrapers in the sky and recognize that these \ntypes of projects take years to design and build. We will continue to \nwork with you to make this a long-term policy of the Tax Code.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Again, your assistance is greatly appreciated and I look \nforward to working with you on this matter in the Finance Committee in \nthe coming months.\n\n\n           clarifications relating to the section 29(c)(1)(c)\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to confinn that certain language \nin the Conference Report to the Energy bill, with respect to the \nInternal Revenue Service stopping the issuance of private letter \nrulings and other taxpayer-specific guidance regarding the section 29 \ncredit, actually refers to a solid fuel produced from coal and ``coal \nwaste sludge,'' a waste product composed of tar decanter sludge and \nother byproducts of the coking process. This fuel is commonly referred \nto as ``steel industry fuel'' because it is a superior feedstock for \nthe production of coke that is used by the domestic steel industry. \nSteel industry fuel provides significant energy benefits by recapturing \nthe energy content of the coal waste sludge and significant \nenvironmental benefits because the Environmental Protection Agency \nclassifies\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\ncoal waste sludge as a hazardous waste unless it is processed with coal \ninto a solid fuel product. The conference report expresses the \nconferees' understanding and belief that the Internal Revenue Service \nshould consider issuing such rulings and guidance on an expedited basis \nto those taxpayers who had pending ruling requests at the time the \nmoratorium was implemented. I would like to confirm the understanding \nand belief of the conferees that this language in the conference report \nactually refers to steel industry fuel and the requests for private \nletter rulings that the producers of steel industry fuel submitted in \nFall 2000.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Yes, the distinguished Senator is \ncorrect. The conferees understand that there are requests for private \nletter rulings with respect to the process the Senator from \nPennsylvania has described. Moreover, these requests were submitted in \nFall 2000. The conferees expect that the Internal Revenue Service would \nconsider issuing these rulings immediately, with due diligence, and \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would also like to ask the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Committee on Finance to confirm that steel industry fuel is a \n``qualified fuel'' that is eligible for the section 29 nonconventional \nfuel tax credit through 2007 when one, the production facility was \nplaced in service after 1992 and before July 1, 1998, pursuant to a \nbinding written contract--including a supply or service contract for \nthe processing of coal waste sludge--and, two, the steel industry fuel \nis sold to an unrelated party.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Pennsylvania raises an important and \ntime-sensitive question. When we considered the section 29 changes, the \nconferees were aware of the process described by the Senator. As the \nsenior conferee for the Committee on Finance, I urge the Internal \nRevenue Service to consider that process as a qualified fuel that is \neligible for the section 29 credit under such circumstances.\n  Mr. SANTORIUM. I thank the distinguished chairman for these \nclarifications.\n\n\n            clarifying section 703 of the Energy Policy Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Chairman, can I ask you to clarify something \nregarding Section 703? It is my understanding that by creating an \nalternative compliance mechanism that essentially we are creating a \nsystem that will allow more technologies to receive credit under the \nEPAct program without specifically naming them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So, for instance, neighborhood electric vehicles or low \nspeed electric vehicles would now qualify under this program even \nthough they are not specifically named?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the chairman and yield the floor.\n\n\n                      foreign utility--section 203\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee--Senator Domenici--in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that section \n1289 of the Domenici Energy Policy Act of 2005 could be interpreted as \nrequiring FERC approval of certain foreign transactions wholly outside \nof the United States.\n  I am a strong supporter of section 1289 because I believe it is \nvital, especially since we are repealing the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act, that FERC be given the authority it needs to protect U.S. \nconsumers. In my opinion, section 1289 gives FERC the appropriate \nauthority to ensure that utility mergers and acquisitions do not \nadversely impact consumers. I also think it is appropriate for FERC to \nbe able to ensure that retail customers in the United States do not \nsubsidize foreign acquisitions.\n  However, Section 1289 could also be interpreted as requiring FERC \napproval of a holding company's acquisition of a foreign utility where \nthe holding company has no retail customers in this country. A company \nthat has a subsidiary that simply owns generation assets in the United \nStates for wholesale electric sales is also defined as a holding \ncompany. As a result, that holding company's acquisition of an electric \nutility company operating entirely overseas could be interpreted as \nbeing subject to FERC's purview as a result of section 1289 of the bill \nwe are considering today.\n  Subjecting foreign utility acquisitions by holding companies without \nany U.S. retail customers to FERC oversight could potentially have a \nchilling effect on investment here in the United States. At a time that \nwe are trying to encourage investment in U.S. generation, we may be \ndissuading investments coming into the United States if a foreign-based \nholding company believes its next transaction in Great Britain is going \nto be subject to a FERC merger review proceeding. Moreover, the \n``public interest'' test present in section 203 of the Federal Power \nAct does not readily fit the situation present with respect to foreign \ntransactions.\n  I note that section 1289 does give FERC the authority to, by \nrulemaking, identify types of transactions that will receive expedited \nCommission review. I certainly believe that the acquisition of a \nforeign utility company by a holding company with no retail customers \nin the United States should fall in that category. Other categories of \nforeign transactions that could possibly be interpreted as being \ncovered by section 1289 also may fall into this category.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague--Senator \nBingaman--that FERC, if it determines that certain foreign transactions \nare covered by the language of section 1289, should provide expedited \nreview and approval to the acquisition of a foreign utility by a \nholding company that has no retail customers in the United States and \nother transactions that raise no significant U.S. consumer issues. \nThese types of transactions don't require FERC's scrutiny in order to \nensure that American consumers are adequately protected.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for 4 years, Congress has failed to enact \na comprehensive Energy bill. Today, however, I am confident we can \nchange that record.\n  The conference committee has assembled a well-balanced package. It is \nright for America. We should send it to the President's desk.\n  The House and the Senate gave the conferees a difficult task. The \nHouse and Senate Energy bills took two very different approaches to tax \npolicy. The two bills had very little in common. Thus, we could not \ninclude everything in both bills without busting our budget.\n  Most of the provisions in the House bill promoted investment in \ntraditional energy infrastructure. It favored pipelines, electricity \nlines, and oil and gas production.\n  In contrast, the Senate bill--which I helped develop with my good \nfriend Senator Grassley--advanced new technologies. It encouraged \nconservation efforts, improved energy efficiency, and expanded use of \nalternative fuels.\n  Conference negotiations were hard fought. We made some tough \ndecisions.\n  But overall, the process was very positive. We kept within our \nbudget, and we worked with a spirit of compromise and cooperation.\n  The energy tax incentives that the conference has recommended take an \nevenhanded approach to an array of promising technologies.\n  For example, the bill provides a uniform period for claiming \nproduction tax credits under section 45 of the Tax Code. This \nencourages production of electricity from all sources of renewable \nenergy.\n  The bill recognizes the value of coal and other traditional energy \nsources to our economy. It provides investment tax credits for clean-\nburning coal facilities and projects. It provides substantial tax \nincentives to facilitate much needed expansion of refinery capacity. \nAnd it promotes expansion of American energy delivery systems.\n  The bill recognizes the need for a diverse energy portfolio, it \nfosters energy production from wind or coal in Montana to geothermal \nsources in California, and it will help create jobs by promoting \ndomestic energy production.\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\n  The bill also rewards energy conservation and efficiency. It includes \nincentives for energy-efficient homes, alternative fuel vehicles, and \ndevelopment of fuel cell technology. These incentives are \nenvironmentally responsible they reduce pollution, and they help \nimprove people's health.\n  These energy tax incentives are good for America. They will promote \nthe delivery of reliable, affordable energy to consumers. They will \nhelp to create jobs through domestic energy production, and they make \nmeaningful progress toward energy independence.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan effort that produced the conference \nagreement. I encourage my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Energy bill \nconference report.\n  For many years, I have supported passage of a comprehensive national \nenergy policy. Such a policy is necessary to reduce our increasing \ndependence on foreign energy sources. A comprehensive energy policy \nwill help lower energy prices in the long run. Furthermore, any far-\nreaching bill will move us toward newer technologies that will keep our \neconomy growing strong while making us more energy independent.\n  Although not perfect, this energy bill moves us in the right \ndirection. It will expand our electricity transmission system and make \nit more reliable. The bill contains incentives for renewable energy, \nincluding the renewable energy production tax credit that I helped \ninclude. It will also spur an increase in the production and use of \ndomestic biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Because of this bill, \nour coal-burning plants will improve their efficiency and emit less \npollution. Finally, the bill provides needed incentives to increase \nnatural gas infrastructure, measures that will lead to lower prices for \nnatural gas consumers in the long run.\n  Equally important, this bill benefits North Dakota for a number of \nreasons. The transmission incentives will enable my State's power \nproducers to export electricity to distant markets. In this way, \ntransmission incentives benefit the lignite and wind energy sectors in \nmy State. The clean coal production incentives will make it easier to \nbuild advanced clean coal powerplants. The inclusion of the wind energy \nproduction tax credit will help North Dakota realize its potential to \nbe the biggest producer of wind energy in the country. The Renewable \nFuels Standard and tax incentives for ethanol and biodiesel will aid my \nState's farm economy, create more jobs, and reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. In addition, the bill will assist my State in developing \nexciting new technologies, such as coal-to-liquid fuel plants.\n  I believe we still have a lot of work to do in order to make our \nNation less dependent on foreign energy. However, this bill takes \npositive steps to address our energy needs. As I just mentioned, this \nbill will provide significant benefits to my State.\n  For these reasons, I support the conference report.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shelby and Senator \nSarbanes for their hard work on H.R. 3, the Safe, Accountable, \nFlexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (SAFETEA). I \nknow how much time, effort and energy went into completing that bill \nand I commend the chairman and ranking member. I especially appreciate \ntheir willingness to work with me to get language included in the bill \nin support of a full funding grant agreement for the New Jersey Trans-\nHudson Midtown Corridor.\n  The New Jersey Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor project entails \nconstruction of a 5-mile commuter rail extension from Secaucus, NJ to a \nnew station in midtown Manhattan. The centerpiece of the project is a \nnew trans-Hudson rail tunnel. This project will benefit transit riders \nfrom the New York and New Jersey region and will relieve congestion on \nthe existing tunnels for intercity rail riders of the Northeast \ncorridor, the Nation's busiest passenger railroad. A recent economic \nimpact analysis indicates that the entire project will create 44,000 \nnew jobs and increase gross regional product by $10 billion. The \nproject's estimated cost is approximately $5 billion.\n  The Federal contribution would be matched by comparable local \ncontributions from the State of New Jersey and the Port Authority of \nNew York and New Jersey. New York's Governor Pataki, who along with New \nJersey's Governor Codey controls the Port Authority governance, \nrecently declared his support of this project--bolstering prospects for \nfuture funding from the Port Authority for local share. In addition, \nthe State of New Jersey will soon be reauthorizing its transportation \ntrust fund, which will provide New Jersey with the funding capacity for \nits own contribution to the project.\n  Currently, the project is undergoing environmental review, which \nshould be completed in 2006. It is expected that preliminary \nengineering will start in fall 2005 and construction will begin in \n2007.\n  The language in the SAFETEA bill will be a significant boost to this \nproject. I would like to take a moment to clarify the intent of a \ncouple of points in that provision in the bill. First of all, it is the \nintent of the language to include the funding expended for the New \nJersey Transit river line and the bi-level railroad cars New Jersey \nTransit purchased for its lines as part of the non-Federal contribution \nfor the New Jersey Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor project.\n  Second, the language says that the Secretary of Transportation must \ngive ``strong consideration'' to the Trans-Hudson Midtown Corridor \nproject when it comes time to awarding a full funding grant agreement, \nsince it will be a crucial link for the Northeast corridor and benefit \nthe region's mobility, security, economy and environment. The term \n``strong consideration'' indicates that the New Jersey Trans-Hudson \nMidtown Corridor project is a high priority for the Secretary and \nencourages the Secretary to award a full funding grant agreement \nprovided it meets the FTA's New Starts criteria. I appreciate the \nopportunity to clarify these important points, and I look forward to \nfurther progress on the tunnel project.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am afraid that the heralded passage of \nthis energy bill against years of failure by the Congress to legislate \na comprehensive energy policy has created a false sense of \naccomplishment in Washington today. As my colleagues are well aware, \noil prices are hovering near the infamous $60 per barrel mark; the \ngreenhouse effect is beginning to have a substantial measurable impact \non the global climate; and American families are being gouged at the \npump while their tax dollars are carelessly spent on Federal subsides \nfor big oil and gas companies. As leaders, we cannot claim that we have \nsuccessfully addressed these real-life challenges by enacting this \nlatest incarnation of special interest influence in policymaking.\n  I do want to acknowledge the work of the Senate conferees for keeping \nout a few of the most objectionable provisions that prevented passage \nof the bill during the last Congress, particularly the MTBE liability \nwaiver and the proposed drilling in ANWR. They took the right action in \npreventing the inclusion of those provisions. Unfortunately, after all \nthe time and effort spent on this issue during the past several years, \nwhen it comes to solving America's pressing energy problems, this bill \nsimply does not go far enough. It will not reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, it won't assure the growing threat of global warming is \naddressed in a meaningful way, and it wont effectively reduce the price \nof gasoline at the pump.\n  The estimated cost of this energy bill has ballooned far beyond the \noriginal $6.7 billion in the President's proposal. The conference \nagreement provides an estimated $14.5 billion in corporate subsidies \nand tax credits. And the tax package provides more than twice as many \nincentives to the oil, gas, coal and nuclear industries as it does to \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy--a significant change from the \nSenate-passed bill.\n  Indeed, big oil, coal and gas companies seem to be disproportionally \nfavored under this bill as most of the tax breaks going to traditional \nindustries. Only about 36 percent of the estimated tax package would go \nto renewable energy and cleaner burning vehicles. Even then, some of \nthe programs to promote renewable energy and alternative fuels are \nquestionable. A loan guarantee program that would cover up to 80 \npercent of the cost of developing new energy technologies was scored at \n$3.75 billion for the first 5 years. These\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nloans carry a 20- to 60-percent risk of default according to the CBO, \nand after the 5 years there are no limits on the amount of loans that \ncan be guaranteed, thus leaving the taxpayer to cover the losses when \nsuch endeavors fail. Perhaps more alarming, the estimated costs of the \nbill are estimates at best, and don't take into account some of the \nhidden costs associated with program authorizations and future tax \ncredit extensions.\n  And then there is the ambiguous realm of alternative fuels for \nvehicles. Rather than addressing the gas mileage interests of \nconsumers, this energy conference report would boost ethanol production \nby requiring 7.5 billion gallons of the corn-derived fuel be added to \nthe domestic gasoline supply by 2012. This is double the current \nethanol mandate and while it will be a boon for the ethanol producers, \nit will have a negligible effect on oil imports. While I fully \nrecognize and support efforts to promote clean energy sources, the \ncosts also need to be weighed against any presumed benefits. And at \nthis juncture, the beneficiaries are still the producers, not the \nconsumers and not the environment.\n\n  Let me mention some of the more ``interesting'' provisions in the \nconference report:\n  Section 134. Energy Efficiency Public Information Initiative. \nAuthorizes a total of $400 million, $90 million for Fiscal Years 2006 \nthrough 2010, for the Secretary of Energy to carry out a national \nconsumer information program to encourage energy efficiency through \ndisseminating information to the American public addressing, among \nother things, the importance of proper tire maintenance. I am fully \naware that it is important to rotate your tires, and to take other \nactions to preserve energy, but do we really need to spend almost half \na billion on such a campaign?\n  Section 138. Intermittent Escalator Study. Requires the GSA to study \nthe advantages and disadvantages of employing intermittent escalators \nin the United States. I can't imagine many of my colleagues would \nsupport removing ``Senators Only'' features in the Capitol Complex and \nbe content to wait for an elevator to intermittently show up, but maybe \nthe rest of the American public is more patient.\n  Section 207. Installation of Photovoltaic System. Authorizes $20 \nmillion for the GSA to install a photovoltaic system, as set forth in \nthe Sun Wall Design Project, for the Department of Energy headquarters \nbuilding. Of all the sunny places in this country where solar power is \nviable, the Energy Department Building in DC would not be the first \nplace that comes to mind.\n  Section 208. Sugar Cane Ethanol Program. Establishes a new $36 \nmillion program under EPA that is limited to sugar producers in the \nStates of Florida, Louisiana, Texans and Hawaii for 3 years.\n  Section 224. Royalties and Near-Term Production Incentives. Under \nthis section, all monies received by the U.S. on all lands except for \nthe State of Alaska, from sales, bonuses, rentals and royalties on \nleased Federal lands or geothermal resources shall be paid into the \nTreasury of the U.S. and a percentage of such funding is then partially \nredistributed to the State within the boundaries of which the revenues \nwere generated. But in the case of Alaska, seems that they will get to \nkeep all of the monies generated.\n  Section 237. Intermountain West Geothermal Consortium. Establishes an \nIntermountain West Geothermal Consortium that focuses on building \ncollaborative efforts among universities in the State of Idaho, other \nregional universities, State agencies and the Idaho National \nLaboratory, must be hosted and managed by Boise State University, and \nhave a directed appointed by the Boise State University. Why do we need \na federal law to promote collaboration at Boise State?\n  Section 244. Alaska State Jurisdiction Over Small Hydroelectric \nProjects. Amends the Federal Power Act with respect to certain \nauthorities for the State of Alaska, allowing the State to completely \nignore any recommendations received from the National Marine Fisheries \nService, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and State fish and \nwildlife agencies concerning conditions for the protection, mitigation, \nand enhancement of fish and wildlife in constructing small \nhydroelectric projects.\n  Section 245. Flint Creek Hydroelectric Project, located in Granite \nand Deer Lodge Counties, Montana. The bill basically extends the \nproject's permit for an additional 3 years. And, notwithstanding other \nlaws and regulations regarding payment to the U.S. for the use of \nFederal lands, such payments surrounding this project would be \nspecified in the bill. I can only assume this payment is less than what \nwould otherwise be required.\n  Section 354. Enhanced Oil and Natural Gas Production Through Carbon \nDioxide Injection. Establishes a $3 million demonstration program \nsolely for 10 projects in the Willistin Basin in North Dakota and \nMontana and 1 project in the Cook Inlet Basin in Alaska.\n  Section 356. Denali Commission. Authorizes $55 million annually for \nfiscal years 2006-2015 for a seven-member commission created in 1998 \ncomprised entirely of Alaska interests to support Alaska interests. \nThis funding would be used to carry out energy programs.\n  Section 365. Pilot Project to Improve Federal Permit Coordination. \nEstablishes a pilot that only the States of Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, \nUtah, and New Mexico can participate in.\n  Section 412. Loan to Place Alaska Clean Coal Technology Facility in \nService. This section authorizes a direct Federal loan for up to $80 \nmillion for a plant near Healy, Alaska. One of the few protections \nunder this section for the American taxpayer is extremely lax. It \nstates that prior to providing the loan, the Secretary determine that \n``there is a reasonable prospect that the borrower will repay the \nprincipal and interest on the loan.'' That sure doesn't sound like the \ntype of stringent criteria and risk assessment that would be weighed by \nmany lending institutions that I am aware of. And why does this \nparticular facility merit a Federal loan over other clean energy \ntechnologies?\n  Section 416. Electron Scrubbing Demonstration. Directs the Secretary \nto use $5 million to initiate, through the Chicago operations office, a \nproject to demonstrate the viability of high-energy electron scrubbing \ntechnology on commercial-scale electrical generation using high-sulfur \ncoal.\n  Section 628. Decommissioning Pilot Program. This section authorizes \n$16 million for a pilot program to commission and decontaminate the \nsodium cooled fast breeder experimental test site reactor located in \nnorthwest Arkansas.\n  Section 755. Conserve by Bicycling Program. Provides $6.2 million to \nestablish a pilot program to be known as the ``Conserve by Bicycling \nProgram'' and study the feasibility of converting motor vehicle trips \nto bicycle trips, including whether such factors make bicycle riding \nfeasible: weather, land use and traffic patterns, the carrying capacity \nof bicycles and bicycle infrastructure. I find it difficult to support \nspending $6.2 million to encourage Americans to ride bicycles when we \nare running a deficit of $368 billion this year and a 10-year projected \ndeficit of $1.35 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n\n  Section 756. Reduction of Engine Idling. Authorizes $139.5 million to \nstudy the environmental impact of engine idling from heavy-duty \nvehicles and locomotives at truck stops, ports of entry, rest areas and \nprivate terminals. Is there any doubt that engine idling may be \ncontributing to air quality problems? Do we need to expend almost $140 \nmillion on such a study? It might be cheaper to pay the truckers and \nengineers to shut off their engines.\n  Section 955. Department of Energy Civilian Nuclear Infrastructure and \nFacilities. Requires the Secretary to develop a comprehensive plan for \nfacilities at the Idaho National Laboratory to avoid duplicative \nefforts at other national laboratories and establish or consider plans \nto establish or convert various areas into user facilities.\n  Section 980. Spallation Neutron Source. Requires the Secretary \ndevelop an operational plan for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in \nOak Ridge, TN, to ensure the facility is employed to its full \ncapability. It further authorizes the Spallation Neutron Source Project \nat Oak Ridge at $1,411,700,000 for total project costs.\n  Section 997. Arctic Engineering Research Center. It directs the \nSecretary of Transportation to provide annual grants, worth $18 million \ntotal, to ``a\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nuniversity research center to be headquartered in Fairbanks''--that \nmust be the University of Alaska-Fairbanks according to its Web site--\nto establish and operate a university research center to research \nimproved performance of roads, bridges, residential, commercial, and \nindustrial structures in the Arctic region.\n  Section 1511. Renewable Fuel. The section authorizes a total of $12 \nmilliom--$4 million for 3 years--for a resource center to further \ndevelop bioconversion technology at the Center for Biomass-Based Energy \nat the Mississippi State University and the Oklahoma State University.\n  Section 1811. Coal Bed Methane Study. Directs the DOE and EPA to \ncollaborate with the NAS on a study on the effect of coalbed natural \ngas production on surface and ground water aquifers in Montana, \nWyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Utah.\n  Now that we know a little about some of the provisions contained in \nthe conference agreement, let's talk about one very important issue \nthat is not addressed--an issue of worldwide significance: global \nwarming.\n  Earlier this month, the leaders of the G8 nations met and issued an \nagreement with respect to climate change. The agreement among the G8 \nnation states that: ``We will act with resolve and urgency now to meet \nour shared and multiple objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions \n[.]''\n  This agreement followed the joint statement that was issued in June \nin which the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and national academies \nfrom other G8 countries, along with those of Brazil, China, and India, \nwhich concluded that: ``The scientific understanding of climate change \nis now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It \nis vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can \ntake now, to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions.''\n  It is very disappointing that the climate change provisions in the \nconference report fail to address the necessary commitment for taking \nurgent actions and making substantial reductions in greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  The conference report requires the Department of Energy to develop \ngreenhouse gas intensity technologies and strategies. Such requirements \nare a waste of time and effort as we already know that using the \ngreenhouse gas intensity does not work. How do we know it doesn't work? \nWe know because the Department of Energy has shown us and because \nclimate change science tells us that the climate system does not \nrespond to greenhouse gas intensity, but rather to greenhouse gas \nconcentration levels in the atmosphere.\n  Recently, the Energy Information Administration at the Department of \nEnergy released a statement indicating that preliminary data for the \nyear 2004 revealed that energy-related carbon emission intensity fell \nby 2.6 percent, while energy-related carbon dioxide emissions grew by \n1.7 percent. This is an early reality check for those who argue that we \ncan control greenhouse gas emissions by only controlling carbon \nemission intensity.\n  Again this clearly shows how our efforts to address climate change \nare misfocused and without substance. If we continue down this path, \nthe $5 billion per year that we are currently investing in the climate \nchange science and technology programs will not provide the return on \ninvestments that the American people deserve.\n  Furthermore, if you look at any credible scientific report on climate \nchange, it speaks of the impact of greenhouse gases on the climate \nsystem, not the impact of greenhouse gas intensity. In all the hearings \nthat we have held in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee over the past few years, I don't recall a single scientist \nindicating that if we control our greenhouse gas intensity, then we can \nmitigate the impacts of climate change.\n  If we are to address climate change consistent with the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution passed by this body just over a month ago, then we \nmust pursue solutions that will truly have an impact on the climate \nsystem, not those that are no more than ``smoke and mirrors.'' Of \ncourse, the conferees failed to agree to even include the modest \nresolution in the final conference agreement.\n  If it weren't for the pressing need to show the American public that \nwe are acting in at least some way to address our Nation's energy \nproblems--action that every person is reminded of every time they pay \nyet a higher price at the pump--I doubt many of my colleagues would be \nso rushed to pass this bill. Quite frankly, it seems as though the \nCongress is grasping at straws to address our energy quandary, \nunwilling or unable to use the foresight necessary to plan for a future \nAmerica that is less reliant on foreign oil, cleaner under renewable \nenergy generation, or leading in cutting-edge energy efficiency \ntechnology. And in our failure, the American people will be \ndisappointed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nbill conference agreement. The final version of this legislation is \nimperfect, but it takes important steps forward in addressing some of \nthis Nation's energy problems. This bill will strengthen electric \nreliability, further develop our renewable energy resources, and \nimprove energy efficiency.\n  I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Domenici and ranking \nmember Bingaman for their long and arduous work on this subject. We \nhave now been working on comprehensive energy legislation for nearly 5 \nyears, under three different Congresses and three different Energy \nCommittee chairmen. I know it has been a very difficult path. I express \nmy sincere appreciation to Chairman Domenici for his dedication, \nleadership, and willingness to accommodate a great diversity of views \non the subject of energy policy.\n  I am very pleased that the Energy bill provides nearly $3 billion for \nwind, biomass, and other renewable energy sources. This credit could \nhelp a major wind energy development project move forward in Aroostook \nCounty and will help Maine's forest products industry by providing an \nimportant revenue stream for waste forest products. Developing Maine's \nwind and biomass resources creates jobs in rural areas, provides \nadditional revenue to farmers and struggling industries, reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and helps diversify our energy supply. While \nI am disappointed that the bill does not contain the provision which I \nauthored, along with Senator Bingaman, to require that 10 percent of \nour electricity come from renewable energy sources by the year 2020, \nthe bill nevertheless makes important strides forward in developing our \nrenewable energy resources.\n  This bill will also help improve our electricity reliability by \ncreating new standards for the national electric transmission grid and \ncreating incentives to spur the creation of a stronger and more robust \ngrid. This bill also provides for improved market transparency, the \nfirst ever broad prohibition on market manipulation and filing false \ninformation, and new consumer protections for utility customers.\n  I am also pleased by a number of provisions included in the bill to \nhelp spur greater energy efficiency. Consumers will be able to take \nadvantage of tax credits for hybrid cars, solar water heaters, and \nenergy efficient improvements to existing homes. Additional tax credits \nwill spur energy-efficient appliances and alternative fueled vehicles, \nwhich will not only reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions but also \nreduce oil imports. In addition, a number of new Federal programs and \n15 new product standards will reduce natural gas use in 2020 by 1.1 \ntrillion cubic feet, and reduce peak electric demand by an amount \nequivalent to that produced by 85 power plants. All of these programs \nwill not only help protect the environment, but also help consumers \nsave money on their energy bills.\n  Several other provisions bear mentioning. I am pleased that the final \nlegislation retains the amendment which Senator Levin and I offered \nregarding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This amendment requires the \nDepartment of Energy to develop procedures for using the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve in such a way as to reduce the impact on taxpayers \nand energy consumers, while maximizing oil supplies and improving U.S. \nenergy security. This amendment will help mitigate the impact of the \nDepartment of Energy's misguided policies on the Nation's gasoline \nprices.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes language regarding ISO New\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nEngland's misguided Locational Installed Capacity plan, also known as \nLICAP. This language requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto very carefully weigh the concerns of Maine and other New England \nStates regarding this proposal. I am very concerned that the LICAP \nproposal would unnecessarily raise electricity rates in Maine, and I \nurge FERC to consider this issue very carefully.\n  While I believe the bill makes important progress in some areas, I am \nextremely concerned that this bill fails to stop our growing and \nincreasingly dangerous reliance on foreign oil. Regretfully, a \nprovision requiring that we save 1 million barrels of oil per day by \n2015 was dropped from the bill. This provision, which I co-authored, \nwas included in the Senate-passed bill, but removed by the House. In \naddition, I am disappointed that the bill does not require any increase \nin fuel economy standards for automobiles. Although the energy \nefficiency provisions for hybrid automobiles and alternative fuel \nvehicles are important steps forward, they are not enough. Four years \nago I released a report predicting that crude oil prices would hit $60 \nper barrel by the year 2010 unless we took aggressive action to \nincrease our energy efficiency and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. \nWithout greater energy efficiency measures, I am concerned that prices \nare likely to go even higher.\n  I am also concerned by a provision in the bill that would allow for \nan inventory of offshore oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental \nShelf, OCS. I am strongly opposed to oil exploration on restricted \nareas of the OCS, and I believe this inventory is pointless since this \nCongress has no intention of allowing drilling in these areas.\n  I would note that this bill is much improved over the 2003 conference \nreport which I could not in good conscience support. First, I am \npleased that this legislation does not include a very harmful liability \nwaiver for the manufacturers of MTBE. MTBE is a noxious chemical which \nhas polluted drinking water supplies in Maine and many other States. I \nsaw no justification for allowing the manufacturers to be let off the \nhook in terms of cleaning up this chemical, and I am grateful to \nChairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman for refusing to give in \nto those advocating for the waiver.\n  I am also very pleased with the improvements to the electricity title \nin this bill. The electricity provisions in this bill are good for the \nNortheast and have the potential to promote competitive markets which \nare more efficient, more reliable, and lower priced than we have now. I \nam pleased that the Carper-Collins provision to promote combined heat \nand power was retained in the bill.\n  While the legislation before us does not address our dangerous \nreliance on foreign oil, it nevertheless takes important steps to \nincrease our use of renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and \nstrengthen our electricity grid. While I am disappointed at some of the \nthings that were included in the bill as well as many things that were \nnot included, I nevertheless believe that the bill is a step in the \nright direction. Given our extremely high energy prices and an even \nmore dire energy crisis looming just over the horizon, I believe we \nsimply cannot afford to block needed improvements out of fear that they \ndo not go far enough, and I therefore intend to vote in favor of this \nlegislation. However, I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation \nas a first step, and to again address these issues next year and the \nyear after, until we finally begin to reduce our reliance on foreign \noil and provide a secure energy future for the United States.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, after 4 years, the Senate is on the verge \nof passing a comprehensive Energy bill. This important legislation will \nlessen America's reliance on foreign sources of energy, boost renewable \nresources, and provide reliable energy for the nation.\n  Putting this legislation together and keeping it within budget \nconstraints took hard work and perseverance. First, I thank the \nchairman and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, respectively. They \nprovided excellent leadership, and I know their staff stayed up many a \nsleepless night. They played an important role developing this bill.\n  I also thank my good friend Senator Grassley, the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his commitment to taking a balanced approach to \nenergy tax policy.\n  Let me take a moment and speak about the hard work of the Finance \nCommittee staff. The House and Senate bills took two very different \napproaches to tax policy. Conference negotiations were hard fought. We \nmade some tough decisions. But we got it done within budget limits \nlargely because we worked with a spirit of compromise and cooperation.\n  I also thank some staff members in particular. I appreciate the \ncooperation we received from the Republican staff, especially Kolan \nDavis, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, and Nick Wyatt.\n  I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate \nLegislative Counsel for their service.\n  I thank Chairman Bill Thomas and his staff for their hard work, \ncooperation and continuing willingness to work with us through the \ndifficult negotiations that produced this important legislation.\n  I also thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Ryan Abraham, and \nWendy Carey. I especially want to thank Matt Jones. He is the tax \ncounsel on our staff who has worked for years on the tax legislation in \nthis bill. His hard work and perseverance on this legislation went \nabove and beyond the call of duty. I owe him a deep debt of gratitude. \nI also thank our dedicated fellows, Mary Baker, Jorlie Cruz, Cuong \nHuynh, Richard Litsey, Stuart Sirkin, and Brian Townsend.\n  Finally, I thank our hard-working interns: Rob Grayson, Jacob \nKuipers, Heather O'Loughlin, Andrea Porter, Ashley Sparano, Julie \nStraus, Danny Shervin, Katherine Bitz, Drew Blewett, Adam Elkington, \nJulie Golder, and Paul Turner.\n  This legislation was a team effort that really paid off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to announce my support for the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. I want to thank Chairmen Grassley and \nDomenici and Senators Baucus and Bingaman for working with me to \ninclude renewable energy and energy efficiency provisions in the bill \nthat are important to my home State of Arkansas.\n  Some may say this bill is not perfect, but I believe it is a step \nforward toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil and increasing \nthe use of renewable resources in this country. This bill makes an \neffort to address energy concerns in every sector of this industry. In \nArkansas, we have investor-owned utilities and co-operatives. This bill \nwill help both of these providers serve their customers in a more \nefficient and reliable manner.\n  And while this bill may not go as far as some would like in the \ndirection of renewable energy, there are many provisions in this \npackage which will help the United States begin the long process of \neliminating our dependence on foreign oil. I look forward to the \nfurther growth and development of the biodiesel industry that will be \nspurred by the extension of the production tax credit provided in the \nbill that I have fought for during my time in the Senate.\n  Another provision of which I am particularly proud relates to the \ncleanup of the Southwest Experimental Fast Oxide Reactor, a \ndecommissioned nuclear reactor near the community of Strickler, AR, in \nthe northwest corner of my State. The site is contaminated with \nresidual radiation, liquid sodium, lead, asbestos, mercury, PCBs, and \nother environmental contaminants and explosive chemicals. The Federal \nGovernment helped create these contaminants and should pay to help \nclean them up. This is great news for northwest Arkansas, because this \nsite has threatened public health and the environment there for too \nlong.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the staff on both the Finance and \nEnergy Committee, majority and minority, for all of their help in \ncrafting this bill. Elizabeth Paris and Matt Jones have been patient \nand helpful with any idea or request I have come to them with. Sam \nFowler and Lisa Epifani have been equally accessible when I had \nquestions or concerns on the nontax portion of\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nthe bill. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Todd \nWooten of my staff who has done an incredible job of helping ensure my \npriorities for Arkansas were included in the final bill. This body \nwould be nothing without the tireless work of our staff, and I wanted \nto make sure they knew how much I appreciate their hard work.\n  In conclusion, our current global situation shows us how important it \nis that we take steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We all \nknow this bill is not a comprehensive solution, but a step in the right \ndirection. We must continue to look toward more useful and progressive \ntechnology that brings us to our goal.\n  Much more work needs to be done if we ever expect this country to \nlose its dependence on fossil fuel and foreign sources of energy, and I \nurge my colleagues to continue to work hard until we achieve this goal.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Energy \nbill conference report.\n  I have spoken on this floor many times before on Energy bills. I hope \nthe bill before us is the last one I come to the floor to speak on for \na long time.\n  While not perfect, this is a good bipartisan bill.\n  I want to thank Chairmen Domenici and Grassley and Ranking Members \nBingaman and Baucus for working hard in a bipartisan manner to produce \nthe bill before us.\n  This Energy bill strikes a balance between conservation and \nproduction.\n  And while passing an Energy bill might not help energy prices in the \nshort term, it will make a difference over the long term by affecting \nhow much our energy costs increase. This bill's increased domestic \nenergy production, coupled with increased conservation provisions, will \nslow the astronomical price increases we have seen lately.\n  Without a new national Energy policy, though, there is not much we \ncan do about the rising energy prices.\n  Many oil producers are working at full capacity.\n  And with China and India starting to increase their demands for oil, \nthe world's oil supply will continue to decrease while prices continue \nto increase.\n  This means that we cannot just try and conserve our way out of any \nkind of energy problem.\n  We have to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and do a better job of \ntaking care of our own energy needs.\n  The bill contains some good policy provisions.\n  It includes electricity provisions that are a good start to help \nupdate our electricity grid.\n  America has outgrown its electricity system and some changes need to \nbe made to it.\n  One of the provisions included in the bill is PUCHA repeal, which \nwill go a long way in helping our electricity system meet increasing \ndemands.\n  The bill also makes strides to increase the reliability of the \nelectricity grid.\n  We also desperately need new transmission lines built, and I hope \nthat the provisions in this bill will ensure that this happens.\n  It also contains an incentives title which will encourage the design \nand deployment of innovative technology to increase energy supply and \nalso protect the environment. These incentives cover projects such as \nclean coal, electric transmission and generation, and fuel efficient \nvehicles.\n  I am glad that the Senate Energy bill contains clean coal provisions \nwhich I wrote to help increase domestic energy production while also \nimproving environmental protection.\n  Coal is an important part of our energy plans. It's cheap and \nplentiful, and we don't have to go far to get it.\n  For my home State, this means more jobs and a cleaner place to live. \nClean coal technology is estimated to create 62,000 jobs nationwide and \ncut emissions from coal drastically.\n  The Energy bill encourages research and development of clean coal \ntechnology by authorizing over $1 billion for the Department of Energy \nto conduct programs to advance new technology that will significantly \nreduce emissions and increase efficiency of turning coal into \nelectricity.\n  Almost $2 billion will be used for the clean coal power initiative, \nwhere the Department of Energy will work with industry to advance \nefficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness of new \nclean coal technologies.\n  And $3 billion will be used to help coal companies comply with \nemission regulations by providing funding for pollution control \nequipment.\n  The energy tax package also contains tax credits for companies to \nimplement clean coal technology.\n  The bill provides $1.6 billion in tax credits for investment in clean \ncoal facilities. It also provides over $1 billion in tax credits for \namortization of pollution control equipment to help clean up the \nemission from existing coal facilities.\n  Coal plays an important role in our economy, providing over 50 \npercent of the energy needed for our Nation's energy.\n  The 21st economy is going to require increased amounts of reliable, \nclean, and affordable electricity to keep our nation running.\n  With research advances, we have the know-how to better balance \nconservation with the need for increased production.\n  I think this bill makes a good start in ensuring that coal remains a \nviable energy source that can provide cheap power to consumers.\n  And the other tax provisions from the Finance Committee will do a \ngood job to promote conservation and energy efficiency further by \nencouraging the use of cleaner burning fuels.\n  I am pleased the bill contains ethanol and biodiesel tax credits. \nThese expanded tax credits will further encourage the use of these \nalternative fuels to help increase domestic production and lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil. This also is good for farmers and is good \nfor jobs.\n  We have deliberated and discussed for far too long the need for \nAmerica to follow a sensible, long-term energy strategy.\n  I am glad the Senate acted to pass an Energy bill.\n  This is good for our environment, economy, and national security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against this energy bill \nbecause it does not do enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nthrough the promotion of alternative forms of energy or by encouraging \nenergy efficiency.\n  I was very disappointed that the conference committee eliminated the \nSenate's renewable portfolio standard, under which utilities would have \nprovided 10 percent of their total sales from renewable resources by \n2020. In addition, the conference also eliminated the Senate provision \nthat called on the President to find ways to reduce oil use by 1 \nmillion barrels per day by 2025, as well as the provision promoting \nhybrids for use in Federal, State, and other vehicle fleets.\n  I am also very concerned about an authorization for an inventory of \nenergy resources in America's Outer Continental Shelf, which is \ndamaging in itself and may lead to future oil and gas development in \nsome coastal areas.\n  Overall, this bill is very imbalanced. The bill provides $5.7 billion \nin tax incentives over 10 years for the fossil fuel industry and $1.5 \nbillion in subsidies and tax breaks for the nuclear industry. Compare \nthis to tax incentives for renewable electricity, alternative vehicles \nand fuels, energy efficiency, and energy conservation, which were cut \nfrom $11.4 billion in the Senate bill to $5.8 billion in the final \nbill.\n  With all of these bad provisions, I am pleased that a few good \nprovisions survived, such as my amendment calling on the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to conclude action on energy crisis refunds by \nthe end of the year or report to Congress explaining what it has done \nand specifying a timetable for the rest of their process\n  I am also pleased that this energy bill will exempt California from \nthe proposed new ethanol mandate during the summer months, when ethanol \nusage in gasoline can increase air pollution, and that it included my \noriginal proposal to encourage the production of ethanol from \nagricultural waste.\n  Republicans removed many provisions from the Senate bill that would \nhave put us on a more energy-efficient path, and unfortunately we were \nleft with a bill that does not offer the sound and innovative policies \nwe need to reduce our dependence on foreign\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\noil, protect the environment, and improve our energy and fuel \nefficiency.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise today not only to cast my support for the \nconference report to H.R. 6, an energy bill that touches on nearly \nevery aspect of domestic energy production, consumption, and savings, \nbut especially to compliment Energy and Natural Resources chair, \nSenator Domenici, for once again showing what a truly superb leader he \nis. He and Senator Grassley, chair of the Finance Committee, have been \nsuccessful in reaching bipartisan agreement on comprehensive energy \nlegislation--something that we have not been able to do since 1992, \neven though we have actively attempted to do so in the last three \nCongresses.\n  I would have written a more ambitious bill that would have more \naggressively reduced our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, but this \nis an improvement over the status quo. What this legislation does \ninclude is essential energy efficiency and conservation tax incentives \nthat will make our Nation's energy policy more balanced. As a Nation, \nwe must recognize that we must do more than just produce our way out of \nan energy crisis, we have an obligation to consume less as well.\n  For instance, by improving fuel economy standards of our cars and \ntrucks, we could have saved our Nation 1 million barrels of oil a day, \nas Senator Feinstein and I have attempted to do for these last several \nyears. Also, by keeping Senator Bingaman's provisions for Climate \nChange and Renewable Portfolio Standards in the conference report, we \nwould have had a much stronger bill to address our future energy, \nenvironmental, and economic needs. But this bipartisan energy \nlegislation is a reflection of what was possible. These important \nissues will not go away, we will be addressing them another day--and in \nthe not-too-distant-future, I will predict.\n  While the report came out of conference far from perfect, the \nquestion we need to ask ourselves at the end of the day is, Does the \nlegislation begin to take the Nation forward for responsible energy \npolicy to help decrease our dependence on foreign oil from the most \nvolatile areas of the globe as we begin the 21st century? And this bill \ndoes take at least that small step forward, especially for provisions I \nbelieve in--greater energy efficiencies and energy from renewable \nsources that begin to wean the Nation off of its thirst for oil.\n  For instance, I am extremely pleased that I could secure $1.7 billion \nthrough the energy efficiency and conservation provisions from my \noriginal bills, the Efficient Energy Through Certified Technologies and \nElectricity Reliability, or EFFECTER, Act of 2005. I would like to \nexpress thanks for assistance over the past 5 years in drafting these \nenergy efficiency tax incentives to Dr. David B. Goldstein of NRDC, a \n2002 MacArthur fellowship winner who has worked on energy efficiency \nand energy policy since the early 1970s, both domestically and \ninternationally.\n  Also provided are tax incentives from the Lieberman-Snowe fuel cell \nbill that provide a 30-percent business energy credit for the purchase \nof qualified fuel cell power plants for businesses, along with a 10-\npercent credit for the purchase of stationary microturbine power \nplants. A fuel cell is a device that uses any hydrogen-rich fuel, such \nas natural gas, methane, or propane, to generate electricity and \nthermal energy through an electrochemical process. Since no combustion \nis involved, fuel cells produce almost no air pollution and reduce \nemissions of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas blamed for \nclimate change. The tax incentive will accelerate commercialization of \na wide range of fuel cell technologies for a distributed source of \npower.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I worked with \nChairman Grassley to also secure $2.7 billion in alternative energy \nproduction tax credits in this energy legislation. Included for the \nfirst time is a tax credit for biomass, which is extremely important to \nthose who work at our Maine biomass plants, which provide good paying \njobs in rural areas all over Maine. In addition, the tax credit \nextension for wind power is essential for wind projects in Maine, for \ninstance the one planned in Mars Hill. This legislation will decrease \nthe project's costs by 30 percent.\n  Also included in H.R. 6 is the permanent authorization of the \nNortheast Home Heating Oil Reserve that was established in 2000. The \nNHOR holds 2 million barrels of emergency fuel stocks stored at \ncommercial tank farms that would give Northeast consumers adequate \nsupplies for approximately 10 days, the time required for ships to \ncarry heating oil from the Gulf of Mexico to New York Harbor. The \nreserve is essential for cold winter States like Maine--especially at a \ntime when fuel prices continue to be sky high. While we are in the \nmidst of a very warm summer, our winters are never that far off, and \nthis provision ensures that emergency fuel stocks are made available in \ntimes of need.\n  And speaking of cold weather, the conference report reauthorizes the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance program, or LIHEAP, until 2007, and \nreauthorizes State weatherization grant and energy programs at $2.1 \nbillion through fiscal year 2008. I cannot emphasize strongly enough \nhow important these programs are to my State of Maine where winters \ncome early and can stay well past the start of spring.\n\n  There is an extension 5 years for my original legislation, the \nNational Oilheat Research Act; NORA which expired in February.\n  Also, the conference report puts in place enforceable electricity \nreliability standards that were included in my EFFECTER Act and other \nbills that would further improvements in the electricity grid at a time \nthat the surging demand continues to stress the Nation's power grid. \nOne only needs to recall that in August 2003, a big Northeast blackout \ndisrupted service to 50 million people, and 2 years earlier, soaring \nprices and isolated blackouts rolled across California.\n  One of the International Climate Change Taskforce, ICCT \nrecommendations, for which I am a cochair with the Right Honorable \nStephen Byers of the United Kingdom, called for incentives for \nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle; IGCC, a process that allows \nCO2 to be extracted for storage more easily and at less cost \nthan from conventional coal-burning plants. Clean coal technology helps \nto address climate change by capturing CO2 rather than \nallowing it to be released into the atmosphere and has immediate \nbenefits health benefits in terms of reduced emissions of toxic \npollutants that cause respiratory and cardiovascular illness. The bill \nprovides a 20-percent credit for clean coal power plants for IGCC \nplants while other advanced clean-coal projects get the 15-percent \ncredit.\n  There disappointments to me in this bill, most certainly, as they \ncould affect my State. In particular was the vote loss that would have \ngiven States equal say on the siting of Liquified Natural Gas, LNG, \nsiting decisions, but the language in H.R. 6 has been enhanced to give \nthe States a more consultative role, even though FERC still has \nexclusive jurisdiction. A pre-NEPA National Environmental Policy Act \nfiling process is included in the bill so the FERC will have to work \nwith States on problems before moving any projects forward. Also \nincluded is a cost-sharing provision calling for both the industry and \ncommunities to share the cost for emergency response plans. Originally, \nonly the communities had to pay for these plans.\n  I will continue to work to ensure that States have greater authority \nover LNG siting decisions. I believe this is clearly a States rights \nissue--and given how contentious these decisions are, it only makes \nsense to have State input into the process. As I have said before, this \nis a Liquified Natural Gas facility siting we are talking about, not a \nWal-Mart.\n  Another issue I plan to actively work on with my colleagues from \nother coastal States is the deletion of a provision that calls for an \ninventory of oil reserves off the Outer Continental Shelf. I believe \nthose of us from coastal States did everything in our power to strip \nthis potentially environmentally dangerous provision out of the Energy \nbill. Our amendment during Senate consideration of the Energy bill--\ndespite our best efforts--failed. We did everything we could to have \nthis provision removed--we presented our case to our colleagues and had \na fair up-or-down vote. It is a terrible policy that imperils our \nfragile coastal ecosystems and fisheries around Georges Bank, a \nveritable nursery for sea life.\n  Mr. Chairman, what we have here is a step forward as we begin the \n21st century and great energy needs that will\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nhave to be met, and we continue to craft national energy policy--we \nhave only begun to do so with many steps ahead of us to take.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to finish \na very long journey in the quest to build a dynamic, comprehensive \nenergy policy for the United States of America. I can say with pride \nthat this Congress, through many trials and tribulations has now \nperformed admirably in its duty to the American people. This is a \nbalanced energy bill that focuses as much on the future as it does the \npresent. We have the opportunity with the passage of this legislation \nto safely produce more energy from more sources and with more \ninfrastructure security then ever before.\n  Among the many people whose hard work has made the difference, I must \nfirst thank the chairmen and ranking members of all the appropriating \ncommittees that have been involved in this process.\n  Credit must also go to all members of my staff, who spent many hours \nsifting through the nuts and bolts of this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark \nPrater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Kurt Kovarik, John Good, and \nNick Wyatt showed great dedication to the tasks before them.\n  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his \nstaff was imperative. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, \nPatrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth, Matt Jones, and \nRyan Abraham.\n  I also want to mention George K. Yin, the chief of staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and his staff, especially the fuel fraud and \nenergy team of Tom Barthold, John Navratil, Deirdre James, Roger \nColinvaux, Allen Littman, Gray Fontenot, and Gary Bornholdt as well as \nthe always invaluable assistance of Mark Mathiesen, Jim Fransen and \nMark McGunagle of Senate legislative counsel.\n  This conference agreement is infused with the spirit of bipartisan \nand bicameral cooperation. It is my commitment that spirit will be \ninfluential to the entire ongoing legislative process.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to vote on final passage of \nthe most comprehensive energy bill in decades.\n  After years of careful and patient negotiation, we have before us an \nenergy plan that promises to make America safer and more secure, and \nour energy supply cleaner and more reliable.\n  It is a forward-looking plan. And it is a plan that will increase \nboth our economic and national security.\n  Anyone who has been to the gas pump, or turned on their AC for some \nrelief from the current heat wave, knows that energy prices are \nskyrocketing.\n  Suddenly, instead of the lowest energy prices in the industrialized \nworld, we have the highest.\n  Because of high natural gas prices, manufacturing and chemical jobs \nare moving overseas. Farmers are taking a pay cut. Consumers are paying \ntoo much to be comfortable in their own homes. Small businesses are \nstruggling to pay their bills.\n  Communities across the country are suffering. And as many as 2.7 \nmillion manufacturing jobs have been lost.\n  All the while, we have grown dangerously reliant on foreign sources \nof energy. And some of those foreign sources do not have our best \ninterests at heart.\n  In the 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. produced almost as much oil as \nwe consumed. Imports were relatively small. But since then, U.S. oil \nproduction has been on the decline, while consumption has steadily \nincreased. As a result, we have become more and more dependent on \nimported oil.\n  Twenty years ago, 75 percent of crude oil used in American refineries \ncame from American sources. Only 25 percent came from abroad.\n  Today, that equation is nearly reversed. We have become dangerously \ndependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. As a result, \nAmerica is more vulnerable than ever to the use of energy as a \npolitical weapon.\n  Many nondemocratic and corrupt governments maintain their hold on \npower by spending the oil profits they earn from selling to us.\n  We see this happening in Venezuela, We currently import over 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day from Venezuela. Meanwhile, its dictatorial \nPresident, Hugo Chavez, actively opposes the Umted States, supports \nrogue states such as Cuba, and is destabilizing Latin America.\n  Many of these same dynamics are also at work in the Middle East. \nNondemocratic regimes in the Middle East are using their oil revenues \nto tighten their grip on the reins of power.\n  As a result, the conditions that breed hatred, violence, and terror \nhave been allowed to fester and spread terror all over the world. \nLondon, Madrid, Russia, Bali, Iraq, and, of course, the United States \nhave all suffered terribly at the hands of the terrorists.\n  Passing the energy bill today will be a major step forward in \naddressing these serious national security challenges by putting us on \na path to energy independence.\n  It will also be a major step forward for our economic productivity \nand prosperity.\n  The energy bill promises to deliver exciting new technologies to \nincrease our efficiency and lessen our dependence, Hydrogen fuel cells \nare one example.\n  If just 20 percent of cars used fuel cell technology, we could cut \noil imports by 1.5 million barrels every day.\n  The energy bill authorizes $3.7 billion to support hydrogen and fuel \ncell research and the infrastructure we need to move toward this goal.\n  Last month, Senator Hatch and I had the opportunity to attend a \nhydrogen car demonstration here at the Capitol. The cars were stylish. \nThey drove well. The technology was very promising.\n  Hybrid cars are already gaining in popularity. Nissan recently \nannounced that its first hybrvehicle will be built at their plant in \nSmyrna, TN.\n  This is one example of how technology can simultaneously promote \nconservation and efficiency, and boost the manufacturing sector.\n  In addition, the energy bill's conservation and energy efficiency \nprovisions far exceed those of other energy bills considered by the \nCongress in recent years.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, \nthe Energy bill will save $1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas by \n2020, equivalent to the current annual consumption of the whole State \nof New York.\n  It will reduce peak electric demand by 50,000 megawatts by 2020, the \nequivalent of 170 new power plants.\n  This bill encourages the use of home-grown renewable fuels such as \nethanol and biodiesel, as well as wind and solar and geothermal energy.\n  The ethanol mandate will require fuel manufacturers to use 7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol in gasoline by 2012. This provision alone \nwill reduce oil consumption by 80,000 barrels of oil a day by 2012; \ncreate over a quarter of a million new jobs; increase U.S. household \nincome by $43 billion; all adding $200 billion to the GDP between 2005 \nand 2012.\n  It provides incentives to facilitate the development of cutting-edge \ntechnologies like coal gasification and advanced nuclear plants, which \nwill produce clean, low-carbon energy to help address the issue of \nglobal climate change.\n  And it will modernize and expand our Nation's electricity grid to \nenhance reliability and help prevent future blackouts.\n  This change in particular is long overdue. We are once again seeing \nthe strain on our aging electrical grid as people turn up the AC to \ndeal with the current heat wave.\n  In fact, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported that yesterday's \ndemand for electricity reached an all-time record level of almost \n32,000 megawatts, breaking a record that had been set just the day \nbefore.\n  The Energy bill will help us both conserve more energy, and produce \nmore energy. It will also help produce more jobs.\n  It is estimated that the Energy bill will save over 2 million jobs \nand create hundreds of thousands more.\n  As I mentioned, the ethanol provision is expected to generate over \n230,000 new jobs.\n  Incentives for wind-generated energy are expected to create another \n100,000 jobs.\n  The investment in clean coal technology will create 62,000 jobs. And \n40,000 new jobs in the solar industry will come on line These are good \njobs, well paying, and right here at home.\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\n  The Energy bill is good for America. It will move our country toward \na more reliable supply of clean, affordable energy.\n  I thank my colleagues for the hard work and leadership. Special \nrecognition goes to the Energy Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, \nand his ranking member, Senator Bingaman.\n  Senator Domenici's expertise on energy issues is unparalleled in the \nU.S. Senate, as he has demonstrated for a number of years on both the \nEnergy Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  His determination to produce a comprehensive national energy policy, \nand his hard work with Senator Bingaman, as well as members of the \nEnergy Committee, is the reason why we stand here, today, on the cusp \nof final passage of a balanced, bipartisan Energy bill.\n  And finally, special recognition goes to President Bush for his \nunwavering commitment to delivering an energy plan for the 21st \ncentury.\n  He came into office determined to deliver an energy plan that makes \nAmerica safer and more secure. And soon he will have a bill to sign \ninto law that does just that.\n  Every day we are working hard to deliver meaningful solutions to the \nAmerican people. The Energy bill promises to keep America moving \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, with regard to this bill, I want to \nacknowledge, of course, all of the very complimentary statements many \ncolleagues have made about the good work Senator Domenici and I did on \nthis bill. Clearly, I have myself complimented Senator Domenici for his \nleadership in this regard many times. The fact is this bill is the \nresult of much good work by many Members, much good work by the staffs \nof our committee and the staffs of many Members individually, and work \nthat has occurred over a very long period of time. So I think some of \nthe relief some of us are feeling as a result of seeing this finally \ncome to completion is because of the multiple years that have gone into \nthis effort to get a bill we could agree upon.\n  Every time a bill, particularly a bill of this size and \ncomprehensiveness, comes to the Senate floor, it requires a balancing \nof those provisions which are positive and constructive with those that \nare less so, and in some cases are negative. I feel very strongly that \nthe positive outweighs the negative in this bill. There are many \nprovisions that will move us in the right direction.\n  My colleagues have been alluding to those this morning in many of \ntheir statements and there are things we need to come back and try to \ncorrect in the future, and we will have that opportunity. There are \nissues we were unable to address in this bill that we will hopefully be \nable to address in the coming months that I think also need to be \nmentioned. All of the discussion has been useful. All of the good work, \nparticularly of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee members, has \nbeen appreciated.\n  I again appreciate very much the process that has been followed in \ngetting us to this point. I compliment all colleagues, and I yield the \nfloor. I know Senator Domenici wishes to make a final statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that a list of staff men and \nwomen who helped put this conference together be printed in the Record. \nI commend them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows: \n\n       Judy Pensabene, Karen Billups, Dick Bouts, Kathryn Clay, \n     Kellie Donnelly, Lisa Epifani, Marnie Funk, Frank Gladics, \n     Angela Harper, Colin Hayes, Frank Macchiarola, John Peschke, \n     and Clint Williamson.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill will produce more jobs for our \ncountry, more secure jobs, and we will be using cleaner energy in the \nfuture. This will happen across America, and it will happen in the \nState of Wisconsin.\n  Also, I would like to say to everyone here, our electrical system \nwill be safer and more sound. We may very well have nuclear powerplants \nbuilt anew for the first time in years. Renewable energy will be \nadvanced and enhanced dramatically. Some do not believe ethanol will be \na significant contributor to less dependence on foreign oil. They are \nmistaken. We will, within the next 7 or 8 years, make a major \ncontribution to jobs, stability of the agricultural community, and the \nproduction of ethanol as a substitute for gasoline.\n  In addition, we will enhance our supply of natural gas, thus \nstabilizing the price, which is one of the most significant things for \nAmerica's future. If we cannot do that and the reverse happens, we will \nexport hundreds of thousands of jobs. While everyone thinks that the \nonly problem is gasoline, the problem is far bigger than gasoline \nprices tomorrow morning; it is what will be the state of energy 5 and \n10 years from now in the United States.\n  I can tell my colleagues, we will be safer, we will have more jobs, \nwe will have an electric system that is safe and sound. We will have \ndiversity of energy sources and supplies built in our country, spending \nour money, creating jobs, and much more.\n  Frankly, it is very easy to criticize a bill of this magnitude, and \nit is very easy to say we did not solve everything.\n  I close by saying there is criticism that we did not do anything to \nalleviate our great dependence on crude oil. I think we did. Hybrid \ncars are accentuated and pushed ahead by tax credits. I just explained \nethanol. But if anybody thinks right now we can pass in the Congress a \nbill to substantially change the American way of using automobiles, I \nask them to stand up, and we will put it on the Senate floor next week \nand see if they can do it. We cannot order Americans to buy smaller \ncars, little tiny cars, and we cannot order them to stop buying cars. \nThat will happen. It is going to happen, and we are going to have more \nefficient ones clearly in short order in this country, but we cannot do \neverything in this bill. We have done a great deal.\n  My compliments to Senator Bingaman. I am glad this was a totally \nbipartisan bill, totally open in every respect. I think we have proved \nthat on a major, contentious bill, we can have open, above-board, total \nparticipation by any Senator who wants to participate. In conference, \nthe same with the press of having all of the amendments and everything \nwe do so they can do what they would like with the American people and \nyet get an agreed-upon bill.\n  That is a pretty good accomplishment on the part of Senator Bingaman, \nmyself, as the leaders in the Senate, and Congressman Barton and \nCongressman Dingell in the House.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senate for permitting me to produce \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9367-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9367-S9373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nequally divided on the conference report accompanying H.R. 2361.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Interior \nappropriations conference report and to speak about two key provisions: \none to protect our veterans and one to protect our kids.\n  First, the conference report includes a much needed $1.5 billion \nsupplemental spending package for veterans health care. This $1.5 \nbillion will cover the massive budgetary shortfall that Congress only \nrecently discovered, and I hope this will prevent the loss of some \nimportant veterans health care services.\n  Earlier this year, I, along with my Democratic colleagues on the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, repeatedly asked the Department of \nVeterans Affairs if the President's budget provided sufficient funds \nfor veterans health care. The response we received was yes, the funds \nare sufficient.\n  Unfortunately, that response was not consistent with what folks on \nthe ground were saying about VA health care services. They complained \nof long waiting periods for doctor's appointments, reduced office hours \nat veterans clinics, an increased demand for services, and reduced \naccess. These voices were too loud to ignore, so I joined my colleagues \nSenator Murray and Senator Akaka here on the floor of the Senate to ask \nfor additional funding for VA health care. Those efforts were\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\ndefeated, but we knew that a possible crisis was on its way.\n  That crisis became a reality when it was discovered that the VA was \nmore than $1.5 billion in the hole on its health care funding. Like \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate, I was shocked by that admission.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Murray in cosponsoring both a stand-\nalone bill and an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to get \nveterans the funding they need so they can get the health care that \nthey have earned and deserve.\n  The $1.5 billion appropriated by today's Interior appropriations \nconference report will help ensure that our Nation's veterans get that \nhealth care. With this funding, our veterans facilities also will get \nthe maintenance they need, and I hope the VA will be able to keep its \nhands out of its rainy day fund.\n  I don't think there is sone person in this Senate who would want to \ntell a returning soldier who fought and bled for our country: Sorry, \nbut when it comes to getting health care, you are on your own.\n  I was right. The inclusion of this provision in the conference report \nproves that we can work together to do what is necessary for our \nNation's veterans.\n  I thank Senator Murray, Senator Craig, and Senator Akaka for their \nleadership on this issue. I hope we can work together--as we do today--\nto ensure that veterans are not shortchanged next year. They deserve \nbetter.\n  Second, I want to thank my colleagues for including an amendment in \nthe conference report that is important to parents of small children \nall over the country but particularly in my hometown of Chicago. I am \nreferring to my amendment prohibiting EPA from spending tax dollars to \ndelay the promulgation of regulations that are now 9 years overdue. \nThese regulations, when promulgated, would require contractors to \nreduce lead paint exposure during home renovation and remodeling.\n  I have raised this issue with EPA on numerous occasions and reminded \nthem of the serious health dangers that high blood lead levels pose for \nchildren. Now, reluctantly, EPA officials have promised me these rules \nwill be issued by the end of the year. I intend to use this amendment \nto hold them to their word. So today when we pass this funding bill, I \ncan tell the youngest, poorest citizens of Illinois that Congress is \ndoing its part to keep them safe from lead paint exposure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to EPA Administrator Johnson \nregarding this issue be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Stephen L. Johnson,\n     Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Johnson: As you may know, I have been \n     concerned about the failure of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2682(c)(3). This provision requires EPA to issue rules \n     for contractors to reduce lead exposure during home \n     renovation and remodeling by October 1996. Almost nine years \n     later, these rules still have not been issued, and I have \n     spent the past few months trying to understand why.\n       When your nomination was considered by the Senate \n     Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee in April, I \n     asked you when EPA was going to issue these rules. You stated \n     that EPA was focusing on a voluntary education and outreach \n     program and ``will evaluate the effectiveness of this effort \n     and will determine what additional steps may be necessary, \n     including regulation.'' Of course, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2682(c)(3) \n     does not give EPA the option of whether to promulgate \n     regulations.\n       In May, Sen. Boxer, Rep. Waxman, and I wrote a follow-up \n     letter to you, asking once again when EPA would issue these \n     rules on lead. We received no response for two months.\n       In June, I included an amendment in the EPA appropriations \n     bill that would prohibit the agency from spending any funds \n     to delay the implementation of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2682(c)(3). \n     That bill passed the Senate unanimously.\n       When Deputy Administrator-designate Marcus Peacock appeared \n     before the EPW Committee two weeks ago, I asked him about the \n     status of these lead rules. Responding to written questions \n     that I submitted to him after the hearing, Mr. Peacock \n     stated: ``As I understand it, the Agency will announce by the \n     end of this year a comprehensive program, which will include \n     a proposed regulation, as well as an extensive education and \n     outreach campaign aimed at the renovation, repair, and \n     painting industry and the consumer.''\n       I am pleased by Mr. Peacock's statement, which is a \n     significant departure from your response in April. I am also \n     encouraged by a letter I received last week from Susan Hazen, \n     Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator, responding to my \n     May letter. Ms. Hazen reiterated that ``the Agency plans to \n     announce by the end of this year, a comprehensive program \n     that will include a proposed rule.''\n       In light of the commitments I received from Mr. Peacock and \n     Ms. Hazen, I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr. Peacock for \n     the deputy administrator position. However, I want you to \n     know that I will be closely monitoring EPA's actions \n     regarding lead paint and will expect you to honor your \n     commitment to issue these proposed rules by December 31, \n     2005.\n       I look forward to working with you on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Interior appropriations conference \nreport before us today is a very important piece of legislation. This \nconference report contains over $26.2 billion to fund the Department of \nthe Interior, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the Indian Health Service, among \nmany others. This represents an increase of approximately $500 million \nover the administration's budget request. While I appreciate the \nimportance of funding the programs in this legislation, I am \ndisappointed that we have once again exceeded the requested level of \nspending.\n  One bright note of this bill is the correction of the funding \nshortfall for the Department of Veterans Affairs' health care programs \nthat was only recently brought to the attention of Congress. I am \npleased that we have all acted quickly to provide an additional $1.5 \nbillion in emergency funding for the VA.\n  This bill contains several accounts which are designated as \n``Congressional Priorities.'' I fully recognize that Congress has a \nresponsibility to fund important projects, but we need to follow the \nproper process in doing so. To put it simply, if there is a \ncongressional priority that is not included in the administration's \nrequest, we should get it authorized through the appropriate committee \nand then set aside the necessary funds.\n  It has become standard practice around here to forgo the authorizing \nprocess and simply do everything on appropriations. That is wrong and \nit needs to stop. Congressional priorities should be subjected to the \nscrutiny of public hearings and debate--they should not be held up as \nsome type of sacred cows that are not to be questioned. We can no \nlonger afford to fund every pet project simply because a Member of \nCongress considers it to be imperative.\n  Let me highlight a few of the projects that are contained in this \nbill: $1.2 million for eider and sea otter recovery at the Alaska Sea \nLife Center; $200,000 for landscaping at the Gettysburg Military Park \nin Pennsylvania; $200,000 for the George Washington Memorial Parkway \nright here in the Washington, DC, area; $450,000 for the Automobile \nNational Heritage area in Detroit, MI; $150,000 for the Actors Theatre \nin Kentucky; $150,000 for the Black Horse Tavern in Pennsylvania; over \n$6 million to rehabilitate bathhouses at the Hot Springs National Park \nin Arkansas; $2.5 million for the Southwest Pennsylvania Heritage \nCommission; $11.1 million for the Old Faithful Inn at Yellowstone \nNational Park; $5.3 million for Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan; \n$200,000 for a diamondback terrapin study. That's one expensive turtle; \n$400,000 to survey and monitor the ivory-billed woodpecker in Arkansas; \n$150,000 for the Alaska Whaling Commission; $98,000 for the Alaska Sea \nOtter Commission; $200,000 for maple research in Vermont; $1.8 million \nfor restoration of the Long Island Sound; $4 million for water system \ntechnology in Kentucky, New Hampshire, Alaska, Pennsylvania, Missouri, \nMontana, Illinois, and Mississippi. Interesting--what is it that all of \nthese States have in common? The answer is that they are all \nrepresented by a member of the Appropriations Committee; $350,000 for a \ntree planting program in Milwaukee, WI; $500,000 for the Hinkle Creek \nwatershed study in Oregon; $500,000 for a\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nhardwood scanning center at Purdue University in Indiana; and $400,000 \nfor a wood technology center in Ketchikan, AK.\n  Another troubling aspect of the appropriations process is the way in \nwhich we have become complacent with the routine violations of the \nrules of both the Senate and the House that occur on these bills. The \nrules of both bodies clearly state that it is not in order to legislate \non an appropriations bill. Senate rule XVI states, ``The Committee on \nAppropriations shall not report an appropriation bill containing \namendments to such bill proposing new or general legislation . . .'' \nAnd House rule XXI states, ``A provision changing existing law may not \nbe reported in a general appropriation bill.'' Sadly, these directives \nare routinely ignored in this process by the inclusion of legislative \nlanguage and policy changes on appropriations bills.\n  Let me point out just a few examples of these violations that are \ncontained in this conference report: Language prohibiting the closure \nof the underground lunchroom at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New \nMexico. Language prohibiting the demolition of a bridge between New \nJersey and Ellis Island. Language authorizing the Secretary of the \nInterior to acquire lands for the operation of Ellis, Governors, and \nLiberty Islands. Language prohibiting the demolition of structures on \nthe Zephyr Shoals property in Lake Tahoe, NV.\n\n  So as not to be viewed as unappreciative, I would like to comment on \none aspect of this measure with which I was pleased. In this bill, \nthere is over $3.2 billion for the State and Tribal Assistance Grant \nProgram. These funds are earmarked for 257 various projects around the \ncountry. Last year, this same account contained 667 earmarks. I have \nlong been critical of the number of earmarks contained in this section, \nand I commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for their \nrestraint in this area.\n  I am, however, still concerned with the number of earmarks contained \nin this and many of the other annual appropriations bills. Mr. \nPresident, the process of earmarking funds in appropriations bills has \nsimply lurched out of control. According to a report issued by the \nCongressional Research Service, in fiscal year 1994 there were 4,126 \nearmarks in the then 13 annual appropriations bills. That number grew \nto 14,040 earmarks in fiscal year 2004. That is an increase of 240 \npercent in just 10 years.\n  It is clear that, with our ever-growing mandatory entitlement \nspending coupled with our shrinking discretionary accounts, we are on \nthe road to fiscal disaster. At a conference in February 2005, David \nWalker, the Comptroller General of the United States, said this:\n\n       If we continue on our present path, we'll see pressure for \n     deep spending cuts or dramatic tax increases. GAO's long-term \n     budget simulations paint a chilling picture. If we do \n     nothing, by 2040 we may have to cut federal spending by more \n     than half or raise federal taxes by more than two and a half \n     times to balance the budget. Clearly, the status quo is both \n     unsustainable and difficult choices are unavoidable. And the \n     longer we wait, the more onerous our options will become and \n     the less transition time we will have.\n\n  Is that really the kind of legacy we should leave to future \ngenerations of Americans?\n  Referring to our economic outlook, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan testified before Congress that:\n\n       (T)he dimension of the challenge is enormous. The one \n     certainty is that the resolution of this situation will \n     require difficult choices and that the future performance of \n     the economy will depend on those choices. No changes will be \n     easy, as they all will involve lowering claims on resources \n     or raising financial obligations. It falls on the Congress to \n     determine how best to address the competing claims.\n\n  It falls on the Congress, my friends. The head of the Government's \nchief watch-dog agency and the Nation's chief economist agree--we are \nin real trouble.\n  The time has come to stop the practice of earmarking unauthorized \nfunds and let the cabinet officials responsible for the various \nagencies of our government determine where and how our dwindling \ndiscretionary funds are to be spent. If we in the Congress are not \nwilling to do our jobs and authorize our spending priorities, we should \nat least be willing to trust the President's Cabinet, who we voted to \nconfirm to their positions, to do their jobs and appropriately fund \ntheir respective agencies' needs without our interference.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, exactly 1 month ago I praised the \nAppropriations Committee's efforts to fund the State Revolving Fund for \nWastewater Treatment and for Drinking Water at the highest possible \nlevels. Today, however, I am gravely concerned about the overall cut in \nenvironmental spending contained in the bill before us today and \nspecifically with a large cut in the clean water program.\n  First, let me say that I intend to vote for this conference report, \nas it contains a $1.5 billion supplemental spending package to cover a \nshortfall in veterans health care funding.\n  I was highly disappointed to learn last month of the shortfall in \nfunding for veterans health care. It was particularly outrageous that \nthis announcement followed on the heels of assurances from the \nVeterans' Administration and President Bush that the additional funding \nwe attempted to add in the emergency supplemental funding bill was not \nneeded. Clearly, this was not the case. I am pleased that the Senate \nmoved immediately to rectify this problem and dealt with this problem \nwhile we still had a chance.\n  I am frustrated, however, that the funding to combat this shortfall \nwas not attached to the more appropriate vehicle. At a time when our \nsoldiers are returning from war and veterans are coming into the VA in \nrecord numbers, our veterans and our local VA hospitals need and \ndeserve this funding. I only hope that we have learned our lesson from \nthis unfortunate sequence of events and that we will do what is \nnecessary in the future to ensure that the essential funds are provided \nfor our veterans in a timely manner and following appropriate \nprocedures. Our veterans deserve no less.\n  A clean and healthy environment may be our most important legacy for \nour children. It saddens me to think that under the guise of fiscal \nresponsibility, the bill before us today cuts spending at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to levels not seen since fiscal \nyear 2001. This bill funds the EPA at about $7.7 billion. As recently \nas fiscal year 2004, the EPA received $8.365 billion. This is a cut of \nover $600 million in just 2 years.\n  Because of the administration's fiscal policies and priorities, which \nhave led to record deficits, we are now going to underfund many \nprograms that are important to the protection of public health and the \nenvironment. There are many programs I could touch on, but let me focus \nmy remarks on the sad state of the clean water State revolving fund, \nCWSRF.\n  The CWSRF offers long-term, low-interest loans to State and local \ngovernments to help them meet Federal water quality standards by fixing \nold, decaying sewer pipelines, building and repairing wastewater \ntreatment plants, and controlling other sources of water pollution. The \nconference report before us today funds the CWSRF at about $900 \nmillion, down from almost $1.1 billion last year and over $1.3 billion \nin FY 2004. This huge drop in spending is occurring at a time when \nnearly half of America's rivers and lakes do not meet basic Clean Water \nAct standards.\n  Furthermore, municipalities are currently struggling to fix old water \nand sewage pipes. The EPA estimates that clean water infrastructure \nneeds nationwide will cost $390 billion over the next 15 years. The \naging of the Nation's sewage treatment infrastructure has a direct \neffect on our waters and the people who come into contact with them. \nMany systems have exceeded their effective lives and are decaying \nbecause they were designed and built decades ago when urban areas were \nmore compact and had much smaller populations.\n  I intend to carry on this fight for increased spending on water \ninfrastructure and other important environmental programs. I hope that \nwe can come to our senses before it is too late.\n\n\n               expanding the oil and gas leasing program\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we prepare to accept the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 2006 Interior appropriations spending bill, I \nwant to raise an issue regarding the implementation of a pilot project \nin the State of Utah to determine the feasibility of expanding the oil \nand gas leasing program to include online auctioning of leases.\n  There is a very active oil and gas lease trading market in the \nprivate\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\nsector. Many of these leases are bought and sold online in an auction \nprocess quite similar to other auction processes on the Internet. \nInformation about the individual lease sale is made available to the \npublic with accompanying documentation, prices are set and bids are \naccepted, sales and transactions are completed all online. The system \noperates very efficiently and expands the opportunity to participate to \npotential bidders all across the country.\n  BLM is currently limited to conducting oil and gas lease auctions \norally. However, under the Government Performances Result Act, or GPRA, \nFederal agencies are allowed to conduct pilot studies to identify \nopportunities to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \ntheir business processes. Under GPRA, a pilot program which tested the \nfeasibility of both oral and online auctions might help BLM increase \nthe efficiency of the auction process and increase the exposure of \nleases to a broader number of participants.\n  However, the BLM does not currently have the capability to implement \na program like this. But were they to develop a partnership with the \nprivate sector to develop an online component of the oil and gas \nleasing program, the program becomes much more feasible.\n  With that in mind, I requested funds for the BLM State office in Utah \nto conduct a pilot program with a private sector partner to develop a \npotential online oil and gas leasing project and to conduct a series of \ntests to see if this idea is workable. The Senate included funding for \nthis program in the State of Utah. However, the committee did not \nspecify that BLM should try to identify a private sector partner that \nhas experience in conducting online oil and gas lease auctions.\n  Would it be the opinion of the chairman that BLM should identify and \nwork with a partner in the private sector to proceed forward quickly \nwith the development of a pilot program in Utah?\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator is correct. The Bureau of Land Management \ncurrently does not have the mechanism in place to implement a pilot \nproject like this. However, there are entities in the private sector \nthat have a well-established history of conducting oil and gas lease \nauctions online. I would encourage BLM in Utah to quickly identify a \nprivate sector partner and develop a pilot program in Utah for online \noil and gas lease auctions and encourage the director of the BLM to \nmake sure that the necessary resources are devoted to implementing this \nproject in a timely manner.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate that clarification.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take just a moment to \ncomment on the Interior appropriations conference report now before the \nSenate.\n  First, let me congratulate Senator Burns, chairman of the Intenor \nSubcommittee and his ranking member, Senator Dorgan, for their work on \nfinishing this important piece of legislation before we adjourn for the \nAugust recess. My home State of Idaho has great interest in the \nInterior appropriations bill every year. And timely completion of this \nlegislation is welcome news to my constituents.\n  As odd as this may sound, though, I do not wish to speak about \nInterior matters in this bill. Rather, I want to say a few words about \nthe $1.5 billion included in this legislation for fiscal year 2005 \nsupplemental funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs health care \nsystem.\n  I know all of my colleagues are aware of the notice I received a \nlittle over 1 month ago that VA funding for this fiscal year was \nseverely strained. And that, as a result, this Congress was going to \nneed to move fast to provide an infusion of resources to ensure our \nveterans continued to receive high-quality, timely health care from VA.\n  Working with Senators Hutchison, Cochran, Murray, Feinstein, Akaka, \nand others, the Senate voted unanimously to add $1.5 billion for VA \nhealth care to this Interior appropriations bill. We did so because we \nwere confident this legislation would be completed in time to get this \nbill to the President's desk--and more importantly get the money to VA \nfor veterans' health care--before the August recess. As is evident with \nthe expected passage of this bill today, we have accomplished that \ngoal.\n  Certainly this victory has not come without some hard work and \nnegotiations. It was extremely difficult to get the administration to \nprovide us with accurate budget numbers in any timely fashion. I spoke \nseveral times with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and with OMB about the \nneed to get the information to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and \nthe Appropriations Committee fast and to get it right with respect to \nfiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2006 so that we would not be back here \nagain in 6 months talking about shortfalls.\n  I am cautiously optimistic that VA and OMB have gotten it right this \ntime. Working with Congress, they submitted a fiscal year 2005 and 2006 \nbudget amendment that identified the need for an additional $2.952 \nbillion. This bill provides a $1.5 billion down payment that goes \ntowards meeting that identified need.\n  In addition, Senators Hutchison and Feinstein are working on VA's \nfunding need for fiscal year 2006 in the military construction/VA \nappropriations bill that was recently sent to the Senate floor by the \nfull Appropriations Committee. We will all have a chance to vote on \nthat measure after the recess.\n  I also want to tell my colleagues that I was very unhappy with the \nway in which all of this information about VA's shortfalls came to my \nattention. As chairman of the Veterans Committee, I take very seriously \nmy responsibility to provide oversight of the VA and its financial \npicture on behalf of the Senate. And I want each of you to know that I \nhave received personal assurances from Secretary Nicholson that he will \nprovide quarterly reports throughout the fiscal year on VA's financial \npicture so that Senators can be certain that VA is on track and on \nbudget.\n  Working together with Members on both sides of the aisle, I believe \nwe can conduct the proper oversight of VA's health care budget and make \ncertain that adequate finances are provided for the health care needs \nof our Nation's veterans.\n  Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all of their support, \nespecially Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd of the full \nAppropriations Committee. Their unwavering commitment in the face of \nVA's shortfalls made this substantial supplemental increase possible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while I voted in favor of the fiscal \nyear 2006 Interior appropriations conference report, which contains \nfunding for a number of important programs, including vital funding for \nveterans health care, I am disappointed in the lack of adequate \ninvestment in the clean water State revolving fund. This program has \nbeen helpful to communities all over Wisconsin, and across the country, \nin their efforts to safeguard their water supplies and to comply with \nnew standards for drinking water contaminants like arsenic and radium. \nI was concerned earlier this year when the President requested a 33 \npercent cut for the clean water State revolving fund for his fiscal \nyear 2006 budget. Because of my concern, I joined a bipartisan group of \nSenators in asking the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to ignore \nthe requested cut in funds and instead provide $1.35 billion for this \nprogram. The Senate bill included $1.1 billion for the revolving fund, \nand I am disappointed that the conferees did not retain this more \nfavorable funding level.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to address the conference \nreport on the Interior appropriations bill. Indeed, our efforts in the \nSenate to add $1.5 billion in funding for VA this year have borne \nfruit. I again laud our bipartisan effort to address the funding crisis \nin VA health care.\n  I also wish to thank my colleague, the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid, for his determination to ensure that $1.5 billion was the final \namount of fuhding for this year. Though some were willing to accept \nless, he and I understand that every last dollar of this amount is \nneeded to provide the highest quality of care to all veterans--be they \nolder veterans in VA nursing homes or younger service members just \nreturning from Iraq and seeking VA care for the first time.\n  We all know that while many of us have been saying that VA needs more \nmoney since the early part of the year, the administration needed to be\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\npressed to own up to the shortfall. As I have said before, I hope in \nthe future all Members reach out to VA nurses and doctors and reach out \nto the veterans service organizations. We need not wait for the \nadministration to make an official pronouncement about something that \nis so obvious. I do believe that the administration has lost its \ncredibility in forecasting demand and expected costs. I believe this is \ntrue for its estimates of this year's funding, as well as next year.\n  The battle for next year's funding will be upon on us shortly. During \nthe budget resolution I debate in March, I offered an amendment to \nincrease VA's funding by $2.8 billion for next year. I stood before \nthis body and outlined the case for a significant increase for VA. But \nwe were I rejected because the administration claimed VA needed far \nless.\n  The administration wants us to now believe that VA needs a certain \namount for fiscal year 2005 and 2006. They now want to convince us that \nthey have a handle on the numbers. I remain skeptical.\n  VA rightly admits the fiscal year 2006 budget was off-the-mark in its \nestimate of the number of returning service members who will come for \nVA care. We know from experience how much it costs to treat a returning \nservice member. Yet, the administration wants to now convince us that, \nin fact, the cost of treating a patient is less than half of this \namount.\n  My original estimate of a need for $3 billion in VA health care \nspending for next year remains correct. The VA appropriations bill must \ncontain the full amount for VA health care next year. If not, our \nveterans will find this nightmare repeated once again.\n  Along those lines, I appreciate the work that Senators Craig and \nHutchison and our other colleagues are doing to tackle this problem. I \nbelieve we can find a solution, together.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, within the conference report on the \ninterior appropriations bill is an essential provision to provide $1.5 \nbillion to address the current shortfall in funding for VA health care. \nThe Interior appropriations conference report was selected as the \nquickest legislative vehicle to address this immediate and compelling \nlack of funding for VA.\n  With our country in combat in various regions around the world, \nincluding Iraq and Afghanistan, it is greatly disturbing that the VA is \nfacing such a severe shortfall. I am proud that the Senate prevailed in \nsecuring the $1.5 billion needed to respond to urgent health care needs \nof veterans now--both veterans returning from current conflicts and \naging veterans needing long-term care. While we are addressing this \ncompelling need today, this crisis could have--and should have--been \naverted. The administration should have proposed a better budget for VA \nin February of 2005. The administration could have supported Senator \nMurray's amendment to the Iraq supplemental in April of 2005 to add \n$1.97 billion for VA health care. Neither happened, and it is troubling \nthat VA blames use of old models and early estimates on VA health care \nneeds beginning in 2002. Our heroic service men and women have been \nserving in Iraq since 2003, and the VA budget officials should have \nknown to rework and review the VA health care budgets. It is a sad \nexcuse for VA officials to tell Congress in April that VA health care \nfunding is adequate and fine, and then have VA officials come to \nCongress at the end of June of 2005 to suggest a shortfall of at least \n$1.5 billion in the VA health care programs. We simply must have a \nbetter budget process at the VA to measure and adjust any estimates \nover time so that our veterans get the health care they have earned \nwith their brave service.\n  Military personnel--Active Duty members and especially members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves--respond to the call of duty. They risk \ntheir lives in service to our Nation, and they, and their families, \nendure enormous sacrifices due to their service. A new survey from the \nArmy suggest that as many as 30 percent of those military personnel \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan will face mental health concerns, like \npost traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, at the time of their return due \nto the violence and experiences they face. I have hosted private \nroundtables throughout West Virginia to meet with returning veterans \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan, and I believe that they have compelling \nneeds for mental health care due to the overwhelming stress of serving \nin such a challenging combat situation. Even service personnel who are \nsupposedly not in combat zones face attacks from car bombs and suicide \nbombers. It is sad and tragic, and of course it affects our troops. The \nstories from West Virginia veterans about their service have convinced \nme that we must invest in more resources for mental health care, \ncounseling, and our vet centers.\n  Knowing this, and knowing this for several years, we simply must \nensure that VA health care get the funding it needs to serve all our \nveterans, Active Duty as well as National Guard and Reserves. But \ncaring for our new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan cannot \nbe at the expense of serving veterans of other eras, Vietnam, Korea, \nand World War II and all the times in between.\n  Our aging veterans have huge long-term care concerns, and VA has an \nobligation to serve them. Part of our current shortfall was a lack of \nlong-term care funding. While we did not know about the Iraq war in \n2002, surely we should have been aware of the demographics of the VA \npopulation and the looming need for health care. This issue will not go \naway, and VA must serve all of our veterans.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1985, I have been proud to serve on the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee and I treasure this opportunity to \nwork on behalf of veterans in West Virginia and throughout our country. \nToday's passage of the $1.5 billion provision for VA health care in the \nInterior appropriations package is an important step to address the VA \nhealth care shortfall. But honestly, this is merely a downpayment, and \nmuch more must be done to strengthen the process and the funding for VA \nhealth care. This Senator is fully committed to finding a real solution \nto the chronic problems of insufficient funding for VA health care. Our \ndedicated veterans deserve no less.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Conrad Burns and the \nranking member, Senator Byron Dorgan, on their work on this \nlegislation. I am pleased that this conference report includes the full \n$1.5 billion proposed by the Senate to make up the current 2005 fiscal \nyear shortfall in funding for veterans health care. The Interior bill \nmay seem a strange vehicle for this funding, but it was the first \nvehicle available once the administration confirmed the funding crisis \nin VA health care, and I thank the managers for preserving this \nprovision in their conference report.\n  It is critically important that the President sign this conference \nreport into law quickly so that this money can be used to replenish the \ncoffers of the VA and make sure that there is no interruption in the \nVA's ability to provide medical services to our Nation's veterans.\n  Make no mistake about it, this money is needed now--now. We know the \nVA anticipates an even greater shortfall in fiscal year 2006, and the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has addressed that problem in the 2006 \nMilitary Construction and VA appropriations bill by providing $1.977 \nbillion in emergency funding for VA health care in 2006.\n  The $1.5 billion that is provided in this conference report is \nspecifically intended to address the current--the current--2005 crisis \nin VA health care funding. The precise amount of the current shortfall \nremains somewhat murky. The administration, after months and months of \ndenying that a shortfall even existed, first pegged it as $975 million, \nand then upped--upped--the estimate to $1.275 billion.\n  The Senate, however, fully mindful of the VA's dismal track record in \nestimating shortfalls, and wisely skeptical of the administration's \nfluctuating estimates, voted to include a total of $1.5 billion in this \nbill, with the proviso--get this--with the proviso that the funds would \nbe available both this year and next. This was in sharp contrast to the \nHouse, which provided only $975 million in a separate bill to cover the \nfiscal year 2005 shortfall in VA funding.\n  It is a victory for our Nation's veterans. Hallelujah. It is a \nvictory for our Nation's veterans that the conferees agreed on the \nSenate level of $1.5 billion, but it will be merely a Pyrrhic\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nvictory if the White House tries to balance the books by shortchanging \nveterans in 2005 to make up some of the anticipated shortfall in 2006. \nDo not let it happen.\n  It is worth repeating: The Senate Appropriations Committee has \naddressed the 2006 shortfall by adding $1.977 billion in emergency \nfunding to the 2006 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations bill. The entire amount of the VA funding included in \nthe Interior bill--$1.5 billion--is available for 2005--for 2005--and I \nstrongly urge the administration, I strongly urge the White House, to \nspend up to that amount to meet the current health care needs of our \nveterans.\n  The Senate voted twice, both unanimous votes, to provide $1.5 billion \nto make up the 2005 shortfall in veterans health care. I think the \nSenate made its position crystal clear. We did not vote to bank the \nmoney for some future rainy day. We voted to provide adequate funding \nto address an exiting crisis in the veterans health care system, and I, \nfor one, fully expect--I fully expect--the administration to use this \nfunding for the current crisis, and not attempt to horde it--horde it--\nhorde it--for the future.\n  America's veterans have given much for their country. We have an \nobligation to give back to them something and to provide for their \nhealth care needs. This conference report is a good first step in \nshoring up the VA's health care budget and, hopefully, leading the way \ntoward more realistic and adequate budgeting for the needs of our \nveterans in the future.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is another part of this conference report \nfor which the Senate can be very proud. Just a few weeks ago, this body \nvoted unanimously--unanimously--to approve an amendment that I offered, \nalong with Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Senator John Warner \nof Virginia, to provide $10 million--$10 million--to the national \nmemorial to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That funding \nremains part of this final conference report before the Senate.\n  There are many in this country who, during his life, did not \nappreciate the passion that Dr. King stirred in people. There are many \nwho believed his goals could be achieved through different means. And I \nwas one of those people, Robert C. Byrd. I was one of them. And I was \nwrong. I was wrong. I have come to admire Dr. King. I have come to \nrecognize that his dream--his dream--truly is the American dream.\n  Dr. King spoke of a day when children, regardless of color, \nregardless of creed, regardless of religious belief, would walk \ntogether in peace. Oh, how we need that message today, how we need that \nspirit today, as religious beliefs are used to divide our people, not \nto unite us, and as terrorist attacks breed distrust for people who \ncome from different lands. Oh, how we need to recall the lessons that \nthe late Dr. King taught some 40 years ago.\n\n  During the conference negotiations on this legislation, Mr. \nPresident, there was a great discussion on how the Congress could \nencourage more Americans to contribute to the construction of the King \nMemorial. This legislation will help. This legislation says that every \ndollar raised in the private sector will be matched with a dollar from \nthe U.S. Government, up to $10 million. That is why I urge those who \nbelieve in the message of Dr. King to take just a few minutes and \ncontribute to this national memorial.\n  Now, Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the gracious Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Thad Cochran, for \nhis support and for his work on behalf of this memorial. Without his \nsupport we would not have had this in the bill. We would not be at this \nmoment without his strong efforts.\n  I also thank the senior Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. John Warner, for his work, too. Right \nfrom the start, Senator Warner stood up and cosponsored this amendment. \nHis influence and his support were vital to this effort.\n  I also thank Senator Pete Domenici for his support of this effort.\n  Finally, let me thank the tens of millions of Americans who continue \nto build the dream--the dream; ah, how great the dream--that Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., voiced some 40 years ago. Achieving that dream is not \neasy. Despite efforts to put the past behind us and move forward \ntogether, there remain those who are determined to look backward. There \nremain those who would rather promote fear and division than build \nunity and common purpose. I hope this memorial to the legacy of the \nReverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will remind all of us--all of \nus--that there is far more strength in unity, far more strength in \nresolve, far more strength in love of one's fellow man than there ever \ncan be in division, in discord, and in disunity.\n  And so, Mr. President, I thank those who have been so helpful. And I \nhope that one of Dr. King's favorite Bible passages, which is also one \nof mine, comes to be a reality. And I have seen it coming to be a \nreality. It comes from the Book of Isaiah.\n\n       Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert \n     a highway for our God.\n       Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill \n     shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, \n     and the rough places plain:\n       And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh \n     shall see it together:. . . .\n\n  That was one of Dr. Martin Luther King's favorite Scriptures. And so \nI look forward to that day, Mr. President. That day was the hope of Dr. \nKing. And that day is my hope as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank all Senators.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a list of the Senate cosponsors of the \nMartin Luther King, Jr., Memorial amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            cosponsors list\n\n       Amendment Number: SP1053.\n       Cosponsors: Cochran, Warner, Kennedy, Mikulski, Landrieu, \n     Johnson, Stabenow, Murray, Bingaman, Jeffords, Rockefeller, \n     Obama, Feinstein, Schumer, Sarbanes, Boxer, Harkin, Corzine, \n     Brownback, DeWine, Levin, McConnell, McCain, Biden, Nelson of \n     FL, Clinton, Bayh, Kerry, Roberts, Leahy, Allen, Pryor, \n     Durbin, Martinez, Lieberman, Feingold, Hutchison.\n       Total Cosponsors: 37.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I came to work this morning, as I \npulled into the Capitol, there were dogs under Capitol police control, \nsniffing to find out if there were explosives in the cars coming into \nthe Capitol. There was an officer with a semiautomatic shotgun. As I \nproceeded, there was an officer on the Capitol steps with an assault \nrifle. As I came into the Capitol, there were police officers at the \ndoor. These are the same type of officers as the two who were gunned \ndown, Chestnut and Gibson, a few years ago. These were police officers \nprotecting us.\n  In this Chamber today, there are plain clothes Capitol police \nofficers here for our protection. All of these police officers are \ntrained to put our lives ahead of theirs.\n  When we, in recent days, have been directed to leave the Capitol, \ntaken from the Capitol, there are police officers who wait behind to \nmake sure everyone is out before whatever wrong is supposed to happen \nhappens. They are the last here before the doors are closed.\n  I was a Capitol policeman. I was not trained to do any of the things \nthese men and women are trained to do today. We are in an extremely \nvulnerable situation here in the United States Capitol complex. In \nevery one of the office buildings, every place we go in the Capitol \ncomplex, there are evil people who are trying to do harm to us and the \nmillions of visitors who come here every year.\n  That is why, as I read this morning the language in the Legislative \nBranch appropriation bill, I was offended. I was offended by the \nlanguage in that bill, the insulting language about our Capitol Police. \nThey are our Capitol Police.\n  This legislation is going forward. As a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee--I was chairman of the Legislative Branch Appropriations \nSubcommittee for a number of years, and I enjoyed the service greatly--\nI feel that the Capitol Police have been wronged in this appropriations \nbill. The Capitol Police is an imperfect organization, similar to every \norganization. It is a big organization. I am sure the administration \nmakes mistakes and things happen that should not happen within the \nCapitol Police force. However, I repeat, the men and women who put \ntheir lives on the line for us every day, 24 hours a day--for each of \nus, for the staff here, as I said before, for the thousands of people \nwho are visiting today in this Capitol--their support, their protection \nis consistent and strong.\n  I resent this libel, by vague generality, that is contained in this \nconference report. The language in the Senate version of the \nLegislative Branch bill contained a number of constructive clauses and \nareas of improvement for the police, written in a way that is \ncompletely appropriate in an appropriations bill. What is returned from \nthe conference is an anti-Capitol Hill Police screed that is \nunacceptable.\n  I am pleased the Senate was largely able to prevail on fiscal issues \nin this conference report. The Capitol Police will have most of the \nresources they need to protect Members, staff, and the visitors who \ncome here. However, it seems that our conferees were forced, obviously, \nto swallow nasty report language about the Chief of Police, his \ndeputies, and other police administrators in order to get adequate \nfunding for them. This is absurd. I am happy to have the funding, but \nthe trade is ridiculous.\n  It is unwarranted. There are problems in all large organizations. \nLet's work to solve them together, but not have the nasty tone of this \nconference report. For whatever reason, we have had a succession of \npeople in the House of Representatives who do not like the Capitol \nPolice force. They have stated so publicly and privately. But it is not \ngetting better; it is getting worse.\n  This is the last year I will accept it. Maybe others will, but I will \nnot. Let me be very clear. I will never ever allow a Legislative Branch \nconference report that is as nasty and relentlessly negative toward our \nCapitol Police as this one that is going to become law. One will never \nbecome law again. I am going to reach out to my friends on the House \nside, Congressman Lewis and the Speaker and others, to see what we can \ndo to improve this.\n  I support Chief Gainer, his deputies, his staff, and all his \nofficers. They have my support and my devotion because they protect my \nlife every day. They risk their lives every day to protect this \ninstitution, and they deserve better than the pettiness that I have \nread in these pages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next three \nrollcall votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2985, the \nLegislative Branch appropriations bill. The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield to the minority to speak first. \nAre there any additional comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chairman again for his hard work on the bill, \nand I agree with Senator Reid in every word he has said. What is in \nthis conference committee report about the Capitol Police is totally \nundeserved and unwarranted. It is a shame there are some people in this \nCapitol, not necessarily on this side of the Rotunda, who unfortunately \nput that language in here. Remember, we are here safely today because \nthey are literally risking their lives as we do our work. For goodness \nsakes, they deserve our appreciation, and they do not deserve the \ncondemnation that is part of this conference committee report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I think we have a good bill for us. I ask \neverybody to vote ``aye'' on the conference report. We have been very \ngenerous with the police. We all recognize the hard work and sacrifice \nthey have made on behalf of all of us, our staffs, and the many \nvisitors who come to the Capitol.\n  We have taken a very strong position in support of the Capitol Police \non this side of the Capitol. We worked closely with the minority side \nand appreciate their input as we move forward with this particular \npiece of legislation.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 211 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Ensign\n     Inhofe\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate on the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 6, the Energy bill. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the issue before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The issue before the Senate now is the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 6. There is 2 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin \ndesires to make a point of order.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have 1 minute; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I have four fundamental concerns with regard to the \nEnergy conference report: it digs us deeper into a budget black hole, \nit fails to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, it rolls back \nimportant consumer protections, and it undermines some of the \nfundamental environmental laws our citizens rely upon.\n  The conference report includes direct spending of more than $2.2 \nbillion over the 2006-2010 period, exceeding the amount allocated by \nthe budget resolution, so I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsustaining a budget point of order.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending conference \nreport violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Was the motion just made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order was made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to waive the point of order subject to \nappropriate provisions of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico moves to waive the \nbudget point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One minute. First, this is almost not a point of order. \nIt is $40 million a year. That is because we had $2 billion in direct \nspending, $2 billion in this whole bill. What we did, when we ended up \ndoing all of the estimating, it was 2.2. So anybody who thinks this \npoint of order is a real budget point of order, it is a nothing point \nof order. Many times the budget process takes $50 million and rolls it \nbecause they are trying to make things meet, and here we are having a \npoint of order making it sound like a bunch--$40 million.\n  The last comment is this bill reduces the deficit because the tax \nwriting committee came in $6 billion under. We are $200 million a year \nover. Do the arithmetic. The bill reduces the deficit; it doesn't raise \nit. I think this is the very reason the waiver provisions in the Budget \nAct were provided, for mistakes like these in estimating. That is why \nwe have a waiver section. Members should vote in favor of the Domenici \nmotion to waive.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Mexico to waive the Budget Act.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have now returned to S. 397. Under a \nunanimous consent agreement, there are four amendments to be debated, \nand three of the four will have relevant first degrees. My colleague \nfrom Kansas has asked to speak very briefly before we move to the first \namendment.\n  I yield to Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding.\n  There is not another thing, basically, on any of these amendments \nthat has not already been said or that will change anybody's vote. I \ndon't intend\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nto hold the Senate up, but I want to take a moment to comment on where \nwe are in the legislative schedule and to make a personal request of my \ncolleagues. I don't question the right of any Senator to be heard on \nthe Senate floor. But I must say I do not understand the need to \ncontinue debating and discussing all of these amendments on the Friday \nafternoon before the start of a long month's recess. I ask, could we \nplease cut down on the rhetoric so that we might be able to get along \nwith the people's business and cast our votes. I know the manager wants \nthat. I would probably determine that the minority would like that as \nwell.\n  I make this request not only as a Senator from Kansas but as the \nfather of a young lady that I will be walking down the aisle tomorrow. \nVery early this week I informed our leaders in the Senate that I had \nevery intention of being at her rehearsal, and that rehearsal and \ndinner starts at 5 o'clock. I will be there. So if we must continue on \nmaking these statements this afternoon and offering these amendments, I \nask that the Record reflect that any votes I miss will be the result of \nme performing my duties as a dad and being with my daughter on the most \nimportant evening and day of her life.\n  Thus, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record reflect \nthat should I miss votes in the afternoon, it would have been my \nintention to vote as follows on the Transportation bill, amendments to \nthe gun liability bill, and the gun liability bill itself:\n  ``Yea'' on the Transportation bill; ``nay'' on the Reed amendment No. \n1642; ``yea'' on the Frist-Craig first-degree amendment to the Kennedy \namendment No. 1615. Should the first-degree amendment not be accepted, \nI would vote ``nay'' on the Kennedy amendment. I would vote ``yea'' on \nthe Frist-Craig first-degree amendment to the Corzine amendment No. \n1619. Should the first-degree amendment not be accepted, it would have \nbeen my intention to vote ``nay'' on the Corzine amendment. It would be \nmy intention to vote ``yea'' on the Frist-Craig first-degree amendment \nto the Lautenberg amendment No. 1620. Should the first-degree amendment \nnot be accepted, it would be my intention to vote ``nay'' on the \nLautenberg amendment. Finally, it would be my intention to vote ``yea'' \non final passage of the gun liability bill.\n  I respect and love you all. I admire you all. But while charm and \nlooks and levity may woo us in the start, in the end it is brevity that \nwill win my colleagues' hearts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. An interesting speech about not making speeches. I yield \nthe floor for the offering of an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1620\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wonder if I might dare to offer my \ncomments after that earlier admonition. But I will do it because we are \nhere for reasons that are obvious to everybody. We are here because our \nfriends on the other side wanted to stop us from offering amendments \naltogether and are trying to block any suggestion that might be added \nto make this bill more reasonable or more acceptable.\n  I call up my amendment and ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 1620.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To exempt lawsuits involving injuries to children from the \n            definition of qualified civil liability action)\n\n       On page 10, strike line 3 and all that follows through page \n     11, line 2, and insert the following:\n       (iv) an action for breach of contract or warranty in \n     connection with the purchase of the product;\n       (v) an action for death, physical injuries or property \n     damage resulting directly from a defect in design or \n     manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a \n     reasonably foreseeable manner, except that where the \n     discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that \n     constituted a criminal offense then such act shall be \n     considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, \n     personal injuries or property damage; or\n       (vi) any case against a manufacturer or seller involving an \n     injury to or the death of a person under 17 years of age.\n       (B) Negligent entrustment.--As used in subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), the term ``negligent entrustment'' means the \n     supplying of a qualified product by a seller for use by \n     another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should \n     know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely \n     to, and does, use the product in a manner involving \n     unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.\n       (C) Rule of construction.--The exceptions enumerated under \n     clauses (i) through (vi)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment that \nposes a question to the Senate. The question is fairly simple: What is \nmore important in our life, in our society, to be on watch for: Is it \nto protect our Nation's children and to let those know who would assist \nin harming those children that they are going to be taken to court and \nbe sued and punished, if they can be punished, or for criminal action \nas well? This refers only to the civil side of things. But what is more \nimportant? Is it most important for us to support the NRA, to make sure \nthey are satisfied, to make sure that their dictates to this body--and \nit is obvious that it is all over the place. Ladies and gentlemen who \ncan hear us in this debate, understand that the other side is willing \nto block your ability, your family's ability to sue someone who has \nbeen neglectful, careless, reckless with the way a gun is handled and \nto protect them.\n  Why? Frankly, I cannot figure it out. But apparently our friends on \nthe other side have it all figured out. They just say no. We went \nthrough that exercise in our society, and it didn't work. It is not \ngoing to work here. Is it to protect our children? Special interests \nversus the children in America.\n  This bill--everyone knows--wants to protect the gun industry even, as \nI said, when they are grossly negligent, reckless, careless. What my \namendment says is that there should not be a blanket grant of immunity \nin cases in which a child is the victim. We identify a child as those \nchildren under 17 years of age. How dare we look a mother in the eye \nand tell her that she cannot hold the people who caused the death or \ninjury to her child accountable? We cannot do it. One has to look \ndeeply into whether there is a constitutional question associated with \nthis. The fifth amendment suggests that you have the right to seek \ndamages--this is not precise language--for injuries.\n  What this bill says now is that the parents of children killed by \ngunfire, when someone else is at fault, even if they are careless, \nreckless, or negligent, cannot seek redress. It has been said before by \ncolleagues that there are numerous industries that would like the same \nprotection so they can go ahead perhaps and not be as careful in making \nsure their product meets safety standards. But, no, they didn't have \nthe muscle to break their way into this place and ``at gunpoint''--if I \nmay use the expression--jam something through this Senate. And they \ndescribe these shamelessly as junk lawsuits--that is hard to \nunderstand. The bill says, too bad, sorry about your kid, but we cannot \nlet you harm these big campaign donors of ours. No, no, no. It is kind \nof sacrosanct. But it is prohibited for every other industry in this \nworld of ours.\n  If they make a faulty product and if they are negligent in its \nhandling, they can be taken to court and sued. I will provide an \nexample. A criminal goes into a gunshop and asks to look at assault \nweapons. The dealer lays out deadly weapons on the counter and the \ndealer says: Just a minute. I have to go in the back. Here are these \nweapons on the counter. When the dealer returns from the back room, \nwhere he said he was going to check something in inventory, the \ncriminal has taken the weapon and left the store.\n  Can you imagine that outrageous behavior? The lethal weapons were on \nthe counter. The dealer could turn his back for a moment and have \nsomeone with criminal intent steal a gun and go out. The dealer cannot \nbe punished for that\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\noutrageous behavior. The next day, that criminal could use that weapon \nin a drive-by shooting and kill a 6-year-old boy.\n  If this bill passes in its current form, the parents of that child \ncannot go to court to sue against that negligent gun dealer. When the \nparents ask why they can't sue this dealer whose negligence caused \ntheir son's death or permanent disability, we can tell them to thank \ntheir Senator; get the phone number and office address of their \nSenator, and they can send their gratitude to that Senator--or their \nanger and their rage--which they have a right to do.\n  Mr. President, nearly 3,000 children die from gunshot wounds every \nyear in our country. The Senate ought to try to reduce that statistic \nand not stand by and permit it to grow.\n  According to the CDC, the latest statistics show that in 2002, 2,867 \nchildren and teenagers died from gunshot incidents in the United \nStates. The CDC also found that firearm-related deaths among children \nunder the age of 15 were 12 times higher here than in 25 other \nindustrialized countries combined. Let me repeat that. Firearm-related \ndeaths among children under 15 in our country were 12 times higher than \nin 25 other industrialized countries combined. We are not talking about \nbackwoods or primitive countries; we are talking about industrialized \ncountries. They are much more conscious about protecting their \npopulation from random gunshots than we are. These are shameful \nstatistics.\n  So why does it matter whether negligent gun dealers are held \naccountable? Because when we hold people accountable for their actions, \nwe prevent wrongdoing that will hurt more people in the future. It \nsends a clear message--hey, if you are not careful with your inventory \nof guns, if you are not careful of whom you sell that gun to, if you \nare not careful with what kind of a retailer you distribute your guns \nto, you are going to pay a price, a stiff price. Maybe it will put you \nout of business. Maybe you deserve to go out of business. That is what \nI say. Why should we lock the courthouse doors to our children and the \nfamilies of children killed or injured by guns?\n\n  Mr. President, earlier I used a hypothetical example, but there are \nthousands of real-life examples of children suffering because of gun \nindustry negligence. There is the story of Tennille Jefferson, the \nmother of a young son who became another statistic of gun violence. On \nApril 19, 1999, her son, Nafis, was shot and killed by a young man who \nfound a gun on the street belonging to a gun trafficker named Perry \nBruce.\n  Perry Bruce bought this deadly weapon from a gun dealer who had \nrepeatedly sold him guns, despite many obvious signs that he was a gun \ntrafficker. Mr. Bruce had shown a welfare card as his identification; \nyet, somehow nobody at this store bothered to question how he had \nthousands of dollars to purchase 10 guns at a time.\n  Mr. Bruce has stated that the gun dealer ``had to know what I was \ndoing'' and that he was high on marijuana each time he bought guns from \nthis gun dealer.\n  Gun dealers like this must be held accountable. This bill gives them \na free pass to do any darn thing they want, except certain classes of \nnegligence, or negligence per se; otherwise, it is a free pass.\n  The senior Senator from Virginia spoke so eloquently yesterday about \nthis issue. He pointed out that the vast majority of licensed gun \ndealers followed the rules, but there are those rogue dealers that act \nnegligently and cause death and injury. Senator Warner explained it to \nus that this bill before us gives these rogue gun dealers a pass. This \nbill says--and I quote Warner--``Go ahead. Do whatever you want.''\n  Shamefully, the Senate leadership denied Senator Warner--a \ndistinguished, long-serving Senator, a veteran of World War II--from \nhaving a chance to have a vote on his amendment. I didn't think I would \nbe here defending a Republican Senator's chance to offer an amendment, \nbut they made sure that that wasn't going to happen. Even though there \nis purported respect, affection, and almost reverence for Senator John \nWarner, they denied him a chance to stand on this floor and offer an \namendment. No, the NRA is more powerful than Senator Warner. It is \nshameful. In my view, it was so disrespectful to a senior Member of \nthis body.\n  My amendment takes on pretty much the same issue as Senator Warner \nbut with a narrower focus. Do those whose actions lead to the death or \ninjury of a child get a free pass? To me, there is only one answer \nthere. I would take my kid over anything that the NRA needs or wants \nany time.\n  I would fight like the devil for it. I once carried a gun for it when \nI served in World War II. So the question before the Senate on my \namendment is: Whom do you want to please? Do you want to please \nmothers, fathers, grandparents, brothers, and sisters? Or do you want \nto protect the NRA, the gun manufacturers, the gun distributors--those \nwho at times don't give a darn about how they handle these things?\n  We are going to hear the cry about how we are going to put these \ninnocent people out of business. Out of business? No. We don't want to \nput them out of business. If they are going to be in the business, and \nthey are legally licensed, they need to be careful and make sure they \nobey the rules. If they don't, they will pay a price--perhaps \ncriminally, but surely civilly.\n  If we fail to adopt my amendment, gun dealers are not going to have \nany accountability, no incentive to behave responsibly, no matter the \nnumber of children who die from gun violence. Our criminal justice \nsystem brings about punishment--yes, they take the person who committed \na violent act or a felony and make them pay. Purportedly, it registers \nwith others who would conduct similar acts, and that is the way we \noperate.\n  But here, no. We are saying: Listen, you don't even have to be \ncareful. You can be negligent and reckless. Do what you want. Come on. \nIt is for the gun industry, for the NRA. Whom do we have to respect \naround here? It is obvious that they think it is the NRA. It is unjust, \nunfair, and immoral for us, as elected officials, to strip away the \nrights of children and families who are harmed or killed by gunfire.\n  Are Senators willing to look in the eye of Tennile Jefferson and tell \nher the door to the courthouse is barred for her?\n  I wish to talk about something we know will be pending, and that is \nthe Republican alternative ostensibly to offer the protection these \nchildren's families might need from my amendment. To put it bluntly, \nthe Republican sham protection is an insult. It is an insult to \nAmerica's children. It is an insult to America's parents. It is an \ninsult to this Senate. It is an insult to morality. That is the way it \nis going to come about.\n  You are going to say: No, that child's family can be protected by \nthose conditions already laid out for penetrating the shield of \nprotection that the gun industry and the NRA are demanding.\n  I urge my colleagues to read this so-called alternative, and I urge \nthe public to get this language. Understand what is taking place. \nCompare my amendment to that which is going to be offered and see which \none is serious about offering the opportunity for people to seek \ncompensation in the event of injury.\n  The Republican language makes clear that children get no special \ntreatment under this bill. It says that children are subject to the \nsame limited exemptions that everyone else has under this bill, \napproximately three conditions. Negligence and negligence per se are \nexempt from the prohibition. In our amendment, negligent entrustment \nand negligence per se are still able to be adjudicated in a court in a \ncivil action.\n  Our amendment says that the gun violence immunity bill should not \napply to children. Please, look at your own families. See what you \nwould do to someone who would harm your child, maybe render them \ntotally disabled for life. How would you react to that? Would you say, \nToo bad, the courts in America will not allow us to seek redress, to \nget some measure of compensation? There is never enough money to bring \nback the health and well-being of a child who was killed or a child who \nis permanently injured.\n  This will block legal actions on the behalf of children and their \nfamilies who are injured or killed. It is about as simple a decision as \nwe get around here. Are there times when the courthouse doors ought to \nbe locked, be shut to children or their families, or shouldn't they?\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues once again to think about the faces of their \nchildren. I have 10 grandchildren, and nothing in this world is more \nimportant to me than all 10 or any 1 of those 10 grandchildren. I think \neverybody else, even those who right now are supporting this hard-\nhearted legislation, even those people I know love their children. They \ndon't want anything to happen to them. They want to protect them as \nmuch as they can. I bet whatever devices they can use to protect them \nthey would use.\n  So come on, think about it when you cast your vote. Look in the \nmirror one time and challenge your conscience to see how you ought to \nbe voting. Let that be your guide.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have more time for this amendment. What \nis the status of the time for our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1644\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, under the order, I send a relevant first-\ndegree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1644.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the rights of children who are victimized by crime \n  to secure compensation from those who participate in the arming of \n                               criminals)\n\n       On page 11, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       (D) Minor child exception.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to limit the right of a person under 17 years of \n     age to recover damages authorized under Federal or State law \n     in a civil action that meets 1 of the requirements under \n     clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph (A).\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have just heard the arguments of Senator \nLautenberg in relation to his amendment. I most assuredly in no way \nquestion the sincerity of the Senator and the environment in which this \namendment has been offered. But if I can be as direct as I can be, if \nyou want to drive a truck through the middle of the bill, then the \nLautenberg amendment accomplishes just that. In the name of children, \nyes, and we should be sensitive to children. Of course we are. Children \nare as protected under this proposed law as anyone else because this \nlaw says go after the criminal, don't go after the law-abiding gun \nmanufacturer or the law-abiding gun seller.\n  But if there is negligent entrustment, if that can be proven, \ncertainly if that seller or if that gun dealer or manufacturer is \nnegligent, then anyone can and should bring lawsuits. It is the same \nissue we faced on previous amendments trying to carve out a special \nclass that gets favored treatment beyond another class, and with \nchildren, certainly that would sound like we would want to be more \nsensitive.\n  Most of us in the Senate are parents, but you don't have to be a \nparent to grieve over a child's injury or a child's death. We have many \nlaws on the books at both the State and the Federal level, and some of \nthem are placed by this very Senate to protect our Nation's most \nvulnerable--our children. We must insist on the enforcement of those \nlaws instead of constantly trying to carve out something special that \nmay not even be that enforceable. How do you protect children on the \nstreet? You go after the criminal who is packing the gun on the street. \nEvery year we do that, those deaths go down in America, whether it is a \nchild's death or whether it is an adult's death. The Lautenberg \namendment speaks to those 17 years of age and younger.\n  If those laws are broken by the gun industry, then the bill we are \nconsidering today will not shield them from the lawsuits or from the \nkind of harm that is rendered. If this is the same issue--and it is--we \nhave debated several times to carve out something special, then we \nshould not do that. But what we are saying in the alternative that has \njust been offered is that the bill allows lawsuits against firearms \nindustries by and for children to the same extent that it does for any \nother victim of the illegal misuse of a firearm in relation to a gun \nmanufacturer and a gun dealer.\n  Under this, if a child is injured by some wrongdoing of the gun \nindustry, the lawsuits are not barred. Again, remember yesterday we \ndebated the question of negligence and reckless conduct, and it was \nvery clearly established by a substantially large vote in the Senate \nthat it does not take away the standards of law and the specifications \nwithin the Federal law today as it relates to the responsible and legal \noperation and performance of a gun manufacturer or a licensed Federal \nfirearms dealer.\n  How do you solve the crisis or the problem so defined by Senator \nLautenberg? You enforce the law. You go after the criminal. You go \nafter the drug dealer. You go to the streets of America and you sweep \nthem clean of those who would break the law and those who are stealing \nthe guns and those who are misusing the guns, instead of going after a \nlaw-abiding legal citizen manufacturing a law-abiding and legal \nproduct.\n  I believe that is the issue, and I ask my colleagues to support us in \nvoting for the alternative and opposing the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I now yield to Senator Thune for any comments he would wish to make. \nWhat is the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question and \nclarification of terms?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. On the question of gross negligence, does gross \nnegligence pierce the prohibition suit?\n  Mr. CRAIG. If it is spelled out within the context of the Federal law \ntoday, it would. Under this bill, it would not unless it could be \nestablished as a violation of the current laws of our country and under \nthe current standards. We are not creating a new category as the Levin \namendment tried to do as it relates to gross negligence or reckless \nmisconduct. But what was established was negligence, negligent \nentrustment is not exempt from this law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Didn't the Senator from Michigan offer the gross \nnegligence exemption and had it denied because----\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the broadest sense, he did.\n  Reclaiming my time, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nleadership on this issue and for yielding time. I rise in strong \nsupport of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and in \nopposition to these amendments that will be offered this afternoon, all \nof which are designed to gut the underlying legislation.\n\n  It has been noted throughout the course of this debate that \nprosecutions are up, crime is down. That should be the fundamental \nfocus of our efforts--protecting people from crimes committed by \nfirearms.\n  I come from a State where we view these issues as a part of our \npersonal freedoms, part of the rights that are guaranteed under the \nConstitution, the opportunity to possess and own firearms. It is a part \nof the culture of our State, a belief in personal freedom, also coupled \nwith personal responsibility, which is why every year thousands of \nyoung South Dakotans take the firearm safety course and learn the \nresponsible use of firearms and then go out and have the opportunity to \nhunt and recreate and enjoy the great outdoors in our great State.\n  That was the opportunity I had as a young 12-year-old. I have taught \nmy teenage daughters responsible use of firearms. It is part of our \nhistory. It is part of our tradition. It is part of our culture.\n  The bill before us today would end many of the abusive lawsuits that \nare often filed, largely with the intent to bankrupt the firearms \nindustry. Contrary to the assertions by some, this\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\nbill is not about the NRA. This bill is about law-abiding gun owners, \nit is about law-abiding gun dealers, it is about law-abiding gun \nmanufacturers who are having that second amendment right infringed upon \nby those who are trying to destroy an industry that, for a couple of \ncenturies now, has provided quality workmanship in accordance with \nFederal and State laws.\n  This bill is about reestablishing some of the fairness and justice, \ngetting it back into our judicial system. This bill attempts to remedy \na system that allows innocent parties--in this case, gun manufacturers \nand gun dealers--who have abided by the law to become victims of \npredatory lawsuits.\n  Furthermore, we are protecting American workers who are in danger of \nlosing their jobs due to the enormous amount of money that must be \nspent to defend against unfounded lawsuits.\n  I also support this legislation because it would take the first step \nin ending what has been now a decades-long trend of using the courts to \neffect social change. For far too long, the American judicial system \nhas been used as a conduit around the legislative process in an attempt \nto make public policy or implement social change outside the democratic \nprocess.\n  The aim of this bill is clear: to allow legitimate lawsuits against a \nmanufacturer when the legal principles to do so are present. The bill \nallows suits against manufacturers who breach a contract or a warranty, \nfor negligent entrustment of a firearm, for violating a law in the \nproduction or sale of a firearm, or for harm caused by a defect in \ndesign or manufacture.\n  These are not arbitrary standards, nor are they an approved NRA wish \nlist. They are established legal principles that apply across the board \nto all industries. People who misuse firearms should pay for their \ncrimes and answer to those they injure. However tragic, a death or an \ninjury caused by a firearm should not create a windfall at the expense \nof the manufacturer if the manufacturer followed the law.\n  The manufacturer should not be held responsible for intentional and \nunforeseen acts of unrelated third parties.\n  The firearms industry has spent over $200 million in lawsuits. Many \nof these cases are not filed by injured parties but by city and \nmunicipal governments and special interest groups simply looking for \nthe deepest pockets and not the guilty party. This bill would not allow \nmanufacturers in the firearms industry to act as recklessly as they \nplease, as some have asserted.\n  The firearms industry is one of America's most regulated industries. \nFor example, a firearm is one of the few consumer goods that requires a \nwaiting period or a background check. Unfortunately, some ultimately \nhope to drive America's gun manufacturers into bankruptcy and \neventually out of business. The firearms industry is not only part of \nour tradition of outdoor and hunting sports, it is an integral part of \nour military manufacturing base. We cannot allow this industry to be \nbankrupted by unfounded lawsuits and endless litigation.\n  S. 397, this underlying bill, is good policy. It is a bipartisan bill \nwith over 60 cosponsors and it mirrors legislation that already exists \nin 33 States around this country. By supporting this bill we are \nsending a message that Congress is committed to protecting American \njobs and providing further security against predatory lawsuits. I \nencourage my colleagues to support the underlying legislation and to \nresist these amendments--these are killer amendments, gutting \namendments that would undermine the entire purpose behind this \nlegislation--and allow this legislation to pass and be put in place so \nthe gun manufacturers and dealers of this country can operate in a \nfair, sensible, and just environment with the goods they produce for \nAmerican firearms owners.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on my \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 7 minutes 45 seconds, \nand 53 seconds on the minority.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nleadership and his articulate explanation of why this is good \nlegislation. We are following the historic principles of civil \nlitigation in America. We had a group of activist, anti-gun litigators \nwho sometimes buddy up with a city or mayor somewhere--usually a big \ncity--and try to conjure up some way to make a legitimate manufacturer \nof a firearm liable for intervening acts of criminals and murderers.\n  That has never been the principle of American law, but it is a \nreality that is occurring today and it threatens an industry that \nsupplies our military with weapons. The Department of Defense is \nconcerned about it and they support this legislation. This industry \nsupplies weapons for our policemen as they go about their duties every \nday. If we do not watch it, we will end up with no domestic \nmanufacturing and have to import firearms to this country.\n  The Lautenberg amendment is unprincipled, unjustified, and \ninconsistent with the good policies of the bill. Why would we want to \nallow any group of people, whether age or sex or anything else, the \nnature of their job, be able to pursue a lawsuit that others would not \nbe able to pursue?\n  Mr. REED. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On the Senator's time. How much time do we have?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield time to respond if the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. I would be pleased to attempt to answer the \nquestion.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Alabama is a lawyer, a Federal attorney, \nand has made the statement that an intervening criminal act essentially \nabsolves someone of negligence, which I think is a fair response, but \nyet the statement of torts, which is recognized generally by most \nlawyers as the statement of basic law in torts, says very clearly that \nan intervening criminal act does not absolve someone from their own \nnegligence. Because of the standing of the Senator as an attorney, I \nsuggest that his conclusion does not comport with what most people \nassume is the law of the country.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All I know is I won a lawsuit on it. I defended the \nVeterans' Administration when a veteran went off the grounds and was \nmurdered by a murderer. They tried to sue the VA. They said the VA was \nnegligent in letting him get off the grounds of the VA. We alleged that \none could foresee certain things and cited abundant authority to the \nfact that no one should be held liable and should expect criminality, \nan intervening criminal act, of that kind.\n  That is my view of it, but maybe somebody else would not have that \nview.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Does the \nSenator from Idaho yield additional time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield additional time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Just 1 minute. It is my view that this is the classic \nprinciple of law and we have gotten away from it. We have eroded these \npractical, realistic, historical principles of liability and, as such, \ninsurance goes through the roof, huge verdicts are being filed against \nvictims. The allegation has been that if somebody had their firearm \nstolen by a thief, they then become liable if that thief goes and \nmurders somebody. What kind of principle of law is that? Maybe that is \nnot the idea behind this amendment, but that is the way I see it. I do \nnot think it is good.\n  This bill allows lawsuits for violation of contract, for negligence, \nin not following the rules and regulations and for violating any law or \nregulation that is part of the complex rules that control sellers and \nmanufacturers of firearms.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this Frist-Craig amendment ensures that \nnothing in the gun liability bill would limit the right of a person \nunder 17 to recover damages authorized by law in a civil action.\n  A person suing on behalf of an injured person can sue under \ntraditional tort law as always.\n  But the underlying Lautenberg amendment would allow lawsuits even\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nif no law is broken, no product is defective, and no person negligently \nsold a gun.\n  These are the types of suits we are trying to stop.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for the Frist-Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will close out our side and then the \nSenator from New Jersey can close.\n  From 1992 to the year 2003--and this is only in the area of \naccidental deaths by firearms--dramatically down, 54 percent. From 2001 \nto 2003, down 13 percent. That category is not quite what the Senator \ntalks about, but it is from 5 to 14 that makes up 1.6 percent of the \ntotal deaths by firearms, again dramatically down. Why? These are \naccidental. These are not on the streets of America. But out on the \nstreets of America, those are also down because we are enforcing the \nlaw and going after the criminal.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not going after law-abiding \ncitizens. I think the Senator from Alabama put it very clearly. All new \nlaw is being treaded upon instead of adhering to consistent, known, \nwell-established tort law in America.\n  I would hope my colleagues will support my amendment, the alternative \nto the Lautenberg amendment. I oppose the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and would hope that Senators \ncould conclude their remarks as we move to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, very quickly, not once in my comments \ndid I talk about taking away guns from people. We are discussing this \nparticular issue. There are three reasons that permit penetration of \nthe veil of immunity: negligent entrustment, negligence per se, and \ndefective products. Those who describe negligence as a cause are \nmistaken.\n  It was suggested that this would drive a truck through this bill. I \nwant to drive that truck full of children alive and healthy.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time. All time is \nexpired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I understand there is a time limitation. \nWe have 20 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1615.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the definition of armor piercing ammunition and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       On page 13, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Definition of Armor Piercing Ammunition.--\n     Section 921(a)(17)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iii) a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that \n     the Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be \n     capable or penetrating body armor; or\n       ``(iv) a projectile ror a center-fire rifle, designed or \n     marketed as having armor piercing capability, that the \n     Attorney General determines, under section 926(d), to be more \n     likely to penetrate body armor than standard ammunition or \n     the same caliber.''.\n       (b) Determination of the Capability of Projectiles To \n     Penetrate Body Armor.--Section 926 or title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the rollowing:\n       ``(d)(1) Not later than 1 year after the date or enactment \n     or this subsection, the Attorney General shall promulgate \n     standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against Body \n     Armor Exemplar.\n       ``(2) The standards promulgated under paragraph (1) shall \n     take into account, among other factors, variations in \n     perrormance that are related to the length of the barrel or \n     the handgun or center-fire rifle rrom which the projectile is \n     fired and the amount and kind or powder used to propel the \n     projectile.\n       ``(3) As used in paragraph (1), the term `Body Armor \n     Exemplar' means body armor that the Attorney General \n     determines meets minimum standards for the protection of law \n     enforcement officers.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express my strong appreciation to the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, for his leadership in opposition \nto this legislation. It has been enormously impressive. Many of us who \nshare his views are grateful for his steadfastness, his hard work, and \nhis perseverance and commitment.\n  It is preposterous to call this bill the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. If we were honest, we would call it the \n``Protection of Unlawful Commerce in Arms Act.'' It is a blatant \nspecial interest bill to protect gun manufacturers and sellers, even if \nthey recklessly make guns available to criminals and terrorists. This \naids and abets the perpetuation of these crimes. With all the urgent \nchallenges facing our country, it is difficult to believe that the Bush \nadministration and the Republican leadership are willing to spend any \ntime at all on this flagrant anti-victim, anti-law-enforcement \nlegislation, let alone push aside the major Defense authorization bill \nto make room for this debate.\n  President Bush called for clean passage of the bill without extending \nthe Federal ban on assault weapons, without closing the gun show \nloophole, and without any other needed reforms in our Nation's laws.\n  Instead of this special interest legislation, Congress should be \nconsidering important bills, such as Senator Feinstein's proposal to \nregulate .50 caliber weapons. These weapons are particularly dangerous \nbecause of their appeal to terrorists. These rifles can shoot down \nairplanes and destroy armored vehicles. These bullets can even \npenetrate several inches of steel. They have been called the ideal \ntools for terrorists. Who are we kidding?\n  In 1995, a RAND Corporation report identified these weapons as a \nserious threat to the security of U.S. Air Force bases. In 2003, a U.S. \nArmy intelligence training handbook called this rifle a weapon \n``attractive to terrorists for use in assassinations.'' Snipers love \nthem. A study funded by the Department of Homeland Security identified \nthese rifles as an imminent threat to civilian aviation. The report \nnoted that these weapons have been acquired by al-Qaida and even been \nused to attack our own troops in Iraq.\n  Barrett Firearms Manufacturing and E.D.M. Arms advertise these \nassault weapons as capable of destroying multimillion-dollar aircraft \nwith a single hit. Every bullet sold for these weapons puts our troops \nat risk. But are we working to stop that? No. Instead we are, once \nagain, debating a bill that threatens the safety of the American people \nin a way that undermines law enforcement and our national security. \nInstead we are guaranteeing that people who sell these rifles and \nammunition will never be held liable for their crimes.\n  With its raw special interest power, the National Rifle Association \nhas demonstrated that this bill is a top priority for Senate action. \nThey could care less that they are interrupting the important business \nof protecting our men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. They \nare willing to let unsavory gun dealers and gun manufacturers put \npowerful killing machines in the hands of criminals and terrorists \nwithout any regulation or liability. It is a national disgrace that \nAmerica does more to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns.\n  The Republican leadership and the Bush administration will do \nwhatever it takes to give the industry all it wants. The NRA wants gun \ndealers and manufacturers to be protected from lawsuits. The NRA \nexpects and demands that the Senate take away the courts as the last \nresort for victims of gun violence. For years the courts have been the \nonly place where negligent and often conspiring gun dealers and \nmanufacturers can be challenged.\n  The Senate majority leader says this bill is of urgent importance, \ntaking precedence over the Defense bill because the Department of \nDefense ``faces the real prospect of having to outsource sidearms for \nour soldiers to foreign manufacturers.'' Guess what. The bulk of \ncontracts to arm our country's military and law enforcement is already \nheld by foreign manufacturers based in Austria, Italy, Germany, Sweden, \nJordan, and Belgium. Lawsuits have nothing to do with that.\n  Furthermore, we have not heard one single company filing for \nbankruptcy in the absence of this legislation. The truth is that gun \nindustry profits are on the rise. The only two publicly held gun \ncompanies in this country have filed recent statements with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission specifically and emphatically \ncontradicting the claim that they are threatened by lawsuits.\n  Smith & Wesson filed a statement with the SEC, June 29, 2005, 1 month \nago, stating: We expect net product sales for fiscal 2005 to be \napproximately $124 million, a 5-percent increase over the $117 million \nreported for fiscal 2004. Firearms sales for fiscal 2005 are expected \nto increase by 11 percent over the fiscal 2004 level.\n  In another filing, dated March 10, 2005, Smith & Wesson wrote: In the \n9 months ended January 31, 2005, we incurred $4,500 in legal defense \ncosts.\n  Legal defense costs of $4,500 are supposed to be bankrupting the \ncompany? Let's get real.\n  At the same time, gun manufacturer Sturm, Rugr told the SEC in a \nMarch 1, 2005, filing: It is not probable and it is unlikely that \nlitigation, including punitive damage claims, will have a material \nadverse effect on the financial position of the company.\n  We have to wonder what the real agenda is here. The level of \nlitigation against gun manufacturers and dealers is miniscule. In a 10-\nyear period, only 57 suits were filed against gun industry defendants \nout of an estimated 10 million tort suits in America. We are supposed \nto buy the claim that these lawsuits are unduly burdening the gun \nindustry. No. This legislation is another in a long line of \ncongressional paybacks to the NRA, to the severe detriment of the \nsafety of the American people. The gun lobby has systematically made it \nmore difficult and, in some cases, even impossible for the government \nto police negligent gun dealers and manufacturers, while making it \neasier for criminals to buy guns.\n  Under the Brady bill, a licensed seller of firearms must run a \nbackground check through the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System. But at the NRA's demand, \nCongress drastically narrowed the definition of gun dealer. Reckless \nand unlicensed dealers are now selling millions of guns to people, \nincluding criminals and terrorists, without background checks. All of \nthat is legal because the U.S. Congress kowtowed to the National Rifle \nAssociation.\n  We have a shameless proposal before the Senate today that shields \neven the most reckless sales in the gun industry. This bill will even \nprotect manufacturers that promote military-style weapons for use in \nbattle in urban scenarios against any foe at any range. It protects \nmanufacturers who brag about their weapons of war and spread them to \nour streets.\n\n  Look at this advertisement from Vulcan. ``Vulcan Armament, the \nweapons of the special forces. From Afghanistan to Iraq, the guns of \nthe special forces are now on sale in America.''\n  All you need is a credit card. Call that company and you get that \nweapon. It is being used by special forces in Iraq. Do you think this \nbill has anything to do with protecting Americans from that? Absolutely \nnot.\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\n  The gun dealer claims: ``From Afghanistan to Iraq, the guns of the \nspecial forces are now on sale . . . '' How outrageous can dealers get? \nBut the NRA demands that these sales continue to be unregulated. Credit \ncard, computer, you get your sniper rifle used by the special forces. \nAnd are we doing anything about that? Absolutely not.\n  Congress continues to do their bidding as it has done for years. At \nthe insistence of the NRA, Congress has already tied the hands of law \nenforcement by cutting Federal funding for the agency that overseas gun \ndealers and manufacturers. According to the GAO, at the current level \nof underfunding, the ATF would take 22 years to inspect every gun \ndealer just once. What kind of enforcement is that? The GAO also tells \nus that people on the terrorist watch list are routinely buying guns in \nthis country. Under current law, terrorists are not prohibited buyers. \nAt the urging of the NRA, Congress is doing nothing about it. If that \nweren't enough, under this bill, gun manufacturers and sellers will be \nexempt from lawsuits even if they sell weapons to terrorists.\n  I have a GAO report that shows that there were 45 instances where the \nGAO found firearms-related background checks handled by the FBI \nresulted in valid matches with terrorist watch list records. Of this \ntotal, 35 transactions were allowed to proceed. If they get on the \nlist, they are supposed to notify Homeland Security. But in this case, \n35 transactions were allowed to proceed because the background checks \nfound no prohibiting information. What does that mean? The prohibiting \ninformation are the categories that would deny them the ability to sell \nthese weapons. For example, if you have had a felony conviction, you \ncan't sell them; illegal immigration, you can't sell them; domestic \nviolence, you can't sell them.\n  Member of a terrorist organization? You can sell them. Do you think \nthis bill is doing anything about that? Do you think we are doing \nanything about that? No. It is disgraceful. Absolutely disgraceful.\n  We already know the terrorists are exploiting the weaknesses and \nloopholes in the Nation's gun laws. In the caves of Afghanistan our \ntroops found an al-Qaida manual that instructed terrorists on how to \nbuy guns legally in the United States without having to undergo a \nbackground check. Al-Qaida understands that we have created a mess that \nallows, even encourages, criminals and terrorists to traffic in guns.\n  Why do we in this body continue to ignore it? We are not talking \nabout some hypothetical situation. In 2000, a member of a terrorist \ngroup in the Middle East was convicted in Detroit on weapons charges \nand conspiracy to ship weapons and ammunition to Lebanon. He had bought \nmany of these weapons at gun shows in Michigan. In 1999, only a lack of \ncash prevented two persons from purchasing a grenade launcher at a gun \nshow in a plot to blow up two large propane tanks in suburban \nSacramento. But instead of addressing these real and serious problems, \nthe Senate is considering this outrageous immunity bill that even gives \nthe gun industry protection from administrative proceedings to revoke \nlicenses of dealers who sell to illegal buyers.\n  This bill will bar State attorneys general from bringing civil \nactions against gun sellers, even those engaged in so-called straw \nsales to middlemen who buy guns from prohibited buyers. Why should the \nindustry stop there? At the demand of the NRA, Congress has already \nexempted the gun industry from Federal consumer safety regulation. But \nthe NRA wants more. It is a disgrace.\n  The NRA has also persuaded our Government to destroy gun purchasing \nbackground records within 24 hours. Our Justice Department refused to \nexamine the gun records of any of the 19 hijackers or 1,200 suspected \nterrorists rounded up after 9/11. We can know everything about law-\nabiding citizens in this country, but we can't know about the \nterrorists purchasing these weapons. Within days of 9/11, we knew who \nthe hijackers were, where they sat on the planes. We saw some of their \nfaces on surveillance videos. We knew what they had charged on their \ncredit cards. We knew where they had gone to school. We knew where they \nlived, where they traveled. We knew they had tried to get pilot's \nlicenses. We knew they had looked for a way to transport hazardous \nchemicals. But we didn't know whether our terrorist friends had \npurchased firearms because we were worried about their privacy rights \nand their right to bear arms.\n  Give me a break. Give me a break. Make no mistake, Mr. President, the \nNational Rifle Association clearly comes first in this Senate \nRepublican agenda. This is not just about the immunity bill on the \nfloor today. If this bill passes, it will open the floodgates for NRA's \nother priorities. None of these priorities will protect our citizens or \nmake this country safer. Designed by the NRA, it promotes the sale of \nguns by manufacturers if they are sold to criminals. The NRA is \nlavishly rewarded for lobbying victories, and so are the Members of \nCongress who do their bidding.\n  This is an unholy alliance, Mr. President. This bill gives greater \nprotection to the gun industry than Congress has given to any industry, \nand it is a dangerous precedent. At a minimum, we owe a duty to the \npolice officers who are more in jeopardy because of the increasing \nnumber of dangerous weapons and ammunition in the hands of criminals. \nThe Treasury Department already has regulations containing some \nprohibitions on armor-piercing ammunition. My amendment would expand \nthe ban on that. It can easily be sold over the Internet, no questions \nasked. That is a disgrace and danger to police officers throughout the \nNation.\n  The NRA would have us believe cop-killer bullets are a myth, they \ndon't exist. Try to tell that to some of the sellers on eBay. Here you \ngo, Mr. President. This chart represents what is on eBay. All you need \nis one click of the computer, and you can buy these bullets on eBay--\narmor-piercing bullets. They are $15 on eBay, armor-piercing bullets.\n  Now let's look at what has happened in the last year, in 2004. The \nnumber of police officers killed was 54, and 32 of these officers were \nwearing body armor. The only bullet that can pierce the armor is the \ncop-killer bullet. That is what this amendment addresses, the cop-\nkiller bullet. It will stop the sale of the cop-killer bullet. These \nare the types of armor-piercing ammunition. All you have to do is look \nat these words, ``hardened steel or tungsten carbide.'' Any terrorist \nknows what that means. Put those words together, and it goes right \nthrough a police officer's armored vest. We have had 54 police officers \nkilled in the line of duty; 32 were wearing body armor.\n  This is the FBI report of May 16, 2005. I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFBI Preliminary Statistics Show 54 Law Enforcement Officers Feloniously \n                             Killed in 2004\n\n       Washington, D.C.--Fifty-four law enforcement officers were \n     feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2004, according to \n     preliminary statistics released today by the FBI's Uniform \n     Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. Nearly half of the officers \n     killed, 26, were in the South; 9 officers were in the \n     Midwest; 9 were in the West; and 7 were in the Northeast. Two \n     were in Puerto Rico, and 1 was in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \n     The number of officers killed was up 2 from the 52 officers \n     killed in 2003.\n       The 54 officer deaths occurred during 47 different \n     incidents. Police cleared 46 out of the 47 incidents by \n     arrest or exceptional means. One offender is still at large. \n     Of the officers killed, 16 died in arrest situations, 12 died \n     responding to disturbance calls, 7 died investigating \n     suspicious persons or circumstances, 6 were ambushed, and 6 \n     more were killed in traffic pursuits or stops. Two officers \n     were killed while handling mentally deranged persons, 2 died \n     while involved in investigative activities, 2 died in \n     tactical situations, and 1 died handling and transporting a \n     prisoner.\n       As in previous years, most offenders used firearms to kill \n     police officers in 2004. Of the 52 officers who died from \n     gunshot wounds, 36 were fatally injured with handguns, 12 \n     were shot with rifles, and 4 were killed with shotguns. \n     Offenders used vehicles to kill 2 officers. Thirty-two \n     officers were wearing body armor, 11 fired their own weapons, \n     and 9 attempted to fire their own weapons. Seven of the \n     officers had their service weapons stolen, and 6 were killed \n     with their own weapons.\n       In addition to the officers feloniously killed, 82 law \n     enforcement officers died accidentally in the performance of \n     their duties in 2004. This is an increase of 1 over the 2003 \n     total of 81 officers killed accidentally.\n       The UCR Program's publication, Law Enforcement Officers \n     Killed and Assaulted, 2004, is scheduled to be released in \n     the fall. The publication, produced annually, includes final \n     statistics and complete details.\n\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is what this amendment does. Nobody can deny that \nour policemen and policewomen face a greater threat every day from \nthese armor-piercing weapons and bullets that remain in our community. \nIt is outrageous and unconscionable that such ammunition continues to \nbe sold in the United States.\n  Mr. President, victims of gun violence and their families oppose this \nunderlying legislation. I wish to mention the organizations that \nsupport my amendment. The International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \nthe National Black Police Association, the Hispanic American Police \nCommand Officers, the National Latino Police Officers, and the Major \nCity Chiefs Association representing the Nation's largest police \ndepartments all support this amendment.\n  If you are interested in the security of those who are protecting us \non the streets and in our communities and in our homes across this \nNation, support my amendment, not a phony amendment that will be put on \nby the other side.\n  I withhold my time.\n  Ms CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I rise to cast another vote in \nfavor of strict control on armor-piercing, cop-killer bullets. I am \nproud to stand to strengthen the penalties against those who use this \nammunition. I also would like to set the record straight on my position \non the same amendment last year. Last year, like this year, several \nSenators offered versions of this measure. I support both strengthening \nthe penalties and the other provisions of the Craig/Frist amendment, as \nwell as the broader definition of banned cop-killer ammunition in the \nKennedy amendment, which I believe provides even stronger protection \nfor America's law enforcement officers. That is why I am voting for \nboth of these amendments and why I wish I had been recorded supporting \nboth of these amendments last year.\n  In preparation for today's vote, it was discovered that my position \nwas inaccurately recorded last year. While Senate rules do not allow \nfor a formal correction of an error from a previous Congress, I today \nsubmit for the record that I supported the Frist/Craig amendment last \nyear, just as I do today.\n  And I particularly thank both the Senator from Idaho and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for their work on this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Kennedy have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 1 minute 39 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1645\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send a relevant first-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1645.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To regulate the sale and possession of armor piercing \n                  ammunition, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 13, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Unlawful Acts.--Section 922(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking paragraphs (7) and (8) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(7) for any person to manufacture or import armor \n     piercing ammunition, unless--\n       ``(A) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the use of \n     the United States, any department or agency of the United \n     States, any State, or any department, agency, or political \n     subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the purpose \n     of exportation; or\n       ``(C) the manufacture or importation of such ammunition is \n     for the purpose of testing or experimentation and has been \n     authorized by the Attorney General;\n       ``(8) for any manufacturer or importer to sell or deliver \n     armor piercing ammunition, unless such sale or delivery--\n       ``(A) is for the use of the United States, any department \n     or agency of the United States, any State, or any department, \n     agency, or political subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) is for the purpose of exportation; or\n       ``(C) is for the purpose of testing or experimentation and \n     has been authorized by the Attorney General;''.\n       (b) Penalties.--Section 924(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence \n     is otherwise provided under this subsection, or by any other \n     provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to \n     any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for \n     an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be \n     prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries \n     armor piercing ammunition, or who, in furtherance of any such \n     crime, possesses armor piercing ammunition, shall, in \n     addition to the punishment provided for such crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime or conviction under this \n     section--\n       ``(A) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less \n     than 15 years; and\n       ``(B) if death results from the use of such ammunition--\n       ``(i) if the killing is murder (as defined in section \n     1111), be punished by death or sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and\n       ``(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in \n     section 1112), be punished as provided in section 1112.''.\n       (c) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study to \n     determine whether a uniform standard for the testing of \n     projectiles against Body Armor is feasible.\n       (2) Issues to be studied.--The study conducted under \n     paragraph (1) shall include--\n       (A) variations in performance that are related to the \n     length of the barrel of the handgun or center-fire rifle from \n     which the projectile is fired; and\n       (B) the amount of powder used to propel the projectile.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report containing the results of the study conducted under \n     this subsection to--\n       (A) the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate; and\n       (B) the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to the argument of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts. To hear it, you would say the \nsky is truly falling, that this world is just falling apart and that \neverything being done in law enforcement just doesn't work, and that if \nwe don't do what his amendment says, we are going to be for terrorism \nand everything else in this world.\n  I rise to speak against the Kennedy amendment and for the Frist-Craig \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The first-degree amendment Senator Craig just filed would strengthen \nthe penalties for violating the existing ban on armor-piercing \nammunition for handguns. It would also create a study on the effects of \nadopting a performance-based standard for ammunition.\n  This exact same first-degree amendment passed overwhelmingly last \nyear on the floor of the Senate, and I suspect it will again this year. \nLet me make clear why the Kennedy amendment, without this first-degree \namendment, would be harmful.\n  The Kennedy amendment would ban nearly all hunting rifle ammunition. \nIt is also opposed by law enforcement organizations such as the \nFraternal Order of Police, the largest law enforcement agency or \norganization in the country.\n  The fact is that we have laws in this area that are working. The \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the BATFE, reached \nthe same conclusion in a recent study. The existing laws were adopted \nin 1986 and prohibit the manufacture and importation, for private use, \nof handgun bullets made of certain hard metals and specially jacketed \nbullets. The BATFE found that ``no additional legislation regarding \nsuch laws is necessary.''\n  My friend from Massachusetts believes all we have to do is just keep \npassing laws and that will solve every problem. The Departments of \nJustice and Treasury opposed legislation similar to this amendment back \nwhen it was first introduced in the 1980s. Congress rejected it then. \nWe ought to reject it now.\n  Let me give a couple other facts that are important. The Frist-Craig \namendment we are offering here today recognizes, as the Fraternal Order \nof Police points out, that the current law regarding armor-piercing \nammunition is working; that is, it states that it is unlawful to \nmanufacture and import, for private use, handgun bullets made of \nspecial hard metals and specially jacketed lead bullets. It also \nrequires the\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nAttorney General to study and report on whether it is feasible to \ndevelop standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against body \narmor.\n  The difference that the alternative amendment--the Frist-Craig \namendment--makes is in the law's message. It says that if armor-\npiercing ammunition is used to kill a law enforcement officer, then the \nmaximum penalty available is the death penalty. It doesn't get any \ntougher than that. If armor-piercing ammunition is used in the \ncommission of a crime that wounds but doesn't kill a law enforcement \nofficer, there will be a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.\n  Let's talk about how this is different. It sends a message to \ncriminals in this country that not only is this ammunition illegal, if \nthey use it to kill law enforcement officers who put their lives on the \nline every day for our citizens, families, and communities, they will \npay the ultimate price.\n  Mr. President, we should reject the Kennedy amendment. We should \nfollow what law enforcement in this country says. It does not get any \nbetter than the FOP. Last year, the Senate rejected the Kennedy \namendment 34 to 63 and instead adopted the Frist-Craig amendment by a \nvote of 85 to 12. We should do that again.\n  I compliment my colleague for the hard work he has done on this \nparticular bill. I hope we will all vote for the alternative amendment \nof Senator Craig.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will have a brief comment. Do any of my colleagues wish \nto comment?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have some great friends in law \nenforcement. They have served their country and States and communities \nwell over the years. We hunt and fish together at various times. I am \nnot hearing them say this is what they would like to see. If you talk \nto law officers, what they are concerned about is repeat dangerous \noffenders getting released on the streets. A police officer never knows \nwhen he may face someone like that around the corner, at a traffic \nstop, or in a domestic violence situation. Those are things that \nconcern them. They do feel sometimes that the criminal justice system \nis too slow, that the punishment and penalties that are imposed by law \nnever get carried out. Those things frustrate them. That follows \nthrough and is consistent with the letters we have received regarding \nthe Kennedy amendment.\n  I am looking at the Law Enforcement Alliance of America letter, which \nthey wrote to Senator Craig. This is a very clear and strong message. \nThey represent 75,000 members in support of law enforcement. They \nwanted to ``add our voice to the growing group of law enforcement \nrepresentatives who strongly oppose efforts to gut or kill S. 397, the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.''\n  They refer to this amendment as a ``poison pill'' and object to the \nterm ``cop killer bullet'' as a ``thinly veiled fraud.'' They go on to \nsay:\n\n       This amendment, along with other amendments, should be \n     identified for what they are: an outright attempt to kill S. \n     397.\n       Please know that many in the law enforcement community \n     encourage you to continue steadfastly in support of America's \n     gun manufacturers who provide our officers the tools to \n     return home safely at the end of their shift.\n\n  Also, the Fraternal Order of Police has written to Senator Craig in \n``strong opposition'' to the amendment offered by Senator Kennedy. They \nsay that this will be presented as a ``officer safety issue'' to get \ndangerous ``cop killer bullets off the shelves.''\n  Then they add:\n\n       Regardless of its presentation, the amendment's actual \n     claim and effect would be to expand the definition of \n     ``armor-piercing'' to include ammunition based, not on any \n     threat to law enforcement officers, but on a manufacturer's \n     marketing strategy.\n\n  Then they add this, which is interesting:\n\n       The truth of the matter is that only one law officer has \n     been killed by a round fired from a handgun which penetrated \n     his soft body armor--and in that single instance, it was the \n     body armor that failed to provide the expected ballistic \n     protections, not because the round was ``armor-piercing.''\n\n  They say:\n\n       It is our view that no expansion or revision of the current \n     law is needed to protect law enforcement officers.\n\n  That letter is to Senator Craig. No additional legislation is needed \nto protect law officers.\n\n       To put it simply, this is not a genuine [law enforcement] \n     officer safety issue.\n\n  They noted that it had been rejected previously--last year, 63 to 34. \nThey say it should be rejected again.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe all that can be said about these \ntwo amendments has been said. I hope my colleagues join in voting for \nthe first-degree relevant amendment I have offered that toughens up \npenalties and recognizes the reality that the law we have today is \nworking to protect our law enforcement community from armor-piercing \nbullets.\n  I yield back the balance of my time. Senator Kennedy can conclude and \nwe can move to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have in my hand the Federal Firearms \nRegulations Reference Guide that bans 14 different types of ammunition \ntoday. All we are trying to do is add a 15th. What will the 15th do? It \nwill be limited to cop-killer bullets.\n  My friends, the Republican amendment says we should study the problem \nof cop-killer bullets. Our police officers are the ones that are in the \nline of fire, and we are going to protect them with a study?\n  If you care about fighting terrorism, you will reject the Republican \namendment and vote for my amendment to take real action. If you care \nabout protecting our brave police officers, you will support my \namendment. They risk their lives for us every single day.\n  This is not about hunting. We know duck and geese and deer do not \nwear armor vests; police officers do. This can save their lives. I hope \nit will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding, under the unanimous consent that \nthe Craig first degree would be the first to be voted on; Kennedy would \nbe the second to be voted on. I ask unanimous consent the second vote \nbe a 10-minute vote. I urge my colleagues to come now, as quickly as we \ncan, to move these votes.\n  I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nsecond vote will be 10 minutes.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1645\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Idaho.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu) and the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Roberts).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just a clarification. A lot of people will \nhave questions. We had these time allotments and we have asked Senators \nnot to use all of the time that has been allocated. That is the general \nunderstanding. With that we have an orderly way of very quickly \ncompleting our rollcall votes for the course of the day. But with that, \nwe can explain it over to the side that we are in shape and have a plan \nin order to finish at a very reasonable hour.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1619\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1619.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1619.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the rights of law enforcement officers who are \n victimized by crime to secure compensation from those who participate \n                          in arming criminals)\n\n       On page 13, after line 4, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the \n     right of an officer or employee of any Federal, State, or \n     local law enforcement agency to recover damages authorized \n     under Federal or State law.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  I come to the floor today moved by an event that occurred in my life \nthis week and more importantly the life of a family in New Jersey.\n  Sometimes there are events that move you to feel passionately. I went \nto a wake for an officer on Monday night. I actually missed a vote.\n  The reality is that an officer was gunned down a week before by a \ngang member, a Blood, on the streets of Newark. This police officer was \na man with five children. He was 32 years old, the oldest child of 11.\n  Violence brought on by the illegal movement of guns in our society \nand the irresponsible dealing in guns is something that actually costs \npeople's lives. I have an amendment which I have talked about \npreviously. I am a realist and I know where this amendment is going, so \nwe will deal with it on a practical basis.\n  But my amendment is an effort to protect the rights of law \nenforcement officers who are victimized by gun violence. I want to make \ncertain that law enforcement officers can seek compensation from gun \nmanufacturers and dealers who participate in arming criminals.\n  I am not a lawyer, so I can't define negligence with the perfection \nthat maybe others can. I know this amendment is not going to pass, and \nI know this gun industry immunity bill will pass.\n  This is a picture of another officer from Orange, NJ. We have heard a \nlot about Detective Lemongello and his\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\npartner, Officer McGuire. They were shot in 2001. They subsequently \nbrought a case in court and reached a $1 million settlement with the \ngun dealer, because that gun dealer in West Virginia sold 12 guns to \nwhat we call a straw buyer. This straw buyer, by the way, was standing \nnext to a second person who qualified as a potential purchaser of \nweapons and just handed them off, and then that individual walked out, \nput them in a car, drove off to New Jersey and sold them on the \nstreets. I call that negligence. It was so negligent and so obviously \nnegligent that the gun dealer, the day after being paid in cash for \nthose 12 guns, called up the AFT and said: We think we made a mistake. \nWe ought to do something about this. And so they called up the AFT. But \nit was too late, and nothing happened to stop the flow of the guns to \nNew Jersey, but at least they recognized that they had done something \nwrong.\n  Detective Lemongello and Officer McGuire brought a lawsuit against \nthis gun dealer. They went to court and received justice, although both \ncannot return to the streets as police officers. They got a $1 million \nsettlement. One took three bullets, one took two, and the other 11 guns \npurchased that day in West Virginia were also resold and distributed. I \nwonder whether one of those guns was the used to murder Police Officer \nReeves last week in Newark, NJ.\n  I think it is time we recognize there needs to be the ability to use \nboth the criminal justice and the civil justice system to protect our \ncitizens, particularly our law enforcement officers.\n  We have heard from Senator Reed, who has done an enormous service to \nthe country, in my view, to bring up so many of the flaws in the \narguments that have been made by my colleagues who support this bill.\n  This bill is not right. We are taking people who protect us at their \nown risk every day and we are shutting the door to the courthouse in \ntheir face. So I believe strongly that we ought to be protecting our \nlaw enforcement officers. I passionately believe that because I see it \nand the distress it brings to families and communities and all who are \ninvolved.\n  My amendment is not a political desire to challenge the NRA or \nanybody else. And, frankly, I do not understand how anyone could not \nsupport this amendment. I do not get it from a commonsense point of \nview. It is a right and a responsibility that we protect those who \nprotect us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will not be asking for a rollcall but a \nvoice vote on my amendment acknowledging the realities and the \npractical aspects of moving the floor, if that is appropriate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, no one questions Senator Corzine's \nintention or his sincerity as we are all sincere and concerned about \nmaking sure that the law enforcement community of this country has the \nbest tools available, has the greatest protection available. We want \nthe laws with them, and we believe the laws are with them. And the \nFraternal Order of Police, the world's largest organization, believes \nthe same thing.\n  Last year, this amendment was opposed by them strongly and they \nexpressed that very clearly. The reason was they do not believe a \nspecial category is necessary in that relationship. What is happening \nhere is an attempt to carve out that unique category because we think \nthe law enforcement community is well protected under the current law.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I point out this year, by decision, the FOP is not \ntaking a position with regard to my amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is true, they are not taking a position this year, \nbut I did get permission from Tim Richardson, if there is any question \nof verifying what I said, that as the executive he would be happy to \naccept a call.\n  The point is quite simple. This is an amendment that destroys the \nunderlying intent of the legislation involved. I hope my colleagues \nwould oppose the amendment as they did last year by a substantial vote, \n56 in opposition, 38 for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will not speak on the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey, which I support, but on the underlying \nprovision. It is hard for me to accept the fact that we are taking a \nspecial interest, we are taking an industry that deals with something \nthat admittedly can be dangerous, and exempting them from liability and \ngiving them greater exemption than just about anybody else.\n  We talk about special interests. That is exactly what ``special \ninterests'' means. Giving it to one small group because they have \ninfluence rather than for a whole larger group who may also deserve it. \nEven when somebody is grossly negligent, even when an organization does \nnot abide by the rules, they will still get an exemption. How can we \nsay that to people who are injured, perhaps, as a result of that \nnegligence and carelessness?\n  I want people to remember the terror brought upon ordinary Americans \nwith the Washington snipers. These terrorists acquired their assault \nrifle to shoot 13 people. They got the rifle at the Bull's Eye Shooter \nSupply. Bull's Eye could not account for the sale. Bull's Eye could not \naccount for 230 of its guns. Yet Bull's Eye would be protected when \nthese families sought recompense by this legislation. Who in America \nwould exempt a gun dealer who repeatedly violated the law and put them \nabove those who had lost loved ones?\n  That says enough. I know my colleagues are eager to move on so I will \nnot speak for much longer. If Members want to know why the American \npeople get fed up with this body, it is legislation such as this that \ncaters to a small, powerful group.\n  The right to guns is a good thing. I support the second amendment. \nBut no amendment is absolute. Not the first, not the fourth, not any of \nthem, including the second. There are some here who believe only the \nsecond amendment should be exalted above all the others. I disagree.\n  This is an awful piece of legislation, despite my respect for its \nsponsor. I urge we defeat it.\n  To reiterate, I rise in opposition to this bill, which will give a \nfree pass to gun dealers and gun manufacturers, even when their \nproducts wreak havoc on innocent people.\n  With all of the important business before the Senate right now, it is \nshocking that we would spend our time giving unwarranted and \nunprecedented immunity to an industry whose products, when allowed into \nthe hands of the wrong people, do incredible harm to innocent \nAmericans. We even put off working on a defense bill to do this favor \nto the gun lobby.\n  This bill, will literally endanger people's lives because it \neliminates the last check we have, on bad gun dealers--the threat of \nlawsuits.\n  This bill will hurt victims of gun violence all across America--the \ninnocent men, women and children who will end up being shot and killed \nif this bill passes because a gun dealer can't or won't keep track of \nhis guns and there is no check on him.\n  We remember too well the terror that was brought upon ordinary \nAmericans when the Washington snipers, John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd \nMalvo, went on their 23-day shooting spree.\n  These terrorists acquired the assault rifle that they used to shoot \n13 people at Bull's Eye Shooter Supply, and Bull's Eye could not \naccount for that sale.\n  In fact, Bull's Eye couldn't account for over 230 of its guns. This \nbill would protect gun dealers like Bull's Eye from lawsuits by the \nfamilies of the sniper victims.\n  And this wasn't a dealer operating under the radar. In fact, Bull's \nEye was inspected by the ATF not once, not twice, not even three, but \nfour times in the 6 years prior to the sniper shootings. And what did \nthose inspections reveal? They revealed that Bull's Eye could not \naccount for over 160 guns missing from its inventory.\n  One of these guns was used by the DC snipers to kill ten innocent \npeople and injure three others. It was only after people died that ATF \ndid a real investigation and found that it was not 160, but 238 guns \nthat were missing.\n  But it was still open and doing business.\n  What recourse did the sniper victims and their families have while \nthey were\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\nwaiting for the government to act? These victims sued the gun dealer \nfor negligence, and won a $2.5 million settlement.\n  That won't bring back the innocent people who were killed by the \nsnipers. But it gives these victims what we are all entitled to when \nsomeone else's negligence does us harm--our day in court and the \nopportunity to achieve justice.\n\n  This bill would shield bad dealers like Bull's Eye from justice. It \nwould say to people like the victims of the DC snipers--``I'm sorry but \nyou have no right to your day in court because Congress has made a \nspecial exception for bad gun dealers.''\n  We don't do this for other industries, but due to pressure from the \ngun lobby we are being asked to carve out a special exception to an \nindustry that makes and sells what are, in the hands of the wrong \npeople, very deadly weapons.\n  In Philadelphia, a small child found a gun on the street and \naccidentally shot a 7-year-old boy. That boy's mother was able to \nrecover a settlement from the gun dealer, who negligently sold multiple \nguns to a gun trafficker. One of those guns ultimately caused her son's \ndeath. This bill would deny that mother her day in court.\n  And it's not just about money. Gun dealers and manufacturers also \nagree to implement safer practices as a result of these negligence \nsuits. This bill would give bad dealers and manufacturers no incentive \nto enact these safer practices.\n  Lawsuits against bad dealers, or dealers who are too lazy to \nadequately keep track of their inventories, do not affect the right of \nlaw-abiding Americans to safely use guns to hunt or collect.\n  But this bill does wipe away the right of American citizens to have \ntheir day in court. This bill destroys that right and slams the \ncourthouse door in the faces of gun crime victims who are trying to \nmake sure that gun dealers are responsible.\n  We have heard some of my colleagues talking here about the importance \nof responsibility. Well this bill says that everyone should be \nresponsible--except the gun industry. You get a free pass. The rules \nthat apply to every other industry in America don't apply to you.\n  Our court system works. And when a frivolous or baseless lawsuit is \nbrought, there are rules to make sure that it doesn't go forward.\n  We should allow the system to continue to work. It worked for two New \nJersey police officers who won a $1 million settlement from a dealer \nwho negligently sold 12 guns to a straw buyer. It worked when the \ndealer agreed to implement safer sales practices to prevent criminals \nfrom getting guns.\n  That is why I also want to encourage my colleagues to support the \namendment being offered by my friend from New Jersey, Senator Corzine. \nThis sensible amendment will allow law enforcement officers like those \ntwo New Jersey police officers to obtain justice when careless sellers \nallow guns to get into the wrong hands.\n  So the system needs to work for all Americans--and Congress shouldn't \ncreate special rules for special interest groups, especially when the \nlives of so many people are literally at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Corzine \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1619) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1642\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have one amendment remaining, the \namendment of Senator Reed. There is a time agreement on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 1642.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer to let me know when I have reached 10 \nminutes.\n  My amendment has an overarching purpose, to preserve the right of an \nindividual to sue for negligence when they have been harmed and when \nthat negligence can be fairly attributed to a gun manufacturer, gun \ndealer, or a gun trade association. It does not depart from the \nprinciples of the law. In fact, it braces the fundamental principle of \nthe law which says if someone owes you a duty of care and violates that \nduty and you have been harmed, you have a right to go into court.\n  The legislation before the Senate not only sweeps away the rights of \nindividuals but sweeps away the rights of municipalities, counties, and \nother government entities. This is one of the major reasons the \nadvocates have been talking about in this legislation. They have said \nthere has been a rash of suits by municipalities, not about recovering \ndamages, but about undercutting and undermining the gun industry.\n  I am reluctant to change what I think is well-settled law and well-\nsettled practice, but if we are confronted with this legislation, I \npropose we step back and perhaps reluctantly eliminate suits by \nmunicipalities, but for goodness sakes, we can have and maintain suits \nby individuals.\n  The reason this legislation is before the Senate is because they \nclaim there is a crisis. But if you look at the financial reports of \nthese companies--of Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger--there is no \ncrisis. The financial report of Smith & Wesson indicates they are \nactually reducing the amount of their reserve to cover these types of \nsuits, which is a strong indication, because it is real dollars, that \nthis threat is dissipating. It is not becoming more enhanced. This \ncrisis is manufactured. And it is, indeed, evaporating.\n  This suit will deny ordinary people, our constituents, their voice \nbefore the courts when they have been harmed. No one is going out and \ngetting shot so they can bring a lawsuit. That is preposterous. They \nare being shot because people have been either criminal or negligent or \nboth. We have criminal laws to deal with criminals, but we have a well-\nestablished body of civil practice which allowed an individual to go in \nand be compensated, receive damages for the harm they have suffered.\n  This legislation, the underlying legislation, would bar the door to \ncourthouses for real people. Who are some of these real people? We all \nknow about the most notorious incidents in the last several years, the \nWashington, DC snipers. If this legislation passed in the last \nCongress, and it was on the verge of passing, these people would have \nbeen denied their day in court.\n  Ted Franklin is the husband of Linda Franklin, a resident of \nArlington, VA. On October 14, 2002, Linda Franklin was a 47-year-old \nanalyst for the FBI. She had two children and a loving husband. She, \nlike so many of us do, was in the parking lot of Home Depot loading up \npurchases for their new home when she was killed by the sniper.\n  How did the sniper get his weapon? Well, a teenaged boy walked into a \ngunshop in Washington State and apparently shoplifted a 3-foot-long \nassault weapon. The manager did not know about it and he did not know \nwhere over 200 weapons were. That is gross negligence, certainly, the \nkind of fact that would get you before a court. She was killed. A 47-\nyear-old, dependable worker of the FBI.\n  Margaret Walekar is the wife of Premkumar, who was shot at the age of \n54 while he was refueling his cab at a gas station. Tonight, as you \nfill up your automobile at a gas station, just think, someone else was \ndoing that and innocently was killed and the heart of the causation of \nthat tragic event was the negligence.\n  After this legislation passes, if it does, that negligent gun dealer \nand that negligent manufacturer who contributed the weapons would not \nbe held liable for the death of this man.\n  Carlos Cruz is the husband of Sarah Ramos. They had one son, age 7. \nShe was 34 and was sitting on a bench in front of a post office on \nOctober 3, 2003, waiting for a ride to take her to her baby-sitting job \nwhen she was shot and killed by the Bushmaster assault weapon \nshoplifted from that negligent gun dealer in Washington State.\n  I could go on and on and on. These are innocent victims. These are \nour neighbors. These are our constituents. These are the people we will \ntell, unless we adopt the Reed amendment, you have no value in the eyes \nof the court. You have no voice in that court. You are not important.\n  Who is important? The National Rifle Association. The gun lobby. The \ngun dealers. They are important. But these good people are not \nimportant.\n  At a minimum, we have to allow the tort law of the various States \nthat has been worked out to be operative for these individuals. Certain \nStates, very few, have restricted--again at the behest of the gun \nlobby--certain activities. I don't object to that. But that is\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\nmore the normal course of activity since tort law is the province \ntypically of the State. But no State is going as far as this \nlegislation. No State is going to the extent of practically barring all \nclaims.\n  Now the proponents will stand up and say, no, no, wait, we have \nexceptions. These exceptions have been carefully crafted to prevent the \nvery cases I have spoken about and we have spoken about from getting to \ncourt. These are the real cases. This is what happens. People buy guns \nthrough straw purchases. That activity is virtually totally immunized \nby this legislation. As a result, we are going to see, I think, more \nreckless behavior.\n  We have already identified through the reporting system of the ATF \nand other gun shops across this country that have records and are \nsupplying hundreds of guns to crime scenes, some within a short period \nof time. A weapon is purchased and a few days later found at a crime \nscene. If they are behaving that way now under the cloud of potential \nlitigation, what will they do when they feel totally immunized, free, \nuninhibited, to be grossly negligent? The result, of course, is not \nsome academic statistics. The result is people such as Linda Franklin.\n\n  I note that a few moments ago, in Senatorial time, we took a vote on \nlegislation that would at least have given children the ability to use \nthe existing tort laws of their State without the conditions and \nencumbrances of this legislation. That provision by Senator Lautenberg \nwas struck down. That amendment failed.\n  What about the case with respect to the Washington sniper where Iran \nBrown, a 13-year-old boy, was walking to class? All of us who were here \nvividly remember watching the television set, vividly remember seeing \nthe reports of a young boy walking to the Benjamin Tasker Middle School \nin Lanham, MD, and being shot by a sniper. The fear that grasped \neveryone here, parents particularly, that their child could be the next \nvictim, that their school could be the next target, was palpable. He \nwas rushed to a nearby medical center. Thank goodness, after a month in \ncritical condition he survived. What if he had been critically injured \nor paralyzed? Who was going to pay for that young child's life and \nrecovery if he could not allege that the negligence of the gun dealer \ncontributed to his injury?\n  That is the reality. This legislation is actually modeled on the \nlegislation adopted by the State of Idaho. Certainly that is a State \nthat is proud of its tradition of recreational shooting and hunting. \nThis State adopted this legislation. They recognized the problem and \nthey took exactly the same steps we have taken. If municipalities and \npublic interest groups are going after the gun dealers or gun \nmanufacturers because they want to make a political point, we are not \ngoing to allow victims in Idaho who have been shot to be able to raise \ntheir voice in court?\n  Texas has a similar statute. They put restrictions upon \nmunicipalities, they put restrictions upon groups that might take \npolitical suits, and we have heard about those suits, but they have let \nordinary citizens have a much more expansive right to go to court than \nanything included in this legislation before the Senate.\n  So we are not even being consistent with the States of Idaho and \nTexas and many others and we are usurping the role of States which \ntraditionally set the standards for tort actions in their own States'. \nThat is an interesting position for people who I used to think were \nfaithful to this notion of State rights, State practice, local control, \nand let the people of Rhode Island, Idaho, and Massachusetts, let those \npeople decide.\n  We are deciding if this Reed amendment fails and we pass the \nunderlying bill that these people--Linda Franklin and James Franklin, \nthe husband of the victim, and Lisa Brown, the mother of Iran Brown--\nare not worth it.\n  They don't mean anything. You have heard people say these are junk \nlawsuits. Are these lives junk? They are not.\n  We have a chance at least to preserve the right of individuals who \nhave been harmed by the alleged negligence of gun dealers, gun \nmanufacturers, and gun trade associations to get their case before a \njudge, to ask 12 fellow Americans to decide: Was there a duty by that \ndefendant of more care, more attention, more foresight? Was that duty \nviolated? Was I injured as a result of that and, therefore, should I be \ncompensated by that person?\n  If we fail to adopt this amendment, we are sending a very strong \nmessage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. That message is, these people don't matter. The only thing \nthat matters is the gun lobby. That would be a terrible message to \nsend. I urge passage of the amendment and retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the \nsubstitute. This is a complete substitute for the bill. In effect, it \nguts the bill. It does exactly the opposite of what the bill is \nintended to do, and that is to stop abusive predatory lawsuits against \nlaw-abiding businesses for damages caused by the criminal misuse of \ntheir products by others.\n  Senator Reed mentioned some terrible situations regarding the \nWashington serial killer and said that those victims would not be able \nto sue the gun seller who was presumed to be negligent. In fact, that \ngun seller was found to have violated the laws that are required to be \nmet and his license was revoked. So I believe under our bill--and it \nwould be our opinion under our bill--that those people would be able to \nsue that gun seller. The other side has a legal opinion to the \ncontrary, but we disagree with that.\n  The bill says, what is not included in this bill is a lawsuit which \nis brought against a seller for negligent entrustment or negligence, \nper se. So I think you could have brought that lawsuit. In fact, those \nlawsuits were settled.\n  What we are talking about is a substitute that appears to bar \nlawsuits but, in fact, allows lawsuits by cities and counties against \nfirearms manufacturers and sellers if there is a State legislature \napproving the lawsuit or the State Attorney General brings the suit. So \neverything that we have been voting on would be reversed. If a State \nlegislature says: We are going to allow a city to sue, the city would \nbe able to sue.\n  We are here not to bar legitimate lawsuits. We are not here to bar \nlawsuits if a gun malfunctions. What we are trying to do is stop gun \nmanufacturers from having to answer lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit \nfor the criminal misuse of that product. If this amendment is passed, \nthe bill before us will be gutted and will be of no use. We are trying \nto stop frivolous lawsuits against law-abiding citizens and law-abiding \ngun manufacturers. It does not stop lawsuits for negligence of the gun \nitself or violations of the law by the gun seller.\n  I hope my colleagues will see through this substitute and stay with \nthe intent of the bill--to stop the frivolous lawsuits against the gun \nmanufacturer or the misuse of the product, not the defectiveness of the \nproduct itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. President, I rise to speak against this substitute \namendment that we are now considering. This is yet another attempt to \nundermine the very purpose of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct.\n  This amendment creates two loopholes so large that you could drive a \ntruck through them. It would allow lawsuits for lawfully making or \nselling nondefective guns as long as either the State legislature \napproves, or a State attorney general brings a lawsuit on behalf of a \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, some governmental entities are part of the problem \nhere. Cash-strapped cities and counties across the country bring these \njunk lawsuits in an attempt to snare money from gun makers and sellers \nfor their lawful activities. To suggest that State legislative approval \nwill serve as a sufficient check on this problem makes no sense. These \nlawsuits already have the tacit approval of their state legislatures. \nAnd we already know well that some State attorneys general are not \nabove pursuing political agendas. This would only encourage them to \nbring more of these types of suits.\n  So this amendment would not eliminate in any meaningful way the very \nlawsuits that the gun liability bill is designed to address. And \nfurthermore, it would not even apply to any pending cases. So lawsuits \nbrought against the gun industry by New York City and Washington, DC, \nto cite two examples,\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nwould go forward under this substitute amendment.\n  This bill is about the integrity of our legal system. It is about \nprotecting law-abiding small businesses from being overwhelmed by \njunk--yes, junk--lawsuits. And these are not just any small \nbusinesses--they also happen to be critical suppliers to our military. \nIn my book, this alone makes them worthy of our protection.\n  We have acted before when we needed to protect others who were \nbesieged or potentially besieged by unscrupulous trial lawyers. We did \nit for light aircraft manufacturers. We did it for food donors. We did \nit for medical implant manufacturers. We did it for charitable \nvolunteers. We did it for makers of anti-terrorism technology. And we \nneed to do it here.\n  We cannot continue to allow these lawsuits that turn traditional tort \nlaw on its head. We cannot continue to blame law-abiding citizens for \nthe acts of criminals. We cannot continue to witness the corruption of \nour legal system and do nothing.\n  This substitute would do nothing, or at least it would do nothing \ngood. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me take a very few minutes because I do \nwant to get on with the vote. First, the underlying legislation would \ndeny the attorney general of Texas the right to defend the people of \nTexas in court with a suit, I believe. Second, the legislature in Texas \ncould not authorize suits. They could under my amendment. But more \nimportantly, going back to the Washington sniper, none of the carve-\nouts, none of the caveats would reach that. I don't think it is a \nmatter of dispute. Negligent entrustment has been defined in the bill \nas supplying a qualified product by seller for use by another person \nwhere the seller knows or should know. There is no allegation that the \nseller knew that the young person came in and shoplifted the weapon. In \nfact, he could argue that there was no sale involved whatsoever. It was \nshoplifting. But that was negligence because I think we all agree that \ngun sellers have an obligation to keep their weapons under control.\n  With respect to negligence per se, that is an unexcused violation of \nsome enactment or administrative law. There are many States in the \ncountry that don't recognize that as a theory of tort recovery. Again, \nyou would have to show they violated the law, they violated an \nadministrative rule. In the case of Bushmaster, the situation is such \nthat I don't believe there is any relevant legislation that says that \nan owner has to do anything in a way that would give rise to this \nnegligence, per se.\n  My point is that the legislation before us would effectively carve \nout all these suits. That is entirely correct.\n  We are faced with a choice. This amendment does not allow these so-\ncalled political suits by municipalities, by political subdivisions, by \ngroups, but it should allow individuals who have been harmed to have \ntheir day in court.\n  I hope we can prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is the Senator ready to yield back the balance of his \ntime?\n  Mr. REED. Is the Senator ready?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be so inclined to with this simple statement. \nThere are 62 Senators who are cosponsors in a bipartisan way of the \nunderlying bill. The Reed substitute, as the Senator from Texas has \nsaid, simply guts it, changes the whole intent of the bill very \ndramatically. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Reed substitute.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. REED. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1642.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point, there are 10 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague for his closing \nremarks.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Craig for a very \ndeliberate and civil debate. I thank my staff, Steve Eichenauer.\n  The legislation before us is not about the facts. There is no crisis \nin litigation affecting the gun manufacturers. These are the litigation \ntrends of Smith & Wesson: In 2001, 32 cases by municipalities; 10 by \nproduct liability. It declined steadily, with four cases ending on \nappeal and two cases with respect to personal liability. That is not a \ngraph showing a crisis in litigation. The slope is going the wrong way. \nThere is no crisis. There is no threat to procurement of military \nweapons. That is also conjured up out of thin air.\n  This is not about legal principle. A fundamental legal principle in \nthis country is if you are wronged by the negligence of another, you \ncan go to court. This is not about legal principles. We have had talk \nabout intervening criminal activities taking away the negligence of \nanother. That is not what the statement of torts, which is the black \nletter law of the country, states. These exceptions in the bill have \nbeen carefully crafted to prevent lawsuits, not to enable appropriate \nlawsuits to go forward.\n  It is not a failure of State courts to act. They have been acting. \nThese cases have been going down under current State law. They are \nbeing handled by the States. It is about power, sheer naked power by \nthe National Rifle Association--the power to take us off the Defense \nbill, the power to take us from that bill which would consider the \nquality of life and the safety of our troops to go to this legislation, \nthe power to take us away from debate on stem cells which will save \npeople and help people, so we can protect people who deal in dangerous \nweapons. It is about power; it is not about principle.\n  But there is something else. If this legislation passes, what \nincentive will there be for a gun dealer or gun manufacturer to act \nreasonably? There is a rogues' gallery of gun dealers--Realco\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nGuns in Maryland, Southern Police Equipment in Richmond--all across the \ncountry--Atlantic Gun and Tackle in Bedford Heights, OH. Hundreds of \nguns are sold and are ending up at crime scenes. If they are this \nblatant and reckless now, what do they do when we say, ``Don't worry, \nno one can touch you''? It will create huge disincentives.\n  Finally, what we are doing today is silencing the voices of victims \nof gun violence, silencing people who have been wronged through the \nnegligence of another. This is not about trying gun manufacturers for \nsomeone else's fault, this is about their own responsibility.\n  Think tonight about what happened in Washington with the snipers. An \nFBI employee loading material at a Home Depot parking lot--shot. Some \nof that was attributed to the negligence of a gun dealer. That lady's \nhusband and family would be silenced. Think about the young boy walking \nto his school in Maryland--shot. His family would be silenced. Think \nabout the cabdriver filling up his cab. Tonight when we fill up our \ncars, think for a second, what if you were struck down, caught up in \nthat web of violence. What if your family knew part of that was the \nresult of the negligence of a gun dealer, a gun manufacturer. Who will \ntake care of your family? Who will take care of you if you are \nparalyzed? We are telling those good people, our constituents: You are \nnot worth it; the NRA is more important. You will suffer. If you don't \nhave the money, you will be on charity. That will take care of you.\n  This is wrong. It is wrong morally, it is wrongly legally. We should \nvote against this legislation. I passionately hope we do.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n  Contrary to the concept of individual responsibility--for the past \ndecade, the U.S. firearms industry has been under assault by legal \nactivists attempting to hold this industry somehow legally responsible \nfor the criminal conduct of others. Some of these suits are intended to \ndrive gunmakers out of business by holding manufacturers and dealers \nliable for the criminal acts of others. It has been reported to me that \nto date, the total cost for the firearms industry in defending \nthemselves from these suits exceeds $200 million.\n  Moreover, these lawsuits seek a broad range of remedies relating to \nproduct design and marketing. Their demands, if granted, would create \nmajor impediments on interstate commerce in firearms and ammunition, \nincluding unwanted design changes, overly burdensome sales policies, \nand higher costs for purchasers.\n  S. 397, which we are in the midst of debating, is desirable \nlegislation and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. This \nlegislation will help curb frivolous litigation against a lawful \nAmerican industry and the thousands of the men and women it employs. \nImagine if General Motors or an auto dealer were to be held liable for \nan accident caused by a reckless or drunk driver in one of their \nmanufactured vehicles or sue Budweiser. Likewise, businesses legally \nengaged in manufacturing or selling firearms should not be liable for \nthe harm caused by people who use that firearm in an unsafe or criminal \nmanner. This legislation does carefully preserve the right of \nindividuals to have their day in court with civil liability actions for \ninjury or danger caused by negligence on the firearms dealer or \nmanufacturer or defective product, a standard in product liability law.\n  Moreover, these frivolous lawsuits against honest, legal companies \nput our national security and our military at risk. Since the late \n1960's, the U.S. military has relied on private industry to supply our \nsoldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and our marines. In 2004-2005 alone, \nthe military has contracted to buy more than 200,000 rifles, sidearms \nand machine guns. And these numbers do not include new purchases for \nour Federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of \nHomeland Security. In addition, the Army fires about 2 billion rounds \nof ammunition each year. While the Army does manufacture a portion of \nthat ammunition, it purchases half of its ammunition from private \ncompanies.\n  The bottom line is, these frivolous lawsuits can shut down the very \nsame companies that are supplying our armed forces, our Federal law \nenforcement agencies, and our local and State police. Even the \nDepartment of Defense understands the implications that these lawsuits \nhave on the firearms. In a letter dated July 27, 2005, from the \nDepartment to my colleague, Senator Sessions, DoD states, ``We believe \nthat passage of S. 397 would help safeguard our national security by \nlimiting unnecessary lawsuits against an industry that plays a critical \nrole in meeting the procurement needs of our men and women in \nuniform.'' That is from the Department of Defense, not something \ncreated by the NRA or the proponents of this legislation.\n  This legislation enjoys broad support. In addition to the NRA, \nbusiness and insurance groups such as the National Association of \nManufacturers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of \nWholesaler-Distributors, National Federation of Independent Business, \nand the American Insurance Association all support S. 397. These \nlawsuits pose a threat to any business that makes or sells any lawful, \nnondefective product that can be misused by third parties.\n  National and local unions such as the United Auto Workers, \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and \nUnited Mine Workers support this bill because the firearms and \nammunition industry provides good jobs for working Americans.\n  National hunting and wildlife conservation groups support S. 397, \nbecause excise taxes on firearm and ammunition sales fund wildlife \nmanagement projects in the States. If these lawsuits wipe out the \nindustry, these funds will vanish.\n  This bill is not a gun control bill; we should save that debate for \nanother time. We should not saddle this lawsuit abuse legislation with \nanti-gun amendments that seek to infringe upon the Second Amendment \nrights of Virginians and Americans ability to protect themselves and \ntheir families. If Senators need to look to gun control, the best gun \ncontrol measures are to enforce existing gun laws, which do more to \nkeep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals than passing new and \nadditional burden on the sale of firearms to honest gun-owners. \nCriminals commit gun-related crimes and we should focus our attention \non these criminals rather than further restricting the rights of law-\nabiding citizens.\n  S. 397 will stop lawsuits that are designed not to recover damages \nfrom criminal or culpable parties, but which are designed to \nfinancially damage the industry or force regulatory changes that would \nrestrict their legal business and strangle second amendment rights \nacross the Nation. We have a responsibility to protect those rights and \nto stop the use of the courts to usurp legislative prerogatives.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to \noppose extraneous amendments that would weaken or delay it from \npassing. Please protect the rights of our constituents and the legal \nbusiness that is unjustly threatened by these reckless lawsuits; and \nlet us preserve the balance between the legislative and judicial \nbranches of government.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is part of the special interest \nagenda being pushed by the NRA and the Republican leader. First they \nmanaged to stall the reauthorization of the assault weapon bank, even \nthough the bill saved lives and kept out police officers safer. Now \nthey are looking to grant sweeping protections to gun manufacturers and \ndealers who recklessly sell guns that cause thousands of deaths in this \ncountry each year.\n  Contrary to what supporters of this bill are saying, this is not \n``tort reform'' and this will not, as the White House said, ``help curb \nthe growing problem of frivolous lawsuits.''\n  They call this bill the ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct.'' They give it a nice name to make it sound like they are \nprotecting trade. What if we called it the ``Shield Gun Makers From \nLawsuits When Their Defective Gun Blows Your Child's Arm Off Act?'' Or, \n``You're Off the Hook if You Sell Guns to Criminals and They Use Those \nGuns to Murder People Act?'' I guess those names just don't have the \nsame ring to them.\n  How about a little truth in advertising here--``Protect the Unlawful \nCommerce in Arms Act?'' I don't think so. Make no mistake, this bill is \nan\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\nerosion of victims' rights. This bill puts the gun industry ahead of \nthe rights of individuals. Ahead of the Dix family. These are real \npeople, real victims. The doors of the courthouse would have been shut \nto the family of Kenzo Dix, who ultimately settled with Beretta.\n  This case was brought by the parents of Kenzo, a 15-year-old boy who \nwas unintentionally shot and killed by a young friend with a \ndefectively designed gun. Kenzo's friend Michael thought that he had \nunloaded his father's gun when he replaced the loaded magazine with an \nempty one. But the design of the gun failed to reveal the hidden bullet \nin the chamber, and this bullet killed Kenzo.\n  Beretta could have easily designed the gun with inexpensive, well-\nknown features that would have prevented Kenzo's death. They could have \nincluded an internal lock to prevent Michael from firing the gun, or an \neffective loaded-chamber indicator to alert Michael that the gun was \nloaded. Although Beretta was long aware of the need for these features, \nit refused to include them.\n  Imported guns are subject to safety standards. But because domestic \nfirearms are currently exempt from Federal consumer product safety \noversight, the Consumer Product Safety Commission cannot compel \ngunmakers to include needed safety devices, as it routinely does with \nmanufacturers of other products.\n  So court cases like Dix v. Beretta are the only way we can ensure \ngunmakers do the right thing. It is the only way. We know that just 1 \npercent of the gun dealers supply 57 percent of the guns used in \ncrimes. None of us can ever forget the terror and horror wrought by the \nDC-area snipers. And no one here can forget the role that Bull's Eye \nShooter Supply of Tacoma, W.A, played in that terror. Bull's Eye says \nit ``lost'' the assault rifle used by the DC area snipers to murder 12 \npeople.\n  In just 3 years, Bull's Eye says it managed to ``lose'' 237 other \nguns as well. This is unbelievable. How did Bull's Eye ``lose'' all of \nthose weapons? Clearly, the victims of Bull's Eye's gross negligence \nshould have their day in court. In all it supplied guns traced to at \nleast 52 crimes.\n  But if the Senate caves to the gun lobby and passes this bill, \ndealers like Bull's Eye will be able to continue business as usual. \nThis bill eliminates any real incentives for the gun industry to act \nmore responsibly. This can only result in more victims in the future \nlike those killed by the DC area snipers.\n  This bill would bar cases including those brought by two New Jersey \npolice officers, David Lemongello and Ken McGuire. They won a \nsettlement from a pawn shop dealer who negligently sold twelve guns to \na straw purchaser.\n  How does a straw purchaser work? This is one way: A criminal wants to \nbuy several guns for his gang. He knows he can not buy it because he is \na felon. So he gets his girlfriend who does not have a criminal record \nto go to the sales counter with him, and she buys the guns for him. The \ngun dealer knows something is wrong here, this young woman wanting to \nbuy all these guns, but the dealer wants the money and goes ahead and \nsells the guns to the girl.\n  As a result of the police officers' suit, the West Virginia dealer \nchanged its policies and now no longer engages in large-volume gun \nsales. Two other dealers in the same town also changed their policies. \nSo the lawsuit brought about responsible behavior and our people are \nsafer.\n  I want my colleagues to consider the outcome of this lawsuit. For two \nbrave police officers, justice was done. The dealer was held \naccountable for its reckless sale to a straw purchaser, and now the \ndealer operates more responsibly. And no one declared bankruptcy.\n  This outcome was only possible because this special interest immunity \nbill had not yet become law.\n  Police and big city mayors oppose the bill before us. They say it \nwill just make battling illegal guns more difficult and make police \nofficers' lives more dangerous, more deadly. They oppose immunizing gun \nmanufacturers against civil liability because it would remove much of \ntheir legal incentive to behave responsibly. It would just encourage \nbad manufacturers to remain bad, while giving good manufacturers the \ngreen light to become lax.\n  In my home state of California, we used to have a law that shielded \ngunmakers from liability, but the governor signed legislation repealing \nthat law 2 years ago. Today in California, gun manufacturers like \neveryone else are responsible for making their products as safe as they \ncan be.\n  We are safer today in California, but that margin of safety will \ndisappear if Congress gives the gun industry special legal immunity.\n  In 1999, the late Senator John Chafee and I introduced the Firearms \nRights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act, which would have preserved \nthe right of local governments and individuals to hold the gun industry \naccountable for avoidable gun violence.\n  Congress not only failed to pass our bill; the House and now many of \nmy colleagues have charged off in the opposite direction to protect \ngunmakers while putting the rest of us at greater risk.\n  Who do we represent here? I ask my colleagues that we think about the \n30,000 Americans killed every year by guns, and 12,000 children wounded \neach year by guns.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the police officers walking the \nbeat, to Lynn Dix, the mother of Kenzo Dix, and to all the other \nmothers who have lost their children to gun violence, and to victims of \nthe DC snipers' rampage. Listen to them and vote against this extremist \nbill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have already registered my \ndisappointment at the majority leader's decision to cease work on an \nimportant defense authorization bill in order to move to the bill \nbefore us, S. 397. Today, I would like to speak about S. 397, the gun \nliability bill, and some of the amendments relating to firearms that \nhave been offered to it.\n  Listening to the debate on this bill, the American people might get \nthe impression that there are just two sides to this issue. On one side \nare those who view the right to bear arms as absolute and oppose any \nproposals that could remotely be considered as restrictions on that \nright. On the other side are those who view gun use as an evil in our \nsociety that must be limited in any way possible. Sometimes the \nrhetoric gets turned up so high that reasoned analysis and debate is \nobscured. That is unfortunate.\n  I have never accepted the proposition that the gun debate is a black \nand white issue, a matter of ``you're with us, or you're against us.'' \nInstead, I have followed what I believe is a moderate course, faithful \nto the Constitution and to the realities of modern society. I believe \nthat the second amendment was not an afterthought, that it has meaning \ntoday and must be respected. I support the right to bear arms for \nlawful purposes--for hunting and sport and for self-protection. \nMillions of Americans own firearms legally and we should not take \naction that tells them that they are second-class citizens or that \ntheir constitutional rights are under attack. At the same time, there \nare actions we can and should take to protect public safety that do not \ninfringe on constitutional rights. I supported the amendment offered by \nthe senior Senator from Wisconsin regarding child safety locks and was \npleased that the Senate approved this measure, which does not infringe \non the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use guns.\n  I do not believe that granting special liability protection to the \ngun industry is necessary to protect the right to bear arms, however. \nThere is no evidence that liability lawsuits threaten the existence of \nthe gun industry in America. I believe it would be a mistake to impose \na nationwide standard of tort liability on this industry that is more \nlenient than the standard that applies to the manufacturers or \nsuppliers of any other product. The gun industry, like other \nindustries, owes a duty to consumers of reasonable care, and juries of \ncitizens are best able to define that standard as they do in tort cases \nof every imaginable type every day in this country.\n  Giving sweeping liability protection will cut off the rights of those \ninjured by negligence and set a very dangerous precedent for how \nCongress treats corporate wrongdoers. I will, therefore, vote against \nS. 397.\n  I realize that many have very strong feelings about gun issues. But I \nalso believe that most Americans favor a\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\nmoderate approach. That is the approach I intend to follow. My approach \nmay not satisfy those on the extremes of this debate, but I believe it \nreflects the commonsense views of reasonable Americans who regret that \nthis issue has become the subject of such overheated rhetoric.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the misnamed Protection of Lawful Commerce \nin Arms Act would rewrite well-accepted principles of liability law, \nproviding one industry, the gun industry, legal protections not enjoyed \nby other industries. In addition, this bill would set a dangerous \nprecedent by giving a single industry broad immunity from civil \nliability and deprive many victims of gun violence with legitimate \ncases of their day in court.\n  Law enforcement and community groups oppose the gun industry immunity \nbill because they understand its negative impact on the legal rights of \ngun violence victims. The list of law enforcement groups opposing this \nbill includes the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, the National Black Police Association, \nand the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police as well as police \ndepartments from around the country. The bill is also opposed by many \norganizations in Michigan including the League of Women Voters of \nMichigan, the Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, and local \nchapters of the Million Mom March.\n  Tort law has been traditionally left to the States to define, and if \nchanges have been necessary, Congress has usually deferred to State \nlegislatures to make those changes. This bill seeks to impose a Federal \ntort regime that would significantly restrict the ability of State \ncourts to hear and decide cases involving grossly negligent or reckless \nconduct by gun dealers and manufacturers, even where existing State law \nwould permit such cases.\n  Some have argued that this legislation would protect the gun industry \nfrom frivolous lawsuits meant to bankrupt the entire industry. While \nmost gun dealers and manufacturers conduct their business responsibly, \nthis gun industry immunity legislation would provide broad protection \nfrom liability even in these cases where gross negligence or \nrecklessness lead to someone being injured or killed. The issue here is \nnot whether innocent manufacturers or gun dealers should be held \naccountable for the criminal actions of those who use their product. \nManufacturers and dealers of guns have a right to make and sell guns. \nHowever, that right is not unlimited. It comes with some \nresponsibility. Like every other business in this country, people who \nare in the gun business have a responsibility to conduct that business \nwith reasonable care. If a member of the gun industry fails to do so, \nand their negligence or recklessness leads to someone being killed or \ninjured, they should not be immune from suit.\n  As this bill is currently written, it is not sufficient that persons \ninjured as a result of a gun manufacturer or dealer's negligence or \nreckless conduct prove their case; with a few exceptions, they would \nalso have to show that the actions of the manufacturer or dealer were \nillegal to recover damages. This is a radical departure from not only \ncommon law but also from principles of fairness and the protection of \nvictims' rights.\n  What if a gun dealer is not violating the law, but is reckless or \ngrossly negligent in the way they maintain their inventory or secure \nthe weapons they are selling? Tragically, we had such a situation in \nthe 2002 DC area sniper shootings. Last year, the victims of the DC \narea sniper shootings won a multimillion-dollar settlement from Bulls \nEye Shooter Supply for their negligence relative to the assault rifle \nused in the shootings. According to published reports, audits by the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives indicate that 238 \nguns had gone missing from Bull's Eye's inventory and over 50 had been \ntraced to criminal acts since 1997. Had this gun industry immunity bill \nbeen enacted prior to the DC area sniper shootings, the victims would \nhave been unable to even have their case against Bull's Eye Shooter \nSupply heard in court.\n  Another tragic example involving an innocent victim of gun violence \nis that of Danny Guzman. On Christmas Eve 1999, Danny Guzman was shot \nand killed in Worcester, MA. The gun used in the shooting was found \nnearly a week later by a 4-year-old child and was turned over to \npolice. The gun had no serial number.\n  The investigation following the shooting revealed the gun was one of \nseveral stolen by employees of Kahr Arms. It was discovered that one of \nthe employees in the Kahr manufacturing facility had stolen the gun \nused to kill Danny Guzman and sold it to buy crack cocaine. Publicly \navailable records indicate this employee of the Kahr facility had been \naddicted to cocaine and was ``habitually stealing money to support his \ncocaine habit.''\n  In March of 2000, the police arrested the Kahr employee who later \npled guilty to the gun thefts. The investigation also led to the arrest \nof a second Kahr employee who also pled guilty to stealing a gun.\n  According to a complaint that was filed by Danny Guzman's family, \nKahr Arms not only apparently hired a drug addict with a record of \ncriminal charges, but the company also chose not to utilize basic \nsecurity measures that could have prevented the theft, or an inventory \ntracking system that could have determined that guns were missing. \nAccording to the family's complaint, Kahr Arms did not conduct \nbackground checks on employees. The company did not install metal \ndetectors, security cameras, x-ray machines, or other devices to ensure \nthat employees did not walk off with guns.\n  Despite the fact that Kahr Arms manufactures several types of ``ultra \ncompact'' handguns, the company did not track its inventory in any \nmeaningful way. And according to the complaint, from February 1998 to \nFebruary 1999, approximately 16 shipments of handguns from Kahr Arms \nfailed to arrive at their points of destination.\n  The lawsuit that was filed by Danny Guzman's surviving family members \nalleges the wrongful death based on Kahr Arms alleged negligence. While \nthe defendants moved to dismiss this case on April 7, 2003, the \nMassachusetts Superior Court denied the motions. If the bill before us \nis enacted, the court would be required to dismiss the case against \nKahr Arms.\n  Responsible gun dealers and manufacturers do not need immunity from \nliability, and we should not be protecting the reckless and negligent \nones.\n  A letter to members of Congress from 75 law professors from \nuniversities around the country illustrates the extensive negative \nimpact that this bill would have on the rights of innocent gun violence \nvictims. Here's a few excerpts:\n\n       It might appear from the face of the bill that S. 397 and \n     H.R. 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability \n     for truly egregious misconduct, by virtue of several \n     exceptions set forth in Section 4(5)(i). Those exceptions, \n     however, are in fact quite narrow, and would give those in \n     the firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks \n     of foreseeable third party misconduct.\n\n  One exception, for example would purport to permit certain actions \nfor ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on, however, to define \n``negligent entrustment'' extremely narrowly. The exception applies \nonly to sellers, for example, and would not apply to distributors or \nmanufacturers, no matter how egregious their conduct. Even as to \nsellers, the exception would apply only where the particular person to \nwhom a seller supplies a firearm is one whom the seller knows or ought \nto know will use it to cause harm. The ``negligent entrustment'' \nexception would, therefore, not permit any action based on reckless \ndistribution practices, negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply \ncriminals, as in the above example, careless handling of firearms, lack \nof security, or any of a myriad potentially negligent acts.\n\n  Another exception would leave open the possibility of liability for \ncertain statutory violations, variously defined, including those \ndescribed under the heading of negligence per se. Statutory violations, \nhowever, represent just a narrow special case of negligence liability. \nNo jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to every \ndetail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there is no need. Why \nis there no need? Because general principles of tort law make clear \nthat the mere absence of a specific statutory prohibition is not carte \nblanche for unreasonable or dangerous behavior. S. 397 and H.R. 800 \nwould turn this traditional framework on its head and free those in the \nfirearms industry to behave as\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\ncarelessly as they would like, so long as the conduct has not been \nspecifically prohibited. If there is no statute against leaving an open \ntruckload of assault rifles on a street corner, or against selling \nhundreds of guns to the same individual, under this bill there could be \nno tort liability.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I offered an amendment to help address this problem in the bill. Many \nrecklessness and gross negligence suits are not based on a violation of \nthe law, but on a violation of a standard. My amendment would have \nprovided that reckless or grossly negligent conduct by gun dealers or \nmanufacturers, in other words, those whose own actions are a proximate \ncause of someone's death or injury, may be held liable in civil court \nfor the damages they caused. This approach would have preserved well-\nestablished principles of our tort law. No one proposes, and this \namendment did not propose, to make members of the gun industry \nresponsible for the actions of criminals. This amendment would have \nmade sure members of the gun industry are still responsible for their \nown reckless or negligent conduct.\n  It is truly unfortunate that the majority in the Senate did not adopt \nmy amendment to protect the rights of victims of gun violence and to \nhold members of the gun industry accountable for their own actions when \nthey lead to the injury or death of another person. I am also \ndisappointed that the Senate failed to adopt amendments that would have \nprotected the rights of children and law enforcement officers to file \nsuit against irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers who continue \nto contribute to the gun violence problem in our country.\n  We should not infringe upon the rights of gun violence victims in \norder to provide a single industry with immunity from liability. If \nthis bill is enacted, other industries will almost certainly line up \nfor similar protections. This is unwise legislation and it should not \nbe adopted.\n                                        The University of Michigan\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                              Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: As a professor of law at \n     the University of Michigan Law School, I write to alert you \n     to the legal implications of S. 397 and H.R. 800, the \n     ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.'' My colleagues, \n     who join me in signing this letter, are professors at law \n     schools around the country. This bill would represent a \n     substantial and radical departure from traditional principles \n     of American tort law. Though described as an effort to limit \n     the unwarranted expansion of tort liability, the bill would \n     in fact represent a dramatic narrowing of traditional tort \n     principles by providing one industry with a literally \n     unprecedented immunity from liability for the foreseeable \n     consequences of negligent conduct.\n       S. 397 and H.R. 800, described as ``a bill to prohibit \n     civil liability actions from being brought or continued \n     against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages resulting from the misuse \n     of their products by others,'' would largely immunize those \n     in the firearms industry from liability for negligence. This \n     would represent a sharp break with traditional principles of \n     tort liability. No other industry enjoys or has ever enjoyed \n     such a blanket freedom from responsibility for the \n     foreseeable and preventable consequences of negligent \n     conduct.\n       It might be suggested that the bill would merely preclude \n     what traditional tort law ought to be understood to preclude \n     in any event--lawsuits for damages resulting from third party \n     misconduct, and in particular from the criminal misuse of \n     firearms. This argument, however, rests on a fundamental \n     misunderstanding of American tort law. American law has never \n     embraced a rule freeing defendants from liability for the \n     foreseeable consequences of their negligence merely because \n     those consequences may include the criminal conduct of third \n     parties. Numerous cases from every American jurisdiction \n     could be cited here, but let the Restatement (Second) of \n     Torts suffice:\n\n\n  Sec. 449. tortious or criminal acts the probability of which makes \n                       actor's conduct negligent\n\n       If the likelihood that a third person may act in a \n     particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which \n     makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, \n     negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not \n     prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby. \n     (emphasis supplied)\n       Similarly, actors may be liable if their negligence enables \n     or facilitates foreseeable third party criminal conduct.\n       Thus, car dealers who negligently leave vehicles \n     unattended, railroads who negligently manage trains, hotel \n     operators who negligently fail to secure rooms, and \n     contractors who negligently leave dangerous equipment \n     unguarded are all potentially liable if their conduct creates \n     an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of third party \n     misconduct, including illegal behavior, leading to harm. In \n     keeping with these principles, cases have found that sellers \n     of firearms and other products (whether manufacturers, \n     distributors or dealers) may be liable for negligently \n     supplying customers or downstream sellers whose negligence, \n     in turn, results in injuries caused by third party criminal \n     or negligent conduct. In other words, if the very reason \n     one's conduct is negligent is because it creates a \n     foreseeable risk of illegal third party conduct, that illegal \n     conduct does not sever the causal connection between the \n     negligence and the consequent harm. Of course, defendants are \n     not automatically liable for illegal third party conduct, but \n     are liable only if--given the foreseeable risk and the \n     available precautions--they were unreasonable (negligent) in \n     failing to guard against the danger. In most cases, moreover, \n     the third party wrongdoer will also be liable. But, again, \n     the bottom line is that under traditional tort principles a \n     failure to take reasonable precautions against foreseeable \n     dangerous illegal conduct by others is treated no differently \n     from a failure to guard against any other risk.\n       S. 397 and H.R. 800 would abrogate this firmly established \n     principle of tort law. Under this bill, the firearms industry \n     would be the one and only business in which actors would be \n     free utterly to disregard the risk, no matter how high or \n     foreseeable, that their conduct might be creating or \n     exacerbating a potentially preventable risk of third party \n     misconduct. Gun and ammunition makers, distributors, \n     importers, and sellers would, unlike any other business or \n     individual, be free to take no precautions against even the \n     most foreseeable and easily preventable harms resulting from \n     the illegal actions of third parties. And they could engage \n     in this negligent conduct persistently, even with the \n     specific intent of profiting from sales of guns that are \n     foreseeably headed to criminal hands. Under this bill, a \n     firearms dealer, distributor, or manufacturer could park an \n     unguarded open pickup truck full of loaded assault rifles on \n     a city street corner, leave it there for a week, and yet be \n     free from any negligence liability if and when the guns were \n     stolen and used to do harm. A firearms dealer, in most \n     states, could sell 100 guns to the same individual every day, \n     even after the dealer is informed that these guns are being \n     used in crime--even, say, by the same violent street gang.\n       It might appear from the face of the bill that S. 397 and \n     H.R. 800 would leave open the possibility of tort liability \n     for truly egregious misconduct, by virtue of several \n     exceptions set forth in Section 4(5)(i). Those exceptions, \n     however, are in fact quite narrow, and would give those in \n     the firearm industry little incentive to attend to the risks \n     of foreseeable third party misconduct.\n       One exception, for example would purport to permit certain \n     actions for ``negligent entrustment.'' The bill goes on, \n     however, to define ``negligent entrustment'' extremely \n     narrowly. The exception applies only to sellers, for example, \n     and would not apply to distributors or manufacturers, no \n     matter how egregious their conduct. Even as to sellers, the \n     exception would apply only where the particular person to \n     whom a seller supplies a firearm is one whom the seller knows \n     or ought to know will use it to cause harm. The ``negligent \n     entrustment'' exception would, therefore, not permit any \n     action based on reckless distribution practices, negligent \n     sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals (as in the \n     above example), careless handling of firearms, lack of \n     security, or any of a myriad potentially negligent acts.\n       Another exception would leave open the possibility of \n     liability for certain statutory violations, variously \n     defined, including those described under the heading of \n     negligence per se. Statutory violations, however, represent \n     just a narrow special case of negligence liability. No \n     jurisdiction attempts to legislate standards of care as to \n     every detail of life, even in a regulated industry; and there \n     is no need. Why is there no need? Because general principles \n     of tort law make clear that the mere absence of a specific \n     statutory prohibition is not carte blanche for unreasonable \n     or dangerous behavior. S. 397 and H.R. 800 would turn this \n     traditional framework on its head; and free those in the \n     firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like, \n     so long as the conduct has not been specifically prohibited. \n     If there is no statute against leaving an open truckload of \n     assault rifles on a street corner, or against selling 100s of \n     guns to the same individual, under this bill there could be \n     no tort liability. Again, this represents radical departure \n     from traditional tort principles.\n       My aim here is simply to provide information, and insure \n     that you are not inadvertently misled about the meaning and \n     scope of S. 397 and H.R. 800. As currently drafted, this Bill \n     would not simply protect against the expansion of tort \n     liability, as has been suggested, but would in fact \n     dramatically limit the application of longstanding and \n     otherwise universally applicable tort principles. It provides \n     to firearms makers and distributors a literally unprecedented \n     form of tort immunity not enjoyed or even dreamed-of by any \n     other industry.\n         Professor Sherman J.

Mr. President, as the sponsor of this legislation, I rise \nto clear up any questions that might arise when tying to understand the \nintent of S. 397 and what its enactment would accomplish. The \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will eliminate predatory \nlawsuits that would otherwise cripple an entire industry.\n  First, let me make two points about what the bill will not do. \nNothing in the bill is intended to allow ``leap-frogging'' over the gun \ndealer to the manufacturer. The negligent entrustment provision applies \nspecifically to the situation where a dealer knows or reasonably should \nknow that a dangerous person is purchasing a firearm with the intent to \ncommit, and does commit a crime with that firearm. When the \nmanufacturer has done nothing but sell a legal, nondefective product \naccording to the law, the negligent entrustment provision would not \nallow bypass of the gun dealer to get to the deeper pockets of the \nmanufacturer.\n  It is also important to make sure that it is clear that the \n``administrative proceedings'' section will have no effect on the \nability of the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms or any \nadministrative agency to revoke licenses or otherwise engage in \nadministrative proceedings to punish bad acting manufacturers, \ndistributors, or dealers, or otherwise enforce the laws and regulations \nthat apply to them.\n  The bill's definition section describes abusive suits in which a \nparty is seeking relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse \nof a qualified product by the person or a third party.'' This \ndefinition clearly does not describe ATF enforcement proceedings. ATF \nis authorized to begin enforcement proceedings when a violation of our \nNation's Federal gun laws has occurred. The use or misuse of the \nproduct is irrelevant to whether ATF may begin an administrative \nproceeding.\n  In fact, ATF does not use administrative enforcement proceedings to \nseek ``relief'' for the ``misuse'' of a product. The law does not \nrequire there be a ``use''--let alone a ``misuse'' of the product--in \norder for ATF to act. ATF can begin a license revocation proceeding \nagainst a dealer for even a single violation of Federal firearms laws, \nregardless of whether the gun is ever ``used'' or ``misused'' by \nanyone. ATF can begin proceedings based on recordkeeping violations, \nfor instance, even if no firearm ever leaves the dealer's place of \nbusiness.\n  Some have tried to suggest that a dealer selling a gun without doing \nthe proper paperwork or meeting other legal requirements might count as \n``misuse.'' This stretches the term ``use'' beyond all rational \nmeaning, and I believe the courts of our Nation would agree. For \ninstance, the Supreme Court has held that firearms ``use'' in a violent \nor drug-trafficking crime requires ``active employment.'' Bailey v. \nU.S., 516 U.S. 137 (1995). If there is no ``use'' of the gun--only a \nsale--then there can be no ``misuse.''\n  But even if we were to consider an illegal sale to be ``misuse,'' we \nmust look at the last part of the definition: A ``qualified civil \nliability action'' involves the ``criminal or unlawful misuse of a \nqualified product by the person or a third party.'' If we were talking \nabout an ATF action, then ``the person'' would be ATF itself. \nObviously, that is not what ATF claims in an administrative proceeding. \nSo we could only be speaking of a misuse by ``a third party''--and in \nan enforcement proceeding, neither the dealer nor the ATF is a ``third \nparty.''\n  For all of these reasons, I think it is very clear that the language \nin this bill about ``administrative proceedings'' should in no way \nprevent any action by ATF to enforce the firearms laws of the United \nStates. It is only intended to prevent--and, I believe, only does \nprevent--abuse of the courts and of various administrative processes \nthat could be manipulated unfairly at the State or local level. \nFurthermore, it is worth noting that since the term ``administrative \npreceeding'' is part of the definition of a ``qualified civil action,'' \nthen all of the exemptions of the bill permitting an action to proceed \nwould\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nequally apply to an administrative proceeding.\n  However, to make this intent absolutely clear, Senator Frist and I \nhave offered an amendment to the exemptions section of the bill that \nwould add ``an action or proceeding commenced by the Attorney General \nto enforce the provisions of chapter 44 of title 18, United States \nCode, or chapter 53 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.'' The \nsections of the US Code I just referenced are also known as the Gun \nControl Act and the National Firearms Act. Again, this would underscore \nwhat is the plain intent of the bill--to allow enforcement of our \nNation's firearms laws through administrative proceedings.\n  Second, I want to give some examples of exactly the type of predatory \nlawsuits this bill will eliminate. I think it is important that we all \nunderstand the current abuse of the legal system to implement radical \npolicies that could not be accomplished through the democratic process \nand understand that after passing S. 397, we will finally put an end to \nthat abuse.\n  One key element of the legislation is to provide for the dismissal of \npending litigation. Dismissals should be immediate--not after trial. \nCourts should dismiss on their own motion, instead of forcing \ndefendants to incur the additional costs and delay of filing motions \nand arguing. Let me emphasize that S. 397 recognizes these lawsuits are \nan abuse of courts and law-abiding businesses and individuals, and I \nwould respectfully submit that it should be the goal of our Nation's \ncourts to eliminate those abuses as swiftly as possible, when enactment \nof S. 397 gives them the authority to do so.\n  In City of New York v. Beretta USA Corp. et al. currently set for \ntrial on September 7 in Federal court in Brooklyn, NY, the plaintiff \nhas asserted that industry members have created a ``public nuisance.'' \nThe lawful sale of a highly regulated product later misused by \ncriminals is not a public nuisance;and has never been considered a \npublic nuisance in American jurisprudence.\n  Another suit expected to be affected by S. 397 is the District of \nColumbia and nine individual plaintiffs, Lawson, et al. that have sued \nmembers of the firearms industry, under a statute that unbelievably \nimposes automatic and absolute liability. The law in question says you \nare liable ``without regard to fault or proof of defect.'' There is \nalso a case pending in Federal court in the District of Columbia in \nwhich a gun manufacturer is being sued under this very statute, Charlot \nv. Bushmaster. The companies being sued under the District \n``automatic'' liability law have no defense.\n\n  Another example of a lawsuit captured by this bill is the case of \nIleto v. Glock, pending in Federal court in Los Angeles, CA, against \nGlock and a distributor, RSR. The United States Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals said Glock and RSR could be sued for a criminal shooting when \nGlock sold the pistol to a Washington State police department and the \ndistributor RSR never owned, nor sold, nor possessed the firearm.\n  Yet another example are the suits pending against members of the \nfirearms industry by cities like Gary, IN and Cleveland, OH even though \nthe States of Indiana and Ohio have themselves passed State laws \nsimilar in purpose and intent to S. 397.\n  In the past few days, lawyers from anti-gun interest groups have \nrushed to the courthouse to file at least three lawsuits, one in New \nYork and two in Pennsylvania against manufacturers Sturm Ruger, Phoenix \nArms, and Hi-Point, and I suspect there will be more suits filed in the \ndays and weeks ahead. While we do not know all the facts yet, in one of \nthese cases we do know that the sale by the dealer was of a single \nfirearm made by an employee of that dealer who was an off-duty federal \nlaw enforcement agent and the firearm in that case was only transferred \nto the buyer after he or she filled out the required paperwork and \nafter the background check by the FBI, as required under the Brady Act.\n  Congress is properly acting here under its Commerce Clause powers, as \nwe have done many times in the past. We are also rightly concerned, as \nis the Department of Defense, that if these lawsuits succeed in driving \ngun manufacturers out of business, the national defense will be harmed. \nThe same is true for our homeland security, as these same companies \nmake the firearms used by law enforcement, including the Capitol \nPolice, of which my distinguished colleague, the Democratic Leader Mr. \nReid was once a proud member.\n  The Constitution also, I believe, imposes upon Congress the duty to \nprotect the liberties enshrined in the Bill of Rights which includes \nthe second amendment. If the firearms manufacturers are driven out of \nbusiness, that second amendment will be nothing more than an illusion.\n  Mr. President, I hope these comments will be helpful for anyone \nseeking additional information about the intent and--I believe--the \nimpact of enacting S. 397, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share my views on the \nlegislation before the Senate, S. 397, the gun liability bill.\n  From the outset, let me make clear: I am a strong supporter of \nmeasured, balanced, and fair tort reform. In my over 27 years in the \nSenate, I have consistently supported measures to reform our legal \nsystem when such measures benefit the American people as a whole, \nbenefit our Nation's economy, and still remain fair to legitimate \nvictims who have been wrongfully injured due to the wrongful actions of \nanother.\n  Without a doubt, the gun , liability bill tries to address a very \nreal problem in America. There is no question that the gun industry in \nthis country is under legal siege from frivolous lawsuits. These \nlawsuits threaten the very vitality of the gun industry in America and, \nby extension, the ability of those of us who enjoy hunting, sport \nshooting, and the collecting of vintage guns, as I have done nearly all \nof my life. In my view, there is no question that law abiding gun \nmanufacturers and law-abiding gun dealers deserve some measure of fair, \nbalanced legal reform.\n  But equally true is that the gun liability bill before us today is an \noverly broad solution to a serious problem because it will immunize \nfrom legitimate lawsuits for negligence those very few, I repeat, very \nfew irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers in the industry whose \nactions, again and again, contribute to violent crime in this country.\n  This wide grant of immunity undoubtedly comes with unintended \nconsequences.\n  For example, we know that under this bill, if it were law at the \ntime, the victims of the DC area sniper shootings would have been \nunable to pursue their claim against an unbelievably negligent gun \ndealer who allowed the snipers to steal the weapon they used to kill so \nmany innocent victims. This wasn't the first time this dealer had been \nnegligent in accounting for its gun inventory. Indeed, it had \npreviously lost over 200 weapons over a short period of time. This \ndealer had a track record of again and again losing firearms. That is \nwhy they were sued, and that is why the dealer ultimately settled the \nsniper victim's lawsuit for $2.5 million. The gun liability bill, \nthough, would have rewarded this dealer's bad behavior by granting it \nimmunity for these egregious acts.\n  I offered an amendment to correct this flaw. My amendment would have \nensured that the 99 percent of law-abiding gun dealers in America would \nbe protected from frivolous lawsuits, but ensured that those very few \nirresponsible gun dealers were not rewarded with immunity for their bad \nbehavior. Unfortunately, procedural maneuvers made by others in \naccordance with Senate rules prevented me from obtaining an up-or-down \nvote on my germane amendment. So these defects in the bill remain \nuncorrected.\n  Over the course of the past week, these issues, both the pros and \ncons of this bill, have been extensively debated here in the Senate. \nThe issues are clear. On the one hand, the need for tort reform for the \ngun industry is very real. On the other hand, I believe this is an \noverly broad measure that will likely treat some future victims of gun \ncrimes unfairly.\n  These factors are not easy to weigh.\n  But as I went through the process of examining this legislation and \nlistening to the debate, one particular point seemed to always stick \nout above all others. And that is the preeminent importance of \nAmerica's national security.\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\n  As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I recently \nrequested that the Department of Defense review this legislation. In \nits reply, the Department's Office of General Counsel stated that the \nDepartment supports this gun liability legislation because it ``would \nhelp safeguard our national security by limiting unnecessary lawsuits \nagainst an industry that plays a critical role in meeting the \nprocurement needs of our men and women in uniform.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent to include a copy of this letter in the Record.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Indeed, the gun industry does play a crucial role in \nhelping to equip the men and women of our Armed Forces. Companies like \nBeretta U.S.A., Colt Manufacturing, and others supply a host of weapons \nand small arms that are vital to our military.\n  This fact is significant because the truth of the matter is that, for \na variety of complex reasons, America's military is increasingly being \nforced to turn to foreign sources for new technology. We simply cannot \nafford to lose more and more technical expertise if we want to ensure \nthat our men and women in uniform will always have the best equipment \nand the best technology in the world. Our national security is \ndependent on having home-grown talent and expertise, and this \nlegislation will help ensure that we do.\n  Ultimately, it is for these reasons that I have decided to cast my \nvote in support of this legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are pleased to provide you with the \n     Department of Defense's view on S. 397, a bill to ``prohibit \n     civil liability actions from being brought or continued \n     against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of \n     firearms or ammunition for damages, injunctive or other \n     relief resulting from the misuse of their products by \n     others.''\n       The Department of Defense strongly supports this \n     legislation.\n       We believe that passage of S. 397 would help safeguard our \n     national security by limiting unnecessary lawsuits against an \n     industry that plays a critical role in meeting the \n     procurement needs of our men and women in uniform.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this letter for the \n     consideration of the committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel J. Dell'Orto,\n                                                           Acting.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last year, we promised the cosponsors of \nthis legislation that we would return to this issue and seek a fair \nopportunity to consider a bill free of any poison pill amendments.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Frist and the cooperation of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, that day has come.\n  This bill will end an outrageous abuse of our courts and law-abiding \nAmerican businesses.\n  This bill will not prevent a single victim from obtaining relief for \nwrongs done to them by anyone in the gun industry.\n  S. 397 will only stop one narrowly-drawn kind of lawsuit: predatory \nlawsuits seeking to hold legitimate, law-abiding businesses responsible \nfor harm done by the misdeeds of people over whom they had no control.\n  We called this bill the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms. That \nis precisely what it is designed to do--to protect lawful commerce in \nthe firearms that supply our nation's military and peace officers, and \nthe millions of law-abiding citizens who acquire guns as collectors, \nhunters, target shooters, or for self-defense.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will shortly be voting on this \nlegislation, but before we do, let me express my thanks to a number of \npeople who made this possible.\n  I would like to thank the 61 cosponsors of this legislation for their \nsupport and encouragement--and the colleagues who counseled with me on \nshaping the debate and who spoke on the floor, especially Senators \nSessions, Cornyn, Graham, Kyl, Coburn, Burr, Thune, Chambliss, \nHutchison, Hatch, Bond, and, of course, the lead Democrat sponsor of \nthis legislation, Senator Baucus.\n  As I have said, special thanks to the Republican majority leader and \nwhip for their leadership and the resources of their offices, including \nthe help of their talented staff, in particular, Eric Ueland and Sharon \nSoderstrom, and Jim Hippe; Kyle Simmons, John Abegg, Laura Pemberton, \nBrian Lewis and Malloy McDaniel.\n  I would also like to thank the Democrat leader, Senator Reid, for his \nconstructive input in moving us to the end of this debate.\n  I am especially grateful to have had the help of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and in particular Brett Tolman of Chairman Specter's staff, \nand James Suehr.\n  Let me also thank the staff who spent many early and late hours \nworking on this legislation and the debate: William Henderson, William \nSmith, Mary Chesser, Bob Taylor, Don Dempsey and Andy Moskowitz, James \nGalyean, Chip Roy, Ajit Pai, and Wendy Fleming. I want you all to know \nyou were all part of an historic effort, and your hard work is \nappreciated.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the distinguished gentleman from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed, for his courtesy as we worked together to manage \na difficult debate. Although we disagree on the issue, he has never \nbeen disagreeable, and I appreciate the tone he brought to the debate.\n  And now, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last year, I promised the cosponsors of \nthis important legislation that we would return with a fair opportunity \nto work our will against the wrong kind of amendments and attempt to \nestablish a clear record on what I think is a very important decision \nthat the Senate is about to make.\n  I offer a very special thanks to Senator Frist for his cooperation \nand all of my colleagues who have helped bring this bill to the Senate \nfloor in the method we have and the success we have had.\n  This bill is intended to do one thing, and that is to end the abuse \nthat is now going on in the court system of America against law-abiding \nAmerican businesses when they violate no law. But because the product \nthey sell in the marketplace may ultimately be misused in a criminal \nact, therefore someone, including some of my colleagues, would suggest \nthat law-abiding business person is liable. I suggest and I think the \nSenate tonight will say they ought not be. But if that law-abiding \ncitizen violates the law or produces a faulty product, then they are \nliable. That is the law today.\n  What we have crafted is a very narrow exemption from predatory \nlawsuits seeking to hold legitimate, law-abiding people responsible for \nthe harm done by the misdeeds of people over whom they have no control. \nThat is what S. 397 is all about. You can put all kinds of different \nexplanations around it, but the reality is very clear and the \nlegislation is really very simple. It is straightforward. It is \nintended to be. It is intended to stop those kinds of abusive lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, I think we have concluded. If my colleague does not \nhave anything more to say, my colleague and I yield back the remainder \nof our time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1606, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Frist amendment No. 1606, as modified, to \namendment No. 1605, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1606), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1605, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Criag amendment No. 1605, as modified, as \namended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1606), as modified, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protection of Lawful \n     Commerce in Arms Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n       (2) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \n     protects the rights of individuals, including those who are \n     not members of a militia or engaged in military service or \n     training, to keep and bear arms.\n       (3) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms that operate \n     as designed and intended, which seek money damages and other \n     relief for the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \n     parties, including criminals.\n       (4) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n     of firearms and ammunition in the United States are heavily \n     regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal \n     laws include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National \n     Firearms Act, and the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (5) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n     interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n     manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to \n     the public of firearms or ammunition products that have been \n     shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are \n     not, and should not, be liable for the harm caused by those \n     who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or \n     ammunition products that function as designed and intended.\n       (6) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n     industry for harm that is solely caused by others is an abuse \n     of the legal system, erodes public confidence in our Nation's \n     laws, threatens the diminution of a basic constitutional \n     right and civil liberty, invites the disassembly and \n     destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n     lawfully competing in the free enterprise system of the \n     United States, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \n     interstate and foreign commerce of the United States.\n       (7) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, and private \n     interest groups and others are based on theories without \n     foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and \n     jurisprudence of the United States and do not represent a \n     bona fide expansion of the common law. The possible \n     sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer or \n     petit jury would expand civil liability in a manner never \n     contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, by Congress, \n     or by the legislatures of the several States. Such an \n     expansion of liability would constitute a deprivation of the \n     rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to a citizen of \n     the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (8) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by the \n     Federal Government, States, municipalities, private interest \n     groups and others attempt to use the judicial branch to \n     circumvent the Legislative branch of government to regulate \n     interstate and foreign commerce through judgments and \n     judicial decrees thereby threatening the Separation of Powers \n     doctrine and weakening and undermining important principles \n     of federalism, State sovereignty and comity between the \n     sister States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n     distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \n     ammunition products, and their trade associations, for the \n     harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of \n     firearm products or ammunition products by others when the \n     product functioned as designed and intended.\n       (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n     and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n     self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n     shooting.\n       (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n     immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n     section 5 of that Amendment.\n       (4) To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose \n     unreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.\n       (5) To protect the right, under the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, of manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and \n     importers of firearms or ammunition products, and trade \n     associations, to speak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to \n     petition the Government for a redress of their grievances.\n       (6) To preserve and protect the Separation of Powers \n     doctrine and important principles of federalism, State \n     sovereignty and comity between sister States.\n       (7) To exercise congressional power under art. IV, section \n     1 (the Full Faith and Credit Clause) of the United States \n     Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON BRINGING OF QUALIFIED CIVIL LIABILITY \n                   ACTIONS IN FEDERAL OR STATE COURT.\n\n       (a) In General.--A qualified civil liability action may not \n     be brought in any Federal or State court.\n       (b) Dismissal of Pending Actions.--A qualified civil \n     liability action that is pending on the date of enactment of \n     this Act shall be immediately dismissed by the court in which \n     the action was brought or is currently pending.\n\n     SEC. 4.

ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Unlawful Acts.--Section 922(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking paragraphs (7) and (8) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(7) for any person to manufacture or import armor \n     piercing ammunition, unless--\n       ``(A) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the use of \n     the United States, any department or agency of the United \n     States, any State, or any department, agency, or political \n     subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) the manufacture of such ammunition is for the purpose \n     of exportation; or\n       ``(C) the manufacture or importation of such ammunition is \n     for the purpose of testing or experimentation and has been \n     authorized by the Attorney General;\n       ``(8) for any manufacturer or importer to sell or deliver \n     armor piercing ammunition, unless such sale or delivery--\n       ``(A) is for the use of the United States, any department \n     or agency of the United States, any State, or any department, \n     agency, or political subdivision of a State;\n       ``(B) is for the purpose of exportation; or\n       ``(C) is for the purpose of testing or experimentation and \n     has been authorized by the Attorney General;''.\n       (b) Penalties.--Section 924(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence \n     is otherwise provided under this subsection, or by any other \n     provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to \n     any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for \n     an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be \n     prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries \n     armor piercing ammunition, or who, in furtherance of any such \n     crime, possesses armor piercing ammunition, shall, in \n     addition to the punishment provided for such crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime or conviction under this \n     section--\n       ``(A) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less \n     than 15 years; and\n       ``(B) if death results from the use of such ammunition--\n       ``(i) if the killing is murder (as defined in section \n     1111), be punished by death or sentenced to a term of \n     imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and\n       ``(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as defined in \n     section 1112), be punished as provided in section 1112.''.\n       (c) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Attorney General shall conduct a study to \n     determine whether a uniform standard for the testing of \n     projectiles against Body Armor is feasible.\n       (2) Issues to be studied.--The study conducted under \n     paragraph (1) shall include--\n       (A) variations in performance that are related to the \n     length of the barrel of the handgun or center-fire rifle from \n     which the projectile is fired; and\n       (B) the amount of powder used to propel the projectile.\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a \n     report containing the results of the study conducted under \n     this subsection to--\n       (A) the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate; and\n       (B) the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9398-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9398-S9418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SAFE, ACCOUNTABLE, FLEXIBLE, EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT: A \n                            LEGACY FOR USERS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 3), and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3), to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway \n     safety programs, and transit programs, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to \n     the same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of July 28, 2005.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand we have 15 minutes divided evenly between \nthe majority and minority, and the Senator from Arizona has up to 30 \nminutes.\n  I ask now to recognize the Senator from Arizona for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a remarkable piece of work. I want \nto assure my colleagues that I will not take a half hour, but I will \ntake a few minutes to talk about some of the interesting and egregious \nand remarkable aspects of this bill.\n  There is an old saying about evil, and that is, if you do not check \nit or reverse it, then it just continues to get worse. I have to say, I \nhaven't seen anything quite like this, although I have seen some pretty \nbad things in the years that I have been here.\n  It is $286.4 billion, terrifying in its fiscal consequences and \ndisappointing for the lack of fiscal discipline it represents. I wonder \nwhat it is going to take to make the case for fiscal sanity here. If \nyou had asked me years ago, I would have said that the combination of \nwar, record deficits, and the largest public debt in the country's \nhistory would constitute a sufficient perfect storm to break us out of \nthis spending addiction--and I would have been wrong. I think we can \nweather almost any storm thrown at us. This week's expenditures, I \nthink, are a pretty good example.\n  I mentioned before, we are all the beneficiaries of the foresight of \nPresident Eisenhower and the Congress that helped to shepherd the \noriginal highway bill legislation. I have carried it to the floor \nbefore. It is about that thick. It has two demonstration projects in \nit.\n  This is just a small example of some of the provisions in this bill, \nwhich are unnumbered pages. The conferees didn't even have time to \nnumber the pages. I have no idea how many billions are in here. Some, I \nam sure, are very good projects. Many of them are interesting. Some of \nthem are entertaining. Just glance right here: Parking facility in \nPeoria, IL, $800,000. A parking facility in a highway bill.\n  The original bill as proposed by President Eisenhower and adopted by \nthe Congress had two demonstration projects. Now we have a lot. No one \nhas counted them yet. No one has counted these projects because we have \nnot, of course, had time because they have been stuffed in late, in the \nmiddle of the night.\n  Not surprisingly, my colleagues have come to me and begged: Please \nmake this short; I have a plane to catch. Please don't take too long; I \nhave a plane to catch. I have to get out of here.\n  Of course, it is just a coincidence that we happen to be considering \nthis legislation just before we leave.\n  How do we celebrate? Let me count the ways.\n\n       Section 1963, Apollo theater leases. The section would \n     require the Economic Development Administration to lease and \n     improve the Apollo Theater, in Harlem, New York.\n\n  The Apollo Theater in Harlem, NY.\n\n       Midway Airport, directs the Coast Guard, in consultation \n     with the Department of Transportation, to make grants or \n     other funding to provide for the operation of Midway Airport.\n\n  This is not an airport bill; this is a highway bill.\n\n       Expands the authority of the State of Oklahoma in \n     environmental matters to extend over ``Indian country'' \n     within that State.\n\n  Let me say that again.\n\n       Expands the authority of the State of Oklahoma in \n     environmental matters to extend over ``Indian country'' \n     within that State.\n\n  I don't know what that costs. But what in the world is it doing on a \nhighway bill?\n\n       Requires for Treatment as a State under EPA regulations, an \n     Indian Tribe in Oklahoma, and the State of Oklahoma, must \n     enter a cooperative agreement to jointly plan and administer \n     program requirements.\n\n  What is that all about? No one has ever brought it to my attention as \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. I admit it is a long-\nneglected committee--at least until recently.\n\n       Eligibility to Participate in Western Alaska Community \n     Development Quota Program. Designates a community to be \n     eligible to participate in the Western Alaska Community \n     Development Program established under the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Act.\n\n  It may be worthwhile. I have no clue. What in the world does it have \nto do with a highway bill?\n  This is one of the most remarkable I have ever seen. I have been \ntalking about these for years and years, but this is truly remarkable. \nThis is a ``technical adjustment.''\n\n       This section would overturn a decision by the 9th Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\n\n  It overturns a court decision in a highway bill, and legislates a \nsettlement between the parties that would authorize $4 million to be \nprovided, tax free, to the Alaska Native fund. That $4 million is going \nto be spent to be provided tax free to the Alaska Native fund, in a \nhighway bill.\n\n  This section was not in either the Senate-passed or the House-passed \nbill. Neither one. So right there it is in violation of the rules of \nthe Senate and the Congress. It wasn't in either bill.\n  This ``technical adjustment'' is neither technical nor an adjustment, \nbut it is a bailout for Hawaii and a blatant giveaway to the Alaska \nNative population. In 2000, the General Services Administration donated \nto Tanadgusix Corporation, called TDX, which is an Alaska Native \ncorporation, a World War II decommissioned dry dock under the condition \nthat it be transported from its holding area in Hawaii and placed in \nAlaska.\n  The TDX agreed to this condition. However, after receiving title, TDX \nbegan operating the dry dock in Hawaii. GSA attempted to enforce the \ncontract. TDX sued the Government. A Federal district court and the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals had both ordered TDX to tow the dry dock \nto Alaska. Additionally, the Department of Justice has filed a false \nclaim suit against TDX for its illegal use of the dry dock.\n  None of this seems to matter to the conferees who require the dry \ndock to be sold, so long as the buyer agrees to operate the dry dock \noutside the United States to protect the ports in Hawaii and Alaska \nfrom competition.\n  The conferees also require the Government to compensate TDX with $4 \nmillion tax free.\n  Why? Again, what in the world does this have to do with highways? And \nwhy should we be bailing out corporations and overturning court \ndecisions? It is only $4 million. We are talking about $280-some \nbillion. But this is a bailout for Hawaii and a tax-free gift to \nAlaska.\n  Conferees also have tax cuts. Do you know in this bill we have tax \ncuts, repeal of special occupational taxes on producers and marketers \nof alcoholic beverages? We don't want people to drink and drive on \nhighways, so I guess there is some connection to the highway bill, \nrepeal their alcohol taxes.\n  There are income tax credits for distilled spirits wholesalers. \nIncome tax credits for distilled spirits wholesalers in a highway bill.\n  Caps on excise tax on certain fishing equipment. I guess you have to \ndrive on a highway to go fishing. Maybe that is it.\n  There are tax breaks for luxury transportation. We don't want to \nleave our big donors out of this bill. Tax breaks for luxury \ntransportation, exemption from taxes on transportation provided by \nseaplanes and certain sightseeing flights. I guess you could land a \nseaplane on a highway--although that is hard, as an old pilot, I have \nto say. Exemption on taxes on transportation provided by seaplanes and \ncertain sightseeing flights.\n  I might add to my colleagues, we have had a couple of hours to \nexamine a 2,000-page bill.\n\n       Section 1114, Highway Bridge Program. The section contains \n     bridge construction or improvement projects totaling $100 \n     million for the fiscal year.\n\n  We are getting up there a little bit now.\n\n       These include $12,500,000 per fiscal year for the Golden \n     Gate Bridge, $18,750,000 per fiscal year for the construction \n     of a bridge joining the island of Gravina to the community of \n     Ketchikan in Alaska.\n\n  Let me tell you that once again: $18,750,000 per fiscal year. We \nfigure it is about $80 million. It could be a lot more than that. Guess \nhow many people live on the Gravina Island? Fifty; five-zero. I don't \nknow what that works out to per capita, but it is about a million-\nsomething per person at least.\n\n     . . . and $12,500,000 per fiscal year for the State of \n     Missouri for construction of a structure over the Mississippi \n     River to connect the City of St. Louis, MO, to the State of \n     Illinois.\n       National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program. \n     Directs the Department of Transportation to establish and \n     implement a program for highway construction in corridors of \n     National significance to promote economic growth and \n     international or interregional trade pursuant to criteria in \n     the section.\n\n  It lists 33 earmarks for 24 States totaling $1.95 billion--B--billion \ndollars.\n\n       Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot Program.\n\n  It is always interesting when you see the words ``pilot program.''\n\n       Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a \n     freight intermodal distribution pilot grant program \n     authorized for a total of $24 million. A portion of the \n     funding must be used for the following projects:\n       Short-haul intermodal projects, Oregon $5 million; the \n     Georgia Port Authority, $5 million; the ports of Los Angeles \n     and Long Beach, California, $5 million.\n\n  Ports--ports, my friends, not highways, ports.\n\n       Fairbanks, Alaska [of course] $5 million.\n  Just throw that in.\n\n       Charlotte Douglas International Airport Freight Intermodal \n     Facility, North Carolina, $5 million.\n       South Piedmont Freight Intermodal Center, North Carolina, \n     $5 million.\n       Development of Magnetic Levitation Transportation Systems. \n     Authorizes a total of $40 million for MAGLEV deployment and \n     earmarks 50 percent of the funding made available each year \n     for a MAGLEV project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and \n     50 percent for a project east of the Mississippi River.\n\n  So we are going to have $40 million for MAGLEV deployment and half of \nit goes to Nevada and half of it goes for a project east of the \nMississippi River.\n  ``Project Authorizations,'' this section would fund 5,173 projects, \ntotaling $14.8 billion.\n  Here is my favorite so far: $2,320,000 to add landscaping \nenhancements along--get this--the Ronald Reagan Freeway. I wonder what \nRonald Reagan would say: $2,320,000.\n  In my youth, I have watched Ronald Reagan deride this kind of \nactivity on the part of Congress. He used to get a pretty good \nresponse.\n\n       $480,000 to rehabilitate a historic warehouse on the Erie \n     Canal in the town of Lyons, New York.\n\n  A historic warehouse. I hope we all have a chance to visit it \nsometime.\n\n       $600,000 for High Knob Horse Trails, construction of horse \n     riding trails and associated facilities in High Knob area of \n     the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia;\n       $2,560,000 for the Daniel Boone Wilderness Trail in \n     Virginia. These funds would be used for acquiring the site; \n     designing and constructing an interpretive center, and for \n     the enhancement of the trail corridor;\n       $120,000 for the Town of St. Paul--restoration of Hillman \n     House to serve as a trail information center;\n       $400,00 to rehabilitate and redesign Erie Canal Museum in \n     Syracuse, New York;\n       $2,400,000 for the National Infantry Museum Transportation \n     Network in Georgia;\n       $960,000 for transportation enhancements to the Children's \n     Museum of Los Angeles;\n       $1,200,000 for the Rocky Knob Heritage Center in Virginia;\n       $1,600,000 for the Blue Ridge Music Center in Connecticut.\n\n  So we can listen to music as we are traveling on the highways.\n       $200,000 for the deer avoidance system to deter deer from \n     milepost markers in Pennsylvania and New York;\n       $1,280,000 for the Cultural and Interpretive Center in \n     Richland, WA;\n       $1,200,000 for the planning and engineering of the American \n     Road, the Henry Ford Museum, Dearborn, MI;\n       $1 million for the Oswego, NY pedestrian waterfront \n     walkway;\n       $400,000 for the Uptown Jogging, Bicycle, Trolley Trail in \n     Columbus, GA;\n       $2 million for Ketchikan, AK, to improve marine drydock \n     facilities;\n       $3 million for dust control mitigation on rural roads in \n     Arkansas.\n\n  Dust control mitigation on rural roads. Good luck. And\n\n       $850,000 for the Red River National Wildlife Refuge Visitor \n     Center in Louisiana;\n       $5 million for the Grant Tower reconfiguration in Salt Lake \n     City, UT.\n\n  I guess we don't know what the problem with the present configuration \nof the Grant Tower is in Salt Lake City.\n  Construction of ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities, which \nwould set aside $20 million for the construction or refurbishment of \nferry boats and ferry terminal facilities and, guess what, of this \namount $10 million would be earmarked for, guess where, Alaska. And $5 \nmillion would be earmarked for New Jersey. Way to go, New Jersey. And \n$5 million would be earmarked for Washington.\n  It authorizes such sums as may be necessary for 465 earmarked \nprojects totalling $2,602,000,000, and the big winners are Alaska, \nColorado, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, \nOregon, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.\n  Going-To-The-Sun Road in Glacier National Park in Montana. Authorizes\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\n$50 million for a project to be 100 percent federally funded to \nreconstruct a road in Glacier National Park. I am sure no one else with \na national park in their State has need for roads that would outdo this \none.\n  Bear Tooth Highway in Montana. Upon request by the State of Montana, \nthe Secretary shall obligate such sums as necessary to reconstruct the \nBear Tooth Highway. I think this might fit nicely into the $3 million \nwe provided a few years ago on another appropriation bill to study the \nDNA of bears in Montana so they could use the Bear Tooth Highway.\n  The Great Lakes ITS implementation: $9 million to continue ITS \nactivities in the Milwaukee, Chicago, and Gary, IN, area.\n  There is a lot more.\n  The Knik Arm Bridge funding clarification: Directs the DOT to provide \nall funds earmarked for the Knik Arm Bridge to provide the Knik Arm \nBridge and Toll Authority, $229.45 million. The Knik Arm Bridge, a name \nthat is hard to pronounce, I admit, will be renamed Don Young's Way.\n  Another section in the legislation: Traffic circle construction, \nClarendon, VT--$1 million for the State of Vermont to plan and complete \nconstruction of a traffic circle at a specified location.\n  Three million dollars--$3 million--to fund the production of a \ndocumentary--get this: $3 million to fund the production of a \ndocumentary about infrastructure that demonstrates advancements in \nAlaska, the last frontier.\n  Statewide transportation funding. This section would fund ferry \nprojects, including $25 million for projects in Alaska and Hawaii, and \nextension projects utilizing ferry boats, ferry boat terminals, or \napproaches to ferry boat terminals; $2.5 million for the San Francisco \nWater Transit Authority; $2.5 million for the Massachusetts Bay \nTransportation Authority Ferry System; $1 million for the Governor's \nIsland New York ferry system, and $1 million for the Philadelphia \nPenn's Landing ferry terminal.\n  The Department of Transportation is going to provide grants to the \nOklahoma Transportation Center to study motorcycle accident \ninvestigation methodology, $1,408,000. And then, of course, $1 million \nfor fiscal years 2006 and 2007 for a wood composite products \ndemonstration project at the University of Maine.\n  Well, anyway, that is how we are doing the grand plan, and I would \npoint out to my colleagues there are, according to the information I \nhave, 30 donor States that are losers and there are 20 States that are \nwinners. Some States have as much as 526 percent return on every dollar \nthat is sent to Washington, and others have as low as 92 percent. Some \nhave 206 percent, 218 percent, 207 percent, 227 percent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record. I \nthink my colleagues would be interested to see how they came out on \nthis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29JY05.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is so harmful in this is, because I happen to \nrepresent, as do some other Senators, fast-growing States, it is the \nrapidly growing States that are penalized the most here: Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Florida, Georgia. The fastest growing States are \nthe ones that are receiving the smallest amounts of money, and it is \nobviously very unfair. I think we all know what the answer is. Let the \nStates keep the dollars they collect in the form of taxes and spend it \nwithin their own State. I think the answer is that simple.\n  This is how this Congress administers the money of the American \npeople, Mr. President. In the 1950s when President Eisenhower's ``Grand \nPlan'' was being formulated, the country focused on building a unified \ntransportation system to improve the safety, security, and economy of \nour Nation as a whole. Now, Congress circles transportation funds like \nsharks. Instead of serving the public good, this Congress slices and \ndices the Treasury's money to fill up the pork barrel. And we do so \nwith grand speeches and lofty language, with no trace of shame or \nirony.\n  We live in the Era of the Earmark, Mr. President. In 1982, the \ntransportation bill included 10 earmarks costing $386 million. In 1987, \nthe bill included 152 earmarks, with a cost of $1.4 billion. By 1991, \nthe bill included 538 earmarks--costing taxpayers over $6 billion. Our \nmost recent transportation bill, TEA-21, included 1,850 earmarks with a \nprice tag of more than $9 billion. The legislation that we are voting \non today eclipses those numbers. I am told that SAFETEA-LU includes \nover 6,300 earmarked projects totaling over $20 billion.\n  Some Members of Congress may be happy to associate their names with \nthis legislation--the chairman of the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee for example has made sure that this \nlegislation renames the Knick Ann Bridge in Alaska ``Don Young's Way.'' \nThe bridge would also receive more than $229 million. I want no part of \nthis, Mr. President. This legislation is not--I emphasize not--my way \nof legislating.\n  And I'm sure that if we had adequate time to review this conference \nreport we would find more pork and more inappropriate provisions. But, \nof course, we will once again go through this process too quickly for a \nproper evaluation. This conference report is over 2,000 pages long--and \nover six and one-half inches high--and yet we've had less than a day to \nreview it. And that doesn't even include the statement of managers, \nwhich sits in a box in the cloakroom--making it difficult for any \nmember to read.\n  Fiscal prudence is crucial. But even if the conferees had excluded \npork from this legislation, that alone would not make it adequate. \nEquity is also essential, and--unfortunately--the conference report \nthat is before us still retains a grossly unfair feature of past \nlegislation.\n  This conference report perpetuates the historical discrepancy between \ndonor States and donee States. Remarkably, not only does the bill \ncontinue this disparity, it actually exacerbates it. Whereas the bill \nthat was passed last year by the Senate would have increased, at least \ntheoretically, every State's rate of return to 95 percent in the final \nyear of the bill--2009--the substitute amendment before the Senate only \npromises a rate of return of 92 percent in 2008 for those States. Until \nthen, many States will linger at a rate of return of 90.5 percent in \nthe first year and less than 92 percent thereafter while others receive \nmore--in some cases much more--than what they contribute to the Highway \nTrust Fund.\n\n  As if that weren't enough, this year's bill would actually propose to \ncreate further disparities between States. Though ``Equity'' is in the \ntitle of the legislation, the number of donor States would increase \nfrom 28 under current law to 30. In addition, 16 States would linger at \nthe bottom of the barrel through 2009. Some may argue that these so-\ncalled super-donor States should be satisfied with the fact that they \nare scheduled to move from a rate of return of 90.5 percent to one of \n92 percent in 2008. I would suggest that this is a meager improvement \nover current law and nothing to cheer about. After all, many other \nStates are set to receive significantly higher rates of return. While a \nState like Ohio is expected to receive 92 percent in 2009, Alaska will \nreceive a rate of return of almost 530 percent in the final year. 530 \npercent on top of the hundreds of earmarks and special provisions that \nare in this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I fully recognize that during the years when the \nFederal Government was building the Interstate system, a redistribution \nof funding between the States may have made sense. Clearly, it would \nhave been very difficult for the State of Montana, for example, with \nfewer than a million people, to pay the full cost of building its share \nof the Intestate system. But, Mr. President, that era is over. Congress \ndeclared the construction of the Interstate system complete in 1991. \nYet here we are, almost 15 years later, and donor States are still \nexpected to agree to the redistribution of hundreds of millions--if not \nbillions--of dollars to other States regardless of the already enormous \ntransportation needs of donor States.\n  That's not where this story ends, though. The rate of return formula \nis based on the authorized funds that are ``below the line''--that is, \nthat count towards the calculation of the rate of return. There is a \nsignificant amount of funds that is ``above the line.'' These funds are \nnot counted in the rate of return calculation. It's above the line that \nmore mischief takes place. For example, $100 million is earmarked for \nthe Alaska Way Viaduct and Seawall Replacement project above the line. \nThis means that Alaska's rate of return significantly understates the \namount of Federal funding that Alaska receives under this legislation. \nThe race for pork that takes place above the line also explains why \nsome States that are nominally donor States might be happier with this \nlegislation than one would expect. For example, California will receive \nover $1 billion in funding for earmarked projects above the line--\nthat's well over the average annual funding that California receives \nbelow the line.\n  In closing, I note that the conference report exceeds the funding \nlevel requested by the President of $284 billion by over $2 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nArizona, are you yielding back your time or just yielding the floor?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry. I would like to yield 2 minutes of time and \nyield back the rest of my time after yielding 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleague. I know \nthat the chairman of the committee is anxious to conclude the \nlegislation so I will be brief.\n  I simply reiterate the point that I hope colleagues sincerely \nconsider the points made by the senior Senator from Arizona--not meant \nto embarrass but to get us to focus on how we could better fund our \ntransportation needs in the country. We are all pretty bright and \npretty good on identifying what is necessary, but far better it would \nbe, as he pointed out, to let the States keep the money raised in the \nStates and for them to decide how best to use the money in their own \nStates. It would be much more fair than taxing some States and giving \nit to residents of other States. Even for the donor States such as \nours, instead of getting close to 100 percent of the targeted amount \nthat was provided in the bill in the first year, some are lucky if they \nget there at the very end of the period of time. There needs to be a \nfix to this problem sooner or later. I hope my colleagues again will \nsincerely consider the remarks of those who regrettably are required to \nvote against this legislation because of its unfairness and because of \nthe way taxpayer dollars are used for projects, some of which do not \neven relate to highways or to transportation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 SteeLGrid Reinforced Concrete Decking\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to engage my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma in a colloquy regarding steel grid reinforced \nconcrete decking. First, I would like to congratulate my colleague on \nthe successful completion of conference negotiations on this important \nlegislation, and thank him for all he has done to assist me and my \nconstituents through this bill.\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\n  It is my understanding that steel grid reinforced concrete decking \nhas significant technological benefits and the ability to accomplish \nthe goals of bridge and highway officials across the Nation. Among the \nmany benefits of this technology are long service life, rapid and/or \nstaged installation, and reduced maintenance costs and closures. \nUnfortunately, this type of bridge deck system is underused because of \nthe larger initial costs incurred. It was my great hope that the \nbenefits of this technology would be noted in the conference report of \nSAFETEA-LU. While it was my understanding that efforts were made by the \ndistinguished chairman to incorporate language regarding this \ntechnology into this important piece of legislation, the issue of steel \ngrid reinforced concrete decking was not directly addressed in the \nconference report. Accordingly, I would like to ask the, chairman \nwhether he agrees with me on the many benefits of steel grid reinforced \nconcrete decking.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis persistence in advocating on behalf of steel grid reinforced \nconcrete decking as a way of modernizing and strengthening our Nation's \nbridges. Be assured that it was my intention to assist this technology \ngain greater prominence among transportation officials at the national, \nState, and local level. I understand my good friend from Pennsylvania's \nenthusiasm for this technology and desire to expand its use. I look \nforward to working with Senator Santorum to educate our colleagues and \ntransportation officials about the vast benefits of this technology.\n\n\n                     exise tax on highway vehicles\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend from \nIowa, the chairman of the Finance Commitee, as well as my friend \nSenator Baucus, the ranking member of the committee in a brief \ncolloquy.\n  The transportation reauthorization legislation that this body is \nconsidering includes a very important provision that is intended to \nprovide clarity with respect to the excise tax on certain highway \nvehicles under Internal Revenue Code Section 4051. Can my colleagues \nconfirm that it is the drafters' intent that this provision will allow \nvehicle dealers to rely on the gross combined weight rating established \nby the manufacturer?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is our intent. Present law allows the seller to \nrely on the weight rating specified by the manufacturer when \ndetermining the applicability of vehicle excise taxes on trucks. The \nsame rule should apply for tractors.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur. A seller should be able to rely on the gross \nvehicle weight rating and the gross combined weight rating established \nby the manufacturer. Only in situations where the seller modifies the \nvehicle substantially will the seller be responsible for determining \ndifferent weight ratings.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues for this clarification.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \ntransportation reauthorization bill. This bill is long overdue and will \nprovide Colorado and our Nation with investments to improve our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I regret that this bill could not do more to correct the fundamental \ninjustice that States like Colorado--a donor State--suffer under our \nhighway funding system.\n  Nonetheless, Colorado does get much needed relief in this bill. It \nwill receive a 46.7 percent increase over the last time this bill was \nreauthorized. That's the largest percentage increase under this bill \nand more than any other State. That is $156 million more over the life \nof the bill than we received under the previous transportation bill, \nTEA-21.\n  This increase in transportation funding to Colorado will help ensure \nthat the highest level of our transportation infrastructure is \nmaintained. Having a first-class transportation system is critical to \nColorado. Transportation infrastructure is critical to the health and \nvitality of our State, from the Eastern Plains to the West Slope, and \nfrom Weld County to Conejos County, Coloradans depend on safe and wel1-\nfunded highways.\n  Recognizing our State's varied needs, I worked hard with the Colorado \nDepartment of Transportation and with counties and municipalities \nacross the state to ensure these precious tax dollars will be well \nspent. I am especially happy with our efforts to secure authorizations \nfor the following highway projects: I-70/Havana/Yosemite; Wadsworth and \nU.S. 36 Broomfield interchange; Wadsworth Bypass, Grandview Grade \nSeparation; U.S. 287 Ports to Plains Corridor; I-70 and SH58 \ninterchange; improvements to Powers Blvd. and Woodman Rd. interchange; \nimprovements to I-25S, Douglas, Arapaho County line to EI Paso; \nimprovements to U.S. 36; improvements to U.S. 24--Tennessee Pass; \nimprovements to Bromley Lane and U.S. 85 Interchange; improvements to \n104th and U.S. 85 Interchange; improvements to I-25 North, Denver to \nFt. Collins; improvements to I-70 East multimodal corridor; \nimprovements to Parker and Arapaho Rd. Interchange; improvements to I-\n225, Parker Road to I-70; improvements to I-70 West Mountain Corridor, \nDenver to Garfield; improvements to I-76--Northeast Gateway; \nimprovements to C470 and U.S. 85 Interchange; improvements to Wadsworth \nand Bowles intersection; improvements to U.S. 160, Wolf Creek Pass; \nFort Carson I-25 and Highway 16 interchange; U.S. 50 East Pueblo to \nKansas border; Heartland Expressway improvements; I-25 Denver to Ft. \nCollins improvements; Pueblo Dillon Drive at I-25 overpass and ramp; \nDenver Union Station improvements; improvements to 56th and Quebec \nStreet; U.S. 550 New Mexico State Line to Durango; SH 121 Bowles Ave. \nintersection and Ridgeway; improvements, Jefferson County, CO; \nconstruction of McCaslin Blvd., U.S. 36 interchange in Superior; I-70 \nEast Multimodal Corridor to Denver; SH 83--SH 88 interchange \nreconstruction, Arapaho County; improve to SH44 from CO Boulevard; \nimprovements to SH550 btw Grand Avenue, N/S of city; improvements on \nU.S. 36 corridor from I-25 to Boulder.\n  Earlier this month I met with community leaders in Colorado Springs \nto discuss their efforts to prepare for the influx of troops and their \nfamilies associated with BRAC changes and the redeployment of the \nArmy's 4th Infantry Division to Fort Carson. Community leaders were \nunited in their desire to see improvements and upgrades of the \ninterchange of I-25 and Highway 16 at Fort Carson. The upgrade of this \ninterchange is of vital importance to ensure that traffic flows freely \ninto Fort Carson and along I-25.\n  I am pleased that we were able to secure $5 million for that project, \nand that my Colorado colleague Senator Allard was able to secure an \nadditional $3 million for that project. Unfortunately, the final report \nof the transportation bill being passed today did not include the \ncorrect highway number for this project. The report wrongly lists \nHighway 12, rather than rightly listing highway 16. I will seek a \ncorrection of this in the technical corrections bill later this year.\n  This is an important bill, and I am happy to support it.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conference report on \nH.R. 3, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act: A Legacy for Users, protects an important program \nadministered by the Department of Transportation the Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise Program also known as the DBE Program.\n  The DBE Program ensures that small businesses owned and controlled by \nsocially and economically disadvantaged individuals are able to compete \non a level playing field for federally funded highway and transit \ncontracts.\n  I strongly endorse the DBE Program and am pleased that this program \ncontinues to enjoy bipartisan support.\n  Since the DBE Program was started in 1982, the field of highway \ncontractors has grown more racially diverse. The DBE Program was \nexpanded to include women in 1987, and that improvement to the program \nhas opened the doors for women contractors to join what has \ntraditionally been an all-male field. Despite the increased fairness \nand greater opportunity for minority and women contractors since the \ninception of DBE, there continues to be a strong need for the DBE \nProgram.\n  Unfortunately, studies have shown that when DBE Programs end, many \ncontractors simply revert to their old practices, denying contracts to \nsmall companies owned by minorities or the economically disadvantaged. \nIt is clear\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\nthat the DBE Program is still needed to secure the gains made and \nencourage even greater opportunity for these small businesses, and I am \npleased that the conferees have recognized that continuing need and \nhave retained this program.\n  Federally funded highway and transit contracts are big business, and \nit is imperative that we give everyone the big guys and the little guys \na fair opportunity to take part. The DBE is vital to increasing \nparticipation in our federally funded highway projects.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of \nthe transportation reauthorization bill. The road to final passage has \nbeen long and brutal, but I am pleased that we have finally reached \nthis point. This is a good bill for Maryland and a good bill for our \nNation.\n  The State of Maryland is the fifth most densely populated State in \nthe Nation. Our highways and byways serve almost 54 billion vehicle \nmiles of travel annually. Maryland has the second largest urban \ninterstate traffic density and the sixth largest percentage of roads in \nurban areas in the United States. As part of the Northeast corridor, \nMaryland experiences an extremely high volume of through traffic, \nespecially on roadways such as 1-95. Maryland is also one of the few \nStates in the Nation with two major metropolitan areas, Washington, DC, \nand Baltimore, and two major beltways with some of the highest traffic \nvolumes in the country, within 30 miles of each other. In the \nWashington metropolitan area, we have the third longest average commute \ntime in the Nation.\n  This bill will provide much needed relief to the stresses that our \ncommuters experience every day by making critical investments to \nhighway safety and expansion, improvements to our Metro system, and \nexpansion of our transit systems.\n  Maryland will receive more funding for highways and mass transit \nunder this bill than it does now. For highways, Maryland can expect to \nreceive $140 million more per year in Federal highway formula money, \nmore than $2.9 billion over the life of the bill. This funding will \nhelp make our roads safer, improve traffic conditions, and help promote \neconomic development throughout the State. For our transit systems this \nbill provides more than $900 million. This means critical funding to \nimprove the capacity of the Washington Metro and expand and build \ncapacity for transit systems throughout Maryland.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, for \nall of his hard work on this bill, particularly for his steadfast \ndedication to the transit needs of Maryland and our Nation. Thanks to \nhis efforts, this bill provides essential support to State and local \ngovernments to ensure greater access to safe and reliable transit \nservices.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the highway bill \nconference report. This legislation is 2 years overdue, and I am \npleased that we are finally completing this very critical piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would like to thank Senators Inhofe, Bond, Jeffords, Baucus, and \ntheir staffs for their very hard work on this bill and commend them for \nthe bipartisan way in which they have proceeded.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Lott and Senator Inouye, the \nchairman and co chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine, for their work on the safety \nportions of this bill, as well as Senator Stevens, the chair of the \nfull Commerce Committee. I was proud to have worked on these very \nimportant motor carrier and passenger safety provisions.\n  I have addressed this body before with my concerns about the need for \na highway bill.\n  In America over one-third of our major roads are both deteriorating \nand congested. In Arkansas, 47 percent of our roads are in poor or \nmediocre condition--almost half. Additionally, over one in four bridges \nare structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that close to 42,800 \npersons died in car crashes in 2004. Over 2,000 Arkansans have died on \nour highways over the past several years. Too many families die on our \nhighways--plain and simple.\n  The amount of freight expected to travel on our Nation's highways \nover the next 20 years is expected to double. Not only do we need to \nimprove the existing system, we feed to increase the capacity of the \nsystem.\n  This bill would decrease congestion on American roads and enable \nbusinesses to transport their materials across the United States \nsafely. It would also spur economic development and create many jobs \nfor hard-working Americans.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that for every $1 \nbillion of investment in our highways, we create 47,500 jobs annually. \nThis bill provides a record amount of investment in our Nation's \nhighways and interstates, over $286 billion.\n  But we still have much work to do. We must continue to make \ninvestments in infrastructure, and we must work toward finding creative \nsolutions to our transportation problems. After all, good schools, good \nhealth care, and good jobs don't mean much if you can't get there.\n  I am pleased this bill provides funding increases that could be used \nto make substantial progress on important economic development projects \nin my State and around the country. With passage of this bill, Arkansas \nwould be able to make progress on many critical projects such as the \nNortheast Arkansas Connector, the Caraway Bridge Overpass, the \nInterstate 430/630 Interchange Modification, the Perry Road Overpass, \nand the Hot Springs East-West Arterial, just to name a few. These \nprojects will greatly enhance the capacity and safety of Arkansas \nroadways.\n  This bill also enables Arkansas to make significant progress on our \ntwo large corridors, I-49 and I-69, that, if completed, would help \ngenerate economic expansion, add jobs, and provide isolated areas with \ntransportation options. I am pleased this bill provides $75 million for \nthe I-69 Corridor, including the Great River Bridge which serves as a \n``Bridge Across the Delta.'' It provides $72 million for the I-69 \nConnector, which will enable the northern part of the State to access \nI-69. 1 am also pleased that this bill provides $37 million for the I-\n49 Bella Vista Bypass and several other projects that will reduce \ncongestion and allow for further economic development in northwest \nArkansas, one of the top 10 fastest growing areas in America.\n  This is a wise investment that will pay for itself by fostering \ninterstate commerce, bolstering tourism, and creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is a long overdue bill. It is \na bipartisan bill. My constituents support it, I support it, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we are passing a significant bill \nfor the people of this country. It will create hundreds of thousands of \njobs. It will reduce congestion on our highways. It will move goods \nmore efficiently. And it will improve local transit systems.\n  I was pleased to have been a part of putting this bill together as a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee and as a conferee \non this legislation.\n  This is a good bill for the State of California. In total, California \nwill receive $21.6 billion in highway and transit funding over the next \n5 years. That is an average of $1.175 billion more per year for \nCalifornia than the last highway bill in 1998. And it will create an \nestimated 800,000 jobs in my State.\n  When I arrived in the Senate in 1993, California was getting about 83 \ncents on the dollar in highway funds. I am pleased to report that with \nthis bill California's rate of return will reach 92 percent. Not what \nit should be--but a significant improvement.\n  This bill also includes over $1 billion in special projects for \nCalifornia, including over $130 million for the I-405 HOV lanes in the \nLos Angeles area and $58 million for the Golden Gate bridge seismic \nretrofit--an extremely important project in helping to preserve one of \nAmerican's most notable landmarks.\n  Let me tell you why increased funding is so crucial for California.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute, Los Angeles and the \nSan Francisco-Oakland region are ranked No. 1 and 2 for the worst \nroadway congestion in this country. California has two more cities in \nthe top five, with San Jose ranked fourth and\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\nSan Diego ranked fifth. The inland empire of San Bernardino and \nRiverside Counties is ranked 12th and Sacramento is ranked 13th.\n  What does this congestion translate to? Delays--in the Los Angeles \narea, 136 hours per year, on average per driver, in peak hours. Drivers \nin the San Francisco and Oakland area experience 92 hours of delays, \nand San Jose drivers endure 74 hours of delays. Inland empire drivers \nare delayed 64 hours, and San Diego drivers are delayed 51 hours a \nyear. This is time people could spend with their families, reading a \nbook, or any number of other things; instead, they are stuck in \ntraffic.\n  Congestion will not get better over time. California's population is \nexpected to increase from 35 million people today to 50 million people \nby 2020. We need to make significant improvements in our transportation \nsystem. This bill will help fund the roads that will help ease \ncongestion.\n  And it will also fund transit systems that will enable more people to \nget off the roads and onto buses, trains, and subways.\n  Transit ridership is up growing rapidly in California. The number of \nmiles traveled annually by transit passengers grew by 20 percent \nbetween 1997 and 2001. The number of annual passenger trips was up 14 \npercent. In the San Francisco Bay Bridge corridor, 38 percent of all \ntrips are on transit. And 30 percent of all trips into central Los \nAngeles are on transit.\n  This is why I am pleased that California will receive $4.6 billion in \nguaranteed transit funding over the next 5 years.\n  To mention a few specific examples of projects in California, this \nbill funds the Metro Gold Line eastside extension in Los Angeles, the \nMission Valley east extension in San Diego, the Muni Third Street light \nrail in San Francisco, and the South Corridor light rail extension in \nSacramento.\n  Another issue that I spent a lot of time working on involves grade \ncrossings. Over 40 percent of all the Nation's imported goods come \nthrough California ports. The majority enter through the ports of LA \nand Long Beach. Many of the goods are then put on trams, leave Los \nAngeles, and travel through Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. This \ncauses terrible local congestion.\n  To help that problem, this bill funds over $150 million for the \nAlameda corridor east for grade separations.\n  In addition to congestion, grade crossings create significant safety \nproblems. This bill includes my provision for a study of grade crossing \nsafety. The study would direct the Secretary of Transportation, in \nconsultation with State and local government officials, to conduct a \nstudy of the impact of grade crossings both on accidents and on the \nability of emergency responders to perform public safety and security \nduties. This would include the ability of police, fire, ambulances, and \nother emergency vehicles to cross the railroad tracks during \nemergencies.\n  Finally, this legislation recognizes that we can both improve our \ntransportation system and improve our environment at the same time.\n  For example, I worked to ensure that fuel-efficient hybrid cars can \nbe allowed on HOV lanes. This will provide incentives for people to \npurchase fuel-efficient vehicles, and will allow the State of \nCalifornia to implement a law passed last year.\n  In addition, this bill promotes bike and pedestrian paths. Funding is \nprovided for the Virginia Corridor Rails to Trails plan, which will \nconvert a Union Pacific railroad right of way into a bicycle and \npedestrian trail in Modesto. Also, Marin County will receive $25 \nmillion to develop a network of bike and pedestrian paths.\n  This bill has been several years in the making. It has been the \nsubject of intense--and sometimes tough--negotiations. But in the end, \nI am glad I had the opportunity to help craft a bill that will do so \nmuch to improve the lives of Californians, create so many jobs in \nCalifornia, and make such significant improvements to our \ntransportation system.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. I would like to briefly explain the scope \nof the Transit New Start project listed as ``Seattle Monorail Project \nPost-Green Line Extensions.'' The project authorization does not \nauthorize any Federal funding for the 14-mile Green Line approved by \nSeattle voters in November 2002. The 14-mile Green Line was approved by \nvoters using entirely local funds. The authorization in this bill is \nfor a possible second monorail line or an extension of the Green Line \nfollowing construction of the 14-mile line.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I proudly rise in support of the \ntransportation bill that Congress passed today. It has been 3 years in \nthe making, and I must admit there were times when I thought this \nmoment would never come.\n  I could not be more pleased to vote for this transportation bill. \nWhen the Senate passed this legislation in May, I feared that Wisconsin \nwould suffer under an unfair, 5-year bill. Today, Congress passed \nlegislation that is significantly different. This legislation treats my \nState equitably. Over the next five years, Wisconsin will receive an \naverage rate of return of $1.06. Wisconsin taxpayers are getting their \nfair share under this bill, and that deserves everyone's support.\n  The Wisconsin delegation has worked tirelessly on improving this \nlegislation over the past 3 years. I would especially like to thank \nCongressman Petri, whose efforts as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHighways, Transit and Pipelines helped ensure the fair treatment of \nWisconsin. Throughout the process, Congressman Petri worked with others \nin the delegation, and this bill is truly the result of bipartisan \ncooperation. I would also like to thank the members of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee: Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member \nJeffords, along with Senators Bond and Baucus worked hard to ensure \nthat the needs of all fifty States were met.\n  Three years in the making and this legislation is long overdue. This \nbill will mitigate the congestion that clogs our roadways, and it will \nenhance safety on highways throughout Wisconsin. It provides needed \nfunding for such critical projects as the Marquette Interchange, the \nSt. Croix River Crossing and the Sturgeon Bay Bridge. Commuters and \nvisitors alike will see a direct benefit from this legislation, in \naddition to the thousands of jobs that the funding in this bill will \ncreate.\n  For 3 years, I have been consistent in my request for Congress to \ncomplete an equitable transportation authorization bill. I am proud to \njoin my colleagues in supporting exactly that.\n\n\n               Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to reiterate \nmy support for the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise, DBE Program. This program is an effective tool \nused by the Department of Transportation to make real the promises of \nour Founding Fathers and the fundamental values of our Nation: economic \nopportunity, equal opportunity, a chance to be able to share in the \nremarkable assets of our Nation.\n  The DBE Program is a much needed program. It is an essential tool in \ncombating the continuing effects of discrimination in the highway \nconstruction industry and in creating a level playing field for all \nbusinesses. It accomplishes these goals in a completely constitutional \nway without establishing quotas and, whenever possible, enhancing \ncontracting opportunities in race and gender neutral ways.\n  Let me explain how the DBE program works. In past debates, my \ncolleagues in the Senate have criticized the program for lacking \nflexibility. This is simply not true. Mr. President, this is not a \nquota it expressly prohibits quotas. This program offers a set-aside of \na specific amount of money, but there is no specific direction as to \nwho gets that amount of money. There is no quota of numbers of women, \nno quotas of numbers of particular races. It is open to any \ndisadvantaged business enterprise. And, while we set aside a very \nspecific sum of money, the money is not allocated with specificity.\n  This program is intended to help level the playing field for \nbusinesses owned by individuals who have historically suffered \ndiscrimination in Federal contracting based on their gender, race or \nethnicity, and who continue to suffer as a result of that \ndiscrimination. To ensure that these firms receive their fair share of \nFederal contracts, Congress set a national goal. I reaffirm\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\nthat it is appropriate in this country to set national goals for what \nwe will do to try to break down the walls of discrimination, the \nbarriers against equal opportunity, in order to give people an \nopportunity to share in the full breadth of the upside of the economy \nof our Nation. The goal for each agency, including the Department of \nTransportation, is negotiated on an annual basis, allowing the \nflexibility that is so desired.\n  In addition, the DBE Program is very flexible. It allows each State \nto respond to local conditions. In the implementation of the DBE \nProgram, the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to increase, \ndecrease or even waive the DBE goal where it is not possible to achieve \nthe goal in a particular contract or for a given year.\n  Many opponents to this and other programs aimed at offering \nassistance to disadvantaged business owners often argue that it is \ninconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand v. Pena which \nrequired that affirmative actions programs, such as this one, be \n``narrowly tailored'' to serve the Government's ``compelling \ninterest.'' It is clear that rectifying past discrimination is a \ncompelling Government interest. And, I believe that the flexibility I \ndescribed above demonstrates that program is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest. In fact, it has been upheld by every court that \nhas reviewed it.\n  It is the duty of Congress to use whatever means available to this \nbody to enhance competition on federally funded projects by promoting \nequal opportunity and the full participation of all segments of the \ncommunity in a marketplace environment that is free from the effects of \npast or present discrimination. The reality is that those effects, \nthose inequalities and those injustices still exist. Justice Sandra day \nO'Conner, who penned the Supreme Court's majority opinion in the \nAdarand decision, stated, ``the unhappy persistence of both the \npractice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against \nminority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and \ngovernment is not disqualified from acting in response to it.''\n  Many of the firms that have been able to use the program, the women-\nowned firms or minority-owned businesses, literally would have been \nexcluded from doing so altogether were it not for the DBE Program. \nArguments against these programs often point to the possibility of \nfirms being excluded for other reasons such as size, experience or \nspecific qualifications necessary. However, the reality in America's \nhistory is that the individuals running these disadvantaged firms often \ndo not meet these standards because they were prevented from doing so \nby a lack of access to capital, training, or even blatant \ndiscriminatory Government policies. As the Congress, and this body in \nparticular, has upheld in numerous debates, the Federal Government has \nan affirmative obligation, both a statutory one and a moral one, to \nmake certain that we are going to do something very specific to respond \nto that kind of discrimination.\n  Mr. President, time has shown that the DBE Program works. It is a \nprogram that meets constitutional muster. It is a program that has a \nrational, national compelling interest. I am happy to reiterate my \nsupport for this essential program that has served an enormous benefit \nto countless minority- and women-owned businesses in the country. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I understand the need for a good highway and \ntransit bill.\n  As debate on this bill has dragged on over the last year and a half, \nI have heard from many Arizonans in industry, as well as users of our \nsurface transportation system detailing the pressing needs in our \nstate.\n  But throughout that time, I have expressed concern that the \nreauthorization legislation that has been brought before this Chamber \nhas had certain fundamental deficiencies.\n  The conference report before us today preserves two of the most \nobjectionable defects: a grossly unfair formula for apportioning \nhighway funds among the States and a staggering quantity of pork-barrel \nearmarks.\n  It is simply impossible to explain to my constituents why more than \n9.5 cents out of every dollar in gas taxes they pay at the pump goes to \nsubsidize road construction in other States.\n  And while it is true that this conference report makes the barest \nprogress toward equity by ensuring that rate of return to high-growth \nStates like Arizona will inch up to 92 cents on the dollar, I believe \nthat much more progress could have been attained given that this bill \nexpends some 30 percent more than its predecessor.\n  This conference report preserves Arizona's rock-bottom standing in \nthe donor/done sweepstakes.\n  And it does so in a way that adds insult to injury, for even as \nArizona and other high-growth states continue to heavily subsidize the \nothers, and are only moved up to the higher rate of return in the \nbill's fourth year, others are raised up immediately.\n  Even as the sponsors of this legislation suggested that we ignore the \nextent to which Arizona highway users will be compelled to subsidize \nthose in other States, but they ensured that their own apportionments \nwere promptly and generously supplemented.\n  I must also object to the out-of-control earmarking in this \nconference report.\n  Earmarking is, of course, the insertion into the bill of projects \nselected not through a merit-based process, but through the influence \nof Members.\n  Consider: The 1982 highway bill contained 10 such projects. The 1991 \nbill had 538. The 1998 bill had 1,800. This bill has somewhere in the \nneighborhood of 6,000. The list alone goes on for 250 pages.\n  Among those listed is the notorious ``Bridge to Nowhere,'' the 200 \nfoot high $223 million bridge connecting Ketchikan, AK, to an island \nthat is home to 50 people and is currently accessible to the mainland \nby a 10 minute ferry ride.\n  I hope that between now and the next time Congress takes up a highway \nbill, we will take a serious look at the flawed process that results in \nthe diversion of funds from fast-growing States, as well as at the \nunsustainable rate at which earmarking has been proliferating.\n  But for now I can only note my disappointment in what we have \nproduced, a bill the Wall Street Journal today describes as a monument \nto ``extravagance''--and vote against this conference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Wall Street Journal \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 29, 2005]\n\n                          Capitol Hill Blowout\n\n\nHighways, bike paths, ethanol, ``biomass''--Congress throws a spending \n                                 party\n\n       President Bush had to twist a lot of arms to squeak his \n     Central American Free Trade Agreement through Congress this \n     week, but Republicans are about to make sure he pays for a \n     whole lot more than their chiropractor bills. Having \n     sacrificed to support free trade, the Members prepared for \n     the August recess by throwing themselves a giant spending \n     party.\n       Speaker Dennis Hastert had barely waited for dawn to break \n     after the midnight Cafta vote before he directed the House to \n     pass a $286.4 billion highway bill. He expects Mr. Bush to \n     sign this because it is ``only'' $2.4 billion more than the \n     President's 2005 veto limit, which is ``only'' $28 billion \n     more than his 2004 veto limit of $256 billion, which was \n     ``only'' a 17% increase over the previous six-year highway \n     spending level. ``Only'' in Washington could spending so much \n     money be considered an act of fiscal discipline.\n       The bill is all about ``jobs, jobs, jobs,'' declared Mr. \n     Hastert, and he's right if he's referring to the Members' re-\n     election prospects. The House version alone contained 3,700 \n     special earmarks, doled out liberally across state and party \n     lines.\n       Democrat Jim Clyburn retained another $25 million for his \n     famous ``Bridge to Nowhere,'' a project in rural South \n     Carolina that has already sucked up $34 million in federal \n     funds. The California delegation secured $1.4 billion for \n     more than 479 projects, including $2.5 million for freeway \n     landscaping. And ranking Transportation Committee Democrat \n     James Oberstar snatched more than $14 million for Duluth, \n     Minnesota, including $3.2 million for an extension of the \n     longest paved recreational path in the nation.\n       Next to this highway extravagance, the energy bill seems \n     almost a bargain at an estimated $66 billion or so. Minor \n     highlights here include the repeal of a Depression-era law \n     (Puhca) that will open up electricity sector investment; new \n     reliability standards for the national power grid; more \n     federal authority to settle siting disputes over much-needed \n     natural gas terminals; and an inventory of offshore oil and \n     gas resources that may someday encourage more exploration.\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\n       We can also say this for the bill: It doesn't pick energy \n     winners or losers. Everyone who produces so much as a \n     kilowatt hour is a winner in this subsidy-fest of tax credits \n     and new federal mandates. There's $550 million for forest \n     biomass, $100 million for hydroelectric production, and $1.8 \n     billion for ``clean coal.'' There are subsidies for wind, \n     solar, nuclear and (despite $60 oil) even for oil and gas.\n       Most egregious is the gigantic transfer of wealth from car \n     drivers to Midwest corn farmers (and Archer-Daniels-Midland) \n     via a new 7.5-billion-gallon-a-year ethanol mandate, which \n     will raise gas prices by as much as a dime a gallon on the \n     East and West coasts. Oh, and don't forget the $15 billion (a \n     155% increase) in federal home heating subsidies, $100 \n     million for ``fuel cell'' school buses, and $6 million for a \n     government program to encourage people to ride their bikes--\n     presumably along Mr. Oberstar's newly paved trail.\n       All of this points up the bill's underlying mortal failing, \n     which is that it abandons the lesson of the 1980s that the \n     best way to ensure abundant energy supplies is to let the \n     price system work. At least the House-Senate conferees \n     dropped a Senate provision that would have mandated that 10% \n     of all electricity come from ``renewable'' sources by 2020, \n     regardless of supply and demand. Although in return for \n     killing this, the House had to drop its liability protection \n     for producers of MTBE, a gas additive that Congress itself \n     mandated in 1990 but now wants to feed to the trial bar.\n       It's too much to hope that Mr. Bush will target one of \n     these fiascoes with his first veto; any chance of a highway \n     veto vanished when Mr. Hastert scheduled the bill immediately \n     after Cafta. At least the Members are leaving town for \n     August; too bad they plan to come back.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 3, which will reauthorize our Nation's surface \ntransportation laws and provided significant and needed resources to \nmaintain and improve our nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems.\n  For Rhode Island, this legislation is welcome news and will bring \ntremendous resources to address a number of high-priority highway and \ntransit projects.\n  This conference report is the product of hard work and bipartisan \ncooperation, and I was pleased and proud to be named as a conferee on \nthe transit title of this conference report. I believe the transit \ntitle of this bill continues the trend of TEA-21 of investing more in \ntransit systems to the benefit of our economy and our environment.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shelby and Sherry Little, Rich Steinman, and \nJohn East of his staff for their hard work and bipartisan spirit. I \nalso want to commend my ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, who has \nfought for transit since the first day he took office, as well as his \nstaff, Sarah Kline and Aaron Klein, for their tireless work in helping \nmy office and others. Lastly, I want to thank my subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Allard, and his able staff, Tewana Wilkerson, for their work on \nbalancing the needs of old and new transit systems.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for over 2 years Congress has been trying \nto reauthorize the Federal surface transportation and safety programs \nthat to keep commerce and traffic flowing smoothly across our Nation. \nThe reauthorization bill is long overdue and I am pleased Congress will \nfinally complete this process today. Funding for transportation \ninfrastructure such as roads, bridges and border crossings is an \nimportant investment that increases the mobility of people and goods, \nenhances economic competitiveness, reduces traffic congestion, and \nimproves air quality.\n  Improvements in transportation infrastructure are critical to all of \nour States, and the Federal highway money that States receive is \ncritical for funding them. In addition, few Federal investments have as \nlarge and immediate an impact on job creation and economic growth as \ntransportation infrastructure. The Department of Transportation \nestimates that every $1 billion in new Federal investment creates more \nthan 47,500 jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the formula that distributes Federal highway funds to \nStates is antiquated and inequitable and has discriminated against \nMichigan and other states for 50 years since the interstate system was \nfirst legislated. Historically, about 20 states, including Michigan, \nhave been ``donor'' States, sending more gas tax dollars to the Highway \nTrust Fund in Washington than are returned in transportation \ninfrastructure spending. The remaining 30 States, known as ``donee'' \nStates, have received more transportation funding than they paid into \nthe Highway Trust Fund.\n  This unfair practice began in 1956 when small states and large \nWestern states banded together to develop a formula for distributing \nFederal highway dollars that advantaged themselves to the disadvantage \nof the remaining States. Once that formula was in place, they have \ntenaciously defended it.\n  At the beginning, there was some legitimacy to the concept that \nlarge, low-population, and predominately Western states needed more \nfunding than they contributed to the system. It was necessary in order \nto build a national interstate highway system. However, with the \nnational interstate system completed, the formulas used to determine \nhow much a state will receive from the Highway Trust are simply unfair.\n  Each time the highway bill has been reauthorized, I, along with my \ncolleagues from other donor States, have fought to correct this \ninequity in highway funding. Over the years, through these battles, \nsome progress has been made. For instance, in 1978, Michigan was \ngetting around 75 cents back on our Federal gas tax dollar. The 1991 \nbill brought us up to approximately 80 cents per dollar, and the 1998 \nbill guaranteed a 90.5-cent minimum return for each State. This bill \nwill bring us to 92 cents per dollar by fiscal year 2008.\n  During the past 2 years, in its effort to reauthorize TEA-21, the \nSenate has twice passed bills that would have been better for Michigan \nand other donor States in terms of rate of return than is today's \nConference Report. The first Senate-passed bill died in conference due \nto President Bush's veto threat and his unwillingness to accept the \nfunding levels in either the House or Senate bill. This year's Senate-\npassed bill was modified in the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The bill before us has less overall funding than either of the \nprevious Senate passed bills and does not go as far as it should go in \nclosing the funding equity gap for donor States. Although I am \ndisappointed we did not do as well as we proved could be done in the \ntwo Senate bills, this Conference Report still allows Michigan to make \na little progress toward achieving equity. Michigan will go from a \ncurrent 90.5 percent minimum rate of return on its gas-tax \ncontributions to the Highway Trust Fund to 91.5 percent in fiscal year \n2007 and to 92 percent in fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n  This bill will provide more than $1.123 billion annually to fund \ntransportation projects in Michigan, $239 million more per year than \nthe prior 6 year highway bill, and will create 61,500 new jobs across \nthe State.\n  Furthermore, the bill provides funding for a number of critical \nhighway related projects in Michigan. I am delighted to have helped to \nsecure significant additional funding for Michigan roads and highway \nrelated projects which will help make up for the fact that we are a \ndonor State.\n  For example, the bill provides $40.8 million to reconstruct and widen \nI-94 in Kalamazoo. The bill also provides $29 million for the Detroit \nRiverfront Conservancy to establish a West Riverfront walkway and \ngreenway along the Detroit River from Riverfront Towers to the \nAmbassador Bridge. It provides $12 million for the construction of a \nnew at-grade crossing and I-75 interchange in Gaylord to reconnect \nMilbocker and McCoy Roads and a new overpass to reconnect Van Tyle to \nSouth Wisconsin Road. It also provides $13.28 million to repave a \nportion of H-53 in Alger County.\n  The legislation we will pass today represents some progress in the \nongoing fight for equity for donor states. I will continue to fight in \nthe future, as I have in the past, until we are able to achieve full \nequity for Michigan. I recognize, however, that we have succeeded in \nreducing the inequity a little more in each reauthorization bill, and \nwe do so in this bill as well. I therefore will support this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will overwhelmingly \napprove the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU, H.R. 3. I support this \nimportant legislation as I have done when similar measures came before \nthe Senate last year and again in May. I believe it is a\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\ncritical step toward funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure \nand creating much needed jobs.\n  This process was not perfect. It took 12 short term extensions and \nnearly 2 years to complete this bill. The Senate funding level began at \n$318 billion 18 months ago and shrunk to $295 billion in May. The House \npassed its version, TEA-LU, at $284 billion. The President \nunfortunately, supported the lower House number. In fact, he threatened \nto veto any transportation bill that exceeded the $284 billion funding \nlevel. I am glad he changed his mind.\n  Reauthorization of TEA-21 is one of the most important job and \neconomic stimuli that the 109th Congress can pass. I am pleased that \nCongress has finally accomplished this elusive goal.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits of this \nlegislation for my home State of Illinois.\n  H.R. 3 would make the largest investment to date in our Nation's \naging infrastructure, $286.45 billion over the life of the bill. In \nshort, SAFETEA would increase the State of Illinois' total Federal \ntransportation dollars and provide greater flexibility. It would help \nimprove the condition of Illinois' roads and bridges, properly fund \nmass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviate traffic congestion, \nand address highway safety and the environment.\n  Illinois has the third largest Interstate system in the country; \nhowever, its roads and bridges are rated among the worst in the Nation. \nThe State can expect to receive more than $6.18 billion over the next 5 \nyears from the highway formula contained in the Senate bill. That is a \n33.34 percent increase or $1.545 billion over the last transportation \nbill.\n  With these additional funds, the Illinois Department of \nTransportation will be able to move forward on major reconstruction and \nrehabilitation projects throughout the State.\n  My Illinois colleague, Senator Obama, and I were able to add more \nthan $215 million for projects through the State. And we worked closely \nwith our House colleagues to support projects such as the Chicago \nrailroad initiative CREATE and the new Mississippi River bridge in St. \nClair County.\n  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan \narea as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate \ntraffic congestion, lessen air emissions, and provides access for \nthousands of Illinoisans everyday. Illinois would receive about $2.467 \nbillion under SAFETEA-LU, a 128 percent increase from TEA-21.\n  The transit section authorizes CTA and Metra projects as well as \nprovides funding for transit systems in Springfield, Rock Island, \nOttawa, and Rockford.\n  This legislation also preserves some important environmental and \nenhancement programs, including the Congestion Mitigation and Air \nQuality, CMAQ, program. CMAQ's goal is to help States meet their air \nquality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. \nThis legislation would increase funding for CMAQ by 7.5 percent.\n  With regard to highway safety, Illinois is one of 20 States that has \nenacted a primary seat belt law. H.R. 3 would enable the State of \nIllinois and other states who have passed primary seat belt laws to \nobtain Federal funds to implement this program and further improve \nhighway safety.\n  I know this legislation is not perfect. Congress should have stood up \nto the President and passed a bill with greater funding for highways \nand transit. Illinois' highway formula should be higher, and this bill \nshould have been finished 2 years ago. But thankfully we have reached \nthe end of this very long road. Thankfully, the State of Illinois will \nnot miss another construction season.\n  I would like to take a minute to thank Senator Obama for his work on \nthis bill. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand a conferee, he was able to ensure Illinois received its fair share \nof highway and transit funding. I was pleased to work with him and my \nHouse colleagues to deliver a transportation bill that will move our \nState forward and address critical highway, bridge, and transit needs.\n  With the passage of this legislation, Congress has upheld its \nobligation to reauthorize and improve our Nation's important \ntransportation programs. I am pleased to support SAFETEA-LU.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of the \nconference report for H.R. 3, SAFETEA-LU, the reauthorization of our \nFederal surface transportation programs. During my 42 years in the \nSenate, it has been the rare occasion when we pass a piece of \nlegislation that is guaranteed to save lives. But the safety provisions \nauthored by the Senate Commerce Committee in this transportation \nreauthorization bill will save thousands of lives, and prevent \nthousands of serious injuries, for generations.\n  I want to thank Chairman Stevens, Chairman Lott, Senators Pryor, \nRockefeller, Burns, Dorgan, Lautenberg, and Boxer of the Senate \nCommerce Committee for working so closely with me to develop a \nconsensus, bipartisan safety bill in the Senate. Likewise, Chairman \nYoung, Chairman Petri, Chairman Barton, and Ranking Members Oberstar, \nDeFazio, and Dingell from the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nand Energy and Commerce Committees for their efforts in merging our \nbills into a truly landmark conference report.\n  In crafting our bill and conference report, we have incorporated many \nof the administration's recommendations and provisions from our similar \neffort that passed the Senate last year covering auto, truck, rail \nsafety, and hazardous materials transportation safety. The bill also \nstrengthens consumer protections for those who entrust their belongings \nto a moving company, provides more robust, predictable funding for \nboating safety and sport fish restoration programs, and provides \nadditional financing options.\n  In the 1970s, we required that seatbelts be standard equipment in all \nautomobiles. We then followed in the 1980s with airbags and other \nsafety features. Now a new generation of technology has opened the door \nto even greater automobile safety. With Chairman Stevens and Senator \nLott, we undertook a bipartisan mission in the Commerce Committee to \nuse these new technologies to reduce injuries and save lives of \nautomobile drivers and passengers.\n  The development of electronic stability control by America's \nbrilliant engineers is the most promising vehicle safety technology of \nour generation. Rollovers represent one-third of all traffic safety \nfatalities, so our safety bill requires that electronic stability \ncontrol become standard equipment on all passenger cars and trucks in 5 \nyears. It is also cost effective since it uses existing anti-lock \nbrakes to correct the course of a vehicle before a potential rollover.\n  During a rollover, we need to keep occupants inside the car where \nthey are better protected. Therefore, the bill also requires stronger \ndoors and door locks. The third critical change is to mandate stronger \nroofs that are less likely to crush occupants during a rollover.\n  This highway safety bill goes even further: side-impact crash \nstandards that likely will result in side-curtain airbags in every \nautomobile; new rules to make 15-passenger vans subject to the same \nsafety tests as automobiles; a prohibition on sales of new 15-passenger \nvans to schools for use in carrying children; and new power-window \nswitches that will reduce strangulation deaths and injuries to \nchildren.\n  Cumulatively, these improved vehicle safety standards will save \nthousands of lives.\n  We also dramatically increase funding for programs to reduce drunk \ndriving and increase seatbelt use. I am especially proud that our bill \ngives States large incentives to crack down on hard-core drunk drivers, \nthose who have the audacity to drive drunk again after a prior \nconviction. We also provide $29 million annually for national \nadvertising and safety enforcement campaigns, which research data shows \nhas had a significant effect on saving lives. In other words, everyone \nwill see more commercials during the holidays about drunk driving and \nseatbelt use, and there will be more police on patrol during those \ntimes.\n  There is a final issue that is very important to me, highway safety \non Indian lands. While the rate of highway deaths and injuries has \ndeclined across the Nation, the death and injury rate on Indian lands \nhas actually increased.\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\nSince 1982, 65 percent of fatal crashes that occurred on Indian lands \nwere alcohol related. That compares to the national alcohol-related \ndeath rate of 47 percent of all fatal crashes.\n  The percentage of fatal crashes on Indian reservations that involves \na single vehicle is 26 percent higher than in the rest of the Nation. \nThese single-vehicle accidents are the most preventable, and where we \ncan save the most lives per dollar spent on traffic safety outreach and \nenforcement.\n  Therefore, from the funding pool for the basic safety grant in this \nbill, we more than doubled the proportion of basic safety grant money \nsent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. BIA distributes this money to \nIndian tribes that apply for funds to reduce drunk driving, increase \nseatbelt use, and enact other safety strategies. This was a provision \nin the original Senate bill, and we convinced our colleagues on the \nconference committee to include it in the final report. This extra \nfunding will make a tremendous difference in the lives of our Native \nAmericans, whose families suffer the tragedy of highway deaths more \nseverely than any other part of our country.\n  To improve the safety of trucks and buses operating on our Nation's \nroads, we have reauthorized the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration's safety programs FMCSA and strengthened their efforts \nto improve truck safety through strong enforcement and cooperation with \nthe trucking industry. The conference report also reauthorizes the \nMotor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, MCSAP, for the years 2006 \nthrough 2009 at an average annual funding level nearing $200 million, \nmore than double the TEA 21 level, and consistent with the \nadministration's proposal.\n\n  The conference report also provides $128 million over the life of the \nreauthorization to improve States' Commercial Driver's License programs \nand modernize the Commercial Driver's License Information System, \nCDLIS. The conference report updates the medical program for commercial \ndrivers by establishing a Medical Review Board to recommend standards \nfor the physical examinations of commercial drivers and a registry for \nqualified medical examiners to ensure medical examiners have received \nproper training.\n  The conference report also improves the maintenance and safety of \nintermodal truck chassis are the current Single State Registration \nSystem for truck registration, SSRS, with a new system that requires \ntruckers to only register in one State, while preserving State revenues \ncollected through the current system.\n  To improve the safety and security of the transportation of hazardous \nmaterials, the conference report reauthorizes the hazardous materials, \nHAZMAT, transportation safety programs at an average of $30 million \nannually, now administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials \nSafety Administration, PHMSA, for the first time in over 10 years.\n  The conference report provides $21,800,000 annually for community \nHAZMAT planning and training grants and allows States to use some of \ntheir planning money to training programs as needed. Additionally, the \nbill provides $4 million annually for HAZMAT ``train the trainer'' \ngrants, and allows these funds to be used to train HAZMAT employees \ndirectly.\n  The conference report also increases civil penalties to up to \n$100,000 for HAZMAT violations that result in severe injury or death \nand raises the minimum penalties for violations related to training. \nThe conference report requires Mexican and Canadian commercial motor \nvehicle operators transporting HAZMAT in the U.S. to undergo a \nbackground check similar to those for U.S. HAZMAT drivers.\n  Additionally, the conference report streamlines Federal \nresponsibilities for ensuring the safety of food shipment by \ntransferring primary responsibility of food transportation safety from \nthe Department of Transportation to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, which would set practices to be followed by shippers, \ncarriers, and others engaged in food transportation.\n  To provide greater protection to consumers entrusting their \nbelongings to a moving company, the conference report allows a state \nauthority that enforces State consumer protection laws and State \nattorney general to enforce Federal laws and regulations governing the \ntransportation of household goods in interstate commerce. Additionally, \nthe conference report imposes new penalties for fraudulent activities \nperpetrated by movers and imposes new registration requirements on \nhousehold goods carriers to protect consumers.\n  This conference report also reauthorizes activities funded by two of \nthe Nation's most effective ``user-pay, user-benefit'' programs--the \nsport fish restoration fund, administered by the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the recreational boating safety fund, administered by the \nU.S. Coast Guard. These programs constitute the ``Wallop-Breaux'' \nprogram, which is funded through the aquatic resources trust fund.\n  The reauthorization will allow continued funding of programs that \nbenefit boating safety, sportfish, and wetland restoration, as well as \nClean Vessel Act grants that help to keep our waterways clean. I am \npleased to report that this provision is supported by a large coalition \nof recreational and boating groups who are members of the American \nLeague of Anglers and Boaters.\n  The changes made include: (1) renaming the trust fund the sport fish \nrestoration and boating trust fund, and eliminating the separate \nboating safety account; (2) reauthorizing the marine sanitary devices \npump-out program, the Boating Infrastructure Grant Program, and \noutreach programs; and (3) funding most of the programs on a percentage \nbasis, which provides both simplicity and fairness. Conforming changes \nto the Internal Revenue Code are also included.\n  The growing popularity of recreational boating and fishing has \ncreated safety, environmental, and access needs that have been \nsuccessfully addressed by the Recreational Boating Safety and Sport \nFish Restoration Programs. The trust fund program reauthorizations and \nfunding adjustments contained in the conference report are important \nfor the safety of boaters, the continued enjoyment of fishermen, and \nimprovement of our coastal areas and waterways.\n  Finally, the conference report streamlines the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Loan \nProgram and increases the amount of loans for railroad infrastructure \nimprovements. The conference report creates a new program to fund the \nrelocation of rail lines and other projects that help alleviate \ncongestion, noise, and other impacts from railroads on communities and \nprovides additional funds for highspeed rail planning and development \nefforts.\n  As the title of this bill implies, increasing the safety of our \nhighways and surface transportation system is one of our Nation's top \npriorities, and I am proud to say that this conference report will \nbring us closer to the goal of having the safest transportation system \nin the world.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the highway \nbill conference report. I want to first applaud the chairman, my good \nfriend Senator Inhofe, for all of his hard work on this important \nlegislation. I also want to thank the ranking member of the EPW \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, for his work on the bill.\n  The highway bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation \nthat the Senate undertakes. This bill makes it possible to construct \nand repair vital transportation arteries that crisscross this great \nNation. As our country grows we must be conscious of our transportation \nneeds. Accordingly, this bill increases funding for road construction \nthat will substantially reduce traffic delays that plague the country. \nAdditionally, this bill substantially increases transit funding further \nreducing congestion and pollution caused by overpopulated highways.\n  This bill will provide roughly $1.76 billion in funding for New \nMexico over the next 5 years. The New Mexico projects that made it into \nthis bill will be instrumental in continuing our push for economic \ndevelopment. The money for Double Eagle II Airport will play heavily in \nmaking this new facility a leader in aircraft manufacturing. \nAdditionally, as our population continues to grow, the money for the \nextension of University Boulevard will allow this growing portion of \nAlbuquerque direct access to other parts of the city.\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\n  This bill also contains vital funding for the southern portion of New \nMexico. This bill contains $5 million for reconstruction of NM-176. \nThis road will be a key component in making the LES plant in Eunice a \nsuccess. Finally, this bill provides $7 million for reconstruction of \nthe I-10/I-25 interchange and $2 million for road work on I-10 itself.\n  This bill also increases funding for the Indian Roads Program. I have \nadvocated for increased Indian roads funding for a number of years and \nwhile this increase only begins to address the need, it will help \nimmensely in addressing the economic development problems facing Indian \nCountry.\n  Once again, I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking member of \nthe EPW Committee and their staff for doing a great job in getting this \nbill completed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, after nearly 3 years and countless \ntemporary extensions, the Senate is about to pass a monumental \ntransportation bill. We will provide over $286 billion that will create \nthousands of jobs and keep our transportation infrastructure healthy.\n  Getting to this point truly has been a work of dedication and \nperseverance. First, I thank Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords, from \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as Senator Bond, \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. \nThey provided excellent leadership and cooperation.\n  I sincerely thank their staffs many of whom spent sleepless nights \ngetting this done. In particular, I thank Ken Connolly, J.C. Sandberg, \nMalia Somerville, Alison Taylor, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Catharine Ransom, \nChris Miller, Malcolm Woolf, Carolyn Dupree, Thomas Ashley, Cara \nCookson, Andy Wheeler, Ruth Van Mark, James O'Keeffe, Nathan Richmond, \nAlex Herrgott, Angie Giancarlo, Greg Murrill, Heideh Shahmoradi, Ellen \nStein, John Stoody. They played an important role developing the \ntransit title in this bill.\n  I also thank my good friend Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, for his commitment to the transportation program.\n  Let me take a moment and speak about the hard work of the Finance \nCommittee staff. Getting the Tax Title done presented many challenges, \nnot the least of which was getting it paid for. The House bill simply \ndid not provide enough money for our highway infrastructure. The \nFinance Committee worked together tirelessly to find additional revenue \nto pay for it.\n  I want to thank some staff members in particular. I appreciate the \ncooperation we received from the Republican staff, especially Kolan \nDavis, Mark Prater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, and Nick Wyatt.\n  I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Senate \nLegislative Counsel for their service.\n  I also thank my staff for their tireless effort and dedication, \nincluding Russ Sullivan, Patrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Matt Jones, Ryan \nAbraham, and Wendy Carey. I also thank our dedicated fellows, Mary \nBaker, Jorlie Cruz, Cuong Huynh, Richard Litsey, Stuart Sirkin, and \nBrian Townsend.\n  I especially express my sincere gratitude to Kathy Ruffalo-\nFarnsworth. Her extraordinary efforts and contributions in keeping this \nbill together went over and above the call of duty. I hold her in the \nhighest esteem and can't thank her enough for her counsel and \nprofessionalism.\n  Finally, I thank our hard-working law clerks and interns: Katherine \nBitz, Drew Blewett, Adam Elkington, Julie Golder, Rob Grayson, Jacob \nKuipers, Heather O'Loughlin, Andrea Porter, Ashley Sparano, Julie \nStraus, Danny Shervin and Paul Turner.\n  This legislation really was a team effort. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate-House team that \nnegotiated the final transportation funding package, I want to commend \nMajority Leader Bill Frist for avoiding yet another stalemate and \nsteering this legislation toward final passage. The comprehensive \nhighway measure allocates $286.5 billion over 5 years to support \ninvestment in our Nation's highways and transit systems. Miles traveled \non Utah's roads has grown twice as fast as its population, but Federal \nfunding has remained flat. Now, Utah can plan for long-term projects, \nwhich in the past have been interrupted by numerous temporary \nextensions.\n  With the passage of the Transportation bill, Utah will receive \napproximately $1.8 billion to fund its multi-year highway and transit \nprojects. This highway bill will allocate close to $282 million each \nyear to invest in Utah's highways over the next 5 years. This is the \nmost Federal funding ever committed to Utah in a transportation bill \nand it is long overdue.\n  Utah is the crossroads of the West; every year millions of people \nvisit the Beehive State to enjoy its natural beauty and to invest in \nits growing economy. The highway bill provides a tremendous amount of \nFederal assistance for road improvements and transit projects across \nthe State, including: new I-15 interchanges in Ogden, Layton and Provo; \nlight-rail lines to the airport and South Jordan; highway projects on \nUS-6 in Carbon County and State Road 92 in Utah County; a railroad \noverpass in Kaysville; a pedestrian and bicycle access in Moab; a \nconnector from I-15 to the Provo Municipal Airport; improvements for \nthe Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge Access Road; the 3200 South \nProject in Nibley/Cache County; and building the Northern and Southern \nCorridors in St. George. There are, of course, many, many more projects \nthroughout the State that will receive funding that I do not have time \nto name here but that are equally as important.\n  The Utah Transit Authority, UTA, plans to bring commuter rail to Utah \nto ease congestion and help Utah commuters. I am pleased with the $200 \nmillion set-aside to begin construction on this important project, \nwhich plans to provide service from Ogden to Provo. This project will \ndo so much to relieve congestion and give Utahns a fast, comfortable, \nand efficient choice for transportation. Utah will also receive $30 \nmillion for its statewide bus and bus facilities for the purchase of \nbuses, upgrading existing buses, and for improving maintenance \nfacilities and storage yards.\n  At my urging as a Senate conferee to the Transportation bill, Utah \nState University was designated as a University Transportation Center. \nUSU will receive approximately $2 million over the next 5 years and \nwill greatly improve the statewide knowledge base and transportation \nresearch being done in Utah.\n  Mr. President, a few months ago, executives of Wavetronix, a traffic-\ndata collecting company based in Lindon, UT, asked for my help in \namending the Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure Program, ITIP. \nWavetronix sells sensors that detect speed and flow in highways for \npurposes of gathering information to determine real-time traffic data \nand would like to have access to ITIP funds. Unfortunately, since 1998, \na Pennsylvania-based company, Traffic.com, has had total control over \nhow and where to use Federal ITIP funds. Wavetronix and many others \nhave been shut out from receiving ITIP funds because of the closed \nnature of the program. One large company should not have a monopoly on \nthe funds provided for traffic data collection. We should benefit from \ninnovative solutions coming from small businesses in Utah and other \nStates, not funnel millions of dollars each year to a company that does \nnot have to compete for--the money.\n  In May, I included in the Senate highway bill language that gives \nqualified companies, including Wavetronix, the ability to compete for \nITIP funding. I am pleased that the conference report maintained the \nimportant language which provides a fair and level playing field for \nState DOTs and qualified private-sector companies wishing to access \nITIP funds, without requiring them to work with Traffic.com. This is a \nsignificant victory for Wavetronix and other similarly situated small \ncompanies across the Nation.\n  Finally, I want Utahns to know that the delegation worked very hard \nto include language in this bill to resolve the Legacy Parkway issue \nand perhaps save Utah hundreds of millions of dollars--and it came \nright down to the wire. We took this action after we received reports \nthat the negotiations involving the Utah State Legislature, UDOT, and \nthe Sierra Club, although promising, could not be implemented in a \ntimely fashion. So the delegation attempted to use this bill to bring \nthis longstanding battle to a close in a way that respected the \nenvironmental concerns that have been expressed. We\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\nworked day and night to design language that would allow this 14-mile \nhighway addition and at the same time alleviate the horrendous traffic \njams we have witnessed in northern Utah. In the end, the language was \nblocked. The people who have now cost the State of Utah what some \nestimate to be over $300 million made it impossible, with the help of a \nvery few allies in Congress, to get it through. In my estimation, this \nfight is not over. My goal is to save our State millions of additional \ndollars and get this highway done so the quality of life of those who \nwork south and live north of the project will be improved.\n  Despite my disappointment that this provision was not included in the \nfinal bill, I still believe this bill is one of the most important \npieces of legislation Congress will consider this year. This bill will \nhelp ensure the safety, efficiency, and mobility that every American \nexpects from their transportation system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, Congress is finally completing \nwork on a bill to reauthorize the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st century. This bill has been a long time coming and while it is 668 \ndays overdue, for Wisconsin it may have been worth the wait. I am \npleased that Wisconsin will now have a chance to address our State's \nvital transportation needs for the next year and plan its priorities \nfor the next 5 years. I am even more pleased that this conference \nreport builds on the precedent set under TEA-21, where Wisconsin, after \ndecades of not getting our fair share, finally started to receive at \nleast as much in highway funding as we pay to the Federal Government. \nDuring this summer travel season, the people of Wisconsin should be \nhappy to know that their tax dollars will be used to improve \nWisconsin's roads, bridges, trails, rails and transit system.\n  While the bill is not perfect, it goes a long way toward ending \nWisconsin's decades-long legacy as a donor State. Historically, \nWisconsin's taxpayers have received about 78 cents for every dollar we \nhave paid into the highway trust fund. As a result, we have lost more \nthan $625 million between 1956 and when TEA-21 was passed in 1998. \nUnder TEA-21, the previous 6-year highway authorization, Wisconsin \nreceived approximately 102 cents for every dollar it paid contributed \nto the highway trust fund through gasoline taxes. I was pleased to work \nwith the Wisconsin delegation to finally turn around decades of our \nState getting the short end of the stick, and am happy that we are now \nable to build upon that success. The conference report guarantees \nWisconsin an absolute dollar increase of over 30 percent, or about $165 \nmillion per year, over the last bill and improves our rate of return to \n106 cents per dollar paid in over the 5 years of the bill. This will \nhelp us make up for the decades where Wisconsin was instead on the \nlosing end of the highway funding equation.\n  I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin's delegation in achieving an even \ngreater measure of fairness for Wisconsin's taxpayers. Throughout this \nover 2-year process, I have worked closely with Senator Kohl and the \nentire House delegation to get the best possible treatment for \nWisconsin. The conference bill represents a great victory for \nWisconsin, largely due to this bipartisan bicameral cooperation. I \nwould like to give special thanks to those members of both bodies who \nhave worked in the trenches as conferees to craft this bill, especially \nCongressman Tom Petri, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nHighways, Transit and Pipelines. As one of the key conferees, he worked \ntirelessly over the past 2 years or more to come to this agreement and \nto ensure that Wisconsin was treated fairly.\n  While there are probably some projects in this large bill that may \nnot be priorities for their States or local communities, but instead \nwere proposed by special interests, I don't feel that this is the case \nfor Wisconsin. I worked closely with the Wisconsin Department of \nTransportation when I made requests for funding of specific projects to \nensure that they addressed Wisconsin's transportation priorities. I \nthink this was probably true for the entire Wisconsin delegation as \nwell, and I want to thank the State Department of Transportation for \nthis valuable advice and support. The projects I requested were chosen \nto meet a range of State and local needs and span the entire State from \nour urban areas, with the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee or East \nWashington Avenue in Madison, to suburban and rural areas like the \nStillwater Bridge linking St. Croix County to Minnesota, or the \nSturgeon Bay Bridge and State Highway 57 in Door County. These projects \nwill create jobs in Wisconsin, allow for the more efficient movement of \nmanufactured goods and agricultural products throughout the State, \nprovide access to Wisconsin's natural wonders to residents and \nvisitors, and in many cases make the roads safer for Wisconsin's \nfamilies as they go about their daily lives.\n  Finally, while attention has been focused on money for highways and \nbridges, this bill also includes funds for important safety \nimprovements, transit projects, recreational trails, boating programs \nand funds to give seniors and the disabled more mobility, to name a \nfew. I was proud to support many of these programs that were ultimately \nincluded in the bill. Having fought to secure funds for recreational \ntrails, senior transportation, and various transit projects from the \nstatewide bus funding to the Dane County's Transport 2020 and the \ncommuter rail extension through Kenosha, Racine and Milwaukee, I can \nattest that these are as important to many citizens in Wisconsin as the \nessential highways and bridges.\n  As I noted before, this bill is not perfect. I am concerned about \nsome of the environmental provisions in the bill, particularly those \nwith a potential impact on the Nation's air quality. The language \nmodifies current transportation regulations dealing with long-range \ntransportation planning and its impact on air quality. The current \nrules require that major new road projects must not contribute to \nviolations of air quality standards over a 20-year period. The \nconference report instead mandates that Clean Air Act conformity will \nbe considered over 10 years. The bill also contains environmental \nreview streamlining provisions that include tight review deadlines and \nconflict resolutions provisions. I agree with these measures in \nprinciple, but I am concerned that the articulated deadlines may not be \nrealistic.\n  On balance, my concerns about these provisions are not enough to \ncause me to oppose this bill that provides critical highway funds in a \nfair manner. I will vote for the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report that \naccompanied the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation \nEquity Act reauthorization bill. The Senate adopted this measure \nearlier today and I voted in support of it.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the principal Senate authors of \nthis important legislation: Senator Inhofe and Senator Jeffords of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee; Senator Shelby and Senator \nSarbanes of the Banking Committee; Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nof the Finance Committee; and Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye of the \nCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee. I commend them and \ntheir staffs for their hard work over these past 3 years in crafting \nthis legislation.\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues who served on the conference \ncommittee during these past 2 months. Reconciling legislative \ndifferences with the other body over a bill of this large, complex and \nimportant nature is no easy task; I appreciate all of their hard work.\n  The conference report that passed the Senate funds our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure at $286.4 billion between fiscal year \n2005 and fiscal year 2009. This includes all of our Interstate \nhighways, the National Highway System, secondary roadways, intercity \npassenger rail, local transit systems and transportation safety \nprograms. Taken together, these elements form one of the most essential \nfactors that determine the well-being of our country and our country's \nnational economy: ensuring the safe and efficient passage of people and \ngoods.\n  The conference report provided $233.8 billion for our Nation's \nroadways. Included in this amount was $25 billion for the maintenance \nand expansion of our Interstate highway system, $30.5 billion for the \nmaintenance and expansion of our larger National Highway\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\nSystem, $21.6 billion for the replacement of defunct or obsolete \nbridges, $32.5 billion for discretionary projects under the Surface \nTransportation Program and $5 billion for highway safety programs. Out \nof these funds the conference report provided my home State of \nConnecticut with nearly $2 billion between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal \nyear 2009--a 19 percent increase over the original authorization bill's \namount. Included in these resources were on average $51 million a year \nfor Interstate highway maintenance, $48 million a year for roads \nincluded in the National Highway System, $91 million a year for bridge \nreplacement, $61 million a year for large and small-scale road \nimprovement projects under the Surface Transportation Program and $7 \nmillion a year for highway safety programs. Beyond these resources the \nbill provided over $160 million for several dozen highway initiatives \nacross Connecticut. All of these initiatives, from the reconstruction \nof I-95, municipal streets and bridges to multi-use recreational \ntrails, stand to improve the quality of life in the communities and \nregions where they are taking place.\n  The conference report also provided $52.6 billion for our Nation's \ntransit systems. Out of these funds the report provided Connecticut--a \nState heavily- dependent on mass transit services--with nearly $485 \nmillion between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2009--a 33 percent \nincrease over the original authorization bill's amount. In addition to \nthese resources the report included nearly $150 million for local \ntransit agencies across Connecticut to improve their infrastructure and \nservices, thereby working to alleviate congestion that continues to \nplague my State's roadways.\n  Overall I believe that the resources provided in this conference \nreport will help improve our Nation's transportation infrastructure \nover the next 4 years. They will allow for critical maintenance and \ncapital improvement projects to go forward on our roadways; they will \nallow for dangerous overpasses to be replaced; they will allow for \ntransit systems to meet more efficiently the needs of their riders; and \nthey will allow for a greater degree of safety on our roads and rails. \nNevertheless, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to discuss \nsome of the shortcomings I see in this conference report--shortcomings \nthat, in my view, threaten to undermine the very goals this legislation \ntried to accomplish.\n  First, I do not believe that the level of investment provided in this \nconference report is fully adequate to meet the growing needs of our \ntransportation infrastructure. When the Senate originally debated this \nlegislation, I was pleased to support a bipartisan measure that \nprovided $295 billion between fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2009. \nThis funding level was considerably higher than the House level of $283 \nbillion and the Bush administration's original recommendation of $256 \nbillion.\n  Therefore, when the conference report was completed earlier this \nweek, I was disappointed to learn that the conference committee \nprovided $286.4 billion--a figure only marginally higher than the House \nfigure and significantly lower than the Senate figure. I have been told \nby the Connecticut Department of Transportation that this level of \ninvestment is barely adequate to keep pace with expected inflation over \nnext 4 years and wholly inadequate to meet the growing crises facing \nour transportation systems both in Connecticut and across the country.\n  Second, I remain concerned over how the levels of guaranteed funding \nfor highways and transit were determined in this conference report. \nEarlier this year, I strongly opposed a unilateral move by the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to reduce transit's share in the \nSenate bill from the previously-negotiated ratio of 18.82 percent to \n18.18 percent. Unfortunately, this new ratio prevailed in the Senate \nversion of the bill. In conference it was raised to 18.57 percent. \nWhile this conference agreement is higher than the Senate version's \nratio and higher than the ratio in the original authorization bill, it \nstill underfunds transit activities by $700 million compared to the \noriginal agreed-upon ratio in the Senate.\n  Highway and transit interests should not be working against each \nother. They should be working together. The best transportation systems \nin the world are those that feature a sound, safe, and efficient \nbalance between various modes of transportation. Disrupting that \nbalance by favoring one mode over another ultimately causes road \ncongestion, unreliable transit service, and higher transportation \ncosts--three problems that many parts of this country, including \nConnecticut, are experiencing today. If we are to overcome these \nproblems and support a balanced, safe, and efficient transportation \nnetwork in this country, then we must adequately and equally invest in \nall modes, whether they are highways, transit, airports, or seaways. We \nmust recognize that each mode is an important and integral part of a \nlarger transportation network.\n  From reviewing the funding allocations provided for both transit and \nhighways in this bill, it concerns me that inadequate resources are \ngoing to areas of the country, such as Connecticut, where the \ntransportation needs are the greatest. I find this rationale \ninconsistent with the way our national government usually addresses \nmatters of national significance that affect particular regions of our \ncountry. When a drought plagues a certain part of this country, we \nalways stand ready to provide drought relief to the affected States. \nWhen a hurricane slams into our coastline, we always stand ready to \nprovide emergency disaster relief to the affected States. When farmers \nare experiencing financial difficulty, we always stand ready to provide \nthem with vital subsidies. And when forest fires burn mercilessly over \nhundreds of square miles, we always stand ready to provide emergency \nassistance to the affected States. Why then, when key components of our \nnational transportation system are plagued by aging and obsolete \ninfrastructure, do we not seem to stand ready to provide adequate \nassistance to the most affected States?\n  A transportation system in crisis is more than a transportation \nproblem; it's an economic problem. Without a balanced, safe, and \nefficient transportation system, goods cannot be delivered to their \ndestinations in a timely manner, services cannot be rendered \nefficiently, and people cannot get to their jobs conveniently. Over \ntime, the environment worsens, the quality of life declines, and the \nregion suffers as a whole.\n  Today, the transportation system serving Connecticut and the \nsurrounding region is in need of assistance. In Connecticut alone, a \nrapidly aging infrastructure routinely causes significant disruptions \nto our transportation network--disruptions that have had a negative \nimpact on the region and country as a whole.\n  The busiest commuter rail line in the country is located in \nConnecticut. It runs over 70 miles between New Haven and New York \nCity--carrying over 33 million riders annually along our southwest \ncoast. Last year, a combination of cold weather and rapidly aging rail \ncars--many of which are a decade or more beyond their operational \nlifetimes--caused one-third of the line's fleet to be taken out of \nservice for emergency maintenance. In fact, about 37 percent of the \nfleet was taken out of service for most of last February--230 cars out \nof the 800-car fleet. Needless to say, this occurrence put an enormous \nstrain on thousands of commuters who rely on the service daily to get \nto and from work, travel to and from school, and to see their families.\n  The nation's seventh busiest highway is also located in Connecticut. \nOur segment of Interstate 95 is a major artery for commercial vehicles \nand other interstate traffic. In March of 2004, an accident caused an \noverpass in Bridgeport to collapse. While there were thankfully no \nfatalities, the accident did force the closure of Interstate 95 for 4 \ndays until a temporary overpass could be built. Needless to say, this \nclosure created enormous burdens on the already beleaguered highway and \ntransit systems in Connecticut, New York, and New England. It also \ncreated an adverse economic effect that was felt far beyond our region \nas people and goods were unable to reach their important destinations \non time.\n  These are the types of incidents that speak to an acute \ntransportation need in Connecticut and in our region of the country. \nThese are the types of incidents that should be considered closely when \nvital transportation resources are being allocated in a reauthorization \nbill. It is my hope that Congress in\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nfuture years will take these considerations more into account when \ndrafting transportation authorization measures. The problems facing my \nState and others will not go away on their own.\n  In closing I thank again the authors, managers and conferees of this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with them and all of my \ncolleagues on future initiatives that seek to ensure the long-term \nwell-being of our Nation's transportation system.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the U.S. Department \nof Transportation's disadvantaged business enterprise, DBE, program \ncontained within the surface transportation reauthorization bill. The \nDBE program is critical to providing equal opportunities to small \nbusinesses that are owned and controlled by minorities, women, and \nothers in our Nation who have been socially and economically \ndisadvantaged. I am pleased that Congress is committed to its \nreauthorization.\n  This important DBE program has been in existence since 1983. It was \ncreated to remedy the demonstrated history of discrimination that has \nexisted in our Nation against minority-owned small businesses. The \nprogram was amended in 1987 to include women-owned small businesses. In \n1998, Congress reauthorized the DBE program for both minorities and \nwomen, in light of an extensive record of hearings and evidence showing \nthe effects of discrimination on the ability of disadvantaged \nbusinesses to compete on an equal basis.\n  Although we have made progress as a Nation in the treatment of \nminorities and women, the evidence shows that discrimination endures. \nThe U.S. Department of Transportation has conducted 15 detailed \ndisparity studies since 1998 showing ongoing discrimination against \nbusinesses owned by these groups. The studies show a statistically \nsignificant disparity between the availability of minority and women-\nowned businesses in government contracting, and their utilization. \nCourts have consistently held that such evidence is strong evidence of \nunlawful discrimination and of the need for the continuation of the DBE \nprogram.\n  There is also ample anecdotal evidence showing that discrimination in \ncontracting still exists. Loretta Molter started her own business in \nFrankfort, IL, in 1987, and her business was recently named \nsubcontractor of the year by the Illinois Department of Transportation. \nBut in a letter that Ms. Molter wrote last year to the Women First \nNational Legislative Committee, she stated: ``Prime contractors tend to \ntake advantage of small minority or women businesses. . . . If the \ngoals were eliminated, general contractors would not use minority or \nwomen business owners. . . . There is a good ol boy's network, be it on \nthe golf course, on trips, or dinner/lunch meetings.''\n  And consider the words of Takyung Lee, an Asian-American owner of a \nsmall trucking company in Wauconda, IL. Lee submitted a statement to \nthe city of Chicago last year that discussed the disparate treatment \nfaced by Asian Americans in the trucking business: ``When we do get \njobs, we are targeted and harassed. Our drivers are stopped and checked \nfor identification when others are not. We have to show proof of \nhealth, welfare and pension payments when other companies get away with \nthese and other violations. . . . It seems that some people think an \nAsian American does not belong in the construction business. I have \nworked hard to prove them wrong but face discrimination and unfairness \nevery day. I wonder how much success I could have if I did not have to \nfight so hard against people who are prejudiced?''\n  It is unfortunate that Asian Americans, women, and other participants \nin the DBE program must ask themselves that painful question. We can \nhope for a day when we have a color-blind society and equality of \nopportunity, but that day is not yet here. The surface transportation \nreauthorization bill recognizes this reality and gives new life to a \nprogram that is trying to level the playing field for those who \ncontinue to be socially and economically disadvantaged in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is our final step to positively \nreaffirm our commitment to a strong and dedicated highway program, the \nsafety and soundness of its infrastructure, and the security of the \nNation's transportation network.\n  But in the process of pursuing and completing those goals, conferees \nhad to make many decisions. As chairman of the Finance Committee, at \nthe outset, I committed to several fundamental principles during this \nconference.\n  First, that the bill be paid for. Whatever we added to the trust fund \nshould not increase the deficit. If you look at the revenue table, \nprepared by Joint Tax, you will see that the new trust fund money \nraised by fuel fraud enforcement is raised in a deficit-neutral manner. \nThe tax-writing committees were fiscally responsible in our efforts to \ngrow the trust fund.\n  Second, highway taxes pay for highways. These are taxes that will be \ncollected regardless of whether or not we have a highway bill. They \ncan't be used for anything else. The tax provisions of the highway bill \naggressively focus on collecting all of the taxes due and owed to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  So we increase the size of the trust fund. Primarily, we do it by \nbeing tough on fraud. Some of this fraud is just plain old criminal \nactivity--but we have reason to believe that billions of our highway \ntax dollars are being stolen for a more sinister purpose, that being \nthe potential funding of terrorism. So we have the opportunity with \nthis legislation to not only shut down these thieves but to rightfully \ncollect all of our highway taxes to fully fund this bill. Under the \nSenate bill, several billion dollars will be added to the highway trust \nfund merely by moving jet fuel to the rack. Unfortunately, we can't \nkeep all of the untaxed jet fuel out of the diesel market unless all 50 \nStates move all of their fuel tax collection to the rack. But we can \ncollect billions that are currently stolen from both airport and \nhighway trust funds.\n  The third principle was to provide the highway trust fund with \nsufficient resources to serve America's highway needs. The additional \nresources the Finance Committee produced for the authorizers, I \nbelieve, enabled this deal to happen. Add up last year's FSC-ETI \nconference report changes and the trust fund gained $24 billion extra. \nThis year we have added another roughly $3 billion in additional \nreceipts for the trust fund. Without these additional resources, we \nwould have faced another case of legislative gridlock. Legislative \ngridlock wouldn't help the folks we represent who were facing gridlock \non their roads.\n  I would also like to mention two policy initiatives that do not \nrelate to the highway trust fund. The Senate carried into conference a \npackage of excise tax reforms and a transportation bond proposal.\n  The legislation before us also includes a number of excise tax \nreforms. These are small items, but important to the affected \ntaxpayers. For the most part, these provisions simplify various Federal \nexcise taxes.\n  I will note that these excise tax reforms do lose some revenue. It is \nroughly $1 billion over the 10-year period. When the highway bill came \nout of the Senate, these measures were offset with revenue raisers to \nmake them deficit neutral. The House did not accept the group of \nrevenue raisers we had allocated to these provisions. It should be \nnoted that the budget resolution provides $36 billion over 5 years for \ntax relief outside of reconciliation. So this relatively minor deficit \nimpact is accounted for in the budget.\n  Finally, I am pleased we were able to reach agreement on the Talent-\nWyden transportation infrastructure private activity bond proposal. \nSenators Talent and Wyden are to be commended for pursuing this \ninnovative concept. There will now be $15 billion in bond authority for \ntransportation projects.\n  We did hear some sharp criticisms of the heavy-lifting the Finance \nCommittee did to make this bill happen. We were told our offsets \nweren't real and that phony accounting occurred in the highway trust \nfund. I rebutted these charges during Senate floor debate. I said our \nprinciples would be honored in conference and they were. We got the job \ndone.\n  In the end, that is what counts: doing the peoples' business. The \nconferees achieved an important policy objective. The highway trust \nfund more accurately reflects the resources it receives from the \ntaxpayers who use our\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\nNation's roads. The resources will go into maintaining and improving \nAmerica's highway system. All of this will be accomplished in a \nfiscally responsible manner. That is what the folks back home should \nexpect. That is what we have done. That is what really matters. That is \nwhy the folks back home sent us here in the first place.\n  In conclusion, after great effort by many people, the Senate is \npoised to enacting legislation with the potential to impact all \nAmericans in every State. Crumbling infrastructure and poor \ntransportation choices impede our ability to live and do business, and \ntoday we are going to deliver legislation to the President's desk to \nstart solving these problems. Our conference agreement utilizes more \nthan $285 billion to ensure all Americans have access to efficient and \nreliable transportation as they go about their professional and \npersonal lives.\n  Among the many people whose hard work has made the difference, I must \nfirst thank the chairmen and ranking members of all the appropriating \ncommittees that have been involved in this process.\n  Credit must also go to all members of my staff, who spent many hours \nsifting through the nuts and bolts of this bill. Kolan Davis, Mark \nPrater, Elizabeth Paris, Christy Mistr, Sherry Kuntz, John Good, and \nNick Wyatt showed great dedication to the tasks before them.\n  As is usually the case, the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his \nstaff was imperative. I particularly want to thank Russ Sullivan, \nPatrick Heck, Bill Dauster, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth, Matt Jones, and \nRyan Abraham.\n  I also want to mention George K. Yin, the chief of staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and his staff, especially the fuel fraud team of \nTom Barthold, Deirdre James, Roger Colinvaux, and Allen Littman as well \nas the always invaluable assistance of Mark Mathiesen, Jim Fransen, and \nMark McGunagle of Senate Legislative Counsel.\n  This conference agreement is infused with the spirit of bipartisan \nand bicameral cooperation. Hopefully, that spirit will be influential \nto the entire ongoing legislative process.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today the Senate is taking the final \nstep in a very long, and at times frustrating but overall rewarding \nprocess to address our national transportation needs. It has been 22 \nmonths since TEA-21 expired on September 30, 2003. The Federal-aid \nprogram has since been operating under a number of short-term \nextensions--a total of 11 to date. I urge the Senate to approve the \nconference report before us so that our States can start working on \naddressing their transportation needs.\n  Both sides of the aisle in the Senate and House embraced a spirit of \nbipartisanship and collaboration that has delivered a quality piece of \nlegislation. As in all legislative endeavors there has been much give \nand take. There are provisions in this bill for which I would have \npreferred another outcome, but on the whole, I believe we have produced \na product that will continue the good work started in ISTEA and \nimproved upon in TEA-21.\n  The conference report provides $244 billion in guaranteed spending \nover the 2005-2009 period for our Nation's highways and mass transit \nsystems. If you include 2004, the bill provides $286.5 billion in \nguaranteed spending--an almost $90 billion increase over TEA-21. \nFinally, the highway program is guaranteed $193 billion over the 2005-\n2009 period.\n\n  We worked very hard with our House colleagues to balance the needs of \ndonor and donee States. I will be the first to acknowledge that this \nbalance--as with any compromise--is not perfect. My colleagues \nrepresenting donee and donor States that receive lower rates of return \nor growth rates than they feel fair have made this fact very clear to \nme.\n  I am very sympathetic to the concerns of both donors and donees in \nthis situation. Both have significant transportation needs that cannot \nbe ignored. Addressing their concerns was even more difficult because \nwe had very limited dollars to solve either group's issues.\n  SAFETEA-LU tries to split the difference. Donee States have an \naverage rate of growth of 19 percent above their TEA-21 levels, and \ndonor States will reach a 92 percent rate of return by 2008. Also, if \nthere is a positive revenue aligned budget authority in 2007, it will \nbe directed to improve donor States rate of return.\n\n  One concern of my donor State colleagues when we were on the floor \nwas that not all donor States were treated equally--that concern has \nbeen addressed.\n  Over the 6 years under TEA-21, we made great progress in preserving \nand improving the overall physical condition and operation of our \ntransportation system; however, more needs to be done. A safe, \neffective transportation system is the foundation of our economy. We \nare past due to fulfill an obligation to this country and the American \npeople--the conference report before us does just that.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge all the staff time and effort \nthat has gone into the bill. Specifically, I would like to single out \nmy highway team: again, Ruth Van Mark and James O'Keeffe, Andrew \nWheeler, Marty Hall, Nathan Richmond, Greg Murrill, Angie Giancarlo, \nAlex Herrgott, and Rudy Kapichak.\n  From Senator Bond's staff: Ellen Stein, Heideh Shahmoradi, John \nStoody, and Julie Daman.\n  From Senator Jefford's staff: JC Sandberg, Malia Somerville, Ken \nConnolly, Cara Cookson, Chris Miller, and Jo-Ellen Darcy.\n  From Senator Baucus's staff: Kathy Ruffalo.\n  From Senator Frist's staff: Libby Jarvis, Sharon Soderstrom, and Erik \nUeland.\n  From the Federal Highway Administration: Today is Administrator Mary \nPeters last day before she heads back to Arizona. It is very \nappropriate that we finish the bill on her last day, because without \nthe hard work of Mary and her staff at FHWA, we would not be here \ntoday.\n  On Mary's staff I want to especially thank Susan Binder, Carolyn \nEdwards and Ross Crichton, who over the last 3 years have done more \nthan 1600 formula runs. We really appreciate all of your hard work.\n  Also, I want to personally thank the hard working attorneys in the \nSenate Legislative Counsel office. In particular, Darci Chan, Heather \nArpin and Gary Endicott.\n  Finally, Rachel Milberg with CBO has done great work in assisting \nstaff work through the complicated scoring process.\n  I am certain my colleagues share my strong desire to get a \ntransportation reauthorization bill passed and urge them to support the \nbill before the Senate today.\n  Let me say I do have a great deal of respect for both of my \ncolleagues from Arizona. However, I will put them on my doubtful list. \nBut I would say this and I will be very brief. We only have 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes on each side. I want to make sure that Senator Bond, with whom \nI have worked as chairman of the Subcommittee of Transportation, and a \nfew others get their time.\n  Working with Senator Jeffords and Senator Baucus and Senator Bond has \nbeen a great experience. We have worked very well together. This has \nbeen difficult. We have worked for 2 years on this bill. It is not \neasy. I would only say this: It is paid for. It didn't increase taxes. \nIt is within the President's parameters.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President,\n  I rise in strong support of the conference agreement on the \ntransportation reauthorization measure. This legislation authorizes \nmore than $286 billion--more than an $80 billion increase over TEA-21--\nin funding over the 6 years for maintaining and improving our Nation's \nand State's highways, bridges and transit systems. This is one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that we have considered this year \nand its enactment will help to restore the Federal commitment to our \nsurface transportation infrastructure--the lifeblood for our economy as \nwell as our quality of life.\n  As the ranking member on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs Committee which crafted the transit portion of this \nlegislation, I am proud that the agreement continues our commitment to \na national transit\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\nprogram and builds on the important achievements we made in the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, of 1991, and \nTEA-21, enacted in 1998.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Shelby of the full \ncommittee for his efforts on the balanced budget amendment of the \ntransit title and to Senators Allard and Reed, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Housing and Transportation Subcommittee, for their hard \nwork as well.\n  This legislation increase overall transit funding by 45 percent over \nthe levels provided in the past 6 years to meet the growing needs for \npublic transit infrastructure in all regions of the country. It \nprovides the resources and planning tools to help ensure the continued \ndevelopment of an advanced, integrated transit system--a system that \nwill cut air pollution, conserve fuel and reduce congestion on our \nroadways. This measure will go a long way to meeting the growing demand \nfor transit in cities, towns, rural areas, and suburban jurisdictions \nacross the country.\n  I am particularly pleased that the legislation includes two key \nprovisions which I sponsored, the Transit in Parks Act, or TRIP, and an \nexpansion of the commuter benefits program to encourage greater mass \ntransit use by Federal employees in the National Capital Area. The new \nFederal transit grant initiative known as TRIP will support the \ndevelopment of alternative transportation services--everything from \nrail or clean fuel bus projects to pedestrian and bike paths, or park \nwaterway access--within or adjacent to national parks and other public \nlands. It will give our Federal land management agencies important new \ntools to improve both preservation and access. Just as we have found in \nmetropolitan areas, transit is essential to moving large numbers of \npeople in our national parks--quickly, efficiently, at low cost, and \nwithout adverse impact.\n  The expansion of the commuter benefits program will allow thousands \nmore federal employees to take advantage of a guaranteed tax-free \nfinancial incentive of up to $105 per month, paid by their employer, \ntowards the costs of transit commuting. It will give employees more \nchoice in their commuting options and provide an additional incentive \nto move off our congested roadways and onto public transit. In \naddition, Federal agencies will be permitted to offer shuttle services \nfor their employees to a public transit facility. This is particularly \nimportant to employees of the Food and Drug Administration who will be \nrelocating to the new FDA headquarters at White Oak, MD.\n  Maryland's formula share of transit funding will grow by nearly $275 \nmillion over the 6 years--from $571 million to $846 million. These \nfunds are absolutely critical to Maryland's efforts to maintain and \nupgrade the Baltimore and Washington Metro systems, the MARC commuter \nrail system serving Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Frederick and \nBrunswick, the Baltimore Light Rail system, and bus systems and para-\ntransit systems for elderly and disabled people throughout Maryland.\n  This bill advances important existing and planned new transit \nprojects in the Baltimore and Washington Metropolitan areas as well as \nin growing regions of our State. In the Washington area, it provides \n$100 million to enable the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \nAuthority, WMATA to purchase 52 new rail cars to help alleviate the \nsevere overcrowding that the Metrorail system is currently \nexperiencing. The new cars will enable WMATA to lengthen trains from 6 \ncars to 8 cars on the Metrorail System, utilize more of its design \ncapacity, and give the authority increased ability to assist in case of \nan emergency. It provides $21 million to enable Montgomery County to \ncomplete the Silver Spring Transit Center--a major new transportation \nhub connecting MARC commuter trains, the Metrorail system, Ride-on and \nMetro buses and taxi services that is designed for integrated, mixed \nuse private transit-oriented development. The Silver Spring Transit \nCenter will not only enhance regional mobility, but will also help to \npromote smart growth and continue to strengthen the remarkable \nrevitalization in Silver Spring's downtown business district. The \nmeasure also authorizes two new transit projects to help relieve \ntraffic congestion and improve mobility in the region--the Bi-County \nTransitway, otherwise known as the Purple Line, connecting Bethesda to \nSilver Spring and extending to New Carrollton, and the Corridor Cities \nTransitway connecting the high-tech employment centers and mix-use \ndevelopments in the 1-270 corridor to the Washington Metro and MARC \nCommuter rail.\n  In the Baltimore area, the measure authorizes $105.3 million for \nplanning, environmental study, right of way, and initial construction \nof the Red and Green Line Transit projects as proposed in the Baltimore \nRegion Transit System Plan. The Red Line--an East-West Transit Line \nthat will extend for approximately 11 miles from the Social Security \nAdministration Headquarters in Woodlawn to Fells Point--will provide \nservice to areas in Baltimore currently not served by high quality \ntransit. The Green Line would extend from the existing Metro system at \nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital for approximately 5 miles northeast to \nMorgan State University. This authorization will guarantee that these \nprojects continue to move forward in a timely fashion over the next 5 \nyears. The measure also authorized the final $12.5 million in Federal \nfunds needed to complete the double tracking of the Baltimore Light \nRail Project and provides $5.2 million to enhance the Baltimore water \ntaxi system.\n\n  And statewide, the bill authorizes continued funding for the MARC \nCapacity Expansion Program to enable the Maryland Department of \nTransportation to make needed capacity improvements, purchase new \nrolling stock, and enhance the MARC system. The bill also provides $25 \nmillion in statewide bus and bus facility grants that benefit towns and \ncities throughout the State. The measure also includes a provision \nreauthorizing the National Transportation Center, NTC, at Morgan State \nUniversity over the next 4 years. The NTC conducts important research, \neducation and technology transfer activities that support workforce \ndevelopment of minorities and women, and addresses urban transportation \nproblems. Morgan State will receive $1 million each year to continue \nthose activities.\n  For our Nation's roadways and bridges, this legislation authorizes \nnearly $184 billion in funding to enable States and localities to make \ndesperately needed repairs and improvements. The measure preserves the \ndedicated funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, \nProgram which helps States and local governments improve air quality in \nnon-attainment areas under the Clean Air Act; the Transportation \nenhancement set-aside provisions which support bicycle and pedestrian \nfacilities and other community based projects, as well as the other \ncore programs--Interstate maintenance, National Highway System, Bridge \nand the Surface Transportation Program. Likewise, ISTEA's and TEA-21's \nbasic principles of flexibility, intermodalism, strategic \ninfrastructure investment, commitment to safety and inclusive decision-\nmaking processes are retained.\n  Maryland's share of highway funding will grow from an average of $443 \nmillion a year to $583 million a year or an average of $140 million \nmore each year than was provided under TEA-21 for a total of more than \n$2.9 billion over 5 years. The measure provides funding for a number of \nimportant transportation improvement projects through all regions of \nour State. Senator Mikulski and I placed a high priority in this \nmeasure of ensuring that Maryland is ``BRAC'' ready as it prepares to \nhandle an influx of new people in areas surrounding many of Maryland's \nmilitary installations. In this regard, the measure provides $12.5 \nmillion to make sorely needed access improvements to MD 175 in the \nvicinity of Fort Meade, nearly $10 million for upgrading the US 40, MD \n715 interchange at Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Edgewood Train \nStation, $15 million for construction of MD Route 4 at Suitland \nParkway--an important access way to Andrews Air Force Base--and $6 \nmillion to design improvements to MD 210--a major regional commuting \ncorridor that provides access to the Indian Head Naval Base in Charles \nCounty. The measure also provides $12 million for planning and \nconstruction of the Southern Maryland Commuter Initiative, a program of \nimprovements in\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\nSouthern Maryland to relieve congestion by enhancing peak-period \ntransit services for commuters, including individuals commuting to \nmilitary bases in Southern Maryland. And it provides over $1.5 million \nfor intermodal improvements at the Edgewood and Odenton MARC stations.\n  We also placed a premium on addressing those areas of Maryland that \nhave experienced particularly severe congestion, bottlenecks or safety \nproblems and provided more than $31 million to upgrade MD Route 404 and \nUS 113 on the Eastern Shore, nearly $30 million to continue \nimprovements to 1-70 in Frederick and to initiate upgrades of US 220 \nSouth of Cumberland in Western Maryland, $27 million for upgrades to MD \n5 in Southern Maryland, and more than $22 million for roadway, \ninterchange and bridge improvements in the Baltimore metroplitan area\n\n  We provided funds for several community-based projects around \nMaryland designed to expand travel choices and enhance the \ntransportation experience of our citizens by improving the cultural, \nhistoric, aesthetic and environmental aspects of our transportation \ninfrastructure, including funding to complete the Allegheny Highlands \nTrail in Western Maryland, the Fort McHenry and Assateague Visitors \nCenters, the Baltimore water-taxi system, and the roads and trails at \nPatuxent and Blackwater Refuges.\n  Before I close, I want to take a moment to note the hard work of the \nstaff involved with this bill. This legislation has been years in the \nmaking and while it represents the efforts of many individuals there \nare several whom I would like to especially recognize. First, let me \nthank the staff of Banking Committee Chairman Shelby, particularly \nSherry Little and John East, as well as Tewana Wilkerson of Senator \nAllard's staff, for their hard work and dedication to the transit \nprogram. Also, as I noted earlier, Senator Reed has worked closely with \nme throughout this process and I want to thank Neil Campbell of his \nstaff for his significant contributions to this bill. On my own staff, \nI want to recognize Sarah Kline, Aaron Klein, and Charlie Stek for \ntheir tireless work and for their commitment to helping the people of \nMaryland. Kate Mattice, on detail from the Federal Transit \nAdministration to my office last year, also made an important \ncontribution to this legislation. Finally, I would like to extend \nparticular thanks to Richard Steinmann for the exceptional assistance \nhe has provided to the Banking Committee over the past 2 years while he \nhas been on detail from the Federal Transit Administration.\n  Like any other complex and comprehensive piece of legislation, this \nbill has its share of imperfections. I think it was unfortunate that \nthe administration was unwilling to snpport a higher level of \ninvestment in these programs, and as a result the measure that emerged \nfrom the conference is billions of dollars less than what the Senate \npassed a few months ago. And I am particularly disappointed that the \nmeasure does not contain the stormwater runoff mitigation provision \nthat was approved by the Senate and is so important to helping States \nand localities meet water quality standards stemming from the \nstormwater impacts of Federal aid highways. But if we are to ensure not \nonly the safe and efficient movement of people, goods and services, but \nalso the future competitiveness and productivity of our economy, we \nmust make these investments, and move forward with this legislation. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in approving this measure.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, as we prepare to give the final \napproval to the highway bill conference report I would like to thank \nChairman Inhofe and Senators Bond and Baucus and all of the Senators \nand staff who have helped to move this bill forward.\n  The bill we are about to vote on is good for the Nation.\n  This bill will save lives by making our roads safer.\n  This bill will reduce traffic congestion by making our roads and \nbridges more efficient.\n  This bill will boost local economies by creating hundreds of \nthousands of jobs across the Nation.\n  It may have taken us 3 long years to get here, but the impact of this \nbill will be felt for decades to come.\n  This bill will affect every American in some way.\n  This bill provides the biggest investment in our roads, highways, \nbridges and transit systems in our nation's history.\n  Once again I thank Chairman Inhofe and all the members of the EPW \nCommittee for their work.\n  Madam President, I would like to take one brief moment to thank the \nstaff who have worked so hard to help craft this highway bill.\n  On my staff I would like to thank my staff director, Ken Connolly; \nJ.C. Sandberg, Alison Taylor, Malia Somerville, Cara Cookson, Catherine \nCyr Ransom, Chris Miller, Mary-Francis Repko, Geoff Brown and Jeff \nMunger.\n  From Senator Baucus's staff, Kathy Ruffalo-Farnsworth;\n  From Senator Inhofe's staff, Ruth Van Mark, Andy Wheeler and James \nO'Keefe;\n  And from Senator Bond's staff, Ellen Stein.\n  These Congressional staffers have made extraordinary personal \nsacrifices to move this massive legislation along for over 3 years, and \nI would like to express my personal gratitude for their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time on this side. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank Senator Jeffords for the great working \nrelationship.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding we have 6 \nminutes. I would like to yield 2 minutes each to three Senators, three \nof the hard workers on this bill. I did forget to mention Senator \nGrassley, who was so helpful. I would like to recognize Senators Bond, \nLott, and Shelby for 2 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it has been a long road to get here on \nSAFETEA, and I am pleased to be here. I thank Chairman Inhofe, Senators \nJeffords and Baucus, with a special thank you to my staff: Ellen Stein, \nJohn Stoody, and Heideh Shahmoradi; Senator Inhofe's staff, Senator \nJeffords' staff, Senator Baucus's staff, the help of Senate legal \ncounsel, employees of FHWA, who ran 1661 runs, Ross Crichton, Susan \nBinder, and Carolyn Edwards, and the staffs of the Banking, Finance, \nCommerce, and Budget Committees.\n  I might inform my colleagues from Arizona, this includes highways and \nbridges, mass transit, safety, and other items. I thank particularly my \ncolleague from Arizona for mentioning a bridge across the Mississippi \nRiver. We have the largest truck traffic in the Nation coming east and \nwest on Highway 70, the eastern edge of Missouri. If they do not have a \nbridge, they do not get to Illinois. That is one point people from \ndrier States perhaps do not understand.\n  This bill is one characterized by equity, by safety. Environmental \nissues are addressed by getting environmental input early on and giving \nthem an opportunity to resolve the problems before money is wasted. It \nbrings the stakeholders to the table earlier. Under the CMAQ \nprovisions, we allow in six States the use of clean-burning biodiesel \nfuel.\n  My colleagues and staff have worked tremendously hard in moving this \nbill over the last 2\\1/2\\ years and I want to highlight some of the key \nelements of this bill that I am proud of.\n  H.R. 3 achieves several major goals:\n  First, equity--this bill carefully balances the needs of the donor \nStates while recognizing the needs of the donee States.\n  There are many sections in this bill that I am proud of supporting, \nsuch as the fact that all donor States will receive an equitable \nincrease to, at the minimum, a 92 percent rate of return by fiscal year \n2008.\n  The average rate of growth among States is 30.32 percent and all \nStates will grow at not less than 117 percent over what they received \nin TEA-21 starting in 2005 ramping up to 121 percent by 2009.\n  I, along with Chairman Inhofe, both Senators Baucus and Jeffords, and \nour partners on the House side have worked diligently in trying to \nensure that the bill remain fair and equitable among all States.\n  There are many States that continue to fall under the $1.00 rate of \nreturn, I am one of them. Due to the budgetary\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nconstraints as well as balancing the needs of both the donor States \nwith the needs of the donee States, we were unable to achieve any \nbetter.\n  Another key component of this bill is safety. This bill goes a long \nway to saving lives by providing funds to States to address safety \nneeds at hazardous locations, sections, and elements.\n  Safety in this authorization is for the first time given a prominent \nposition, being elevated to a core program.\n  Inadequate roads not only lead to congestion, they also kill people. \nWe average more than three deaths a day in Missouri and I think that a \nlarge number of these deaths can be attributable to inadequate \ninfrastructure.\n  Nearly 43,000 people were killed on our roads and highways last year \nalone. I am glad that the bill reflects the continued commitment to \nmaking not only investments in our infrastructure, but also to the \ngeneral safety and welfare of our constituents.\n  I am hopeful that the level of funding provided toward the safety \nprogram and other core programs is a sufficient amount to address the \ngrowing needs of all states.\n  The passage of this bill comes at a very critical time, especially \nfor my home State of Missouri. We have some of the worst roads in the \nNation, with over 50 percent of its major roads in poor or mediocre \ncondition, requiring immediate repair or reconstruction.\n  Environmental issues are also addressed, such as to ease the \ntransition under the new air quality standards, the conformity process \nis better aligned with air quality planning, as well as streamlining \nthe project delivery process by providing the necessary tools to reduce \nor eliminate unnecessary delays during the environmental review stage.\n  Another accomplishment of our package ensures transportation projects \nare built more quickly by bringing environmental stakeholders to the \ntable sooner. Environmental issues will be raised earlier and the \npublic will have better opportunities to shape projects. Projects more \nsensitive to environmental concerns will move through a more structured \nenvironmental review process more efficiently and with fewer delays.\n  This bill also ensures that transportation projects will not make air \nworse in areas with poor air quality, while giving local transportation \nplanners more tools and elbow room to meet their Federal air quality \nresponsibilities. Transportation planning will be on a regular 4-year \ncycle, require air quality checks for projects large enough to be \nregionally significant and reduce current barriers local official face \nin adopting projects that improve air quality.\n  Another accomplishment in the bill is allowing local areas to spend \ncongestion, mitigation and air quality funds on the purchase of \nbiodiesel fuel. Soybean based biodiesel provides another market for \nmidwestern, including Missouri, farmers. The clean burning fuel reduces \nsmog forming ozone, soot and hazardous air pollutants. Homegrown \nbiodiesel also decreases our dependence on foreign oil. It's a win for \nthe environment, energy security and farmers.\n  Lastly, jobs. We have all heard the statistics and this bill \nundoubtedly will create jobs.\n  The comprehensive package here before the Senate today is the key to \naddressing our Nation's needs in infrastructure development and \nimprovement. I am hopeful that other Members of the Senate agree and \npass this bill so our State transportation departments can get back in \nthe business of letting contracts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport.\n  I am in support of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3, the \nsurface transportation reauthorization bill. This is a bill, that \nSenator Sarbanes and I have been working on in the Banking Committee \nfor over 3 years now, and I look forward to seeing it signed into law.\n  It has taken 12 extensions of TEA-21 to reach agreement on this bill. \nIt is time to get this bill completed and furnish States with resources \nfor needed transportation infrastructure and implement these important \npolicy improvements.\n  The transportation bill has many important components which I am \nproud to stand here today and support. I am especially proud of Title \n3, the Public Transportation Title. I extend my personal thanks to \nSenator Sarbanes, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, for all \nthe work he has done to help craft our committee's approach to \nstrengthening public transportation, both in terms of funding and \npolicy.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Allard and Senator Reed, chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, \nand Senator Johnson who also served as a conferee. This bill was truly \na bipartisan, collaborative effort. I am very proud of what we have \nbeen able to accomplish.\n  In this bill, we have increased the ability of States to use money \nflexibly. We made new and innovative technology, like bus rapid \ntransit, eligible for significant Federal investment for the first \ntime. This is a promising new cost-effective approach to transportation \nthat has real promise in this country. Also, we increased \naccountability for the Federal investment in public transportation \nthrough several new mechanisms. A contractor performance assessment \nreport will provide real data on transit industry performance and will \nenable transit agencies to have an opportunity to assess the quality of \ncost and ridership estimates for their high-dollar investments.\n  I am a big believer in positive reinforcement and I included several \nprovisions in the bill to reward transit agencies for delivering \nprojects that are on-time and on budget. One of those provisions will, \nfor the first time, allow transit agencies an opportunity to keep a \nportion of their under-run in new starts projects or would give them \nthe chance for a more generous share if they deliver the projects they \npromise to their communities.\n  Another accomplishment here of which I proud is the extent to which \nwe have been able to extend the benefits of public transportation to \nsome of the people who need it most, for example, in rural areas. For \nmany years, the prevailing view--a wrong view in my mind--was that \npublic transportation was only valuable in very urbanized cities.\n  In some rural parts of our country, long distances separate people \nfrom critical infrastructure. Many of these people are elderly or do \nnot have access to a car. Connecting these people to critical \ninfrastructure is one of the most valuable services public \ntransportation can provide.\n  These are just a few of the several important advancements this bill \nmakes over current law. This is a bill I am proud of and I want to \nacknowledge some people who have been critical to putting this bill \ntogether and making it a successful piece of legislation with broad \nbipartisan support.\n  Me and my staff were very lucky to have one of the best resources \nthat the Banking Committee could have during this process. The Federal \nTransit Administration loaned the committee one of their finest people: \nRich Steinmann. Rich is an extremely knowledgeable, competent \nprofessional and his experience is widely respected on both sides of \nthe aisle and in both chambers of the Congress. We are indebted to him \nfor his time and work on this bill. Additionally, I want to thank \nSherry Little and John East of the Banking Committee staff. I think \neveryone would agree that this was a tough process on members and staff \nalike. Finally, I want to thank some additional staff who had a \ncritical role in putting this challenging bill together: Sarah Kline, \nAaron Klein, Tewana Wilkerson, and Neil Campbell. Thank you for your \nwork on this.\n  I am proud of this bill and I look forward to seeing it signed into \nlaw.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, as a member of the conference, I thank the \nleadership and the job they have done. The process has not been easy. \nIt has been long and not always pretty, but we produced a bill with \nmore jobs, safety, and opportunity for all American people. I am very \nproud of it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the chairman to dispense as he \nsees fit.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield back the remainder of my time and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. The next vote is on the highway conference reported bill, \nthe last of the evening, the 11th rollcall of the day and the last vote \nbefore the August break. I thank all of our colleagues for their \npatience and efforts. We have been very busy, very productive the last \nseveral weeks. We can all, in a bipartisan way, be proud of what we \nhave accomplished.\n  We will return for business on Tuesday, September 6th, with a vote \nthat day sometime around 5:30. That is Tuesday, September 6th. I wish \neveryone a safe break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today before we leave on this \nrecess to tell the Senate and those interested in how we do the \npeople's business, what a successful 6 months we have had in the \nSenate. I have been here a long time. I believe this first 6 months has \nbeen like a great marathon runner. We started off slow and crossed the \nfinish line a winner.\n  About 4 hours ago, we passed the first comprehensive Energy bill in \nabout 14 years. We have been trying for 6 years, and now it is done. \nThe Senate did that in a bipartisan way, and we worked with the House \nand got a great policy for our Nation.\n  A few moments ago, we passed a comprehensive Transportation bill for \nall of our States and our people, and regardless of what is said about \nit, in meticulous detail it is a terrific jobs package and \ninfrastructure building bill for America.\n  In addition, I submit that we have also accomplished some things we \nnever were able to do: we enacted a bankruptcy reform act. I know \npeople wonder why that is important, but we will not talk about why. \nLet's just say credit is the lifeblood of our Nation. If something is \nwrong with the credit system, you have to fix it. We have been waiting \naround to fix the bankruptcy law, which is an integral part of the \ncredit system, for at least 5 years. We passed the bill about three \ntimes in the Senate and, yes, in this particular 6 months, we did that. \nWe sent it to the House and it is a law.\n  The budget resolution, I did them for years--let's be honest, for 31 \nyears. This new Senator produced, under our leader's leadership, the \nfifth fastest budget resolution, and he got it in on time.\n  The emergency supplemental was as big as many appropriations bills, \ngigantic--for Iraq, the tsunami, and we provided real help for the \nborders of our country. Five-hundred new Border Patrol people were in \nthat bill, along with other things.\n  We included, since then, in an Interior appropriations bill, which \nalso passed, veterans funding of $1.5 billion.\n  Let me go on with the list. After the emergency supplemental, we did \nsix judges who had been filibustered for months upon months.\n  We did CAFTA. That is the last of a long list of American free-trade \nagreements. This one, for a change, went our way. It was taking off \ntariffs that were imposed mostly on us, instead of the other way \naround.\n  Now, 5 of the 12 appropriations bills have passed. All of the \nappropriations bills have been reported out of committee, except one. I \ndidn't check the history, but I think that is close to a record.\n  We confirmed the Secretaries of State, Justice and Homeland Security. \nWe confirmed the Director of National Intelligence. That is the \nequivalent of another Cabinet seat.\n  We also passed the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. We did, a \nwhile ago, a very important piece of legislation, gun liability reform. \nPeople wonder what that has to do with--as we say out in the country--\nthe price of eggs. I will tell you, it is important legislation, too. \nIt conformed liability, as far as the liability of those who \nmanufacture, which is growing out of proportion to our regular \nnegligence laws, and put that under some kind of reasonable control as \nfar as the liability of manufacturers, those who build firearms. If \nthese gun manufacturers went out of business, we would have had to get \nguns produced overseas, and that would not have been good.\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\n  The reason I did this kind of litany of successes is that it didn't \njust happen. It didn't fall down from the sky. It happened because we \nhave real leadership. I believe it is because of our majority leader, \nBill Frist, and Mitch McConnell, our whip. I give them extreme credit. \nI also say that much of this has been bipartisan--at least I can speak \nfor myself. We would not have had an Energy bill without bipartisan \nleadership. Part of the year we didn't have it, let's be honest. We had \nthe minority trying to move the other way on almost everything. I must \nsay the new minority leader said he was going to try to move in a way \nto help get things done. I think this list, to some extent, indicates \nthat is occurring.\n  Before we leave, I think it is always good to remind ourselves of \nwhat we have done so we can take home a recollection, kind of a roadmap \nof accomplishments. I might have left something out because I just did \nthis this afternoon. It took about 30 minutes, so it is no masterpiece, \nbut I think it is pretty accurate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New \nMexico. I am especially proud of the majority leader whose patience and \nintelligence and perseverance has helped us through these several \nmonths. I am thankful to the Democratic leader for his help in making \nthose things happen.\n  When the Senate reconvenes in September, one of the first orders of \nbusiness will be the Defense authorization bill. During August, I \nrespectfully suggest that the President reconsider his opposition to \nlegislation that would set the rules for the treatment and \ninterrogation of detainees.\n  I have decided to cosponsor three amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill that clarify our policies relative to detainees from \nthe war on terror. There has been some debate about whether it is \nappropriate for Congress to set rules on the treatment of detainees. \nMr. President, for me, this question isn't even close.\n  The people, through their elected representatives, should set the \nrules for how detainees and prisoners under U.S. control are treated \nand interrogated. In the short term, the President can set the rules. \nBut the war on terror is now nearly 4 years old. We don't want judges \nmaking up the rules. So for the long term, the people should set the \nrules. That is why we have an independent Congress.\n  In fact, the Constitution says, quite clearly, that is what Congress \nshould do. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress, \nand Congress alone, shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning \nCaptures on Land and Water.''\n  So Congress has the responsibility to set clear rules here.\n  But the spirit of these amendments is really one I hope the White \nHouse will decide to embrace. In essence, these amendments codify \nmilitary procedures and policies; procedures in the Army Field Manual; \npolicies regarding compliance with the Convention Against Torture, \nsigned by President Reagan; and policies the Defense Department has set \nregarding the classification of detainees.\n  If the President thinks these are wrong rules, I hope he will submit \nnew ones to Congress so we can debate and pass them. I am one Senator \nwho gives great weight to his views on any matter, especially this \nmatter. This has been a gray area for the law.\n  In this gray area, the question is, Who should set the rules? In the \nshort term, surely, the President can, and in the longer term, the \npeople should through their elected representatives. We don't want the \ncourts to write those rules.\n  In summary, it is time for Congress to represent the people, to \nclarify and set the rules for detention and interrogation of our \nenemies during the next few weeks. I hope the White House will tell us \nwhat rules and procedures the President needs to succeed in the war on \nterror. That way, we can move forward together.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, when the Senate reconvenes in September, \none of the first orders of business will be the Defense authorization \nbill. During August, I respectfully suggest the President reconsider \nhis opposition to legislation that would set the rules for the \ntreatment and interrogation of detainees.\n  I have decided to cosponsor three amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill that clarify our policies relative to detainees from \nthe War on Terror. There has been some debate about whether it is \nappropriate for Congress to set rules on the treatment of detainees, \nbut for me this question isn't even close.\n  The people through their elected representatives should set the rules \nfor how detainees and prisoners under U.S. control are treated and \ninterrogated. In the short term, the President can set the rules, but \nthe war on terror is now nearly 4 years old. We do not want judges \nmaking up the rules. So, for the long term, the people should set the \nrules. That is why we have an independent Congress.\n  In fact, the Constitution says, quite clearly, that is what Congress \nshould do: Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress, \nand Congress alone, shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning \nCaptures on Land and Water.''\n  So Congress has a responsibility to set clear rules here.\n  But the spirit of these amendments is really one that I hope the \nWhite House will decide to embrace. In essence, these amendments codify \nmilitary procedures and policies, procedures in the Army Field Manual, \npolicies regarding compliance with the Convention Against Torture \nsigned by President Reagan, and policies the Defense Department has set \nregarding the classification of detainees.\n  That is right. All three of these amendments uphold or codify \npolicies and procedures the administration says we are following today \nand intend to follow moving forward.\n  Senator Graham's amendment, No. 1505, authorizes the system the \nDefense Department has created--Combat Status Review Tribunals--which \nare there for determining whether a detainee is a lawful or unlawful \ncombatant and then ensures that information from interrogating those \ndetainees was derived from following the rules regarding their \ntreatment. Senator Graham's amendment also allows the President to make \nadjustments when necessary as long as he notifies Congress.\n  The first McCain Amendment, No. 1556, prohibits cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment or punishment of detainees. The amendment is in \nspecific compliance with the Convention Against Torture that was signed \nby President Reagan. The administration says that we are already \nupholding those standards when it comes to treatment of detainees, so \nthis should be no problem.\n  The second McCain Amendment, No. 1557, states simply that the \ninterrogation techniques used by the military on detainees shall be \nthose specified by the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. \nThe military, not Congress, writes that manual, and we are told that \nthe techniques specified in that manual will do the job. Further, the \nmanual is under revision now to include techniques related to unlawful \ncombatants, including classified portions, that will continue to give \nthe President and the military a great deal of flexibility.\n  If the President thinks these are the wrong rules, I hope he will \nsubmit new ones to Congress so that we can debate and pass them. I am \none Senator who would give great weight to the President's views on \nthis matter. It's quite possible the Graham and McCain amendments need \nto be altered to set the right rules, but it is time for Congress to \nact.\n  This has been a gray area in the law. In this gray area, the question \nis who should set the rules. In the short term, surely the President \ncan. In the longer term, the people should, through their elected \nrepresentatives. We don't want the courts to write the rules.\n  So, in summary, it is time for Congress, which represents the people, \nto clarify and set the rules for detention and interrogation of our \nenemies. During the next few weeks, I hope the White House will tell us \nwhat rules and procedures the President needs to succeed in this \neffort. That way we can move forward together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is why we have an independent Congress.\n  In fact, the Constitution says, quite clearly, that is what Congress \nshould do: Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress, \nand Congress alone, shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning \nCaptures on Land and Water.''\n  So Congress has a responsibility to set clear rules here.\n  But the spirit of these amendments is really one that I hope the \nWhite House will decide to embrace. In essence, these amendments codify \nmilitary procedures and policies, procedures in the Army Field Manual, \npolicies regarding compliance with the Convention Against Torture \nsigned by President Reagan, and policies the Defense Department has set \nregarding the classification of detainees.\n  That is right. All three of these amendments uphold or codify \npolicies and procedures the administration says we are following today \nand intend to follow moving forward.\n  Senator Graham's amendment, No. 1505, authorizes the system the \nDefense Department has created--Combat Status Review Tribunals--which \nare there for determining whether a detainee is a lawful or unlawful \ncombatant and then ensures that information from interrogating those \ndetainees was derived from following the rules regarding their \ntreatment. Senator Graham's amendment also allows the President to make \nadjustments when necessary as long as he notifies Congress.\n  The first McCain Amendment, No. 1556, prohibits cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment or punishment of detainees. The amendment is in \nspecific compliance with the Convention Against Torture that was signed \nby President Reagan. The administration says that we are already \nupholding those standards when it comes to treatment of detainees, so \nthis should be no problem.\n  The second McCain Amendment, No. 1557, states simply that the \ninterrogation techniques used by the military on detainees shall be \nthose specified by the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. \nThe military, not Congress, writes that manual, and we are told that \nthe techniques specified in that manual will do the job. Further, the \nmanual is under revision now to include techniques related to unlawful \ncombatants, including classified portions, that will continue to give \nthe President and the military a great deal of flexibility.\n  If the President thinks these are the wrong rules, I hope he will \nsubmit new ones to Congress so that we can debate and pass them. I am \none Senator who would give great weight to the President's views on \nthis matter. It's quite possible the Graham and McCain amendments need \nto be altered to set the right rules, but it is time for Congress to \nact.\n  This has been a gray area in the law. In this gray area, the question \nis who should set the rules. In the short term, surely the President \ncan. In the longer term, the people should, through their elected \nrepresentatives. We don't want the courts to write the rules.\n  So, in summary, it is time for Congress, which represents the people, \nto clarify and set the rules for detention and interrogation of our \nenemies. During the next few weeks, I hope the White House will tell us \nwhat rules and procedures the President needs to succeed in this \neffort. That way we can move forward together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9420-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9420-S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             HEARINGS ON SUPREME COURT NOMINEE JOHN ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to outline the \nscheduling procedures for the confirmation hearings on Judge John \nRoberts to the Supreme Court of the United States. I will be followed \nby my colleague, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, who \nwill state a joint agreement, which is incorporated in my statement. \nSenator Leahy will deal with the joint agreement.\n  The decision on when to start the confirmation hearings on Judge \nRoberts depends on what beginning day--whether August 29 or September \n6--is most likely to lead to a vote no later than September 29, so \nthat, if confirmed, the nominee can be seated when the Supreme Court \nbegins its term on October 3. I have stated my own preference for \nSeptember 6 early on, but I emphasized that I was flexible and would be \nwilling to start on August 29.\n  Our duty to have the nominee in place by October 3 took precedence on \nmy or anyone else's preferences.\n  In light of the many possibilities for delay, some justified and some \ntactical, it seemed to me the safer course was the earlier date. At the \nsame time, I was and am mindful that the Senate and the Judiciary \nCommittee can accomplish more in 3 cooperative hours than 3 days or \nperhaps even 3 weeks of disharmonious activity. If any disgruntled \nSenator wants to throw a monkey wrench into the proceedings, even with \nthe August 29 starting date, there would be no absolute assurance of \nmeeting the October 3 target.\n  I acknowledge at the outset that it was unrealistic to obtain a \nbinding unanimous consent agreement specifying an exact timetable with \na commitment to vote by September 29. There are too many legitimate \nissues which could arise which would justify delays where Senators \nwould be compromising their rights by such an agreement. Senator Leahy \nand I have had numerous discussions over the past week with his \nobjective to start the hearings on September 6 and my objective to \nobtain assurances, if not commitments, that the Senate would vote by \nSeptember 29.\n  Our discussions at various times included Senator Frist, Senator \nReid, and Senator McConnell. We have had many additional discussions in \nthe last 72 hours, too numerous to mention. But in one meeting on \nThursday among the five of us--Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator \nMcConnell, Senator Leahy, and myself--we came to an agreement.\n  No. 1, the hearings would start on September 6.\n  No. 2, Senators would waive their right to hold over the nomination \nfor 1 week when first on the Judiciary Committee executive agenda, so \nthe committee vote could occur any time after September 12 and, as \nchairman, I intend to exercise my prerogative to set the committee vote \non our Judiciary Committee agenda for September 15.\n  No. 3, Democrats and Republicans would waive their right to terminate \ncommittee hearings which went past 2 hours after the Senate came into \nsession.\n  No. 4, all written questions would have to be submitted by September \n12, with answers to be submitted in a timely fashion.\n  No. 5 Senators from both parties would waive their right to submit \ndissenting or additional or minority views to the committee report.\n  Beyond these enumerated agreements, the principal basis for the \nRepublicans' willingness to begin the hearing on September 6 was the \nemphasis by Senator Reid and Senator Leahy of their good faith in \nmoving the nomination process promptly to meet the October 3 date.\n  All factors considered, it was our judgment that the September 6 \nstarting date was the best alternative for concluding the hearings in \ntime to seat Judge Roberts, if confirmed, on October 3.\n  I now yield to my distinguished colleague, the ranking member, the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. He and \nI have spent, I believe, more time with each other than we have with \nour families in the past couple weeks. I am not sure if that is to the \ndetriment of our families or ourselves or to the benefit of our \nfamilies or ourselves. In any event, it is a fact we spent an enormous \namount of time.\n  As the distinguished chairman has talked about--and I will in a \nmoment submit this as a joint statement from the two of us--we have \nagreed to the following:\n  The hearings will start on Tuesday, September 6. The Judiciary \nCommittee members will waive their right to hold over the nomination \nfor 1 week, when first placed on the Judiciary Committee executive \nagenda. The vote, of course, then could occur any time after Monday, \nSeptember 12. The chairman intends to set that vote on the executive \nagenda on Thursday, September 15.\n  Senators--and this will require all 100 Senators--will waive their \nright to invoke the 2-hour rule to terminate Judiciary Committee \nhearings 2 hours after the Senate comes into session during the time of \nthe nomination hearings on Judge Roberts.\n  All written questions will be submitted within 24 hours of the \nconclusion of the hearing, and answers will be provided in a timely \nfashion.\n  And we recognize that nothing in the Senate or Judiciary Committee \nrules precludes the Senate from considering the nomination on the floor \nwithout a committee report.\n  As we know--and I see two of the distinguished leaders of the Senate \non the floor and others will be joining us--I served several times in \nthe majority, several times in the minority, and I have handled many \nbills on the floor--you can work out every single possible contingency, \nbut there is always something that comes up, and that is why we have \nchairmen and ranking members.\n\n  I have a great deal of respect for Senator Specter. He has always \nbeen straightforward with me. He has always kept his word to me, as I \nhave to him. We think we have covered all the contingencies. Anything \ncan happen. I suspect the two of us can handle that.\n  I think of some of the contingencies in the last few years. I \nremember an important hearing scheduled and we had the disaster of \nSeptember 11. Obviously, nobody plans or hopes for such events. We have \nthe ability to work out those kinds of situations.\n  Long before the Supreme Court vacancy, long before this nomination, \nthe chairman and I worked cooperatively to lay the groundwork for full \nhearings to prepare that committee for when that day will arrive. We \nhave now announced the schedule for the hearings to begin. I know we \nwill continue to work with each other in good faith as the process \nunfolds, but when we look at this beginning the first week the Senate \nreturns to session after Labor Day, it is a brisk schedule. To meet the \nschedule, we need the cooperation of the administration.\n  The Senate only today, Friday, received the President's official \nnomination of Judge Roberts. The Senate has not received basic \nbackground information on the nominee in answer to the Judiciary \nCommittee's questionnaire. The Senate only today received updated \nbackground check materials from the FBI. All of these, of course, we \nneed.\n  In advance of receiving the nomination, Chairman Specter and I joined \ntogether earlier this week in setting forth additional requests for the \ninformation through the Judiciary Committee questionnaire, something \nworked out by the two of us.\n  The Democratic members of the committee sent the White House a letter \non Tuesday, with a priority of the documents for the nominee's years of \nwork in the Reagan White House with White House counsel Fred Fielding \nfrom among the documents the administration had indicated it was making \narrangements to provide to the Senate.\n  Yesterday I shared with the chairman a suggested request for \nmaterials in connection with only 16 priority cases from the hundreds \nconsidered during the years during which the nominee was Kenneth \nStarr's political deputy at the Department of Justice. That request has \nalso been expedited and sent to the administration this week, even \nbefore the President sent the nomination to the Senate.\n  The President said he hopes the new Justice can be confirmed by the \nstart of the Court's next session on the first\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\nMonday in October. The Senate has already cooperated in achieving this \ngoal. At this point, there is no reason to believe the goal cannot be \nmet, but we need the full cooperation of the administration. The \nadministration has weighed in heavily with demands regarding the \nSenate's schedule.\n  What we need more than the White House telling us how and when to do \nour job is a White House willing to help us expedite our consideration \nby making relevant materials available without delay so we can meet the \nchairman's aggressive schedule.\n  The President has extolled the nominee's credentials, including his \nyears of work in three senior executive branch posts during the \nPresidencies of his father and President Reagan.\n  We are seeking a very small number of the documents evidencing his \nwork in those policy positions. In order for us to fulfill our \nresponsibilities to examine this nomination and report it to the \nSenate, the Senate Judiciary Committee should be provided these \nmaterials without delay so we can perform our due diligence.\n  The White House this week said the Senate will have wide access to \nthe documents from the Reagan administration, but only after an \nelaborate screening process. Based on the White House's own statement \nabout the length of time it will take to screen these documents, that \nwill be 4 weeks from now, maybe even longer.\n  The date the chairman is setting for the beginning of the hearings \nemphasizes the ability to review the materials before the hearings \nrequires quicker action from the administration than that. One only \nneed glance at the calendar to see 4 weeks from today is only a few \ndays before the hearings, and that includes Labor Day weekend.\n  This is a nominee who, if confirmed, could be serving on the Supreme \nCourt until 2030 or beyond, well past the term of the President who \nappointed him and well past the terms or even the lifetimes of Members \nof the Senate who may make this decision. This is a decision that not \nonly affects every American alive today but also our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate, and only the Senate, the \nresponsibility of considering a President's nominations to a lifetime \nappointment to the Supreme Court.\n  The Constitution gives us the duty to make this decision as well as \nwe can, not as fast as we can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the two \nmanagers of the Judiciary Committee, the chairman and ranking member. I \nunderstand why there is a little distrust on both sides because of all \nthe stuff we have gone through on judges. They have done good work, and \nthere is no reason that anyone should be concerned about the work of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  The waivers that have been made by the Senators as to the 1-week \nlayover and 2-hour meeting time for the committee to meet is something \nto show we are trying to move forward on this in good faith.\n  I have no doubt, with the work of these two men, that we will be able \nto work our way through any hurdles we have. We all know the date the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee, \nis shooting for is to make sure Judge Roberts is seated by October 3. \nWe want to make sure that everyone understands that there are no games \nbeing played. Nobody is trying to do anything untoward. We are going to \ndo our very best to work toward that date.\n  The entire Democratic caucus has the utmost faith in our leader, \nSenator Leahy. The Judiciary Committee has been, for 7 months, his. He \nhas done extremely good work, as he has always done. I have been on \nthis floor many times when I served in different capacities where I \nwould talk about the Senator from Vermont in the most positive terms.\n  I feel the same way about the Senator from Pennsylvania. The Senate \nis fortunate to have the Senator from Pennsylvania leading the Senate \nin this most complicated, difficult committee, with the most vexatious \nissues, it seems, all the times.\n  I have spent quite a bit of time, in the last few days, with them and \nthe majority leader and Senator McConnell. It has been worthwhile. This \nis going to move forward.\n  As the Senator from Vermont has stated, materials are needed. We \nunderstand the power of a committee chairman in this instance. He has \ntremendous power. We don't take anything away from the power he has. He \ncan set the markup whenever he wants, within reason. He can call for \nvotes when he wants. But he has, in the past, been very fair, and he \nwill continue to be. I have no doubt that is the case.\n  I also want the record to reflect that I did not get the floor before \nthe majority leader; he was not here. That is why I grabbed the floor \nbefore someone else did. I certainly would not try to speak before the \nmajority leader. Protocol would say that isn't the case. The majority \nleader was not here, and I did not want somebody else to grab the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have a bit of business to do before we \nclose down tonight. What we heard from our colleagues reflects the \ncooperative spirit that is very important as we fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibility in terms of this very important \nnomination.\n  As our colleagues can tell, there have been a lot of discussions with \nthe chairman and ranking member and the leadership on both sides of the \naisle. What we witnessed is the decision to begin hearings after Labor \nDay, that the hearings and the subsequent action, including the workup \nto the floor, which according to the schedule that has been laid out, \nimplies to me we would be able to be on the floor by September 26, and \nwith that would be able to have the nomination finished by the end of \nthat week, confirmed, and the Justice would be sitting on that first \nMonday in October.\n  I do wish to thank all of the people who have been mentioned for \nbringing us to this point and expect that over August, with civility, \nwe will be able to continue our study of records and background that \nare provided. We will have a very busy early September as those \nhearings begin.\n  In terms of timing, it looks as if we will be able to achieve the \nobjectives from both sides of the aisle. We very much appreciate that \nleadership in a bipartisan way in the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. These are difficult things to do, \nand I am glad to see that type of cooperation in what really is a very \nimportant set of hearings with regard to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States of America. Above all, I want to see Judge Roberts \ntreated fairly. I believe we are off to a good start, and hopefully \nthat will continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9421-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9421-S9422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RETIREMENT OF GENERAL GREGORY S. MARTIN, USAF\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I have the distinct privilege and \nhonor of rising to pay tribute, on the announcement of his retirement, \nto one of our Nation's greatest generals, and my good friend, Gen. \nGregory S. Martin of the U.S. Air Force. When I first met the general \nover 2 years ago, I knew immediately that his reputation of being an \nextraordinary leader was true.\n  From the beginning of his career at the Air Force Academy, where he \nwas named the National Collegiate Parachuting Champion, to his current \ncommand of Air Force Materiel Command, excellence has been the defining \ncharacteristic of General Martin's career.\n  As a young fighter pilot, he flew combat missions over Vietnam and \nserved as a mission commander during Operations Linebacker I and \nLinebacker II. I do not have to remind my colleagues that these two air \ncampaigns were instrumental in securing the release of our prisoners of \nwar from Vietnam.\n  General Martin has served in a number of capacities including \nCommander\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\nof the 479th Tactical Training Wing at Holloman Air Force Base, NM; the \n33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL; and 1st Fighter Wing at \nLangley Air Force Base, VA.\n  The Senate began to learn more about General Martin's reputation when \nhe was confirmed as Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and \nCommander of Allied Forces Northern Europe. In this capacity, during \nOperation Enduring Freedom he directed airdrop support for United \nStates and allied forces as well as Afghani refugees. The following \nyear, General Martin provided deployment support, combat airdrop \noperations, and all air delivered sustainment support for Operation \nIraqi Freedom.\n  As a testament to his effectiveness as a leader, not only did General \nMartin accomplish these tasks for his Nation, but he also earned the \nrespect and dedication of the Air Force enlisted personnel who served \nwith him. This was reflected in the decision of the Air Force's \nenlisted personnel to honor General Martin with the Order of the Sword, \nthe highest tribute the Air Force enlisted corps can pay to a \ncommander.\n  After this successful tour of duty, General Martin was confirmed to \nhis present post as Commander of the Air Force Materiel Command at \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. As Commander, Air Force Materiel \nCommand, General Martin leads more than 78,000 men and women of the \nworld's most respected air and space force, and he is all too eager to \nstate that this has been the most satisfying assignment in his career.\n  During his tenure, General Martin transformed Air Force Materiel \nCommand, which is charged with delivering on-time, on-budget war-\nwinning capabilities to our Nation's warfighters as well as providing \n``cradle to grave'' management of every Air Force weapons system. \nGeneral Martin led the development of a new Air Force Science and \nTechnology vision that will guide critical research and development \nwork for decades to come. He strengthened, unified, and streamlined the \nAir Force Program Executive Office to ensure more effective acquisition \nsupport for current and future Air force weapon systems. He led the \nimplementation of Continuous Process Improvement initiatives within the \nAir Force logistics and sustainment activities, achieving the best on-\ntime, on-cost performance in the history of our Air Force logistics \ncenters. Under General Martin's leadership, the Air Force Materiel \nCommand returned $570 million last year to the Department of Defense to \nsupport the global war on terrorism. That is how good this man is, and \nthe people who serve with time.\n  All that being said, none of these accomplishments would have been \npossible without the support of his wife, General Martin's high school \nsweetheart. They have been married for 35 years. I know I join a \ngrateful Nation in saying thank you to Wendy for the sacrifices she had \nmade for her husband and for her country throughout the years.\n  As I conclude my remarks on the announcement of the General's \nretirement, I am reminded of the Air Force's motto: No one comes close. \nThat is how I would describe General Martin: no one comes close.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, General Martin's call sign is \n``Speedy''. There is good reason for that. He is one of the most \nefficient, revered and honored generals in the history of the Air \nForce. He is a person who has given a great deal to our country. He \ndeserves a great deal of respect. He is a man of honor. My remarks do \nnot even begin to do justice for this great man, his wife, and those \nwho have served with him in the Air Force and in the defense of our \ncountry over all of these years. This is a man who makes a difference. \nThis is a man who I hate to see retire because there is nobody better. \nHowever, I wish him well in retirement. Speedy Martin deserves a great \nretirement, and if he wishes a greater opportunity to continue to serve \nin whatever capacity he wants for the rest of his life. Until then, we \nsalute him and let him know that we have appreciated the great service \nhe has given to our country. We appreciate him as a person and as an \nexample to all of us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has come to my attention that there was \na significant decision by a criminal court in Seattle. The decision, as \nI understand it, was made this week, and it involved a U.S. district \njudge, John C. Coughenour. I hope I have pronounced his name correctly. \nJudge Coughenour was tasked with an awesome responsibility--the \nprosecution of Ahmed Ressam, who had been accused of terrorist acts \nagainst the United States.\n  The case was rather straightforward. The man had plotted to bomb the \nLos Angeles Airport on the eve of the celebration of our millennium. It \nwas in imposing the sentence that Judge Coughenour said some things \nwhich are worth repeating. He called into question some conclusions \nthat many people have reached about our system of justice and really \nreminded us of our legacy in terms of constitutional responsibility in \nthis country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the judge's entire statement at the \nsentencing hearing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Judge's Statement\n       U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour made a statement \n     during Wednesday's sentencing hearing for Ahmed Ressam. \n     ``Okay. Let me say a few things. First of all, it will come \n     as no surprise to anybody that this sentencing is one that I \n     have struggled with a great deal, more than any other \n     sentencing that I've had in the 24 years I've been on the \n     bench.\n       ``I've done my very best to arrive at a period of \n     confinement that appropriately recognizes the severity of the \n     intended offense, but also recognizes the practicalities of \n     the parties' positions before trial and the cooperation of \n     Mr. Ressam, even though it did terminate prematurely.\n       ``The message I would hope to convey in today's sentencing \n     is twofold:\n       ``First, that we have the resolve in this country to deal \n     with the subject of terrorism and people who engage in it \n     should be prepared to sacrifice a major portion of their life \n     in confinement.\n       ``Secondly, though, I would like to convey the message that \n     our system works. We did not need to use a secret military \n     tribunal, or detain the defendant indefinitely as an enemy \n     combatant, or deny him the right to counsel, or invoke any \n     proceedings beyond those guaranteed by or contrary to the \n     United States Constitution.\n       ``I would suggest that the message to the world from \n     today's sentencing is that our courts have not abandoned our \n     commitment to the ideals that set our nation apart. We can \n     deal with the threats to our national security without \n     denying the accused fundamental constitutional protections.\n       ``Despite the fact that Mr. Ressam is not an American \n     citizen and despite the fact that he entered this country \n     intent upon killing American citizens, he received an \n     effective, vigorous defense, and the opportunity to have his \n     guilt or innocence determined by a jury of 12 ordinary \n     citizens.\n       ``Most importantly, all of this occurred in the sunlight of \n     a public trial. There were no secret proceedings, no \n     indefinite detention, no denial of counsel.\n       ``The tragedy of September 11th shook our sense of security \n     and made us realize that we, too, are vulnerable to acts of \n     terrorism.\n       ``Unfortunately, some believe that this threat renders our \n     Constitution obsolete. This is a Constitution for which men \n     and women have died and continue to die and which has made us \n     a model among nations. If that view is allowed to prevail, \n     the terrorists will have won.\n       ``It is my sworn duty, and as long as there is breath in my \n     body I'll perform it, to support and defend the Constitution \n     of the United States. We will be in recess.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me read a few things from this statement that I think \nare so significant. The judge said at the sentencing hearing for Ahmed \nRessam, an alleged terrorist now prosecuted and convicted, the \nfollowing:\n\n       Okay. Let me say a few things. First of all, it will come \n     as no surprise to anybody that this sentencing is one that I \n     have struggled with a great deal, more than any other \n     sentencing that I've had in the 24 years I've been on the \n     bench.\n\n  The judge went on to say:\n\n       I've done my very best to arrive at a period of confinement \n     that appropriately recognizes the severity of the intended \n     offense, but also recognizes the practicalities of the \n     parties' positions before trial and the cooperation of\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\n     Mr. Ressam, even though it did terminate prematurely.\n\n  The judge said:\n\n       The message I would hope to convey in today's sentencing is \n     two-fold: First, that we have the resolve in this country to \n     deal with the subject of terrorism and people who engage in \n     it should be prepared to sacrifice a major portion of their \n     life in confinement.\n       Secondly, though, I would like to convey the message that \n     our system works.

We can \n     deal with threats to our national security without denying \n     the accused fundamental constitutional protections.\n       Despite the fact that Mr. Ressam is not an American citizen \n     and despite the fact that he entered this country intent upon \n     killing American citizens, he received an effective, vigorous \n     defense, and the opportunity to have his guilt or innocence \n     determined by a jury of 12 ordinary citizens.\n       Most importantly, all of this occurred in the sunlight of a \n     public trial. There were no secret proceedings, no indefinite \n     detention, no denial of counsel.\n       The tragedy of September 11th shook our sense of security \n     and made us realize that we, too, are vulnerable to acts of \n     terrorism. Unfortunately, some believe that this threat \n     renders our Constitution obsolete. This is a Constitution for \n     which men and women have died and continue to die and which \n     has made us a model among nations. If that view is allowed to \n     prevail, the terrorists will have won.\n       It is my sworn duty, and as long as there is breath in my \n     body I'll perform it, to support and defend the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n\n  That is the end of the statement by Judge Coughenour. This judge was \nappointed by a Republican President. He clearly speaks to \nconstitutional principles which know no party bounds.\n\n  All of us, Republicans and Democrats, swear to uphold that same \nConstitution in our service to the Senate and our service to this \nGovernment. It is clear that in some cases the open and public trial \nwhich this accused, Ahmed Ressam, received in Seattle could never occur \nbecause of concerns over classified information, over concerns of \nsecurity for individuals. But it is very clear that in this case \nextraordinary efforts were made to make certain that we said to the \nworld, this man can be tried in open court, judged by a jury of 12 \nordinary citizens and his guilt determined according to a system bound \nby the Constitution we have sworn to uphold.\n  I am humbled by the wisdom of this simple statement from this Federal \njudge. I hope it serves as a reminder to all that we must seek not only \nsecurity in this time of peril, but we must seek it in a way that never \nimperils our basic freedoms in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9423-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly mention three items \nin these closing minutes before the Senate takes its traditional August \nbreak. One has to do with the legislation Senator Lugar of Indiana and \nI have introduced in this Senate and its companion which has been \nintroduced by Congressman Pence and Congressman Boucher on a bipartisan \nbasis in the other body. I refer to the so-called shield law bill, \nwhich we have offered to the Congress as a Federal proposal to \ncomplement the statutes that exist across the United States in 31 \nStates as well as the District of Columbia. Eighteen other States have \nrules of law that provide some protections for reporters who rely on \nconfidential sources for their stories.\n  This law Senator Lugar and I are proposing in the Senate is only \nnominally about reporters. It is fundamentally about those who rely on \nthe free flow of information in our society to gather important \ninformation that is critical for our democracy.\n  As we are about to take this recess for the next 4 or 5 weeks, we \nwould do well to remember that a few short miles from where we are this \nevening, there is a reporter who sits in a prison cell. Her only \noffense is that she has steadfastly refused to reveal a journalistic \nsource. In a society such as ours, this should not be, in my view, an \nimprisonable offense. A free society obviously requires a free press. \nThomas Jefferson once said that given the choice between a free \ngovernment and a free press, he would choose the latter. Others, such \nas Madison, have suggested that in a nation where you do not have the \nfree flow of information, it puts a nation at great risk.\n  That has been the tradition of our society for more than 200 years. \nWe are entering dangerous territory in the 21st century when a reporter \ngets thrown in jail because she or he honors a commitment to keep a \nsource confidential.\n  I believe it is time we enact a Federal shield law to mirror what 49 \nStates and the District of Columbia have done by law or rule.\n  It is thought that our bill would absolutely guarantee under any and \nall circumstances that a reporter's sources ought to remain \nconfidential. It does by and large protect that confidentiality. \nHowever, we create exceptions for national security. Obviously when \nthere is no other means by which you could glean important information, \nthe reporter should release the information that may be critical in a \nprosecution. But we try to keep sacrosanct that relationship between \nthe source and the reporter. Again, not for the sake of the reporter, \nbut for the sake of our citizenry, for the sake of the free flow of \ninformation which is critical in a democracy.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee on which the \nPresiding Officer today serves held a very good hearing a few days ago. \nI commend the members of that committee. It was a very good \nparticipation by members of the Judiciary Committee who listened to \nvarious witnesses talk about a shield law.\n  This is not a liberal or conservative issue. As I mentioned, we have \nCongressman Pence and Congressman Boucher in the House of \nRepresentatives. Congressman Pence, a conservative from Indiana, \nCongressman Boucher a Democrat from Virginia, along with Senator Lugar \nand I and others have introduced this legislation because as Senators \nand Congressmen, as American citizens, we believe it is important in \nour society that we have this free flow of information. Therefore, we \nare hopeful this body in the coming months before we adjourn sine die \nwould enact a shield law.\n  I sat with an executive in the news business who told me the \nincarceration of Judith Miller, the reporter who is in jail tonight in \nAlexandria, is having an impact in his own newsroom. Reporters and \ntheir editors are thinking twice about going forward with stories, \nimportant stories, stories in the public interest, because they fear \nthe harshest sanctions should a prosecutor knock on their door one \nmorning and demand to know the sources of those stories. This\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nshould not be happening in our country.\n\n  I hope we as a Senate will give this matter the attention it \ndeserves. Senator Lugar and I do not claim that the bill we have \nintroduced is perfect. We welcome advice and counsel of our colleagues \non how we might craft a good shield law. It is not a partisan issue. \nSenator Lugar and I have a bill that has support on both sides of the \naisle. We want to work with our colleagues to see this law be enacted. \nIt is of fundamental importance to our country that we enact a strong \nand good and viable shield law at the national level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9424-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the second issue I will mention briefly, in \naddition to the shield law issue, is terrorism risk insurance \nlegislation. I speak as the author of the original legislation 3 years \nago, which provided a backstop, not a bailout, for businesses in this \ncountry that rely on having terrorism risk insurance in major real \nestate developments and other major projects that are potentially \nvulnerable to attack.\n  That bill expires on December 31. It is critically important for \nAmerican businesses and consumers that we enact this backstop \nlegislation. It is important for our country, important that we provide \nthe kind of insurance coverage that would allow some protection against \na major catastrophe. Without that, we run the risk of major projects \nnot going forward.\n  We had a briefing from major industries and others calling upon the \nCongress to extend the terrorism risk insurance law for the next 2 \nyears. We need to sit down and try to determine whether we can \nestablish some permanent partnership between public and private sectors \nin which we can guarantee to some extent, should a catastrophic event \noccur, we would be in a position to provide a backstop, some relief, \nunder those circumstances.\n  None of us want to think about those events, but certainly the events \nin Spain in March of 2004 and Great Britain over the last several weeks \nand Sharm el Sheik over the last several days clearly indicate to all \nof us that we are living in a different world today.\n  Terrorism risk insurance is not like insurance against other hazards. \nBy the very nature of terrorism, it is very difficult, if not \nimpossible, to develop accurate models for terrorist events. They are \ninherently and extremely unpredictable. Good, solid business people \nwill say a federal backstop is absolutely critical to sustain the kind \nof economic growth that is important to our nation's future. Jobs are \nat stake, major developments are at stake, major public gatherings at \nsporting events and the like are at stake without the ability to \nprovide this critical insurance, terrorism risk insurance.\n  We have approximately 32 cosponsors of the bill I have introduced \nwith Senator Bennett of Utah. Most of the members of the Banking \nCommittee are supportive. The chairman of the Banking Committee, \nSenator Shelby, indicated he would like to work out a proposal in \nSeptember to go forward. My hope is that will happen. We need the \nbacking of the White House as well as the House leadership if that law \nis going to be enacted.\n  Terrorism risk insurance legislation will require real emphasis over \nthese coming weeks and months if we are going to succeed in enacting \nthis bill before December 31 when the present law expires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9424-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Lastly, I urge that when we return in September, the top \nitem be the Defense authorization bill. I was terribly disappointed \nthat we put aside that bill this week. I don't recall another event \nquite like that where we literally pulled the Defense authorization \nbill for special interest legislation. With men and women in harm's \nway, when we are at war, it was stunning to me we would replace that \neffort with the proposal to provide immunity, in effect, to gun \nmanufacturers and dealers with the legislation that was enacted earlier \nthis afternoon.\n  Putting aside my view on that bill, which I have expressed earlier \nthis week, I am stunned that the Senate would prematurely cease action \non legislation to help our men and women in uniform would get \neverything they possibly need--not to mention provide support for \nveterans, for survivors' families, and for the weapons systems that are \nessential to our national security. I found it unbelievable we would \nset aside that legislation in order to provide legal immunity for gun \ndealers and gun manufacturers in the United States. I have never seen \nanything like it in my service.\n  I recall once, last year, there was an effort to cease work on the \nDefense authorization bill in order to consider the class action reform \nbill, which I supported and was deeply involved in crafting. We \nsucceeded in dissuading those who wanted to make that move. We went \nforward and completed the work on the Defense authorization bill. We \ndid not do that this time.\n  I hope when we return in September the first order of business will \nbe to complete the Defense authorization bill. It is critically \nimportant that people who serve in the military, those who are our \nveterans, those whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice, \nthose who have served and given their lives for our country, that they \nunderstand how important we think that legislation is. I urge my \ncolleagues and the leadership to place that item as the No. 1 item when \nwe return in September.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the shield law, terrorism risk insurance \nlegislation, and the Defense authorization bill are three pieces of \nlegislation I hope will become priority bills when we return this fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9424-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9424-S9425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFRICA WATER\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, diplomacy and foreign policy are essential \npillars of our national security. They reflect the values, principles, \nviews and interests of the American people. They are central to \nadvancing the United States role and stature in the world.\n  This year, for the first time ever, we are earmarking specific funds \nin the Foreign Operations bill to advance a specific cause. This year, \nwe are legislating a direct appropriation of $200 million to advance \nthe cause of clean water and sanitation--$50 million specifically \ntargeted toward Africa.\n  In America, we take clean water for granted. Water to drink. Water to \nbathe in. But in other parts of the world, clean water is a scarcity \nand the results are devastating.\n  Every 15 seconds a child dies because of a disease contracted from \nunclean water. Ninety percent of infant deaths are caused by unclean \nwater. Water-related disease kills 14,000 people a day, most of them \nchildren. Millions more are debilitated and prevented from leading \nhealthy lives.\n  Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, dengue fever, trachoma, intestinal \nhelminth infection, and schistosomiasis can all be prevented simply by \nproviding safe water and sanitation.\n  Unfortunately, reliable projections suggest that the problem is only \ngrowing worse. Water stress and water scarcity, leading to impure and \ndisease borne water, is expected to increase. By 2025, upwards of two-\nthirds of the world's population may be subject to water stress.\n  Imagine living in a rural village in Sub Saharan Africa or East Asia \nwhere the village members share their water source with livestock.\n  Imagine being a grandmother like Mihiret G-Maryam from a small \nvillage in Ethiopia. She watched five of her grandchildren between the \nages of three and eight die from water-related diseases.\n  Before the UK-based WaterAid organization intervened in her \ncommunity, constant stomach pain and diarrhea were a fact of life. The \nfoul smelling, contaminated water exposed Mihiret and her neighbors to \nparasitic diseases.\n  With no latrines, human waste was everywhere. As Mihiret testifies, \n``it was horrid to see, as well as being unhealthy.''\n  Now, because of the education and investment of WaterAid, together \nwith the local church, her village is clean and the people no longer \nsuffer chronic stomach aches. Clean water has literally saved lives. \nAnd proper management and intervention can be a currency for peace and \ninternational cooperation.\n  I have been on numerous medical missions around the world and seen \nthe\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\ntruth of this. In January, I traveled with my colleague Senator \nLandrieu to East Asia to survey the aftermath of the December 26 \ntsunami.\n  We helicoptered over the Sri Lankan coast and through the windows \nwitnessed a scene of unending devastation.\n  Over 155,000 people died. At least 1 million lost their homes. Whole \nvillages were literally washed out to sea.\n  Through all of this, the lack of clean water emerged as the most \npressing public health concern. In many areas, the tsunami had poisoned \nwells with salt water, and swept away water treatment plants.\n  Shortages of potable water threatened to trigger outbreaks of \ndiseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. The large pools of \nstagnant water I saw along the coast were potential breeding grounds \nfor mosquitoes carrying malaria and dengue fever.\n  In confronting these challenges, America showed tremendous generosity \nand compassion. And part of our efforts included innovative new \ntechnologies to provide clean, safe water. And those efforts continue.\n  This March, World Water Day launched the International Decade for \nAction. The United States and countries around the world are working \ntogether to reduce by one-half the number of people who lack access to \nsafe drinking water.\n  I applaud the President his leadership. In August 2002, the \nadministration launched the ``Water for the Poor Initiative'' to \nimprove management of fresh water resources in over 70 developing \ncountries. An estimated $750 million was invested in 2004 alone.\n  While no single piece of legislation can eliminate water-related \ndiseases in the world, continued leadership is essential.\n  In March, the minority leader and I introduced the Safe Water: \nCurrency of Peace Act to make safe water and sanitation a major \npriority of our foreign relief efforts.\n  The $200 million earmarked in the Foreign Operations bill is an \nextension of these efforts.\n  I commend the assistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, the \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, for his \nleadership. And I thank my colleagues for their continued commitment to \nthis pressing issue.\n  It is hard to imagine that something so basic, so necessary, is \nlacking in so many places.\n  Providing clean water will save millions of lives. It is as simple as \na glass of H2O.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9425-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      40TH ANNIVERSARY OF MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Tomorrow, America celebrates the 40th anniversary of the \nMedicare law.\n  Forty years ago, standing in the Harry S. Truman library in \nIndependence, Missouri, President Johnson told a grateful nation that \n``Through this new law, every citizen will be able, in his productive \nyears when he is earning, to insure himself against the ravages of old \nage.''\n  Passage of the Medicare law ensured that never again would health \ncare for the elderly be a matter of charity, but one of national \nconscience.\n  Medicare has served millions of seniors, improving their health and \nlengthening their lives. Today, 41 million elderly and disabled \nAmericans have Medicare coverage. That number is expected to hit 77 \nmillion in 2031 when the baby boom generation is fully enrolled.\n  I am proud to have worked to pass the Medicare Modernization Act in \n2003. This legislation guarantees seniors for the first time have \naccess to affordable prescription drugs.\n  It also expands health care choices, improves preventive care, and \nbegins to take a number of additional steps to improve quality and \naffordability of care in the Medicare program.\n  In just a few short months, in January 2006, every senior will have \naccess to prescription drug coverage under Medicare. This represents \nthe most significant improvement to the Medicare program since its \ninception 40 years ago. And 41 million American seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities finally have the prescription drug coverage they need \nand the Medicare choices they deserve.\n  As a physician, I have written thousands of prescriptions that I knew \nwould go unfilled because patients could not afford them. Under the \nMedicare Modernization Act that will soon change.\n  As a senator, I watched a decades-old Medicare program operate \nwithout flexibility, without comprehensive and coordinated care, \nwithout preventive care or disease management, and with no catastrophic \nprotection against high out-of-pocket medical costs. I watched as \nscience raced ahead, and Medicare stood still.\n  Now, under the Medicare Modernization Act that, too, is beginning to \nchange. By expanding opportunities for private sector innovation, \nMedicare now combines the best of the public and private sectors. It \nprovides better and more comprehensive coverage for today's seniors, \nand helps to lay the foundation for a stronger and more modern program \nfor tomorrow's seniors.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act also offered some benefits for younger \nAmericans. Most significantly, it is making health insurance more \naffordable through portable and tax-free health savings accounts. \nHealth savings accounts are already giving younger Americans more \ncontrol over their health care choices and hard-earned dollars.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act was a historic step forward for a \nprogram that has served millions of America's seniors. And it continues \nto draw on technological advances, like health information technologies \nand e-prescribing, to deliver more effective and more affordable care.\n  Medicare is a compact between generations. It is one of the most \nvalued and compassionate legislative achievements of the 20th century. \nMore changes will be needed in the future. But we have already begun to \nlay the groundwork. Medicare is providing a platform for making health \ncare more affordable, more available, and more dependable for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9425-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9425-S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    H.J. RES. 59, WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.J. \nRes. 59, a joint resolution that expresses the sense of Congress with \nrespect to the women suffragists who fought for and won the right of \nwomen to vote in the United States. It is my privilegte to join \nCongresswoman Shelley Berkley, my colleague and fellow Nevadan, in the \neffort to honor and celebrate their hard-won achievements.\n  Our Nation was founded on the principle of ``consent of the \ngoverned.'' Yet for the greater part of America's history, women were \ndenied the fundamental right to participate in our democracy through \nthe power of the vote. Today, it would be unthinkable and \nunconscionable to hold elections where not every vote properly cast is \ncounted. Eighty-five years ago--perhaps within the lifespan of our \nmothers or grandmothers--this was not the case.\n  Next month we will observe the 85th anniversary of the 19th \namendment, which finally secured women's right to vote in the United \nStates. The 19th amendment does not just represent voting rights. It \nalso represents a profound victory for women suffragists long seeking \nto be affirmed as equal partners in America's civic, cultural, and \nsocial affairs. But as victories with enduring and far-reaching \nconsequences tend to, this one required the suffragists to first \novercome numerous setbacks.\n  In 1866, Elizabeth Cady Stanton ran for Congress to test women's \nconstitutional right to hold public office--and received only 24 of \n12,000 votes cast. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony registered to vote in \nRochester, New York, and cast a ballot--and subsequently was arrested. \nTwo years later, the Supreme Court considered whether citizenship \nitself conferred voting rights and ruled that it does not for women. \nDuring the several years leading up to 1920, many suffragists, \nincluding Alice Paul, exercised their right to engage in civil \ndiscourse through protest and were thrown in jail for doing so.\n  These names may not sound familiar to everyone. Nor are these events \nthe full extent of the challenges that the women suffragists faced as \nthey fought for the ratification of the 19th amendment. The joint \nresolution would let us remember them and give them their due tribute.\n  The women suffragists commended in this resolution were instrumental \nnot\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\njust in securing women's right to vote. By winning for women the power \nof the ballot, they moved countless others to strengthen women's voice \nin charting the course of the nation. By asserting women's equality in \nthe mechanism that sustains our democracy, they helped future \ngenerations fight for equality in all aspects of American life. By \nopening the voting booths, they spurred on the work to open our \ninstitutions of higher education, our athletic fields, and our \nboardrooms. And by having persisted in their convictions, they inspire \nyoung women today, like Hannah Low and Destiny Carroll of Henderson, \nNevada, to continue the effort to ensure that their triumphs will not \nbe forgotten.\n  On behalf of Hannah and Destiny, as well as my friend Congresswoman \nBerkley, each person a credit to Nevada, I am pleased to support the \npassage of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9426-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING JUDY ANSLEY\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

The administration \ncould not have made a better choice for this important post, and I am \nconfident that Judy will serve her country with dignity and honor, as \nshe has done throughout her extensive career in public service.\n  My only regret is that Judy Ansley will be leaving the Armed Services \nCommittee after next week to move to the White House. Over the course \nof the last 6 years, Judy has dedicated her time, energy, and \nintelligence to the work of the committee with great enthusiasm. As the \ndeputy staff director and staff director, Judy has provided excellent \nleadership to the committee during challenging times, and I am deeply \nthankful for her profound concern for the issues facing the men and \nwomen of our armed services. I am sure that my colleagues on the \ncommittee would agree that she has been an indispensable resource for \nour efforts. In those instances where she had professional views in \nopposition to mine, she has never hesitated to express them. I trust \nthat she will most respectfully do the same for the President.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to observe closely Judy's indefatigable efforts. Before she \njoined the committee, Judy served as my national security adviser for 5 \nyears, and her keen judgment and incisiveness were readily apparent \nthroughout her work. Truly, while I am pleased that the administration \nwill be gaining such a remarkable asset, I will miss Judy's counsel and \nextraordinary nature. I send my deepest gratitude to Judy as she begins \nher transition to the National Security Council, and I join with her \nwonderful family, husband Steve and daughters Rachel and Megan, in \ncelebrating this achievement.\n  Mr. President, I also take this opportunity to announce Judy's \nsuccessor as staff director for the Armed Services Committee. I have \nasked Mr. Charles S. Abell, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense for Personnel and Readiness, to become the new staff director, \nand it gives me great pleasure to note that he has accepted this \nresponsibility.\n  A humble and devoted patriot, Charlie Abell has served his country \nwith valor in every endeavor. Before joining the administration, \nCharlie was an exceptional member of the Armed Services Committee \nprofessional staff. During his years with the committee staff, Charlie \nwas the lead staffer for the Subcommittee on Personnel, including \nissues of military readiness and quality of life. A highly decorated \nsoldier, he retired from the Army as a lieutenant colone1 after 26 \nyears of distinguished service, and he brought a profound insight to \nhis duties with the committee. I was privileged to work with this \noutstanding individual during his previous term with the committee, and \nI look forward to collaborating with him in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9426-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         spc adam james harting\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Portage. \nAdam Harting, 21 years old, died on July 25 in Samarra when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his Bradley Fighting \nVehicle. With so much of his life left before him, Adam risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Only 19 years old when he arrived in Kuwait to begin his service in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, Adam was featured in Time Magazine in 2003 as \none of the youngest soldiers stationed overseas. A graduate of Portage \nHigh School, Adam had always dreamed of joining the military and was \nactive in the ROTC program throughout his high school years. Adam and \nhis twin brother, Alex, both promised their father when they were young \nthat they would enter the military, and both lived up to that promise, \nwith Adam serving in the Army and Alex in the Air Force. Their father, \nJim Harting, recounted his pride in Adam's service and character to a \nlocal newspaper, saying, ``He was a hero. He was my hero.'' I stand \nhere today to express the same feelings of pride and gratitude for this \nyoung Hoosier's sacrifices and those made by his family on behalf of \nour country.\n  Adam was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 1st Brigade \nCombat Team, 42nd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA. This brave young \nsoldier leaves behind his father and step-mother, Jim and Brenda \nHarting; his mother, Katherine Brown; and his seven siblings, Alex, 21, \nMark, 20, Josh, 15, Jimmy, 14, Tiffany, 22, Tabitha, 20, and Hanna, 8.\n  Today, I join Adam's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Adam, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Adam was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Adam will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country. '\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Adam's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Adam's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of SPC Adam James Harting in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Adam's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Adam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9426-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9426-S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SOLDIERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in honor of U.S. Army SPC \nChristopher Hoskins, of Danielson, CT, who was killed in Iraq on June \n21, 2005. He was 21 years old.\n  Specialist Hoskins was killed along with another soldier when his \nunit came under small-arms fire in Ramadi, Iraq.\n  Growing up, Christopher was known as quiet, passionate, and full of \nenergy. He competed on the wrestling team at Killingly High School and \nwas interested in graphic arts. He carried a sketchbook with him in \nIraq.\n  Christopher enlisted in the Army simply because he thought it was the \nright thing to do. He was proud to be a soldier. In Iraq he drove \nBradley fighting vehicles and humvees.\n  He served with valor and humanity. He often said that the Iraqi \npeople are just like us. They have many of the same basic needs--food, \nwater, clothing, and shelter. And he knew that he had extra and that \nthey are wanting. It would have been easier for him, serving in a \ndangerous region, to shut himself off from the populace, but he didn't. \nHe often shared his extra non-military supplies with Iraqi civilians.\n  Christopher also formed a special bond with those in his unit. Even \nduring the short amount of time that he was able to come back home to \nConnecticut, he would swap pictures over the Internet with those in his \nunit who were still in Iraq. He sent them care packages of magazines \nand junk food. He had recently signed up for a second tour.\n  Christopher's life was defined by unselfish service to his community \nand his country, and that selflessness continues after his death. He \nasked his mother a few months ago that, if he died, donations be made \nto his former school system in lieu of flowers. He was concerned about \nhis younger brother, Sean, who is a special needs student, and the \nstudents in the art department, who do not have up-to-date software.\n  People like Christopher Hoskins make it possible for us to live each \nand every day in freedom, peace, and security. Their sacrifices, in \nlands thousands of miles away, keep us safe here at home. We must never \nforget those sacrifices.\n  So today I salute the courage and commitment of Christopher Hoskins, \na young man who lost his life fulfilling the noblest of callings, \ndefending our Nation and the values we hold dear. And I offer my \nheartfelt sympathies to his parents, Richard and Claudia, his siblings, \nKristin, Erin, and Sean, and to everyone who knew and loved him.\n\n\n                              Steve Reich\n\n  Mr. Dodd. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in tribute of U.S. \nArmy MAJ Steve Reich, of Washington, CT, who lost his life on duty in \nAfghanistan on June 28, 2005. He was 34 years old.\n  Major Reich, a member of the 160th Special Operations Aviation \nRegiment known as ``The Nightstalkers,'' was killed along with 15 other \nsoldiers in a helicopter crash in the eastern mountains of Afghanistan. \nHis service to his country will not be forgotten.\n  Steve was respected in his small home town both for his abilities on \nthe baseball diamond and for his caring personality.\n  He was a star pitcher before entering the military. With the rare \ncombination of a blazing fastball and uncanny control, Steve was an \nAll-Star at every level. He pitched in two championship games for \nShepaug Valley High School before moving on to West Point. In his debut \nagainst the Naval Academy, he pitched a one-hitter.\n  He was a member of the U.S. National baseball team in 1993 and played \nfor it in Italy, Nicaragua, and Cuba. He was rightly very proud of \nhaving carried the American flag for the team in the World University \nGames. He later signed with the Baltimore Orioles farm system and \npitched two games before being recalled to active duty.\n  Major Reich was as accomplished in the military as he was on the \nbaseball field. He learned to pilot three models of Army helicopter and \nbecame a company commander in his regiment. He was serving his fourth \ntour of duty after having already been stationed in Korea, Hungary, \nBosnia, and Albania.\n  He was known in his unit for his willingness to serve by example and \nhis composure, something that, no doubt, made him a great leader and \nkept those who served with him safer.\n  Despite the fact that he was a hero to those in his hometown, Steve \nwas modest. He had won a bronze star for service, but he never told his \nfamily what\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\nheroic acts he performed to deserve the award. He went out of his way \nto show his appreciation for the warm welcomes that he received from \nhis community on the rare occasions that he was able to return home. On \nChristmas, he and his sisters would deliver treats to say thanks to his \nfriends and neighbors.\n  Countless members of his community said that they admired Steve's \nselflessness and that they felt safer knowing that he was watching out \nfor them.\n  His friends and family took great joy in the fact that he met and \nmarried Jill Blue during the past year. It warmed the hearts of those \naround him that he found someone to marry because he had always had so \nlittle time for a personal life. They said that his wedding day in \nMarch was the happiest day of his life. My heart truly goes out to \nJill, who has suffered the kind of loss that is difficult for most of \nus to comprehend.\n  And I offer my deepest sympathies to his parents, Ray and Sue, and \nhis sisters, AnnMarie and Megan, whose loss is too great for words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9429-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9429-S9431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NAVY SEALS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Earlier in this week I along with General Brown and \n     many others have been attending memorial services for our \n     United States Army Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the \n     160th, located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and Hunter Army \n     Air Field, where as you all know we lost eight brave Special \n     Operations Aviators.\n       This morning we pause to honor the memory of ten Navy \n     SEALS, in particular the six SEALS who were home ported here \n     at the Naval Amphibious Base in Little Creek. I'd also like \n     to extend a welcome to those who can't be with us physically \n     in this theater right now. The theater holds 1800 people and \n     we filled that up earlier this morning. And for those of you \n     in the overflow where we have nearly 2000 people seated, I \n     welcome you this morning and I apologize that we did not have \n     space for everybody to be in here physically. But I know, \n     spiritually, that you're with us and we sincerely appreciate \n     you being part of the ceremony this morning.\n       My remarks will be short. I think it's important that you \n     hear from the friends and loved ones, and also Commodore Pete \n     Van Hooser has got some very important things to say.\n       But what I would like to say as the Commander for Naval \n     Special Warfare and the head of this community, how proud I \n     am to be the Commander for Naval Special Warfare and have the \n     opportunity to lead and serve with these ten fine men. Naval \n     Special Warfare is the smallest war fighting community in the \n     Navy. There's 1750 enlisted men and six 600 officers. We're a \n     small town, we literally know each other, and honestly, for \n     those of you it may be hard to believe if you see the way we \n     act with each other, we love one another.\n       Everything that you see here and everything this morning \n     was put together by their Teammates. I'd like to call your \n     attention to the operational equipment that we have forward \n     here on stage. It traces its proud heritage back to World War \n     II. The Underwater Demolition Teams and the Navy Combat \n     Demolition Units and you'd have to go all the way back to \n     World War II to get the number of Naval Special Warriors who \n     died in one day in one military operation. The loss of one \n     SEAL, the loss of one military man is more than we could \n     possibly bear, but to have ten or our brave men perish in one \n     day along with eight of our Nightstalkers is truly a \n     remarkable day and one that will always be etched in our \n     memory.\n       But before you though you have UDT swim fins, a UDT \n     lifejacket, a web belt and a mask. And it may seem strange to \n     you knowing that these Naval commandos died on a mountain top \n     7,500 feet in elevation in a country 300 miles from the sea. \n     But our nation called. These are the same people that flew \n     the planes into the Twin Towers that flew the plane into the \n     Pentagon that also flew the plane into the ground in \n     Pennsylvania. The Al Qaeda and the Taliban are barely \n     distinguishable and these are the people that these brave \n     men, these ten men, went out to meet and engage in combat. So \n     although the operational equipment that they had on them that \n     day on the 28th of June was not swim fins, not a UDT life \n     jacket, not a mask, perhaps a K-Bar. We thought it's \n     appropriate because we are first and foremost warriors from \n     the sea, Navy men, that we honor them today as SEALs and Navy \n     men.\n       The last thing I'd like to just mention is the knife that's \n     on the web belt. The K-Bar also dates back to the knife used \n     by the UDT in World War II. And a tradition in Naval Special \n     Warfare when a young man finishes his training and is awarded \n     his trident, when he is awarded his trident he is also \n     presented a K-Bar, and on that K-Bar is inscribed the name of \n     a SEAL who went before him, where he died, and the date he \n     died on. So that knife would always link him to the past and \n     serve as an inspiration to him as a SEAL in combat in the \n     future. These ten knives that we have up here are now etched \n     with your husbands, your son, your brother, your father, your \n     uncle, your nephew, your neighbor, your friend, and to us our \n     Teammates names. You can take these home with you today, and \n     I hope that you treasure them, but what I want you to know is \n     that in the future when fellow SEALs become SEALS and they \n     are presented with their K-Bars, the name of these men will \n     be engraved to serve as an inspiration to future SEALs in \n     combat, our teammates.\n       And I want to leave you with this. We have a creed, we have \n     many things in Naval Special Warfare, but to sum it up, it is \n     loyalty to our teammates dead or alive. These ten men are no \n     longer with us, that doesn't mean that our allegiance and our \n     covenant ends with them today. We will remain their teammates \n     forever and to the family members sitting here, always know \n     that we will always be there from them, always there for you \n     and, we will always stay connected. God bless and thank you.\n       I'd like to go into the awards presentation now and I ask \n     all of the guests and military to remain seated as we make \n     the presentations so that all can see.\n       The Silver Star Medal, Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple \n     Heart Medal, Combat Action Ribbon and Afghanistan Campaign \n     Medal will be presented posthumously for the actions in the \n     following citation below.\n       On Tuesday 28 June 2005, thirty members of Naval Special \n     Warfare Task Unit-Afghanistan were preparing to conduct a \n     direct action mission when they were tasked to respond as a \n     Quick Reaction Force to reinforce a four-man Navy SEAL \n     reconnaissance element engaged in a fierce firefight near \n     Asadabad, Konar Province, Afghanistan.\n       The reconnaissance element was bravely fighting Anti-\n     Coalition Militia, who held both a numerical and positional \n     advantage. The ensuing firefight resulted in numerous enemy \n     personnel killed, with several of the SEALs suffering \n     casualties.\n       After receiving the task to reinforce, the Quick Reaction \n     Force loaded aboard two MH-47 U.S. Special Operations Army \n     helicopters planning to air assault onto a hostile \n     battlefield, ready to engage and destroy the enemy in order \n     to protect the lives of their fellow SEALs. Demonstrating \n     exceptional resolve and fully comprehending the ramifications \n     of the mission, the Quick Reaction Force, while airborne, \n     continued to refine the plan of attack to support both the \n     reinforcement task and hasty execution of their intended \n     deliberate assault.\n       As the helicopter approached the nearly inaccessible \n     mountainside and hovered in preparation for a daring fast-\n     rope insertion of the SEALs, the aircraft was struck by an \n     enemy rocket-propelled grenade fired by Anti-Coalition \n     Militiaman. The resulting explosion and impact caused the \n     tragic and untimely death of all SEALs and Army Night \n     Stalkers onboard.\n       These men answered the call to duty with conspicuous \n     gallantry. Their bravery and heroism in the face of severe \n     danger while fighting a determined enemy in the Global War on \n     Terror was extraordinary. Their courageous actions, zealous \n     initiative and loyal dedication to duty reflected great \n     credit upon themselves, Naval Special Warfare, and the United \n     States Navy. For the President, Vern Clark, U.S. Navy, Chief \n     of Naval Operations.\n       The presentations this morning will be made by Commodore \n     Pete Van Hooser, Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group Two\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\n     and Master Chief Chuck Williams, Command Master Chief of SEAL \n     Team Ten.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple Heart \n     Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal \n     posthumously to LCDR Erik Kristensen, United States Navy.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple Heart \n     Medal, Combat Action Ribbon and Afghanistan Campaign Medal \n     posthumously to LT Mike McGreevy, United States Navy.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple Heart \n     Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal \n     posthumously to Chief Fire Controlman Jacques Fontan, United \n     States Navy.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple Heart \n     Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal \n     posthumously to Electronics Technician 1st Class Jeffrey \n     Lucas, United States Navy. Accepting his father's awards is \n     his son, Seth Lucas.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Bronze Star Medal with Valor, Purple Heart \n     Medal, Combat Action Ribbon and Afghanistan Campaign Medal \n     posthumously to Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Jeffrey Taylor, \n     United States Navy.\n       The President of the United States takes pride in \n     presenting the Silver Star Medal, Purple Heart Medal, Combat \n     Action Ribbon, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal posthumously to \n     Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Danny Dietz, United States Navy.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthese exceptional remarks by Admiral Maguire. Our great country will \nforever owe these courageous SEALs a debt of gratitude for their \nselfless actions in battle on June 28, 2005. While I am sorry that the \nfamilies of these men have suffered such an irreplaceable loss, I am \nproud that America produced such fine gentlemen who valiantly answered \nthe call to defend these United States. Recalling our national anthem, \nI say, we would not be ``the land of the free'' were we not also the \n``home of the brave.''\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the 10 \ncourageous sailors who lost their lives in Afghanistan during Operation \nEnduring Freedom on June 28, 2005, by reading the eloquent words of \nU.S. Navy CAPT Pete Van Hooser, Commander, Naval Special Warfare Group \nTwo, during a memorial speech at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek on \nJuly 8, 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this tribute in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       (By CAPT Pete Van Hooser)\n\n       I am always humbled in the presence of warriors. We have \n     been in sustained combat for over 3 years--things have \n     changed.\n       I find myself speaking in public a lot more than I would \n     like, but I always start by thanking four groups of people. \n     The first are our warriors who haven fallen; the second, \n     those who have guaranteed that those who have fallen will not \n     be left behind. Some with their bravery, others with lives.\n       I thank those who have selflessly pulled themselves off the \n     line to train the next warriors to go forward--so that they \n     may surpass the prowess of those currently engaged.\n       And I am thankful for the families that nurture such men.\n       My remarks will be focused on these families and the men \n     who wear the trident. We would not be able to do our jobs \n     without the brave men and women of the Army, Air Force, and \n     Marine Corps. Task Unit--Afghanistan of Naval Special Warfare \n     Squadron Ten, was comprised of SEAL Team Ten and SEAL \n     Delivery Vehicle Team Two and One, had many U.S. Navy rates \n     other than SEALs that trained and deployed by our side, and \n     we recognize and are grateful for the professional efforts of \n     all. But this time and this place is about the SEALs.\n       Leonidas, the Spartan King, hand-picked and led a force to \n     go on what all knew to be a one-way mission. He selected 300 \n     men to stand against an invading Persian force of over 2 \n     million. They were ordered to delay the advance the Persian \n     Army. Selecting the battlefield was easy--the narrow mountain \n     pass at Thermopylae restricted the combat power that the \n     enemy could apply--allowing the superior fighting skills of \n     the 300 Spartans to destroy the will of this Persian Army to \n     fight. These Spartan warriors died fighting to the last man.\n       The Persian invaders were defeated by the Greek Army in \n     later battles. Democracy and freedom were saved.\n       Most know this story. But most of us don't know how \n     Leonidas selected the 300 men. Should he take the older \n     seasoned Warriors who had lived a full life, should he take \n     the young lions that felt they were invincible, should we \n     take the battle-hardened, backbone-proven warrior elites in \n     their prime, or should he sacrifice his Olympic champions?\n       The force he chose reflected every demographic of the \n     Spartan Warrior class. He selected those who would go based \n     solely on the strength of the women in their lives. After \n     such great loss, if the women faltered in their commitment, \n     Sparta would falter and the rest of Greece would think it \n     useless to stand against the Persian invaders. The democratic \n     flame that started in Greece would be extinguished.\n       The Spartan women were strong. They did not falter. I would \n     even argue that we live in a democracy and have freedom \n     because of the strength, skill, and courage of these 300 men \n     and the extraordinary will and dedication of the women in \n     their lives.\n       The women in our lives are the same. I see the pride in \n     their wearing of the Trident symbol--I hear it in their \n     voices when they are asked what is that symbol, and they say \n     my husband, my son, my brother, or my dad is a Navy SEAL--\n     usually they say nothing more.\n       If I were to say to the families, I feel your pain, that \n     could not be so. I can never know the depth of your \n     relationship or the anguish of your personal loss. What I can \n     say is the truth I know. Those who wear the trident provide \n     only brief glimpses into our world to those on the outside. \n     Even our families see only a limited view of the path we have \n     chosen. We are all different, but on the inside we share many \n     common beliefs and actions. We spend most of our adult lives \n     with other SEALs preparing for battle.\n       On this occasion I feel compelled to share our innermost \n     thoughts. I want to show you a little more of our world so \n     you can understand the way we see, the way we feel about what \n     happened.\n       There is a bond between those who wear a trident--that is \n     our greatest strength.\n       It is unique to this very small community. It is unique in \n     its intensity. It is nurtured by the way we train--the way we \n     bring warriors into the brotherhood. This bond is born in \n     BUD/S. It starts to grow the first time you look into the \n     eyes of your classmate when things have gone beyond what you \n     or he thinks is possible. It grows in the platoon as you work \n     up for deployment, and it grows around the PT circle. It's \n     the moving force behind every action in a firefight. This \n     bond is sacred. This bond is unspoken, unconditional, and \n     unending.\n       When it comes to fighting we are all the same inside. \n     During the first stages of planning, at the point where you \n     know you are going into the battle, we think about our \n     families. The master chief passing the word to the boys sums \n     it up, ``I am going home to my kids and you are going home to \n     yours. Here is our next mission.''\n       We never stop planning--we never stop thinking through \n     every contingency--we want to cover every anticipated enemy \n     action. This is the way we face the risk.\n       There is a significant difference between inserting on a \n     mission where there may or may not be enemy contact or \n     serious resistance and inserting into a fight where forces \n     are already engaged. On 11 April, the men of this task unit--\n     during their initial week in Afghanistan, immediately shifted \n     from a helicopter training scenario directly into the fight \n     as a quick response force to help soldiers and marines in a \n     desperate battle. They made the difference--saving the lives \n     of our fellow servicemen and destroying the enemy.\n       Last week when these fallen warriors launched on this \n     mission, their SEAL teammates were fighting the enemy--fellow \n     SEALs were in peril--as always in the teams--in this--\n     situation there is no hesitation. It is not about tactics--\n     its about what makes men fight.\n       As you are going in hot--you can't help it--you must allow \n     one more small block of personal time. You think of those at \n     home--the people you--the people you left behind. For this \n     brief moment, there is no war.\n\n     Our souls have touched a thousand times before this moment\n     Boundless undefined shadows quietly surging through and \n           waking each other\n     On a moonless star rich night we patiently wait for the dawn\n     There is no distance\n     You smile a cool wind that takes away thirst\n     I will never know hunger\n     I have never known fear\n     Unspoken--Unconditional--Unending\n\n       It's the same bond--now your focus returns to your SEAL \n     teammates. Total focus on the approaching fight is all that \n     exists.\n       In April, when I heard of the Task unit's first contact \n     that very first week in country--when I saw the reports of \n     the enemy casualties they had inflicted--I was happy but not \n     too happy. Its was more of a quiet internal sharing of a \n     sense of satisfaction they had executed flawlessly.\n       Last week when I was told of their deaths and saw what they \n     were trying to accomplish, I was sad--but not too sad. It was \n     more of a quiet and internal recognition that they had gone \n     to the wall, and there was no hesitation. They were \n     warriors--they are SEALs\n       We are not callous. We don't have the luxury of expressing \n     our emotions at will. In these times our duty is to press on \n     and finish the fight, for all depends on each man's \n     individual actions.\n       We answer to a higher moral calling on the path that \n     requires us to take and give life. It is this dedication to \n     ideals greater than self that gives us strength. It is the \n     nurturing of our families that gives us courage. Love is the \n     opposite of fear--it is the bond that is reinforced when we \n     look in the eyes of another SEAL that drives super human \n     endurance. My teammate is more important than I.\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\n       The enemy we face in Afghanistan is as hard and tough as \n     the land they inhabit. They come from a long line of warriors \n     who have prevailed in the face of many armies for centuries. \n     It is their intimate knowledge of every inch of the most \n     rugged terrain on earth that is matched against our skill, \n     cunning, and technology.\n       They are worthy adversaries and our intelligence confirms \n     that they fear and respect us. They have learned to carefully \n     choose their fights because as SEALs we answer the bell every \n     time.\n       When you see the endless mountains--the severe cliff--the \n     rivers that generate power that can be felt while standing on \n     the bank--the night sky filled with more stars then you have \n     ever seen--when you feel the silence of the night were no \n     city exists--when the altitude takes your breath away and the \n     cold and heat hit the extreme ends of the spectrum--you \n     cannot help being captured by the raw strength of this place.\n       This is a great loss. These men were some of the future \n     high-impact leaders of naval special warfare, but I take \n     refuge in the thought that there is no better place a \n     warrior's spirit can be released then the Hindu Kush of the \n     Himalayas.\n       In their last moments, their only thoughts were coming to \n     the aid of SEAL brothers in deep peril. I can say that any \n     one wearing a trident would gladly have taken the place of \n     these men even with full knowledge of what was to come.\n       Some of those on the outside may understand that the one \n     man who was recovered would possibly make this loss \n     acceptable. Only those who wear the trident know, if no one \n     had come back, it would all have been worth the cost.\n       These men are my men. They are good men. The SEAL teams--\n     this path is my religion. This loss will not go unanswered.\n       I am always humbled in the presence of Warriors.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like associate myself with these exceptional \nremarks by Captain Van Hooser. Our great country will forever owe these \ncourageous SEALs a debt of gratitude for their selfless actions in \nbattle on June 28, 2005. While I am sorry that the families of these \nmen have suffered such an irreplaceable loss, I am proud that America \nproduced such fine gentlemen who valiantly answered the call to defend \nthese United States. Recalling our national anthem, I say, we would not \nbe ``the land of the free'' were we not also the ``home of the brave.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9431-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9431-S9432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GENERAL LOUIS HUGH WILSON, JR.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to GEN \nLouis Hugh Wilson, Jr., U.S. Marine Corps, 26th Commandant of the \nCorps. General Wilson was the embodiment of everything the Marine Corps \nand our Nation stands for. I am honored to read the eloquent eulogy \ndelivered by General Carl Epting Mundy, Jr., U.S. Marine Corps, 30th \nCommandant of the Corps, delivered in the Old Chapel, Fort Myer, \nVirginia, 19 July 2005, in General Wilson's memory.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this tribute in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Eulogy for General Louis Hugh Wilson, Jr.\n\n                  (By General Carl Epting Mundy, Jr.)\n\n       Three years after I graduated from the Basic School at \n     Quantico, I was ordered back to become an instructor. I \n     reported to the adjutant, who informed me that the commanding \n     officer was absent for a few days, but would return the \n     following week. He advised, further, that it was the \n     colonel's policy to address all newly forming companies of \n     lieutenants on the first day of training, which would occur, \n     coincidentally, on the day of his return, and that I should \n     be there.\n       At 0700 on the prescribed day, I mustered with a half-dozen \n     instructors and couple of hundred new lieutenants in the \n     outdoor classroom just in front of the headquarters building. \n     Precisely at 0715, the front door opened and a tall, rangy, \n     all-business-looking colonel walked out. We were called to \n     attention, then put at ease and given our seats. The colonel \n     spoke for probably no more than 8 to 10 minutes, citing what \n     was to be accomplished and what was expected of the \n     lieutenants in the next 6 months. He concluded by saying: \n     ``While you're here, you'll find many things that are wrong . \n     . . that are not to your liking . . . not the way you would \n     do them--and you'll find yourselves talking about how `they' \n     ought to change this or that . . . and how `they' just don't \n     understand the problem. When you have those thoughts or \n     discussions'' he went on, ``I want you to remember: I . . . \n     am they!''\n       He stood looking at us for probably no more than 5 seconds, \n     which seemed like minutes. Not a head turned; not an eye \n     blinked, and I'm sure 200 second-lieutenant minds were \n     working in unison to figure out how they could go through 26 \n     weeks of training without ever once uttering the word, \n     ``they''!\n       This was my first association with then-COL Louis Wilson. \n     Like a few others, the ``I am they'' assertion became pure \n     ``Wilsonian'' over the years, and like me, I suspect that \n     many here this morning have heard it on more than one \n     occasion. It contained a little humor, but it also \n     characterized the man as the leader he was: ``I am `they'; \n     I'm in command; I'm responsible; I give the orders.''\n       Even beyond his years in the Corps, these characteristics \n     continued. His good friend, Bill Schreyer--chairman of the \n     board of Merrill-Lynch when General Wilson served, after \n     retirement, as a director of that company--tells the story of \n     a board meeting at which a particularly difficult issue was \n     being deliberated. After considerable discussion, during \n     which a number of thoughts and ideas emerged, but without \n     definitive resolution of the issue, Director Wilson said, \n     ``Mr. Chairman, if Moses had been a member of this board, \n     instead of ``The Ten Commandments'', we would have wound up \n     with ``The Ten Suggestions!''\n       Louis Hugh Wilson, Jr., was born and grew up in Branson, \n     MS. His father died when he was five, and those family \n     members who knew him then characterized him--even as a small \n     boy--as exhibiting a clear feeling of responsibility for his \n     Mother and sister. He worked at a variety of jobs throughout \n     his school years to help with their support. After graduation \n     from high school, he enrolled at nearby Milsaps College, \n     majored in economics, ran track, played football and joined \n     the ``Pikes''--Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.\n       In the summer after his freshman year, he and a buddy took \n     a job laying asphalt over the dirt and gravel roads of \n     Mississippi, and while working one day, a car passed, \n     carrying an attractive local high school graduate named Jane \n     Clark. ``I sure would like to get to know that girl,'' Louis \n     remarked to his buddy. ``No chance, Lou, she's taken,'' his \n     friend answered.\n       Wrong answer! Within a short time, Lou and Jane were \n     dating, and by the time she followed him a year or so later \n     to Milsaps, they were courting. When he graduated in 1941 and \n     went off to officer candidate training in the Marines, and \n     then into the war in the Pacific, they ``had an \n     understanding,'' and she waited. They became ``Captain and \n     Mrs. Wilson'' 3 years later, when he returned from \n     hospitalization after the battle for Guam.\n       Captain Wilson got a bride, but the Corps got one of its \n     most gracious future first ladies--one beloved by all who \n     have had the privilege of knowing her--but none more so than \n     the Wilson aides-de-camp over the years to whom she became \n     known as ``President of the Aides' Protective Society'' with \n     an occasional early morning call just after the General \n     departed quarters for the office, wishing them--in her soft, \n     Southern manner--``a wonderful day--even though it may not \n     start that way!''\n       Throughout their career, and to the present, Jane has been \n     an inspiring role model to all of us in both the good and the \n     hard times. Indeed, a legion of Marines are glad that Lou's \n     friend on the hot asphalt road in Mississippi in 1938 was \n     wrong when he predicted: ``No chance, Lou.''\n       Captain Wilson's action on Guam was the beginning of the \n     many highlights in his career. I was privileged to be on the \n     island with him in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of its \n     liberation, and while there, walked the battleground on Fonte \n     Hill with him where he remembered and described every move as \n     he assembled and maneuvered the remnants of his company and \n     those of the other companies of his battalion to secure the \n     heights. Only then . . . having been wounded three times . . \n     . did he allow treatment of his wounds and medical \n     evacuation.\n       The following day, I hosted a sad ceremony at Asan Point--\n     near the beach where, 50 years earlier, he had landed. \n     Because of mandated personnel reductions in the Corps--the \n     9th Marines--the regiment in which he had served on Guam--was \n     being deactivated. As its proud battle color was furled, \n     General Wilson placed the casement over it.\n       There is, however, a humorous sequel to this event. Enroute \n     back from Guam, we stopped in Hawaii to attend the change of \n     command of Marine Forces, Pacific. The day allowed time for a \n     round of golf before the ceremonies that evening. As General \n     Wilson and I were having breakfast before teeing-off, a \n     retired marine--red baseball cap and all--came over to our \n     table to warmly greet the general. Turned out they had been \n     in the 9th Marines together, and the conversation turned \n     quickly to something like this: ``Lou, who's this new \n     Commandant that's doing away with the 9th Marines? What does \n     he think he's doing? You need to get hold of him and \n     straighten him out!''\n       The breakfast could have undoubtedly been more entertaining \n     for those around us had he done so, but without introducing \n     me, General Wilson graciously responded that he knew it was a \n     tough decision, but that were he still Commandant, he \n     probably would have had to make the same one. He wished his \n     retired friend a good game, and sat back down to breakfast \n     with a wink and big grin for me. I was grateful to have \n     ``They'' on my team that morning!\n       Throughout the decades of service that marked his career, \n     Louis Wilson established the reputation of a firm, but fair \n     leader who was devoted to the welfare and readiness of \n     marines and would lay his career on the line for them; who \n     asked straight questions and expected no ``off the record'' \n     answers or hidden agendas; and who, while he could show \n     understanding, did not easily suffer fools.\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\n       During his tenure as Commanding General of Fleet Marine \n     Force, Pacific, as North Vietnamese forces closed in, the \n     evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon was ordered, using \n     ships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and embarked marines from \n     Okinawa, including then-COL Al Gray's 4th Marines. As the day \n     wore far longer than had been planned due to the panicky \n     influx of hundreds more evacuees than the embassy had planned \n     for, the operation continued through the night and into the \n     wee hours of the following morning.\n       About 3 a.m., word came into the command center in Hawaii \n     that the Seventh Fleet Commander had signaled that the \n     helicopter crews which had been flying since early that day \n     had reached their administrative maximum allowed flying hours \n     and that he intended to suspend flight operations to allow \n     crew rest, even though a hundred or more marines still \n     remained in the besieged embassy.\n       Although he was not in the direct chain of command for the \n     operation, an infuriated General Wilson immediately sent back \n     a message stating that under no circumstances would such an \n     order be given, that Marine helicopters would continue to fly \n     so long as marines remained in Saigon, and that if the \n     Seventh Fleet Commander issued such an order, he, Wilson, \n     would personally prefer court martial charges against him. \n     The order was never issued, the helicopter crews kept flying, \n     and the remaining marines were evacuated.\n       A year later found the Secretary of Defense looking for a \n     new Commandant, and ``Wilson'' was a name high on the list. \n     While many important people are involved in the naming of any \n     new Commandant, there are a couple who merit special note in \n     this case.\n       The Wilsons had become very happy in Hawaii, and nearing \n     the point at which his career might come to an end, he had \n     been extended a lucrative job offer; Janet was a senior in \n     high school; and Jane had found a ``Dream House'' on the \n     slopes overlooking Wailai Golf Course and the blue Pacific. \n     As the likelihood of his being nominated to become Commandant \n     took shape, the Wilsons sat down for a family conference to \n     discuss the choices. After a brief discussion, Janet brought \n     a decisive end to their deliberations when she said, ``Dad, \n     you've talked for a long time about all the things that are \n     wrong in the Marine Corps. This is your chance to fix them.'' \n     He thought for a moment, and then responded, ``OK, we'll do \n     it.'' And so, perhaps history should record that it was Miss \n     Janet Wilson who, as much as anyone, brought us the 26th \n     Commandant!\n       But there was another player who should not go without \n     note. When the selection was made, Secretary of Defense Jim \n     Schlesinger directed an assistant to ``get General Wilson in \n     Hawaii on the phone.'' Moments later, the assistant reported, \n     ``Sir, he's on the line''. Schlesinger picked up the phone \n     and said, ``Lou, I'm delighted to inform you that the \n     President has selected you to be the next Commandant of the \n     Marine Corps.'' There was a pause, and the voice at the other \n     end of the line responded, ``Sir, I'm deeply honored by your \n     call. I've always had great admiration for the Marines, but \n     do you really think I'm qualified to become Commandant?'' \n     Schlesinger's assistant had dialed the Commander of Pacific \n     Air Forces in Hawaii--also a Lieutenant General named Lou \n     Wilson!\n       A few minutes later, when the right Wilson was reached, \n     Schlesinger repeated the same congratulatory message, but \n     ended by saying: ``However, Lou, you should know that my \n     first call turned me down!'' So perhaps--in the spirit of \n     jointness--we also owe the U.S. Air Force a debt of \n     gratitude!\n       Lou Wilson became Commandant at a time when the Corps \n     needed him. Fewer than 50% of those who filled our ranks were \n     high school graduates. Illegal drug use was rampant. \n     Lingering Vietnam era recruiting had brought a fair number of \n     criminals into the Corps. Riots and gang intimidation were \n     common. His comment when he assumed command, set the stage \n     for his attack on these problems: ``I call on all marines to \n     get in step and do so smartly!''\n       His tenure as Commandant would be marked by firm \n     initiatives to ``get the Corps in step'' again. Overweight \n     marines, ``high-water'' trousers, shaggy haircuts, and \n     moustaches became early points of focus. The word went out: \n     ``If I see a fat marine, he's in trouble--and so is his \n     commanding officer!'' More than a few commanders got early \n     morning calls from the Commandant that began: ``Who's minding \n     the store down there? Seems like you might be looking for a \n     different line of work!'' Prompt administrative discharges \n     from the Corps for ``those who can't, or don't want to \n     measure up to our standards'' were authorized. The Air-Ground \n     Combat Center at 29 Palms came into being to cause marines to \n     prepare for the next war, instead of the last one--and it \n     might be recalled that the ``next big one'' after Vietnam was \n     in the desert sands of Kuwait, and the Combined Arms \n     Exercises at 29 Palms were the training grounds.\n       The Wilson years, and those that followed would rehone the \n     Marine Corps into what it remains today--the finest military \n     organization in the history of the world.\n       But if Fonte Hill on Guam, and the Medal of Honor was the \n     early signature of Lou Wilson, it may be that his enduring \n     mark on the Corps--and our entire joint military \n     establishment--is that which he achieved in his final \n     ``Hill'' battle near the end of his tenure as Commandant.\n       A quarter-century earlier, after a period of intense debate \n     as to the role of the Marine Corps in the national defense \n     establishment, the National Security Act had made the \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps a ``part-time'' member of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff only when matters of Marine Corps \n     interest were at issue. This denigration of the Corps to \n     second-class citizenship had long been an insult and \n     irritation. Within the organization of the Joint Chiefs, a \n     policy existed that when the chairman was absent from \n     Washington, the next ranking chief would assume authority as \n     ``acting chairman''.\n       In early 1978, the Chairman and all other chiefs of \n     service, except General Wilson, were absent from Washington. \n     A memorandum from the Director of the Joint Staff indicated \n     that in the absence of the chairman, and the Chiefs of the \n     Army, Navy, and Air Force, the vice chief of staff of the \n     Army was appointed ``acting chairman''. An irritated \n     inquiry from the Marine Corps gained a response from the \n     Director that ``the Commandant cannot be appointed acting \n     chairman because he is only a part-time member of the \n     Joint Chiefs.''\n       Like when Miss Jane Clark drove by four decades earlier--\n     already with a ``steady'' and ``no chance''--or when the \n     Seventh Fleet Commander was about to suspend flight \n     operations: Wrong Answer!\n       General Wilson quietly and without fanfare, took the issue \n     to Capitol Hill, and when the 1979 Defense authorization bill \n     came out, it contained a provision that made the Commandant \n     of the Marine Corps a full-fledged member of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff.\n       Indeed, the legacy achieved by its 26th Commandant for the \n     Corps sits before us today. Without Lou Wilson's personal \n     perseverance and victory, it is not likely that GEN Pete \n     Pace, the chairman designate, or GEN Jim Jones, the Supreme \n     Allied Commander in Europe, or GEN Jim Cartwright, the \n     combatant commander, U. S. Strategic Command, would be in \n     their positions today. Lou Wilson elevated his Corps from a \n     bureaucratic, second-class category to co-equal status with \n     every other branch of the armed services . . . and his \n     country--and the profession of those who bear arms in its \n     defense--will be forever the beneficiaries.\n       And so, as we assemble today to bid farewell to one of the \n     true giants of our Corps and our Nation, let us do so with \n     gratitude that America produces men the likes of Louis \n     Wilson--and that ``they'' choose to become Marines. Semper \n     Fidelis\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with these \nexceptional remarks by General Mundy. I recall my modest service in the \nMarine Corps during the Korean War and later as Secretary of the Navy, \nwhere I witnessed firsthand the impact of General Wilson's efforts in \nthe Corps. His tremendous legacy will forever challenge future Marines \nto become part of the best fighting force on the Earth. While I am \nsaddened by the General's passing, I am proud that America produced \nsuch a fine gentleman who valiantly answered the call to defend these \nUnited States. Recalling our national anthem, I say, we would not be \n``the land of the free'' were we not also the ``home of the brave.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9432-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9432-S9433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN KENNETH J. PANOS, USN\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to \nCAPT Kenneth J. Panos, U.S. Navy. Captain Panos will retire from the \nNavy on September 1, 2005, having completed an exemplary 26-year career \nof service to our Nation.\n  Captain Panos was born in Union, NJ, and is a 1979 graduate of the \nU.S. Naval Academy. He also earned a masters degree in Financial \nManagement from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.\n  During his military career, Captain Panos excelled at all facets of \nhis chosen profession. As a naval aviator, he deployed to South America \nand the Caribbean. While serving aboard USS Paul (FF 1096), Captain \nPanos participated in peacekeeping operations in the waters off Beirut, \nLebanon.\n  In 1986, Captain Panos was redesignated a full-time support officer \nin the Navy Reserve. He reported aboard Helicopter Anti-Submarine \nSquadron (Light)-94 as the head of the Maintenance, Training and \nAdministration Departments and achieved 1,000 flight hours in the SH-2F \nSeasprite while deployed aboard various Navy Reserve Force frigates. \nHis outstanding capacity for leadership was recognized when he was \nselected as the HSL-94 Junior Officer of the Year in 1988. During \nCaptain Panos' tour as the assistant reserve programs director/reserve \nservice officer and later department head at Naval Air Station Willow \nGrove, he transitioned to fixed-wing aircraft and achieved an airline \ntransport pilot rating while flying the UC-12B transport.\n  Captain Panos made good use of his graduate degree in financial \nmanagement with assignments in the Aviation\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\nBudgets and Requirements Office; the Chief of Naval Operations' Staff \nwhere he was assistant for aircraft procurement; research, design, test \n& evaluation; and ship construction appropriations; the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of the Navy for Financial Management; and as the \ndirector, Programming and Financial Management Division for the Chief \nof Navy Reserve. Many of my colleagues know Captain Panos from his \nservice as the Navy's legislative affairs liaison for Reserve matters \nand anti-terrorism/force protection programs.\n  The U.S. Navy is a better Navy thanks in part to the talent and \ndedication of CAPT Kenneth J. Panos. While Captain Panos' retirement \nmeans the Navy will lose a fine officer, I am happy to report to this \nbody that he has found a replacement. His oldest son, Michael, is \ncurrently a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy. His youngest son, \nRobert, is a sophomore at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, \nVirginia. I know all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Ken, \nhis hometown sweetheart and wife Karen, as well as Michael and Robert, \non the completion of an outstanding military career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9433-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ROMANIA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to express solidarity with the \npeople of Romania in the aftermath of the fatal floods that occurred \nearlier this month. As a consequence of the heavy rainfalls that \noccurred in Romania from July 1 to July 17, 2005, 24 people are \nreported to have lost their lives, and some 800 towns and villages \nsuffered damage to road infrastructure, farmlands, and utilities.\n  The United States and Romania have a strong and continuing \nrelationship. In April 2003, the Senate voted unanimously to bring \nRomania into NATO. It represented a vote of confidence in the Romanian \npeople and I was honored to witness that expression of American support \nas chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Romania's commitment \nto the Alliance is evident in its active participation in the Balkans, \nAfghanistan and Iraq. I am hopeful that Romania will be invited to join \nthe European Union in the near future.\n  The United States and Romania cooperate closely in a number of areas. \nFollowing the terrorist attacks on September 11, Romania has been fully \nsupportive of the global war on terrorism. Among other actions, it \ncontributed transport aircraft and more than 400 troops to Afghanistan. \nIn addition, Romania permitted the use of its territory--land, airspace \nand seaports--for the U.S.-led military action against Iraq, and \ndispatched non-combat troops to the region. Romania currently has \napproximately 900 troops in Iraq, and approximately 500 troops in \nAfghanistan.\n  I commend Romania for its consistent contribution to international \npeace and stability. Since 1991, it has participated in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations in the Gulf, the former Soviet Union, Africa, \nand the Balkans. Just yesterday, the Department of State issued a press \nstatement welcoming the decision by the Romanian cabinet to accept \napproximately 450 Uzbek asylum seekers on a temporary basis as part of \nthe resettlement processing. The asylum seekers had sought initial \nrefuge in the Kyrgyz Republic following the May violence in Uzbekistan. \nRomania stands as a role model in the international community for those \nwho are committed in words and actions to the United Nation's \nprinciples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9433-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9433-S9434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRESS' EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AGRICULTURE SECURITY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr President, I have come to the floor again to speak \nabout the ability of the United States to prevent and respond to a \nterrorist attack on American agriculture, a topic that I believe \ndeserves more attention from the Congress and the administration.\n  That is why I commend the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry for holding a hearing on agroterrorism last week. This was \ntheir first hearing on the subject, and I welcome their interest \nbecause I have been pursuing the passage of legislation on agriculture \nsecurity for the past 3 years.\n  I first introduced agriculture security legislation, S. 2767, the \nAgriculture Security Preparedness Act, which was referred to the \nAgriculture Committee, in the 107th Congress. Unfortunately, it was not \nacted upon in that Congress. I reintroduced my legislation in the 108th \nCongress and again in the 109th. I am pleased that S. 573, the \nAgriculture Security Assistance Act, was included in S. 975, the \nProject Bioshield Act of 2005, and I thank the bill's chief sponsor, \nSenator Lieberman, for that inclusion.\n  The strong potential for the American food supply system to be a \ntarget of terrorist attack and the severe repercussions such an attack \nwould cause are widely accepted among experts. At the July 20 \nAgriculture Committee hearing, Mr. John Lewis, Deputy Assistant \nDirector, Counterterrorism Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nFBI, testified:\n\n       Most people do not equate terrorist attacks with \n     agroterrorism. But the threat is real, and the impact could \n     be devastating.\n\n  Another witness, Dr. Robert Brackett, Director, Center for Food \nSafety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, FDA, added:\n\n       A terrorist attack on the food supply could have both \n     severe public health and economic consequences, while \n     damaging the public's confidence in the food we eat.\n\n  According to the Department of Agriculture, USDA, the United States \nfood and fiber system accounts for approximately 12 percent of our \ngross domestic product and employs 17 percent of the U.S. workforce. \nYet the infrastructure that composes this sector of the economy, which \nis central to American prosperity, is often not viewed as critical as \npower lines, bridges, or ports. We cannot underestimate our dependence \non America's breadbasket.\n  On March 9, 2005, the same day I introduced my two agriculture \nsecurity bills, S. 572, the Homeland Security Food and Agriculture Act, \nand S. 573, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a \nreport I requested entitled, ``Much is Being Done to Protect \nAgriculture from a Terrorist Attack, but Important Challenges Remain'' \n(GAO-05-214). The GAO report reviews the current state of agriculture \nsecurity in the United States and points to a number of key areas where \nimprovement is necessary, such as the inability of USDA to deploy \nanimal disease vaccines in 24 hours and the lack of foreign animal \ndisease knowledge among USDA-certified veterinarians.\n  GAO also confirmed information I had received from the National \nAssociation of Agriculture Employees that the agricultural mission of \nCustoms and Border Protection, CBP, was insufficiently prioritized. GAO \nfound that the number of agricultural inspections at U.S. borders had \ndeclined by 3.4 million since the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \ntook over the border inspection responsibility from USDA.\n  In February 2005, I wrote to then-DHS Undersecretary for Border and \nTransportation Security Asa Hutchinson expressing my concern over the \ndecline in border inspections because I know how important they are to \nthe economy of Hawaii--home to more endangered species than any other \nState. In response, I received a commitment from DHS to hire additional \nagriculture specialists at CBP to ensure the agricultural mission does \nnot go unmet.\n  Also noted in the GAO report were shortcomings in DHS's Federal \ncoordination of national efforts to protect against agroterrorism. The \nFederal agencies involved in agriculture security--DHS, USDA, FBI, and \nFDA, to name a few--claim they are working closely with each other. \nHowever, one only need look at the June 2004 incident in Washington \nState, where 18 cattle developed chromium contamination, to see that \nthere are communication gaps at the Federal level. Agroterrorism was \nsuspected, yet neither USDA nor DHS were notified.\n  In May 2004, representatives from the FBI, FDA, and USDA gave a \npresentation at an agroterrorism conference in Kansas City, MO, on \nlessons learned from the Washington outbreak which included a slide \nstating that the following agencies should be contacted if \nagroterrorism is suspected: a State's Department of Agriculture, FDA, \nUSDA, FBI, local law enforcement, and State and county public health \nofficials.\n  Why was the Department of Homeland Security not on the list?\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\n  It is apparent that Federal coordination remains inadequate if \nnotification of DHS is considered unnecessary by other responding \nagencies.\n  To ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to agroterrorism, \nmy bills address many of the concerns raised by GAO and others. The \nHomeland Security Food and Agriculture Act will: increase communication \nand coordination between DHS and State, local, and tribal homeland \nsecurity officials regarding agroterrorism; ensure agriculture security \nis included in State, local, and regional emergency response plans; and \nestablish a task force of State and local first responders that will \nwork with DHS to identify best practices in the area of agriculture \nsecurity.\n  The Agriculture Security Assistance Act will: provide financial and \ntechnical assistance to States and localities for agroterrorism \npreparedness and response; increase international agricultural disease \nsurveillance and inspections of imported agricultural products; require \nthat certified veterinarians be knowledgeable in foreign animal \ndiseases; and require that USDA study the costs and benefits of \ndeveloping a more robust animal disease vaccine stockpile.\n  I look forward to working with the Agriculture Committee as \nagriculture security legislation moves forward. As ranking member of \nthe Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, I will continue to make agroterrorism a priority for the \nFederal Government, and I ask my colleagues to join me in this quest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9434-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, 40 years ago, in 1965, African Americans \nwere excluded from almost all public offices in the South. At that \ntime, with 21 million people fenced out of the political process, our \nnation was suffering a devastating failure. A failure to fulfill one of \nits signature promises: representation for all.\n  As I speak here today, African-American and Hispanic voters are now \nsubstantially represented in the state legislatures and local governing \nbodies throughout the South. And 81 minority Members currently serve in \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  This turn-around came as the result of a monumental struggle, a \nstruggle in which Americans risked their lives to secure the right to \nvote. They marched in Alabama and across the South to protest the use \nof poll taxes, literacy tests, and other barriers erected in Southern \nStates to exclude African Americans from the political process. African \nAmericans were harassed, intimidated, and physically assaulted for \nsimply trying to vote. Televised broadcasts brought the horrible images \nof attacks on peaceful protesters with nightsticks, tear gas, and \npolice dogs into the living rooms of citizens throughout the country. \nSome brave souls, and some innocent bystanders, lost their lives in \nthis struggle for justice, which still today stands as a testament to \nthe power of ideas and nonviolence to bring about crucial social and \nlegal change.\n  Two days after ``Bloody Sunday,'' a day on which protesters in Selma, \nAlabama, were attacked by State troopers while crossing the Edmund \nPettus bridge, President Johnson sent the Voting Rights Act to \nCongress. In response to the horrific events in Selma and after years \nof efforts in Congress and around the country, on August 6, 1965, the \nVoting Rights Act was signed into law.\n  The act outlawed barriers to voting, such as literacy tests, and \nempowered the Federal Government to oversee voter registration and \nelections in counties that historically had prevented African Americans \nfrom participating in elections. Since its enactment, the Voting Rights \nAct has been extended four times--in 1970, 1975, 1982, and 1992. \nChanges included increasing the act's scope to cover non-English \nspeaking minorities such as Latinos, Asian Americans and Native \nAmericans, Alaskan Natives, and other minority groups. It has also been \nused to examine and challenge new election formats that dilute minority \nvotes and have a discriminatory effect.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been hailed as the most important piece of \nfederal legislation in our Nation's history. Not just the most \nimportant piece of civil rights legislation, but the most important \npiece of legislation ever passed. This may well be true: it is from our \npolitical rights, our rights of citizenship, that all other freedoms \nflow. Without a meaningful chance to vote, there can be no equality \nbefore the law, no equal access to justice, no equal opportunity in the \nworkplace or to share in the benefits and burdens of citizenship.\n  The Voting Rights Act is also considered one of the most successful \npieces of civil rights legislation ever enacted. In Selma, Alabama, in \n1965, 2.1 percent of blacks of voting age were registered to vote. \nToday, more than 70 percent are registered.\n  Still, we must remember that the fight is not over. On this 40th \nanniversary of the Voting Rights Act, many Americans are still \ndisenfranchised by discriminatory redistricting plans, voter \nintimidation tactics, long lines at polling places and inadequate \nnumbers of voting machines, and lifetime restrictions on voting rights \nfor ex-felons.\n  In 2007, key elements of the Voting Rights Act, including the Federal \npre-clearance requirement, are due to expire. The pre-clearance \nrequirement is especially important. It requires Federal approval of \nany proposed changes in voting or election procedures in areas with a \nhistory of discrimination. The Supreme Court in South Carolina v. \nKatzenbach, the case that upheld Congress's power to impose these \nrequirements, aptly called this a shifting of the ``advantage of time \nand inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims.'' It \nsimply means that voters in these areas do not have to refight the \nbattles they won in the civil rights struggle. These provisions of the \nAct are crucial.\n  As we approach, the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Voting \nRights Act on August 6, I urge my colleagues and the citizens of this \ngreat Nation to renew our commitment to protect and strengthen the \nright to vote for all Americans. That right is the foundation of our \ndemocracy and it must never again be denied to a group of Americans \nbased on the color of their skin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9434-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9434-S9436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention a troubling development in our efforts to support the \nreunification of Cyprus. I have recently learned that the State \nDepartment is encouraging members of Congress and their staffs to \ninitiate certain visits to the country through an airport in the \nillegally occupied area of the island--an airport that is not \nauthorized by the Republic of Cyprus as a legal port of entry. In fact, \nthe airport is built on property that was expropriated from its lawful \nowners following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.\n  As you may know, Cyprus was forcibly divided by an invasion of \nTurkish troops more than 30 years ago. Today, the United States and the \nworld community recognize that the Turkish invasion was illegal, and \nthat the Republic of Cyprus, which controls \\2/3\\ of the island, is the \nonly legitimate government of Cyprus. For years, as reflected in our \ndomestic law and echoed in several U.N. Security Council Resolutions, \nU.S. foreign policy has refused to give either recognition or direct \nassistance to the self-declared administrative authority in the \noccupied area, the so-called ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.'' \nIndeed, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended following the \nTurkish invasion, has established that the United States supports a \nfree government for Cyprus, the withdrawal of all Turkish forces from \nCyprus, and the reunification of the island communities.\n  On the specific matter of flights into Cyprus, the U.S. is bound by \nthe Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which both \nthe U.S. and Cyprus are signatories. The Chicago Convention provides \nthat ``[t]he contracting States recognize that every State has complete \nand exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory,'' \nincluding designation of official ports of entry. The Republic of \nCyprus's sovereignty over the entire territory of Cyprus has been \nrecognized and reaffirmed by numerous U.N. Security Council Resolutions \nas well as\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nlong-standing U.S. policy. Because the Republic of Cyprus has never \nauthorized direct flights into the airports in the occupied area, and \nbecause it has not designated these airports as official ports of \nentry, entering the country through these airports is a direct \nviolation of the Chicago Convention. Simply put, our State Department \nshould not be authorizing, encouraging, or even condoning such a \nblatant violation of international law.\n  Moreover, flights into an occupied airport violate local Cypriot law. \nIf Cypriots visit the United States, they cannot just land a plane in \nthe middle of the country--they must land at an airport that is an \nimmigration and customs point of entry. We would rightly object if a \nCypriot landed at an unauthorized airport in our country, and we should \nnot be encouraging Americans to do so in Cyprus.\n  Over the past year, I believe the administration has been playing \nfast and loose with U.S. policy toward Cyprus, and has, at times, been \nless than forthcoming to me and others who are concerned with the \nviability of our efforts to facilitate reunification of the island.\n  In late October 2004, officials from the U.S. Transportation Security \nAdministration--over the protests of the Government of Cyprus--\nconducted an inspection of the airport at Tymbou, which is one of the \nairports in the occupied area. When I expressed my concern to the State \nDepartment that such a visit was not appropriate because flights into \nthat airport would violate international and Cypriot law and are \ninconsistent with U.S. law, the Department assured me that it was not \nchanging its policy toward Cyprus. Instead, I was told that ``the visit \n. . . was a liaison visit to conduct a general review of the aviation \nsecurity posture and was fully consistent with the TSA's mandate to \npromote international aviation security.'' It now appears that this \nvisit may have been an early step toward encouraging Members of \nCongress and staff to land at this illegal airport.\n  This past June, Members of Congress travelled, at the behest and \nfunding of a Turkish Study Group, to occupied Cyprus and arrived at an \noccupied airport. Concerned that the State Department was permitting a \nblatant violation of international law and domestic Cypriot law, I \nraised this issue with the Secretary of State. I have now received a \nreply letter from Mr. Matthew Reynolds, Acting Assistant Secretary of \nState for Legislative Affairs, which I will submit for the Record.\n  The letter indicates that the State Department has ``authorize[d] \nU.S. Government officials to travel directly to northern Cyprus using \ntourist passports.'' It further states, ``[w]e have taken great care to \nensure that our steps are consistent with U.S. and international law. \nNeither U.S. nor international law prohibits U.S. citizens from \ntraveling directly to the area administered by Turkish Cypriots. . . . \nIn fact, courts in the Republic of Cyprus have explicitly refused to \npenalize Greek Cypriots who have chosen to so travel.''\n  This position misses the mark on several levels. First, as I \nexplained earlier, the Chicago Convention--to which the U.S. is bound--\nbars flights into a country's territory without the country's consent. \nCyprus simply has not consented, and thus these flights are flatly \ninconsistent with applicable international agreements. Second, although \ninternational law does not penalize individuals for taking such \nunauthorized flights, that point is irrelevant--the Chicago Convention \nis directed at States, not individuals. Third, there can be no doubt \nthat such trips are suspect--even the State Department seems to admit \nthey cannot be undertaken on an official government passport. And \nfinally, the decision by the government of Cyprus not to prosecute \nthose who make illegal landings is a gesture of restraint, designed to \npromote the freedom of movement among the two communities. It is absurd \nto use this commendable restraint as a justification for encouraging \nfurther violations of the law.\n  As justification, Mr. Reynolds stated that ``we have taken [these] \nsteps in support of the U.N. Secretary General's call on the \ninternational community to ease the isolation of the Turkish \nCypriots.'' I agree this is a noble cause in principle, but it must be \npursued in a way that is consistent with international norms, local \nCypriot law, and broader U.S. and international efforts to bring \ntogether the two communities on the divided island. Several U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolutions--which the Secretary General's remarks did \nnothing to abrogate--confirm the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\n  Moreover, the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots is already \nbeing addressed effectively by the ongoing economic support and \nconfidence-building measures sponsored or supported by the Republic of \nCyprus. Flights that conflict directly with international and Cypriot \nlaw and divide the two communities on Cyprus serve only to discourage \nthe government of Cyprus from undertaking such positive measures. \nMoreover, there is literally no reason to encourage such flights--the \ngovernment of Cyprus permits, and is even prepared in appropriate \ncircumstances to facilitate, free passage to the occupied territory for \nthose who arrive at a legal airport of entry.\n  Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, and the EU has been \nvery active on resolving the Cyprus problem, from providing a forum for \nresolving the dispute with Turkey to proposing direct economic \nassistance to the Turkish-occupied area. It is interesting to note, \nhowever, that the EU members respect Cyprus sovereignty--not one EU \nmember country flies into the occupied airports. It is inappropriate \nfor the U.S. to get ahead of the EU on the resolution of this conflict \nwithin its territory.\n  I hope that my colleagues and their staffs who may be asked to visit \nCyprus through an occupied airport will note the concerns I address \nhere today. I would respectfully ask them to consider whether they \nthink it is appropriate for a member of the Cypriot legislature to \nvisit the United States through an illegal point of entry. I would also \nask them to consider why the State Department has indicated that travel \nto occupied Cyprus should not be on an official passport or in an \nofficial capacity. I also urge members to read the Chicago Convention \nand the U.N. Security Council Resolutions on Cyprus to see that these \nactions are in direct contravention to our international commitments. \nAnd I ask them to consider whether it is appropriate for a U.S. \nofficial to land at an airport that was built on land illegally taken \nfrom its lawful owners following Turkey's invasion of Cyprus.\n  While I have the floor, I would like to take a moment to review all \nthe positive developments that we are witnessing in Cyprus, which \ncontinue despite the administration's divisive actions. It is \nundeniable that the situation in Cyprus is moving forward. The Republic \nof Cyprus has proposed measures to open new crossing points along the \ncease-fire lines; withdraw military forces from sensitive areas; \nincrease the ability of Turkish Cypriot-owned trucks, tourist buses and \ntaxis to cross the Green Line that divides Cyprus; increase trade \nacross the Green Line, and open up ports to greatly facilitate trade. \nFurther, the Republic of Cyprus is unilaterally clearing all land mines \nfrom the National Guard's minefields in the buffer zone.\n  The Republic of Cyprus is also ensuring the economic development in \nthe occupied area. Since April 2003 (when the Turkish military relaxed \nits movement restrictions) there have been more than 2.3 million border \ncrossing by Cypriots into the occupied area. These visits have \ncontributed more than $57 million to the economy of occupied Cyprus. In \n2003 and 2004, the Republic of Cyprus paid more than $43 million in \nsocial insurance for Cypriots in the occupied area. Turkish Cypriots \nhave been provided by the Republic of Cyprus with more than $9 million \nin free hospital and medical care, and more than $343 million in free \nelectricity. The Republic of Cyprus does not isolate its citizens \nliving in the occupied area--more than 63,000 have been issued Republic \nof Cyprus birth certificates, more than 57,000 have been issued \nRepublic of Cyprus identity cards, and more than 32,000 have been \nissued Republic of Cyprus passports.\n  It is also important to remember that the U.S. and Cyprus have always \nenjoyed a strong relationship. We have worked together on terrorism, \nthe war in Iraq, suppressing money laundering, and other initiatives. \nFor instance, in the lead up to the war in Iraq, Cyprus\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\napproved overflight rights for U.S. and other Coalition military \naircraft as well as use of Cypriot airports. Important areas of \ncooperation between the U.S. and Cyprus are spelled out by the U.S.-\nCyprus Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. The treaty has been in force \nsince September 2002 and facilitates bilateral cooperation in the fight \nagainst global terrorism, organized crime, drug-trafficking and related \nviolent crimes. Cyprus is the first European Nation to sign on to \nPresident Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative, which provides for \nshipping inspections and intergovernmental cooperation that is designed \nto stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The addition of \nCyprus to the PSI is particularly significant because Cyprus has the \nsixth largest commercial shipping fleet in the world. It is plain that \nCyprus and the United States share common goals and common values.\n  This is a critical time for Cyprus. The two communities of Cyprus are \nmoving together, their economies and peoples forming links like never \nbefore. The actions of the U.S. must encourage and foster \nreunification, not push the communities apart with divisive actions \nthat challenge the sovereignty of the legitimate government of Cyprus. \nAll Americans, whether officials from the administration or from this \nbody, should educate themselves about these important issues before \nconsidering a trip to Cyprus though an illegal port of entry.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the following letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: Thank you for your letter of May 27 \n     regarding the policy and legal basis for allowing U.S. \n     citizens, including U.S. Government officials, to travel \n     directly into northern Cyprus. Our policy approach is based \n     on our assessment of what is most likely to produce progress \n     toward the Cyprus settlement that we all want to see. The \n     Turkish Cypriot community's vote in favor of the Annan Plan \n     in April 2004 marked a historic shift by that community in \n     favor of such a settlement, and thus fundamentally altered \n     the situation on the island.\n       Denying the Turkish Cypriots direct links with the \n     international community, despite the fact they have done what \n     the world asked of them, would in effect punish them for the \n     fact that the Annan Plan was not accepted by the majority of \n     Greek Cypriots. Such an approach inevitably would weaken \n     Turkish Cypriot support for a settlement. It would also \n     hamper efforts to narrow the economic gap between the two \n     communities, unnecessarily raising the cost to the Greek \n     Cypriots and the world of any prospective settlement.\n       Based on this analysis, we have taken steps in support of \n     the UN Secretary General's call on the international \n     community to ease the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. One \n     of the steps we took was to authorize U.S. Government \n     officials to travel directly to northern Cyprus using tourist \n     passports, for the purpose of establishing the sorts of \n     international links that we believe are appropriate. We \n     regret that some view our limited steps vis-a-vis the Turkish \n     Cypriot community to be in some way directed against the \n     Republic of Cyprus. We continue to work diligently not only \n     to maintain, but to enhance, our good relations with the \n     Republic of Cyprus.\n       We have taken great care to ensure that our steps are \n     consistent with U.S. and international law. Neither U.S. nor \n     international law prohibits U.S. citizens from traveling \n     directly to the area administered by Turkish Cypriots. \n     Moreover, U.S. citizens are not alone in traveling to that \n     area: Greek Cypriots, other EU nationals, and foreign \n     nationals from non-EU countries regularly fly directly to and \n     from Ercan (Tymbou) airport. In fact, courts in the Republic \n     of Cyprus have explicitly refused to penalize Greek Cypriots \n     who have chosen to so travel.\n       I hope this information is useful in understanding the \n     policy and legal basis of our decisions and clarifies that \n     our efforts are aimed solely at promoting a comprehensive \n     solution to the Cyprus problem so that all Cypriots can live \n     and work together in peace on a reunified island. If you have \n     any further concerns on this matter, please do not hesitate \n     to contact us.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                          Matthew A. Reynolds,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n     Legislative Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9436-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CNOOC\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, great concern has been raised by this \nSenator, and others, in recent weeks regarding efforts by the China \nNational Offshore Oil Corporation, known as CNOOC, to acquire the \nprominent U.S. oil company, Unocal, based in California. The Unocal \nBoard has endorsed a takeover bid by Chevron, also a California \ncompany, which its shareholders will vote on in the coming days.\n  This Senate needs to be aware, however, that CNOOC, which is \nessentially an arm of the Chinese government, may well be planning to \nraise its bid to acquire Unocal, and what greatly disturbs this Senator \nare reports in the press that they are waiting for Congress to adjourn \nfor August before making a renewed bid--a move that directly challenges \nthe Congress and the authority granted to it by the Constitution to \nregulate foreign commerce.\n  Moreover, this renewed bid heightens my concerns about the heavily \nsubsidized nature of CNOOC's financing. When foreign firms compete for \nassets in the U.S., it is essential that they do so on a level playing \nfield with U.S. companies. Government subsidies tilt this playing \nfield, and in doing so distort competition. This harms U.S. workers, \ncompanies and investors.\n  Congress recently approved an amendment to the Energy Policy Act that \nrequires the Administration to study these issues and report to \nCongress and the President. This amendment reflects Congress' strong \nreservations about the PRC's role in financing the acquisition of U.S. \nenergy assets, and about CNOOC bid for Unocal in particular.\n  CNOOC's decision to increase its bid would heighten my concerns about \nCNOOC's efforts. If anything, it reinforces my belief that subsidies of \nthis sort raise serious economic policy concerns and leave U.S. firms \nat an unfair competitive disadvantage. You can be sure that I will not \nbe alone amongst my colleagues, in the Senate and in the House, who \nwill be paying attention to what happens in the coming days, and if \nneed be, will be prepared to act when Congress returns in September.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9436-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9436-S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NATIONAL BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to welcome over 30,000 young \nmen to Washington D.C. for the 2005 National Boy Scout of America \nJamboree. I would also like to give my sincerest condolences to the \nfamilies of the four Boy Scout leaders who were tragically killed \nMonday afternoon in an accident while setting up camp.\n  Occurring every 4 years, the national jamboree is one of Scouting's \ngrandest traditions. It is a chance for thousands of young men to come \ntogether and celebrate our shared values and traditions as Americans. \nIn a world that too often celebrates our differences, the National Boy \nScout Jamboree is a unique opportunity to celebrate the qualities we \nall share as Americans.\n  It is also a chance for these young men to visit our Nation's Capital \nto be inspired by the monuments, to learn from our Nation's artifacts, \nand to see democracy in action. To those of us who work in Washington \nit is sometimes easy to forget just how amazing it is that a place like \nthis, where free men can gather, debate, and decide their own fates, \neven exists.\n  I was recently reminded of the significance of Washington by a young \nboy scout from Plymouth, MN, named Eyan R. Lason. In anticipation of \nhis trip to the National Boy Scout Jamboree this week, Eyan wrote an \nessay on what the trip and Washington mean to him. Eyan did not write \nhis essay as a requirement or to win a prize. In fact, until the other \nday Eyan didn't even know that I had read his essay. No, Eyan wrote his \nessay because he has a true appreciation for the values and spirit that \nthis city represents.\n  Eyan began his essay by describing his trip as ``A journey back to \nwhere America was made, an expedition to see and feel everything that \nthis country was based on, and is destined to become.''\n  Eyan is right. During his time here in Washington he will see our \nNation's values. But he would not find them in the architecture of our \nbuildings, or the history on display in the Smithsonian. No, Eyan will \nfind our Nation's values in the hearts of his fellow Scouts.\n  These young men represent the heart and soul of the American people. \nThey know that courage is not the absence of fear, but strength and \ncapacity to go\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nahead in spite of fear. They understand that you can not have justice \nfor one without justice for all. They believe in the equality of \nopportunity, not results. And they know that freedom is not free.\n  Boy Scouts are our friends and family, but as Eyan's letter shows us, \nthey are also our role models and leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Eyan R. Lason's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               National Jamboree and What It Means to Me\n\n                           (By Eyan R. Lason)\n\n       I start this paper staring at the ``Scout Guide'' to this \n     trip that I will soon embark upon. I look at my watch and see \n     the date, the time, and realize that my entire world is \n     racing towards a stand still . . . no a start to a voyage \n     which will be sure to last me the rest of my life. A journey \n     back to where America was made, an expedition to see and feel \n     everything that this country was based on, and is destined to \n     become.\n       Scouting has been a part of my life for more than 10 years \n     now. It has helped form me into the man that I am. Scouting \n     has given me many of the best experiences of my life, many of \n     which can never be forgotten. I have learned so much it is \n     hard to put it into words. I have been fortunate enough to \n     take pleasure in everything that scouting has to offer. From \n     the basic skills of life, to our week long summer camp in \n     Northern Minnesota, to Philmont's mountains in New Mexico, \n     and now most of all the ability to spend two weeks in this \n     Country's great capital.\n       I sit here in this chair wanting to express the true \n     bewilderment that I feel. Trying to communicate the huge \n     opportunity that has been granted to me in words, still there \n     are too many racing through my head to fully explain what I \n     am feeling. A teacher once told me that if you struggle \n     explaining an object be it a person place or event try using \n     a single word for the task, this time even that advice has \n     rendered me speechless. There is no possible way to express \n     my gratitude to the people who have simply handed me the \n     single greatest opportunity of my life.\n       One word, a sentence, or even this paper that I am writing \n     cannot express truly how grateful I am for the kindness of \n     others who have given me this opportunity. Truthfully, with \n     all my heart, I thank you.\n       Now is time for myself to try and explain what this \n     expedition means to me. I have concluded that the best way \n     for me to define this trip to you is use a symbol that every \n     man, woman, and child can recognize, the very flag of this \n     great country that we, the people, have proclaimed The United \n     States of America.\n       The flag is it's own special kind of genius. You see the \n     stars, stripes, and colors all inspire me in different ways. \n     Fifty Stars, thirteen stripes, and three colors are all part \n     of the master symbol of our country; all has given me more \n     than significant inspiration. Thus I will explain.\n       Fifty bright white stars represent each and every state of \n     this noble country. A National Jamboree is my destination \n     therefore I will get a chance to meet people from each and \n     every one of those states. An opportunity to experience \n     cultures specific to each region of this country, for each \n     state is represented by 1 of those fantastic stars on the \n     flag of this country.\n       Thirteen stripes on the banner that is this country, \n     thirteen stripes that embody the thirteen original colonies \n     that formed this country. All of which helped bestow all \n     Americans with the freedoms that we are blessed with. Those \n     colonies fought for what they considered was right, they \n     defended their freedoms. Who knew they were at the threshold \n     of creating the world's greatest country. A country free from \n     gross prejudice of one's ethnicity, beliefs, religion, \n     likes and dislikes.\n       Nobody in that time had any idea of the immense change \n     those thirteen colonies would make in the world, freedom that \n     today is defended by the greatest fighting force in the \n     world, the United States Armed Forces. The U.S. Armed Forces \n     fight for our country protecting us from people who dislike \n     our ability to be unrestrained in our everyday lives. The \n     U.S. Armed Forces, like the people in those thirteen original \n     colonies, are fighting for what the think is right. Why do \n     they risk their lives? Simple their own, and others, belief \n     in freedom is worth fighting for. After all freedom is not \n     free.\n       Myself as an American hold my freedom on the highest \n     pinnacle. Those thirteen colonies that started this whole \n     country have granted all Americans with the greatest possible \n     gift. So I am grateful for the ability to go back to many of \n     these great colonies and see what they fought for, experience \n     what they fought and hopefully get a glimpse of what it will \n     become. I am so grateful to be given the opportunity to be \n     able to see the naval ports, see the modern day defenders of \n     our country and how they do what they do.\n       Red; the color that represents the hardiness and valor of \n     this Nation, red is for the blood, sweat and tears that have \n     gone into making this great country what it is. Hardiness for \n     the millions who have served this Nation with pride. \n     Hardiness for all of those who endured through the cannon \n     blasts of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, hardiness for the \n     ones who spent hundreds of hours in the grueling trenches of \n     World War One. Hardiness for the near Thirteen million United \n     States Soldiers who, once again, proved to the world we will \n     not sit quietly in World War Two, welldeserved valor for the \n     individuals in Middle Eastern countries currently defending \n     us from terrorism each day. All of which have proven to the \n     world that we are the true protectors of freedom. Proved to \n     me, and the world, what it means to be hardy and valorous. \n     Red is the color that represents the millions of individual's \n     sacrifices for me, for this Nation. And when I stand at this \n     Nation's capital and look at Old Glory waving, I will \n     remember those individuals and their sacrifices, and I will \n     thank them.\n       Bright white stripes, six of them on the flag, hold the \n     beliefs of purity and innocence of this Nation. Purity and \n     innocence that in this modern day uphold America as a \n     defender not as an aggressor. In this day America is a world \n     power not a world conqueror. Purity is for those who hold \n     themselves true by using their rights as a good citizen, by \n     supporting their country in what it does, by participating in \n     this country's democracy. We can show purity by respecting \n     other citizens of this country, innocence by living our lives \n     without regrets. Myself as a scout can obtain and uphold this \n     Nation's purity and innocence by living the Scout Oath and \n     Law. I can live the Scout Oath and Law and show others to \n     take pride in themselves and in their country, by being able \n     to go to Washington DC. I can demonstrate these actions and I \n     can influence others to do so.\n       There is a field of blue on the flag for justice, \n     perseverance, and vigilance. One's peers provide fair justice \n     in this country. This country has for nearly 100 years served \n     in protecting itself and others from assailants. Providing \n     justice to where it is deserved. From the improper acts of \n     Pre-Revolutionary War Britain, Nazi Germany, the Jungles of \n     Vietnam, or Terrorist occupied Middle Eastern Countries \n     America has proven its evenhandedness. Perseverance is \n     surely this country's most pronounced value. If \n     perseverance were not valued so highly in this country it \n     would simply not exist. Perseverance made this country, \n     made it and has kept it here for the past 229 years.\n       What if we had not persevered in the Revolutionary war? \n     Would America still be here? The most likely answer is no. \n     The Civil War without perseverance would have ended in the \n     Confederate States of America. Not only in wars must we \n     persevere in life we must. If people do not try hard to \n     complete things, this country, this world would not be the \n     great place it is. Vigilance is simply defined by Webster as \n     ``Alert Watchfulness'' and I could not label it better \n     myself. America has watched over its people and the world \n     doing its best to keep all safe. In a single week I will see \n     these values and all their meaning when I am in D.C. I will \n     value them every day of my life as I always have as far back \n     as I can remember. I can see the documents that made America \n     free. As far as seeing perseverance, I cannot list all the \n     sights and sounds that are supreme examples to me of that \n     value. Justice can be seen in small things as someone stating \n     their opinion of right and wrong to another individual, or a \n     single person standing before a judge a twelve of his peers, \n     however I will be able to see it on the grandest scale the \n     supreme court of America. I can see vigilance as I will go to \n     Pentagon City and for those opportunities that have been \n     given to me I am truly grateful.\n       As I have stated in the above topics the values that are \n     presented on the flag are the one's that I will value most on \n     this trip to the United States Capital. The fifty states that \n     hold the values true, thirteen colonies that made it all \n     happen, hardiness, valor, purity, innocence, justice, \n     perseverance, and vigilance are all valued highly by many but \n     the ones who make values more than just a value are citizens \n     of the United States of America. Boy Scouts, doctors, \n     lawyers, auto mechanics, pilots, military personal are all \n     people that make this country what it is, and that is the way \n     it is supposed to be in a democracy. I am eternally grateful \n     to be able to be an American and having this tour to the \n     Nations Capital given to me just reinforces my strong beliefs \n     in this country and the people who belong to it.\n       I would like to thank the complete organization of the Boy \n     Scouts of America. I would also like to personally thank my \n     Scoutmaster Mr. Jeff Radke, the whole Jungers family, Mr. \n     Mike Simonet, and my parents for letting me go on such an \n     endeavor.\n       Thank You All So Much.\n       To the members of the United States Armed Forces, \n     nationwide Firefighters and Policemen and Women, I thank you \n     for the sacrifices that you have made, and are willing to \n     make on behalf of myself and this entire nation. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. In closing, I thank Eyan and all of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica for their service not only to God and country, but also to \ntheir homes and committees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9437-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9437-S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of Senators the \ntroubling reality in Iraq that is described in two recent Government \nreports, one by the Government Accountability Office and the other by \nthe Office of the Special\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.\n  Documented in these reports are assessments of the precarious and \ndeteriorating security situation on the ground, which has dramatically \nslowed the pace of reconstruction and resulted in significant \nadditional costs. This picture is in stark contrast to the rhetoric \ncoming from the administration that we are in the last throes of the \ninsurgency and that reconstruction is moving forward at a rapid pace.\n  The reality is that because of the security problems in Iraq, the \nresults of reconstruction are falling far short of what the \nadministration optimistically predicted and what we were told to \nexpect. While there has been important progress in building schools and \nhospitals and providing clean drinking water in some areas, exorbitant \nsecurity costs are forcing the scale back or cancellation of \nreconstruction projects. Unfortunately, there is little reason to be \noptimistic that the situation will improve in the short term.\n  According to today's Washington Post, the GAO reported that ``in \nMarch, the U.S. Agency for International Development canceled two \nelectric power generation programs to provide $15 million in additional \nsecurity elsewhere. On another project to rehabilitate electric \nsubstations, the Army Corps of Engineers decided that securing 14 of \nthe 23 facilities would be too expensive and limited the entire project \nto nine stations. And in February, USAID added $33 million to cover \nhigher security costs on one project, which left it short of money to \npay for construction oversight, quality assurance and administrative \ncosts.''\n  Furthermore, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction reported that after reviewing several reconstruction \ncontracts, it determined that more money was going to Government \ncontractors involved in the rebuilding process than was necessary. The \nformula used for disbursing special monetary awards, which are above \nand beyond basic fees, was producing excessively high awards. In some \ninstances, contractors were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars \ndespite not winning a contract or delivering a single service. Once \nagain, these reports shed light on the lack of oversight and \naccountability given to contracts in Iraq.\n  Given the enormous amount of money the United States is spending in \nIraq, the many reports of waste and profiteering by unscrupulous \ncontractors, and the President's request for additional hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for Iraq reconstruction in the fiscal year 2006 \nbudget, it is incumbent on the administration to respond to these \nreports in a forthright manner so that Congress can make informed \ndecisions about the use of these funds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9438-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9438-S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERNET GOVERNANCE AND THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, on July 14 the United Nations' Working \nGroup on Internet Governance, WGIG, issued its final report. WGIG was \nformed following the December 2003 U.N. World Summit on Information \nPolicy with the intention of simply developing a consensus definition \nfor ``intent governance'' and identifying relevant public policy \nissues. Ultimately the task force exceeded its mandate and laid out \nfour policy recommendations for the future of Internet governance. One \nunifying theme for all these options is that there should be ``a \nfurther internationalization of Internet governance arrangements'' \nbecause of WGIG's belief that ``no single government should have a pre-\neminent role in relation to international Internet governance''.\n  In other words, this U.N. task force report suggests that the \nhistoric role of the United States in overseeing the Internet's growth \nand shepherding its development should be terminated and that Internet \ngovernance should be politicized under U.N. auspices. The most extreme \nof the options laid out by the WGIG would transfer the authority and \nfunctions of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, \nICANN, a respected nonprofit organization which is currently overseen \nby the U.S. Department of Commerce, to a new body linked to and \ncontrolled by the United Nations. This would put international \nbureaucrats in charge of the Internet and relegate the private sector \nto a mere advisory role. And it raises the very troubling possibility \nthat the United States would have no more say over the future of the \nInternet than Cuba or China.\n  I am firmly opposed to any proposal to hand control of Internet \ngovernance over to the United Nations. The continuing investigation of \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into the scandal-ridden \nOil-for-Food program has revealed management of the U.N. to have been \nat best incompetent and at worst corrupt. Any suggestion for a greater \nU.N. role over the Internet is hopelessly premature. The first priority \nfor the United Nations must be fundamental reform of U.N. management \nand operations rather than any expansion of its authority and \nresponsibilities.\n  The Internet was created in the United States and has flourished \nunder U.S. supervision and oversight. The United States' fair and \nlighthanded role in Internet governance has assured security and \nreliability. While the roots of the Internet lie in the ARPANet project \nlaunched by the Department of Defense in 1969, the true birth of the \nmodern Internet began 10 years ago, in 1995, when the National Science \nFoundation opened the Internet to commerce, and the Netscape browser \nbecame available so that the general public could ``surf'' the World \nWide Web. The explosive and hugely beneficial growth of the Internet \nover the past decade did not result from increased Government \ninvolvement but, to the contrary, from the opening of the Internet to \ncommerce and private sector innovation. Subjecting the Internet to the \npoliticized control of the U.N. bureaucracy would be a giant and \nfoolhardy step backwards.\n  The Internet today is an unprecedented and tremendously beneficial \navenue for the free flow of information and commerce. Why would we want \nto even consider turning any degree of Internet control over to a \npoliticized and failure- prone multinational bureaucracy that cannot \npossibly move at ``Net speed''? Some of the nations involved in the \nWGIG deliberations have established pervasive Internet censorship and \nmonitoring systems to suppress the ability of their citizens to access \nthe truth, and to stifle legitimate political discussion and dissent. \nOthers maintain a state monopoly over telecommunications services, or \nsubject them to excessive taxation and regulation. Allowing such \nnations a voice in fundamental Internet governance would be dangerous \nand imprudent.\n  The WGIG report also contemplates an expanded U.N. role on \ncybersecurity matters. This is also deeply troubling. We simply cannot \nrisk a disruption of the information economy by cyberterrorists. One \nthing we have learned at the start of the 21st century is that some \norganized groups hate democracy and wish to inflict grave injury upon \nthe people and economies of freedom-loving nations. It would be naive \nand foolhardy if we did not assume that some of the individuals active \nin these terrorist organizations possess the technical expertise to \nplan and execute crippling attacks on the Internet, and that they are \npondering how to crash the net with the same diligence that Osama bin \nLaden gave to bringing down the World Trade Center. The Internet \nassumes greater economic importance with each passing year, both in the \nvalue of the commerce it facilitates as well as the functions it \nperforms. Today, for example, traditional telephone service is making a \nrapid migration from dedicated proprietary circuits to Voice Over \nInternet Protocol, VOIP. It is true that the Internet was designed to \nbe resilient against outside attacks, as ARPANet was conceived as a \ncommunications system that could survive the exchange of nuclear \nweapons. But we have learned in recent years that the greatest threats \nto Internet security are generated from within. The vital national \nsecurity interests of the United States and our allies demand that we \nmaintain an Internet governance regime capable of taking effective \npreventive measures against any attack that could wreak havoc upon us.\n  The continued assurance of competent and depoliticized Internet \ngovernance is clearly a matter of strategic importance to the security \nof the\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\nUnited States and to the entire world economy. I was therefore pleased \nthat the Bush administration announced on June 30 that the United \nStates would maintain its historic role over the Internet's master \n``root'' file that lists all authorized top-level domains. The U.S. \nPrinciples on the Internet's Domain Name and Addressing System issued \nlast month are: (1) The U.S. Government will preserve the security and \nstability of the Internet's Domain Name and Addressing System, DNS. It \nwill take no action with the potential to adversely affect the \neffective and efficient operation of the DNS. (2) Governments have a \nlegitimate interest in the management of their own country code top \nlevel domains (ccTLD). The U.S. will work with the international \ncommunity to address these concerns in a manner consistent with \nInternet stability and security. (3) ICANN is the appropriate technical \nmanager of the Internet DNS. The U.S. will continue to provide \noversight so that ICANN maintains its focus and meets its core \ntechnical mission. (4) Dialogue related to Internet governance should \ncontinue in relevant multiple fora. The U.S. will encourage an ongoing \ndialogue with all stakeholders around the world, and in the ensuing \ndiscussions the U.S. will continue to support market-based approaches \nand private sector leadership in the Internet's further development.\n\n  I applaud President Bush for clearly and forcefully asserting that \nthe U.S. has no present intention of relinquishing the historic leading \nrole it has played in Internet governance, and for articulating a \nvision of the Internet's future that places privatization over \npoliticization. At the same time the administration has recognized the \nneed for a continuing and constructive dialogue with the world \ncommunity on the future of Internet governance.\n  I intend to closely monitor further U.N. actions in this area, \nespecially the upcoming November meeting of the World Summit on the \nInformation Society, WSIS, in Tunisia. I also plan to consult with \nexperts and stakeholders regarding Internet governance, and will assess \nwhether a legislative approach is needed to ensure the principles laid \nout by the administration remain the basis of discussion on this \ncritical issue.\n  The growth of the Internet over the past decade, under the leadership \nand supervision of the United States, has been extraordinary. Over the \nnext decade we can expect to see the global population with Internet \naccess grow far beyond the 1 billion persons who presently enjoy that \nability. The population of the developing world deserves the access to \nknowledge, services, commerce, and communication that the Internet can \nprovide, along with the accompanying benefits to economic development, \neducation, health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock \nof democratic self-government. Inserting the United Nations into \nInternet governance would be a dangerous detour likely to hinder, if \nnot cripple, the fulfillment of the full promise of the most dynamic \nand important communications infrastructure in all of human history. We \nsimply cannot afford the delay and diversion that would result from \nsuch an unfortunate deviation from the path that has brought the \nInternet to its present and almost miraculous state of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9439-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9439-S9440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to praise the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation for their efforts in ensuring the highest standards for \nanimal and public health in this country. Before coming to Congress, I \npracticed veterinary medicine, and I appreciate the AVMA's role in \nhelping veterinarians excel and grow in their professions.\n  At this time, I would like to read for the record remarks recently \ngiven by the president-elect of the AVMA, Dr. Henry E. Childers, at \ntheir 142nd Annual Convention in Minneapolis:\n\n       Members of the House of Delegates, the World Veterinary \n     Association, other international guests, friends and \n     colleagues . . . I am honored to be a part of this historic \n     gathering. I am especially pleased to welcome my fellow \n     veterinarians from around the world and to be addressing \n     those participating in the first gathering of the World \n     Veterinary Association in the United States since 1934.\n       Seventy-one years ago, the AVMA and the World Veterinary \n     Association met to discuss the hot issues of the day: poultry \n     diseases, advances in food animal medicine, food safety and \n     global disease surveillance. Today we are meeting once again \n     and discussing the issues of our day: poultry diseases, \n     advances in food animal medicine, food safety and global \n     disease surveillance.\n       3,917 veterinarians attended that 1934 meeting in New York \n     City at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, many from the same \n     countries that are joining us today. To each I extend our \n     most sincere welcome, especially to our colleagues from \n     Afghanistan and Iraq. I hope you find this experience to be \n     one of the most memorable of your career.\n       Well, here we are, 71 years later. And while we may have \n     different languages and customs, different ways of \n     communicating with our clients and treating our patients, we \n     have come together once again precisely because we have more \n     in common than ever before. We are united in our quest for a \n     better world and better medicine for both animals and humans. \n     We are united in our concerns, we are unified in our \n     challenges, and we are unified in the celebration of our \n     achievements. We are what veterinary medicine is all about.\n       When I told my wife Pat that I was giving this speech, she \n     reminded me of something Muriel Humphrey once told her \n     husband, Hubert, this country's vice president and a favorite \n     son from this great State. She said, ``Hubert, a speech does \n     not have to be eternal to be immortal.'' I will try to \n     remember that.\n       I come before you today slightly imperfect. As many of you \n     know, I just had a knee replacement.\n       My recent surgery got me thinking, do any of us truly \n     appreciate our knees? Really appreciate the foundation they \n     provide? I know I did not, not until they both gave out on \n     me. I quickly came to realize, however, that my knees must \n     work together in unity in order for me to complete the tasks \n     I take for granted. I just assumed they would provide a solid \n     foundation without much attention from me. I was sadly \n     mistaken.\n       Paying attention to our profession's basic principles is \n     what I would like to talk to you about today. We all assume \n     that our professional unity and our rock solid foundation are \n     perpetual. They are not. Without attention and care, our \n     foundation can slowly begin to erode. That is why I am \n     dedicating my presidency to the care and nurturing of our \n     professional unity--the essential cornerstone of our great \n     profession.\n       Traditionally, past AVMA presidents have used this time to \n     present you with a roster of very specific recommendations \n     for new programs and initiatives. Many of those \n     recommendations have resulted in impressive and important \n     changes within the AVMA.\n       But different times call for different approaches. I come \n     before you today with a total commitment to spending my year \n     at the helm of this great organization working to reaffirm \n     our unity.\n       As president-elect, I have spent much of the past year \n     speaking to a wide variety of veterinary associations and \n     student organizations. In May, when I gave the commencement \n     address at Auburn, I was reminded of my own graduation. I was \n     reminded of my classmates and my professors. Of the long \n     hours and challenges that we faced and survived. I think back \n     to the unity we felt as a class and our coordinated effort to \n     help each other. Doing whatever it took to ensure that each \n     individual met the challenges of the curriculum and \n     graduated.\n       Unity got us through school and a C+ mean average did not \n     hurt.\n       And on our graduation day, we became veterinarians. Not \n     equine veterinarians. Not bovine veterinarians. Not small-\n     animal veterinarians. We became veterinarians--members of a \n     select group of professionals that dedicate their lives to \n     ensuring the highest standards in animal and public health.\n       Why is unity more important today than ever before? Aesop \n     said it better than I ever could: ``We often give our enemies \n     the means for our own destruction.''\n       Today our profession is facing challenges, the likes of \n     which we have never seen before. From town hall to Capitol \n     Hill, from the classroom to the laboratory, from the farm to \n     the dinner table, our attention is being pulled in a myriad \n     of directions. In light of those challenges, we must remain \n     focused, we must stay united. While we may practice in \n     different disciplines involving different species of animals, \n     we must be of one vision, one voice. We must maintain the \n     highest standards in medicine and public health, encouraging \n     and assisting others in accomplishing the same. While we may \n     practice in different parts of the world, we must foster \n     unity with our fellow veterinarians from around the globe. \n     Good medicine knows no boundaries, knows no borders. We must \n     cooperate and collaborate with our fellow veterinarians \n     worldwide to make this world a better place for animals and \n     humans alike.\n       Has there always been perfect unity within the profession? \n     If you look back in the annals of our convention or in the \n     Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, you \n     will see many instances where we did not all agree. We are a \n     diverse profession, and there are bound to be differences in \n     opinion. But I would argue that the French essayist, Joubert, \n     was right when he said, ``the aim of argument, or of \n     discussion, should not be victory, but progress.''\n       Some of the differences our profession is experiencing \n     today may just be a reflection of what is happening to \n     society as a whole.\n       For example, we have moved away from an agricultural \n     society. In the past 20 years,\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\n     many of our colleagues have chosen a metropolitan setting, \n     where they concentrate on companion animals. As a result, the \n     number of food animal graduates has slowed to a trickle. The \n     reality, however, is that food animal practitioners are more \n     important to society than ever before. There is an acute \n     shortage of food animal veterinarians during a time when the \n     world is threatened by zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. \n     At the same time, we are experiencing the same crisis level \n     shortages of public health veterinarians. Most new graduates \n     are not choosing a career in this essential segment of \n     veterinary medicine. The profession must find ways to \n     encourage undergraduates to enter food animal and public \n     health practice.\n       In an attempt to resolve the critical food animal \n     veterinary shortage, AVMA has been working on a number of \n     strategies and initiatives.\n       For example, as many of you know, the AVMA helped fund a \n     study to estimate the future demand and availability of food \n     supply veterinarians and to investigate the means for \n     maintaining the required numbers.\n       AVMA also approved and financially supported the \n     development of benchmarking tools for production animal \n     practitioners by the National Commission on Veterinary \n     Economic Issues. These benchmarking tools are designed to \n     provide our current practitioners with help in ensuring that \n     their practices are financially successful. That, in turn, \n     will assist in attracting future veterinarians to food animal \n     practice.\n       The government relations division of the AVMA is diligently \n     working to convince Congress to provide Federal funding for \n     the National Veterinary Medical Service Act. If fully funded, \n     that act could go a long way toward encouraging recent \n     graduates to practice food animal medicine in underserved \n     areas and provide veterinary services to the Federal \n     Government in emergency situations. Just last month, the \n     Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee approved \n     $750,000 for a pilot program. We applaud the efforts of \n     Representatives Pickering and Turner and Senators Cochran and \n     Harkin, all of whom sponsored the original bill, and want to \n     thank the Appropriations Subcommittee, especially Senator \n     Brownback for his kind words and commitment to veterinary \n     medicine.\n       AVMA is also lobbying our Federal legislators to pass the \n     Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act--an important piece of \n     legislation that will provide us with sorely needed public \n     health and public practice veterinarians. Today's public \n     health practitioners play an invaluable role in U.S. \n     agriculture, food safety, zoonotic disease control, animal \n     welfare, homeland security, and international standards and \n     trade. Without an adequate number of public health \n     veterinarians, the wellbeing of our Nation--yes, even the \n     world--is at risk. Senator Allard has been invaluable and \n     unwavering in his dedication to moving this act forward \n     through the complicated legislative process. I intend to do \n     everything I can as president to provide support to Senator \n     Allard's effort to pass the Veterinary Workforce Expansion \n     Act.\n       On the international education level, AVMA has been \n     committed to the global unity of the profession for decades. \n     The AVMA Council on Education has partnered with Canada since \n     the accreditation system was developed and has accredited six \n     foreign veterinary colleges. We are working with six \n     additional schools. We are extremely proud of those colleges. \n     As more inquiries come forward, it is self-evident that the \n     world looks to us as the gold standard in educational goals \n     and expectations.\n       At the same time, I will be supporting the efforts of our \n     specialty organizations to attract and train the new \n     practitioners they need. Currently, there are 20 veterinary \n     specialty organizations comprising 37 distinct areas of \n     expertise under the AVMA umbrella.\n       The AVMA economic report on veterinarians and veterinary \n     practices has revealed a substantial difference between the \n     incomes of specialists and nonspecialists practicing in \n     similar disciplines. I will, as president, encourage the \n     development of additional in-depth financial surveys that, \n     hopefully, will motivate our undergraduates to further their \n     education and achieve specialty status, thus helping ensure \n     that public demands for advanced veterinary medical services \n     are being met while, at the same time, increasing our \n     economic base.\n       Hopefully, these additional specialists will serve as a \n     resource for our veterinary colleges who are becoming \n     increasingly understaffed.\n       In the past 15 years, we have seen a shift in the \n     demographics of our profession. I will bet there were plenty \n     of raised eyebrows when McKillips College, in 1903, and the \n     Chicago Veterinary College, in 1910, graduated our country's \n     first female veterinarians. It is hard to believe that as \n     recently as 1963, the profession included only 277 female \n     veterinarians.\n       We are proud of the fact that an increasing number of our \n     graduates are women. Their contributions and leadership have \n     strengthened our profession. However, the recent AVMA-Pfizer \n     study confirmed lower mean female incomes within the \n     profession. Now is the time to explore solutions to that \n     problem, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that \n     this issue is thoroughly investigated and addressed.\n       To achieve unity, I firmly believe that we must be \n     inclusive, not exclusive. The public has always been well \n     served by the diversity in our practice areas. Now, we must \n     diversify our membership. The AVMA--with more than 72,000 \n     members representing 68 constituent organizations in the \n     House of Delegates--must now seek to represent every race, \n     creed, and color. As a profession, we must mirror the public, \n     and they us. We must become a profession more reflective of \n     the population we serve.\n       Over 30 years ago, Dr. H.J. Magrane, then president of the \n     AVMA, spoke often and passionately about the need for \n     inclusion and equality in our profession. As a profession, we \n     have still not made the advances in diversity that are \n     necessary.\n       As the great social scientist, Margaret Mead said: ``In \n     diversity . . . we will add to our strength.''\n       In order to achieve our diversity goals, we must initiate \n     both practical and creative ideas to arrive at an enriched \n     membership. It is up to us, all of us, to reach out to young \n     people and to nurture their interests and talents so that we \n     become the shining example of professional diversity. We need \n     to be involved in youth groups, in churches and in our public \n     schools, and united in our quest, so that others say: We must \n     emulate the AVMA.\n       Once in veterinary school, our students, all our students, \n     need to know that we, as a profession, are there to mentor \n     and to help them through the special challenges they face. \n     None of us got to where we are today without at least one \n     special person--one special veterinarian--who took us under \n     his or her wing and proved to be our own personal \n     cornerstone. We can do no less for those who are striving \n     today to become members of our profession.\n       In what programs is the AVMA currently involved concerning \n     diversity? First, at its April 2005 meeting, the board \n     approved the establishment of a task force on diversity. That \n     task force will recommend steps that we must take to meet our \n     goals in diversity.\n       But here is something you can do in the immediate future. \n     Tomorrow, our convention will offer a full day diversity \n     symposium, including an appearance by Dr. Debbye Turner, \n     veterinarian, former Miss America, and contributor to the CBS \n     Early Show. I hope many of you will plan on spending part of \n     your day attending these important meetings, if time permits.\n       Diversity will also be an integral part of the 2006 \n     Veterinary Leadership Conference. Each of these opportunities \n     is designed to help us achieve the diversity we have talked \n     about for so long.\n       So what is on our want list for 2005? As I have mentioned, \n     critical shortages exist in food animal and public health \n     veterinarians. But we also are desperately in need of \n     teachers and researchers. We need policy experts and homeland \n     security professionals. We need legislative leaders, and we \n     need veterinarians who are visionaries and who can lead us in \n     this era of globalization. There exists such critical \n     shortages in so many areas that some days I wonder if our \n     small numbers can, in fact, make a difference.\n       But then I am asked to speak somewhere. And I look at the \n     enthusiastic faces in my audience--established veterinarians \n     who are deeply involved in their State and local \n     associations, students who live and breathe only to count off \n     the days until they can touch their dream, high school \n     students with straight A's who are anxious to know what else \n     they have to do to make it into veterinary school, third \n     graders with a commitment to animals that rivals the grit and \n     determination of a Jack Russell terrier--and I know that we \n     will not only survive but thrive.\n       As I have said, my presidency will be dedicated to re-\n     energizing the unity that has always been our strength and \n     foundation. As another President from the Northeast, John F. \n     Kennedy, once said, ``Let us not be blind to our \n     differences--but let us also direct attention to our common \n     interests.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, our common interests are so much \n     greater than our differences. Like the society and world \n     around us, we are changing. And change is never easy. But \n     with your help, and our combined dedication and attention to \n     preserving and protecting our unity of purpose, we will \n     thrive and remain one of the most admired and respected \n     professions in the world.\n       During the coming year, I will be looking to you for help. \n     I will listen and I will participate. I will follow your lead \n     and I will lead to enlighten. I implore each of you to \n     participate in this great organization and make it your own. \n     For you are the teachers, you are the visionaries, you are \n     veterinary medicine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9440-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9440-S9441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a piece of a \nlandmark civil rights legislation on the occasion of its 40th \nAnniversary: the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, African Americans, \nHispanics, Native Americans, and others were routinely prevented from \nvoting. The various tactics used to impede and discourage people from \nregistering to vote or turning out on election day ranged from literacy \ntests, poll taxes, and language barriers, to overt voter intimidation \nand harassment.\n  On August 6, 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, America took a critical step forward in its quest \nfor inclusiveness. Just a year earlier, President Johnson had signed \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, proclaiming that in America,\n\n       We believe that all men are created equal, yet many are \n     denied equal treatment. We believe that all men have certain \n     unalienable rights, yet many Americans do not enjoy those \n     rights. We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings \n     of liberty, yet millions are being deprived of those \n     blessings, not because of their own failures, but because of \n     color of the skin.\n\n  President Johnson knew then what we still recognize today. The \nenactment of both of these critical pieces of legislation was only one \nstep in our country's journey to become an inclusive America where all \nits citizens enjoy the rights and protections guaranteed by the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  When he recalled this day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wisely pointed \nout that ``the bill that lay on the polished mahogany desk was born in \nviolence in Selma, AL, where a stubborn sheriff had stumbled against \nthe future.'' Dr. King was, of course, referring to ``Bloody Sunday,'' \nthe March 7, 1965, incident where more than 500 non-violent civil \nrights marchers attempting a 54-mile march to the state capital to call \nfor voting rights were confronted by an aggressive assault by \nauthorities.\n  In our country's history, we have stumbled, but great leaders such as \nDr. King, and countless others who toiled and gave their lives, made \ncertain that we got back up and continued on our path toward progress.\n  On the dawn of its 40th anniversary, Congress is preparing for the \nreauthorization of key provisions in the Voting Rights Act that will \nexpire in 2007. I hope that the Senate can rise above the partisanship \nthat often plagues this body to renew the promise of inclusiveness that \nthe Voting Rights Act has sought to achieve since its inception. In the \npast, we have been able to accomplish this and the results have been \ntruly extraordinary.\n  Since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the doors to opportunity \nfor political participation by previously disenfranchised groups have \nswung open. Their voices have been heard and counted. The result has \nbeen an America where the number of black elected officials nationwide \nhas risen from 300 in 1964 to more than 9,000 today. In addition, there \nare over 5,000 Latinos who now hold public office, and there are still \nhundreds more Asian Americans and Native Americans serving as elected \nofficials.\n  However, in order to continue to make progress, Congress will need to \nreauthorize and maintain its enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. \nToday, as we work to promote democracy in Iraq and other regions of the \nworld, I wish to honor the legacy of this milestone in our own Nation's \ndemocracy and to thank all those who have been a part of the civil \nrights movements.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9441-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9441-S9442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today on the 15th anniversary of \nthe enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act to commemorate its \npassage, commend its many authors, and suggest some actions we should \ntake to protect, preserve, and advance its legacy as a vital component \nof our laws on civil rights.\n  Fifteen years ago, President George Herbert Walker Bush signed into \nlaw the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark piece of \nlegislation that extended civil rights protections to individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Prior to the passage of the ADA, far too many of our fellow Americans \nwith disabilities faced utterly unnecessary obstacles. Many lacked \naccessible transportation, reasonable workplace accommodations, and \nentree to government buildings.\n  Passionate reformers of all stripes sought to change this, and we \ncannot discuss the ADA without first mentioning the name Justin Dart, \nJr. Never without his trademark cowboy hat, Justin Dart worked \ntirelessly for enactment of the act. His efforts came to national \nattention in 1981, when President Reagan appointed him to be the vice-\nchair of what is now known as the National Council on Disability. Mr. \nDart and others on the council drafted a policy that called for civil \nrights legislation to end discrimination against people with \ndisabilities, a policy that eventually would form the basis for the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Widely respected and beloved \nby both sides, Justin Dart passed away in 2002.\n  Another champion for Americans with disabilities was, without \nquestion, our former colleague, Bob Dole. It was 1942 when, at the age \nof 19, Bob Dole joined the Army to fight in World War II. A year later, \nin the hills of Italy fighting the Nazis, Senator Dole was hit by \ngunfire. The shot shattered his right shoulder, fractured vertebrae in \nhis neck and spine, paralyzed him from the neck down, and damaged a \nkidney.\n  Of course, he recovered to become one of the most influential \nlegislators of the 20th century. Urging Congress to pass the ADA, he \nsaid, ``This historic civil rights legislation seeks to end the \nunjustified segregation and exclusion of persons with disabilities from \nthe mainstream of American life.''\n  A study of the legislative history of the act reveals that it was, in \nevery sense, a bipartisan accomplishment. The legislation supports a \nnotion in which President Reagan deeply believed. He used to say that \nthere is no limit to what you can accomplish if you don't care who gets \nthe credit.\n  The act was then signed into law by another great American, President \nGeorge H. W. Bush. In signing the legislation, President Bush spoke of \nwhat he felt the law would offer Americans with disabilities. He said \n``This Act . . . will ensure that people with disabilities are given \nthe basic guarantees for which they have worked so long and so hard: \nindependence, freedom of choice, control of their lives, the \nopportunity to blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the \nAmerican mainstream.''\n  Since the passage of the ADA, we have seen significant improvements \nin the employment and economic well-being of citizens with \ndisabilities. In 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that over the \nprevious 15 years, the employment rate for working age men with a \ndisability had increased by more than 25 percent. Other evidence of the \nADA's impact was even more readily apparent. For instance, the barriers \nto mobility once posed by public transportation have been largely \neliminated. Here in Washington, DC, for example, 95 percent of the \nMetro system is accessible to persons with disabilities.\n  However, anniversaries are not just for looking back and celebrating \nthe achievements of the past. They must also be an occasion for looking \nforward to the challenges that still lie before us.\n  A report issued by the Institute for Higher Education Policy in 2004 \nrevealed that less than two-thirds of youths with disabilities receive \nstandard high school diplomas. Although this graduation rate represents \na significantly higher rate than 15 years ago, it remains inadequate, \nand significantly behind the rate for individuals without disabilities.\n  We in Congress must maintain high expectations for all Americans. \nAmericans with disabilities can compete and cooperate at the same level \nas Americans without disabilities. I was happy to work on the No Child \nLeft Behind Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nboth of which incorporated the principle of high expectations for all, \nregardless of race, gender, or disability.\n  We also must incorporate the latest technology to help further \nincorporate\n\n[[Page S9442]]\n\nAmericans with disabilities into our workplaces. I was pleased to \nsupport President George W. Bush's New Freedom Initiative, which builds \non the progress of the ADA by supporting new technologies that make \ncommunications easier, and thereby helping people with disabilities \nlive full, active lives in their communities.\n  We in Georgia know that people with disabilities can realize their \nincredible potential and better our workplaces, our schools, and our \nsociety. For 6 years, we were represented in this body by Senator Max \nCleland, a disabled Vietnam veteran.\n  No one knew the potential of Americans with disabilities better than \nBobby Dodd, whom most Georgians would associate with Georgia Tech and \nhis phenomenal years coaching, winning football teams. But after his \nretirement, he developed the Bobby Dodd Institute, which works to \nensure that Atlantans with disabilities are given the opportunities to \nachieve economic self-sufficiency through employment.\n  Another name that comes to mind when we discuss heroes to Americans \nwith disabilities is Tommy Nobis. Tommy was the first draft pick in the \nhistory of the Atlanta Falcons, taken No. 1 in the 1965 draft. A steady \nand reliable linebacker, Tommy was a five-time Pro-Bowler and NFL \nRookie of the Year in 1966. Yet far more important than his football \naccomplishments are his accomplishments off the field. In 1975, he \nfounded the Tommy Nobis Center to provide vocational training to \npersons with disabilities. Originally run out of a small, crowded \ntrailer, the center now operates a $2 million state-of-the-art center \nin Marietta, GA. The center enables individuals to enter or return to \nemployment and to enjoy productive and independent lifestyles while \ncontributing to the greater business community. Over their proud 25-\nyear history, the center has assisted over 11,000 individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Again, I am pleased to cosponsor today's resolution and offer my \nsincerest congratulations to all of those who have worked to ensure \nbetter lives for Americans with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9442-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING ALAN CHARLES SADOSKI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Alan Charles \nSadoski, a loving husband, father, and friend whose lasting memory is \ncontinually celebrated by everyone who knew and loved him.\n  Alan's life was filled with family, friends, excitement, and \nlaughter. He was one of what quickly became seven brothers and sisters \ngrowing up in Salem, MA. Everyone who knew him will tell you that his \nsiblings were not only his best friends but also his biggest fans. He \ngraduated from high school in 1967 and went on to become a standout \nsoccer player at Salem State College, while at the same time serving in \nthe Massachusetts National Guard.\n  After odd jobs throughout the summers in and around Salem, Alan took \na job working as a teller for the Essex Bank. Little did he know at the \ntime, but that job changed Alan's life. Not only did Alan find a \ncareer, but he also fell in love with a fellow teller, Claire McGuire. \nThe two married and began their life together, ultimately moving to \nWashington, DC where Claire pursued her legal career and Alan took a \njob with the National Bank of Washington. Everyone who knew Alan can \nremember him on his way to work, the banker in his three piece suit.\n  On December 29, 1981 Claire and Alan had a son named Nicholas Alan. \nShortly thereafter the family moved into their first home where Alan's \nlove of fatherhood blossomed. Alan converted the boxes from their new \nappliances into little homes for Nick and the two of them spent \ncountless hours playing together. When Nick had trouble sleeping at \nnight, Alan would drive him around the neighborhood until he fell \nasleep. He even brought Nick back to Salem for his first haircut at the \nbarbershop just down the street from his own childhood home. Everyone \ncould see how much Alan enjoyed being a father.\n  Although Alan fought hard, his spirit and courage in the face of \nadversity never showing the effects of his illness, he sadly succumbed \nto his battle with cancer on August 12, 1985. He was troubled by the \nidea of leaving his wife and son behind, but he knew they would be \ntaken care of and supported by both his family and the legion of \nfriends he made over the years. Each of them made a special promise to \nAlan that in their own way they would always make sure Claire and Nick \nwere okay. It is now 20 years later and Alan's friends and family have \nnever let the two of them down.\n  Over the years the people closest to Alan have kept his spirit alive \nby thinking about him often and sharing their memories of him with \nothers. His friends remember his tolerant and understanding nature. \nThey remember his love of camping and how much he had hoped to take his \nson and nephews out on a true wilderness adventure. They talk about his \nfabled flapjacks, and how everyone would watch the pancake impresario \nperform his tricks. They remember how much fun it was to be around \nAlan; how he was always at the center of the crowd, telling some of his \nfamous stories, somehow making the gathering better just by being \nthere. Even the pharmacists at the local drugstore, who saw Alan during \nsome of the worst days of his illness, thought the world of him and \neven made a donation to the American Cancer Society in his honor. He \ntruly touched everyone he met.\n  Since then the family has remained close and they talk about Alan \noften. He has nieces and nephews now that he never had a chance to \nmeet, but they have heard all about ``Uncle Al, the Kiddies' Pal.'' \nAlan would be happy to know that the people who meant the most to him \nin his life still gather and share their memories of him after his \ndeath. He would love to know that Claire and Nick are the best of \nfriends. He would love to know that Nick enjoys hearing stories about \nhis dad, and perhaps more than anything else, loves to hear people say, \n``Your dad would be proud of you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9442-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9442-S9445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Department of Transportation's \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise Program is vital to ensuring that \nbusinesses owned by women and minorities have an equal opportunity to \ncompete for Federal highway construction contracts, and I commend the \nconferees for supporting this important program in this year's highway \nbill.\n  Since the program was created in 1982 and expanded to include women \nin 1987, the construction industry has changed significantly. Although \nwe still have far to go to fully address the effects of discrimination \nin the industry, the program has opened many doors of opportunity for \nwomen and minorities in what was once a virtually all-male, all-white \nconstruction industry. The program deserves high marks in combating the \neffects of discrimination in highway construction. But on the extensive \ninformation available to us in considering its reauthorization, it is \nalso clear that the program is still very much needed to achieve a \nlevel playing field for all qualified contractors, regardless of race \nor gender.\n  Since Congress first began examining this problem, it has been clear \nthat the construction industry generally, and highway construction in \nparticular, have been predominantly an insiders' business that often \nexclude women and minorities for discriminatory reasons. The \npersistence of this festering problem has denied opportunities for \nAfrican American-, Asian American-, Latino-, Native American-, and \nwomen-owned firms in the industry.\n  Our extensive hearings and other information gathered over the years \nmade clear that women and minorities historically have been excluded \nfrom both public and private construction contracting. When Congress \nlast reviewed the program in 1998, there was strong evidence of \ndiscriminatory lending practices that deny women and minorities the \ncapital necessary to compete on an equal footing. Much of that \ninformation is cited and described in three leading rulings by Federal \ncourts of appeals--the Eighth Circuit's opinion in Sherbrooke Turf. \nInc. v. Minnesota Department of Transportation, the Tenth Circuit's \nopinion in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, and the Ninth Circuit's \nopinion in Western States Paving Company v. Washington State Department \nof Transportation, all of which upheld the program as constitutional, \nand found that it is narrowly\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\ntailored to deal with the Government's compelling interest in remedying \ndiscrimination.\n  I will not detail all of the information previously considered, but a \nfew examples illustrate the breadth of the problem. A bank denied a \nminority-owned business a loan to bid on a public contract worth $3 \nmillion, but offered a loan for the same purpose to a nonminority-owned \nfirm with an affiliate in bankruptcy. An Asian-lndian American \nbusinessman in the San Francisco Bay area testified at a public hearing \nthat he was unable to obtain a line of unsecured credit from mainstream \nbanks until he found a loan officer who shared his heritage. A Filipino \nowner of a construction firm testified that he had difficulty obtaining \nbank financing, although white-owned firms with comparable assets could \nobtain similar loans.\n  Overt discrimination and entrenched patterns of exclusion prevented \nmany female- and minority-owned businesses from obtaining surety bonds.\n  Minorities also have been consistently under-utilized in Government \ncontracting. In 1996, the Urban Institute released a report documenting \nwide statistical disparities between the share of contract dollars \nreceived by minority- and women-owned firms compared to firms owned by \nwhite males. Minority firms received only 57 cents in Government \ncontracts for every dollar they should have received based upon their \neligibility.\n  For specific racial groups, the disparities were even more severe. \nAfrican American-owned firms received only 49 cents on the dollar; \nLatino-owned firms, 44 cent; Asian-American owned firms, 39 cents; \nNative American-owned firms, 18 cents; women-owned firms, 29 cents.\n  These statistics are particularly troubling, because they exist \ndespite affirmative action programs in many of the jurisdictions. \nWithout such programs, their plight would have been far worse. The \nUrban Institute report found that the disparities between minority- and \nwomen-owned firms and other firms were greatest in areas in which no \naffirmative action program was in place.\n  When only areas and years in which affirmative action is not in place \nwere considered, the percentage of awards to women fell from 29 percent \nto 24 percent. For African Americans, the percentage dropped from 49 \npercent to 22 percent; for Latinos, from 44 percent to 26 percent; for \nAsians, from 39 percent to 13 percent; and for Native Americans, from \n18 percent to 4 percent. These figures show that affirmative action \nprograms are not only effective, but are still urgently needed.\n  We also had extensive evidence of discrimination by prime \ncontractors, unions, and suppliers of goods and materials, who \nexpressly favored white males over minorities and women. In addition, \nthe information we received established that exclusionary practices by \nState and local governments also contributed to the problem. As a \nresult, female and minority contractors were disadvantaged in their \nefforts to compete fairly for both public and private construction \nprojects.\n  The history of discrimination in contracting provides important \ncontext for the information that has been developed since the program \nwas last reauthorized. We must not and do not assume that because the \nprogram was necessary in 1998, it must be reauthorized. Before deciding \nto continue the program, we have a constitutional duty to determine \nwhether it is still needed today.\n  The information we have seen since then confirms that there is still \na need for a national program. New studies completed since 1998 show \nthat minority- and women-owned companies are underutilized in \ngovernment contracting. The Department of Transportation identified 15 \ndetailed studies of State and local governments showing significant \ndisparities between the availability and utilization of minority- and \nwomen-owned firms in government contracting. Studies showed \nunderutilization in Nebraska; in Maryland; in Colorado; in Georgia; in \nKentucky; in Ohio; in Wilmington, DE; in Dekalb County, GA; in Broward \nCounty, FL; in Dallas, TX; in Cincinnati, OH; in Tallahassee, FL; and \nin Baltimore, MD. Several other studies have also been completed since \n1998. Furthermore, expert evidence presented to the trial courts in \nSherbrooke and in Gross Seed v. Nebraska Department of Roads included \nstatistical evidence of underutilization of minority- and women-owned \nfirms in Minnesota and Nebraska.\n  In the past, we have seen a striking reduction in participation in \nthe regions where government programs designed to provide a level \nplaying field in the construction industry are curtailed or eliminated. \nThat pattern has continued in recent years. For example, in the State \nof Minnesota, during 1999, after a Federal court had enjoined the State \ndepartment of transportation from implementing a previous program--\nparticipation dropped from over 10 percent to slightly more than 2 \npercent. In addition, the General Accountability Office, GAO, issued a \n2001 study showing that contracting under the Federal program had \n``dramatically declined'' when similar local programs were terminated \nin the jurisdictions it examined.\n  We also have received considerable new anecdotal evidence of \ndiscrimination in highway construction contracting:\n  Herta Bouvia, the female co-owner of a company that competes for \nbuilding contracts and highway construction contracts in Nebraska, \ntestified in Gross Seed v. Nebraska Department of Roads that she faced \nhostility, slurs, and other forms of harassment on construction jobs \nbecause of her gender.\n  Stanford Madlock, an African-American owner of a DBE trucking company \nin Nebraska, testified in the same case that he had suffered \ndiscrimination because of his race, including being denied contracts \ndespite submitting the low bid for the work and being denied access to \ncapital.\n  The Tenth Circuit's 2003 opinion in Concrete Works v. City and County \nof Denver included extensive anecdotal evidence of discriminatory \nbehavior by lenders, majority-owned firms, and individual employees in \nthe Denver metropolitan area, which the court characterized as \n``profoundly disturbing.'' In that case, a senior vice president of a \nlarge, white-owned construction firm testified under oath that when he \nworked in Denver, he received credible complaints from minority- and \nwomen-owned construction firms that they were subject to different work \nrules than majority-owned firms; that he frequently observed graffiti \ncontaining racial or gender epithets on job sites in the Denver area; \nand that, based on his own experience, many white-owned firms refused \nto hire minority or women-owned subcontractors because of biased views \nthat such firms were not competent.\n  Witnesses from minority- and women-owned firms testified that they \nwere treated differently than their white male competitors in \nattempting to prequalify for public and private projects or to obtain \ncredit. They also testified that prime contractors rejected the lowest \nbids on construction projects when those bids had been submitted by a \nminority or woman, and that female- and minority-owned firms were paid \nless promptly by prime contractors and were charged more for supplies \nthan white male competitors on both public and private projects.\n  The case also included extensive evidence that Latino, African-\nAmerican, and female contractors were subjected to verbal and physical \nabuse because of their race or gender. Even more disturbing was the \ntestimony that minority and female employees working on construction \nprojects were physically assaulted and fondled, spit on with chewing \ntobacco, and pelted with 2-inch bolts thrown by males from a height of \n80 feet.\n  Disparity studies completed since the Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise Program was last reauthorized also contain significant \nanecdotal evidence:\n  A disparity study by the State of Delaware described the difficulties \nof African-American firms in obtaining loans, including the experience \nof an African-American contractor who could obtain credit only after a \nwhite friend working at the bank interceded on his behalf.\n  The 2003 Ohio study also included the account of an African-American \ngeneral contractor in the construction business whose ability to \nperform the work was questioned by an administrator for a project \nconducted by the State. The African-American contractor related that he \n``had a lot of\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nproblems out of that particular agency,'' and was told that Government \naffirmative action programs are ``a form of n--gger welfare.'' The same \ncontractor found that he was expected only to work on projects that \nwere part of an affirmative action program.\n  The study included anecdotal evidence that female construction \ncontractors were often forced to justify their ability to do the job. \nOne contractor related that she was frequently required to demonstrate \nher knowledge of the construction business. She said, ``You are \nchallenged, no matter your age, no matter your position, you are \nchallenged quite frequently and asked very simple construction quiz \nquestions just to prove you [know] construction acumen.'' She said that \nmale contractors assume women lack knowledge of the business. One \nfemale contractor stated that she was forced to answer basic questions \nabout construction before being permitted to perform work on a job.\n  A 1999 study of contracting in Seattle includes accounts by a female \ncontractor with 14 years' experience in construction. It found that \ngeneral contractors assume minority-and women-owned firms do \nsubstandard work. It also includes information about women contractors \nsubjected to sexually inappropriate or demeaning comments by men in the \nconstruction industry.\n  The 1999 Seattle study contained troubling anecdotal evidence of \nlending discrimination against minorities. A Latino construction \ncontractor had difficulty obtaining credit for his business until his \nwhite employee began dealing with the bank and easily obtained the loan \nfrom the same loan officer who had previously ignored the Latino \ncontractor's application. The Latino owner also said that he later \ntried to help six other minority contractors--two African Americans, \ntwo Latinos, and two Native Americans--obtain credit after his company \nexpanded, and always had difficulty. He stated that bankers told him, \n``Jeez, you know how much these types of firms fail?'' and that the \nAfrican American and Native American contractors he sought to help were \nverbally mistreated by bank employees.\n  The same study noted that one Seattle bank placed so many increasing \nfinancial requirements on an Asian American construction contractor \nthat the contractor was unable to get credit until he no longer needed \nit.\n  The study also included anecdotal evidence of bid shopping by prime \ncontractors that disadvantaged minority firms and discriminated against \nAfrican-American and Latino construction contractors in seeking bonding \nand insurance.\n  A 1999 study of contracting in Minnesota included the account of an \nAfrican-American construction contractor, who stated that a white \nconstruction worker refused to report to an African-American worker, \nthat there was racial harassment on job sites ``all the time,'' and \nthat African Americans had been called ``monkeys'' on the job and had \ntheir work sabotaged.\n  The Minnesota study also included statements by an Asian contractor \nwho endured racial slurs or harassment from others in his business ``at \nleast once a month.''\n  In light of the extensive evidence of continuing discrimination in \nconstruction contracting, the additional information available to \nCongress since 1998 makes clear that the Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise Program is still needed. Given the importance of this \nquestion, I will ask unanimous consent to include further evidence in \nthe Record.\n  In reauthorizing the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, we \nare well aware that in seeking to expand inclusion in the American \ndream, we must not unduly burden any other group. The program achieves \nthe proper balance. The Department of Transportation's regulations \nexpressly prohibit the use of rigid quotas, and require States \nadministering the program to use race-conscious measures only as a last \nresort when race-neutral efforts to combat discrimination have been \nshown to be insufficient. If a State finds that it can create a level \nplaying field on which all contractors have a fair chance to compete \nwithout using race-conscious means, the regulations require it to set \nthe race-conscious portion of its goal of minority participation at \nzero, so that no race-conscious measures are used at all. We know that \nthe program is also flexible in fact, because some States have set the \nrace-conscious portion of the goal at zero.\n  The process by which firms may be certified for the program does not \nrigidly classify firms based on race, ethnicity or gender. Instead, the \ncertification process is designed to identify victims of \ndiscrimination. Although firms owned by women and minorities are \npresumed to be eligible to participate in the program, that presumption \nmay be rebutted, and their owners must submit a notarized statement \ndeclaring that they are, in fact, socially and economically \ndisadvantaged. Firms owned by white males who can show that they are \nsocially and economically disadvantaged can also qualify to participate \nin the program.\n  Finally, the program is inherently flexible. It imposes no penalty on \nStates for failing to meet annual goals for participation. It requires \nonly that prime contractors exercise good faith in seeking to meet the \nDBE participation goals on individual contracts; no penalty is imposed \nif their good-faith efforts are unsuccessful.\n  Given the magnitude and pervasiveness of the historical exclusion of \nwomen and minorities from construction contracting, it is not \nsurprising that this problem has not yet been fully corrected. But the \ndifficulty of the problem does not absolve us of our duty to address \nthe effects of discrimination, and to continue our effort to achieve a \nlevel playing field in government contracting. As the Supreme Court \nstated in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, ``[g]overnment is not \ndisqualified from acting in response to the unhappy persistence of both \nthe practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against \nminority groups in this country.'' Indeed, we have a duty to ensure \nthat federal dollars are not used to subsidize discrimination.\n  As President Kennedy stated in his landmark message to Congress on \ncivil rights in June 19, 1963:\n\n       Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all \n     taxpayers of all races [and both genders] contribute, not be \n     spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, \n     subsidizes, or results in . . . discrimination.\n\n  The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program enables a diverse group \nof contractors to contribute to the important projects financed by this \nmajor legislation. Everyone benefits when the recipients of Federal \nopportunities reflect all of America.\n  The program ensures that all Americans have a fair opportunity to \nparticipate in the construction projects and other activities \nauthorized in this legislation and that those who benefit from Federal \ncontracting opportunities reflect our Nation's diversity, and I commend \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for including this still \nurgently needed program in this major legislation.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the National Economic \nResearch Associates Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Availability \nStudy prepared for the Minnesota Department of Transportation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Molter Corporation,\n\n                                    Frankfort, IL, March 29, 2004.\n     Joann Payne,\n     Women First Natl Legislative Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Payne: In 1987 I started my business. At that \n     time, I was not married. I am married now. You ask if I feel \n     there have been acts of discrimination, I most definitely \n     feel that is the case.\n       When I started my company, I was involved in a specialty \n     type of construction, and tried to work for industrial \n     business. In 1987, rarely did you see women in plants, \n     workers or business owners. I was mocked and ridiculed by my \n     male counterparts. They blatantly said I did not know much \n     about the business, and that I would not be in business in \n     one year's time frame. (That was 16 years ago.)\n       When I went to the bank for a loan--and that is still \n     happening, my husband has to sign all papers, though he is \n     retired from the restaurant business and has never been \n     involved in my business.\n       Prime contractors tend to take advantage of small minority \n     or women business. They do not pay timely, do not process \n     change orders in a proper time frame. This leads to a cash \n     shortage for a small business.\n       If the goals were eliminated, general contractors would not \n     use minority or women\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\n     business owners. That has been proven for those areas without \n     goals. When they have a project, they will only solicit your \n     bid up to the amount of the goal, and do not want to use me \n     to any further limit.\n       There is a good ole boy's network, be it on the golf \n     course, on trips, or dinner/lunch meetings.\n       Given the opportunity, my company has proven our \n     exceptional capabilities. Just recently we were named \n     subcontractor of the year by IDOT. We performed shotcrete \n     work on a bridge over the river in Peoria, Illinois.\n       The DBB program has been good for my company when we are \n     given the opportunity. It is extremely important that the \n     program continue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Loretta Molter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Leajak Concrete Construction Inc.,\n\n                             Mountlake Terrace, WA, July 20, 2005.\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir or Madam: I appreciate the opportunity to submit \n     evidence of my company's experiences with the DBE program as \n     it exists in Washington State.\n       Located in Washington State, Leajak Concrete Construction \n     Incorporated has been in existence since 1992 and has been a \n     certified DBE since its inception. Leajak Concrete \n     Construction is a small general contractor specializing in \n     structural concrete work suitable for commercial buildings, \n     civil work, public works projects, transportation projects, \n     and many others. As a small DBE business our revenues average \n     approximately 3-3.5 Million, employing 8-10 full time \n     employees and 6-7 part time employees.\n       Although the DBE program has assisted Leajak Concrete \n     Construction Incorporated to access some opportunities, it is \n     important to know that the barriers and obstacles that the \n     program is suppose to mitigate still exist. We continue to \n     encounter discrimination in the market place that keeps us \n     from participating in competitive bidding, negotiated work, \n     and receiving the necessary information we need to seek \n     business. Leajak Concrete Construction Incorporated \n     constantly pursues subcontracting work with Prime \n     contractors, but it continues to be our experience that the \n     Prime contractors do more to discourage us than to encourage \n     us to bid. For example, we are constantly at a disadvantage \n     because Prime contractors contact us at the last minute to \n     bid on complex and substantial contracts. This is indicative \n     of the ``Good Faith Effort'' we experience day in and day \n     out. Furthermore, when we have asked for feedback on our bid \n     and request post-bid reviews, we are ignored and disregarded.\n       Washington State has the dubious distinction of being only \n     one of two states in the Union that have an anti-affirmative \n     law on the books RCW 49.60.400 (aka I-100). As a result, \n     spending with certified minority and women-owned businesses \n     had decreased dramatically; 7.8% in 1998 for minority firms \n     to 0.8% in 2003, and 6.1% in 1998 for women firms to 1.2% in \n     2003. I believe that the chilling effect of I-200 is event in \n     a lack of commitment, responsiveness and concern by the state \n     agencies responsible for managing and upholding the federal \n     DBE program. It is correct to say that the recipients and \n     sub-recipients of federal transportation dollars in \n     Washington State take a very passive approach to promoting \n     and communicating the DBE program to the affected parties.\n       To summary, the DBE program as contained in TEA-21 should \n     be reauthorized, upheld, strengthened and improved. America's \n     certified DBE firms deserve fair and equitable access to \n     opportunities that are funded by our tax dollars, and the \n     federal DBE program is an important underpinning.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Fredell Anderson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Md.

Discrimination against one's \n     racial, ethnic and gender make-up is still the number one \n     impediment for minority entrepreneurs starting and sustaining \n     their businesses in America today. As the leader of a \n     minority trade association in Baltimore, Maryland, I have \n     witnessed and received testimony from many who have \n     experienced first hand the evils of procurement \n     discrimination in Government and private sectors.\n       The findings from disparity studies conducted throughout \n     Maryland indicate that countless minority businesses are not \n     being provided opportunities to grow their businesses because \n     of a lack of capital, bonding and retained earnings. Upon \n     attending a recent public hearing at the headquarters of the \n     Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) on the subject \n     of its recent disparity study, I heard a disadvantaged \n     business testify that if the WSSC suspends the DBE program, \n     his company would be out of business. This particular company \n     supplies valves and manhole covers to WSSC. The owner of the \n     business further stated that other water supply and treatment \n     centers in the region who do not have DBE programs won't buy \n     from him because he can't get the foundries to supply him. \n     The foundries that do supply him do so only to satisfy WSSC's \n     DBE program. If the DBE program is not reauthorized, the fate \n     of the majority businesses doing business under the program \n     is doomed. I urge you the continuance of the program without \n     haste.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Wayne R.

Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: I am writing to advise you of our \n     strong opposition to Amendment 1615, offered by Senator \n     Kennedy to S. 397, the ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in \n     Arms Act.''\n       Senator Kennedy will certainly present his amendment as an \n     ``officer safety issue'' to get dangerous, ``cop-killer'' \n     bullets off the shelves. Regardless of its presentation, the \n     amendment's actual aim and effect would be to expand the \n     definition of ``armor-piercing'' to include ammunition based, \n     not on any threat to law enforcement officers, but on a \n     manufacturer's marketing strategy.\n       The truth of the matter is that only one law enforcement \n     officer has been killed by a round fired from a handgun which \n     penetrated his soft body armor--and in that single instance, \n     it was the body armor that failed to provide the expected \n     ballistic protection, not because the round was ``armor \n     piercing.''\n       It is our view that no expansion or revision of the current \n     law is needed to protect law enforcement officers. To put it \n     simply, this is not a genuine officer safety issue. If it \n     were, Senator Kennedy would not be offering this amendment to \n     a bill he strongly opposes and is working to defeat.\n       The Kennedy amendment was considered and defeated by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2003 on a 10-6 vote. We \n     believe that it should be rejected again.\n       On behalf of the more than 321,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I thank you for taking our views on this \n     issue into consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact \n     me, or Executive Director Jim Pasco, through our Washington \n     office if I can be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      The Law Enforcement Alliance\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                                    July 29, 2005.\n     Hon.

Senator Kennedy opposes the effort to reign in runaway \n     trial lawyers who are bent on driving the legitimate firearm \n     industry out of business and this amendment has everything to \n     do with killing a bill he opposes, not protecting cops.\n       The Kennedy amendment is an effort to label some bullets as \n     ``bad'' while others are ``good;'' this is ill considered and \n     misleading at best. Law enforcement officers are killed and \n     assaulted by criminals. Criminals bent on attacking officers \n     will use whatever tool they can to hurt and kill. There are \n     no good bullets or bad bullets; in this case there are only \n     bad amendments whose true intent is to be a ``poison pill'' \n     to S. 397.\n       This amendment, along with other hostile amendments, should \n     be identified for what they really are: an outright effort to \n     kill S. 397 and they should be defeated.\n       Please know that many in the law enforcement community \n     encourage you to continue steadfastly in support of America's \n     gun manufacturers who provide our officers the tools to \n     return home safely at the end of their shift.\n       Thank you for your unwavering support of America's brave \n     men and women who wear a badge. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or Ted Deeds if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James J.

GUINN, USA\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer remarks on the \nmilitary career of Col. William A. Guinn,\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\nU.S. Army, and to offer my appreciation to Colonel Guinn on his years \nof dedicated service to our country.\n  Col. William A. Guinn has made numerous and significant contributions \nto the U.S. Army in a career of over 27 years, culminating with his \nassignment as Commander, Letterkenny Army Depot from July 2002 to \nAugust 2005. During the past 10 years, Colonel Guinn distinguished \nhimself through meritorious service while serving in positions of great \nresponsibility. His leadership and support to members of the Armed \nForces, the units and commands in which he served, and local \ncommunities mark him as an exceptional leader and contributor to the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  From 1996 to 1998 Colonel Guinn commanded the 123rd Main Support \nBattalion, MSB, 1st Armored Division Support Command, Dexheim, Germany. \nIn July of 1996, the same month he took command, Colonel Guinn was \nordered to begin redeployment of his unit while not losing any levels \nof support to the Multi-National Division-North. In less than 1 year, \nColonel Guinn was again directed to deploy his units into Bosnia as \npart of the NATO lead stabilization force, SFOR. After 26 months of \ncommand duty, Colonel Guinn moved forward and became one of the select \nfew chosen to attend the Industrial College of the Armed Forces.\n  In June 1999, Colonel Guinn reported to the headquarters, U.S. \nPacific Command, as a member of the J4 staff. Within his first 90 days, \nhe assumed the challenge of coordinating the United States' support in \nthe emerging nation of East Timor. While assisting the U.S. commitment \nto Operation Stabilize, the Australia-led operation to bring peace and \nstability to East Timor by international forces, East Timor, lNTERFET, \nhe planned and executed the first major deployment of contracted \nsupport to military forces. Within a year Colonel Guinn would be given \nanother mission of international and U.S. strategic importance when \nNavy surveillance aircraft, the EP-3E BUNO 15651, was forced down in \nthe Peoples Republic of China, PRC, after an in-air collision with a \nPRC Air Force fighter aircraft on April 1, 2001.\n  After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Colonel Guinn was \ntasked to coordinate the regional U.S. response in the opening stages \nof the global war on terror. Colonel Guinn's knowledge of establishing \nforward logistics bases in remote locations was instrumental in \nestablishing a base in Zamboanga for special forces units to train \nPhilippine soldiers in tactics to resist terrorist insurgents.\n  In July 2002, Colonel Guinn took command of Letterkenny Army Depot, \nLEAD, in Chambersburg, PA. When he arrived, LEAD was still wrestling \nwith the effects of the downsizing and reductions from the base \nrealignment and closing, BRAC, actions. The infrastructure was being \nshed to comply with the BRAC 1995 realignment and Letterkenny was \nstruggling to define its future.\n  Because of aggressive and progressive planning, Colonel Guinn has \nbeen able to more than double the workload and output of Letterkenny. \nHe developed a strategy to grow the workload, which in turn made the \ndepot a more competitive and efficient producer of materiel in support \nof global war on terror. First, he identified niche areas where the \ncore capabilities of the depot and its skilled tradesmen could best \nutilize their strengths. Second, he went directly to nontraditional \nmilitary customers such as the Special Operations Command, SOCOM, to \nshow what the depot had to offer and how the depot could meet the needs \nof the warfighter. Finally, he built on the existing core depot work \nsupporting air defense and tactical missiles to grow that part of the \nbusiness in a competitive environment. During his tenure workload is up \nover 200 percent in dollars and over 100 percent in terms of manhours.\n  Colonel Guinn directed an analysis and a strategic plan for human \nresources and workforce replenishment at the depot. Recruitment targets \nand strategies of tying into technical schools were put in place. The \nfirst 4-year apprenticeship program was adopted under Colonel Guinn. \nInterns began to arrive for the first time in a decade. Colonel Guinn \ninstilled a sense of importance in the everyday tasks of civilians at \nthe depot. He demanded high standards in workmanship and in orderliness \nof the workplace. He began with the first levels of Lean, Six Sigma, \n6S, to improve shop effectiveness and to instill pride in the \nworkforce.\n  Following the BRAC 1995 round, there were challenges in merging the \ngoals of BRAC and those of the depot. Under his leadership, Colonel \nGuinn looked for opportunities, was entrepreneurial, and he set the \ndepot up to be a model of efficiency. In 2002, the Army launched its \n``lean implementation'' initiative. Colonel Guinn decided LEAD would be \nat the forefront of this initiative. The activities undertaken under \nhis leadership set the pace for lean implementation across all of Army \nMateriel Command.\n  The summary of a military career is the opportunity to command and \ntransform an organization. Some officers will manage an organization; \nothers lead and challenge the organization to excel. Colonel Guinn led \nLetterkenny Army Depot and its people to achieve more than they thought \nthemselves possible. Colonel Guinn did what a great connnander should, \nhe got all his organization was capable of doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9446-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9446-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak about \nGuatemala, a country that receives too little attention by the \nCongress, where we have seen both progress and disturbing trends in \nrecent years.\n  Guatemala is struggling to emerge from more than three decades of \ncivil war in which tens of thousands of civilians, mostly Mayan \nIndians, were disappeared, tortured and killed. The majority of those \natrocities were committed by the army.\n  A year and a half ago, Guatemala elected a new President, Oscar \nBerger, who pledged to support the implementation of the 1996 Peace \nAccords which his predecessors had largely ignored. President Berger's \nelection offered hope for change, beginning with the downsizing of the \nmilitary, his appointment of Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu as a \nGoodwill Ambassador, and his pursuit of corruption charges against \nformer President Alfonso Portillo. I was among those who praised \nPresident Berger for those important and courageous initiatives.\n  However, I am concerned that after a promising beginning, corruption, \norganized crime, and human rights violations are getting worse.\n  In 2004, President Berger reduced the size of the Guatemalan military \nby 50 percent. However, to the consternation of many civil society \norganizations, the Interior Ministry announced that the Guatemalan \nmilitary would continue to participate in joint law enforcement \noperations with the National Civil Police, in violation of the Peace \nAccords. This is also a concern because, according to the State \nDepartment, there are credible allegations of involvement by police \nofficers in rapes, killings and kidnappings. Rather than prosecute \nthese officers, they are often transferred to different parts of the \ncountry. Impunity remains a serious problem.\n  Organized crime is thriving in Guatemala, and the government faces an \nuncertain future if it is perceived as powerless against these wealthy \ncriminal networks. In one day this year, 17 people were reportedly \nmurdered in Guatemala City. Our Ambassador is reportedly confident that \norganized crime has not infiltrated the Berger administration, and \nPresident Berger deserves credit for removing Attorney General Carlos \nde Leon who was suspected of corruption. But he also needs to crack \ndown on these violent gangs.\n  President Berger also deserves praise for his support of the proposed \nCommission for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups and \nClandestine Security Organizations, CICIACS. His initial efforts ran \ninto problems with the judiciary and continue to face opposition in the \nGuatemalan Congress. But the establishment of CICIACS would assist in \nthe consolidation of democracy as well as in combating clandestine \ngroups.\n  Reports of intimidation, kidnappings, and death threats remain all \ntoo frequent. In January and February of this year alone, Amnesty \nInternational documented that 26 human rights activists were threatened \nor attacked in Guatemala. More recently, on July 7, Mario\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\nAntonio Godinez Lopez, head of the Association for the Promotion and \nDevelopment of the Community, an organization that opposes CAFTA, \nreceived a death threat. The next day, Alvaro Juarez, a human rights \nleader who worked with Alliance for Life and Peace and with the \nAssociation of the Displaced of the Peten, was assassinated. On July \n11, five journalists were attacked with machetes by ex-civil patrol \nmembers. Ileana Alamilla, the President of the Association of \nJournalists of Guatemala, has warned that journalists are in increasing \ndanger and that the government needs to take steps to protect them. \nThese are only a few examples of the types of incidents that are common \nin Guatemala today.\n  A recent report indicates that the number of women murdered and \nsexually abused in Guatemala has also increased. As of mid-July, 326 \nwomen have been murdered this year in Guatemala, a country of only 14 \nmillion people. While the report suggests causes such as clandestine \ngroups, ultimately it concludes that the lack of investigations and \nconvictions, in other words, impunity, are at the root of the problem.\n  The Guatemalan Government also needs to more effectively address the \nagrarian conflicts by seeking greater input from indigenous and \ncampesino organizations. I have been concerned with the government's \nsupport for land evictions, and the national police's role in the \ndestruction of crops and houses of members campesino organizations. \nThis explosive issue may worsen if President Berger does not find more \neffective ways to address the legitimate needs of landless people.\n  We should all be encouraged by the recent announcement that Anders \nKompass will be heading the newly established office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. Having gained \nwide respect for his work in OHCHR offices in Colombia and Mexico, Mr. \nKompass brings a wealth of expertise to Guatemala. I would hope that \nthe State Department provides funds to help support this office.\n  Since 1990, the Congress has prohibited foreign military financing \nassistance for Guatemala because of the military's involvement in gross \nviolations of human rights, and the lack of accountability for heinous \ncrimes. The Senate continued that prohibition recently due to ongoing \nconcerns with the inadequate pace of military reform. It is all too \napparent that despite the downsizing of the military, the attitude that \nthe military remains above the law has yet to change.\n  However, we do provide the Guatemalan military with expanded \ninternational military education and training assistance. In addition, \nwe continue to provide counter-narcotics assistance. And this year we \nreleased prior year military assistance funds to address urgent \nequipment needs for drug interdiction, such as spare parts for \naircraft.\n  Guatemala is at a crossroads. No one should be under any illusions \nabout the difficulties of the many political, economic and social \nchallenges it faces. Reform of Guatemala's corrupt and dysfunctional \njudicial system alone will take many years. But while President Berger \nhas made progress, the culture of violence and impunity continues to \nthrive in Guatemala. And until there is clear evidence that he is more \nvigorously and effectively confronting the powerful interests that are \nresponsible for these problems, it will be difficult if not impossible \nfor the United States to support the Guatemalan Government as strongly \nas we would like to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9447-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMBATING TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to the widespread \nproblem of human trafficking. It is the world's fastest growing \ncriminal enterprise. It is a modern-day form of slavery, involving \nvictims who are forced, defrauded or coerced into sexual or labor \nexploitation. Annually, nearly 1 million people, mostly women and \nchildren, are trafficked worldwide, including nearly 18,000 persons \ninto the United States.\n  The fact is that the violent subjugation and exploitation of women \nand girls is ongoing and not enough is being done by governments to \naddress it. Take, for example, reports that in a marketplace in Skopje, \nMacedonia, women are forced to walk around a stage naked while brothel \nowners point their fingers to make a selection. Women are bought and \nsold like cattle and treated like slaves.\n  In Krong Koh Kong, Cambodia, 14-year-old girls stand outside a row of \nshacks where they charge the equivalent of $2 or $3 for sex, half of \nwhich goes to their pimps. These girls, many of whom have AIDS, are \ndiscarded when they become too sick to continue working.\n  Even in the United States, we are not immune to the scourge of human \ntrafficking. Earlier this month, Federal agents raided brothels and \nbusinesses in San Francisco and arrested two dozen people allegedly \noperating an international sex-trafficking ring. Nearly 100 South \nKorean women were lured to illegally enter the United States; \nwhereupon, they were held captive and forced to work as prostitutes.\n  Around the world, women and girls are sold as slaves and forced to \nengage in unprotected sex because clients offer more money for such \nacts. These women have no control over their lives, their health or \ntheir futures. Trafficking victims in the sex industry are exposed to \nHIV/AIDS at much higher rates than the general population, with no \naccess to medical care. The fear of infection of AIDS among customers \nhas driven traffickers to recruit younger girls, erroneously perceived \nto be too young to have been infected.\n  Last month, the State Department issued its fifth annual Trafficking \nin Persons report, which ranks the efforts of 150 countries to combat \nhuman trafficking. Some have observed that the United States has been \nsoft on certain Asian countries thought to be lax on trafficking, such \nas Indonesia, the Philippines, India, and Thailand. Because these \ncountries are vital allies in fighting terrorism, they may have been \ntreated with greater leniency.\n  On the other hand, this year, the State Department identified four \nMiddle Eastern allies--Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab \nEmirates--as being among the worst offenders of human trafficking and \nwhose governments are doing little to control it. Despite the fact that \nthese countries have been important partners of the United States, \ntheir inadequate efforts on human trafficking demand a call to action \nby the United States.\n  Mr. President, this report is merely one first step in combating a \ngrowing international problem. We must call upon governments around the \nworld to renew their efforts against this form of modern-day slavery.\n  We must rededicate our efforts to the prevention of human \ntrafficking, protection of victims, and prosecution of traffickers. \nNowhere on Earth should it be acceptable to deceive, abuse, and force a \nperson into a life of enslavement. To deny a person their right to \nfreedom, is an affront to the ideals established nearly 57 years ago in \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We can and must do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9447-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9447-S9448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF STEPHEN STIGLICH\n\n  Mr. BAYH.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 32 years of \nservice to our Nation of Sergeant Edward Owen Humphreys, U.S. Capitol \nPolice, as he retires from the force.\n  Edward Humphreys was born and raised in Chesapeake Beach, MD, the son \nof Louise and Edward Humphreys. Sergeant Humphreys attended Calvert \nCounty public schools, graduating from Calvert High School in June of \n1967. Soon after graduation, in 1968, Humphreys voluntarily joined the \nU.S. Navy, and proudly served 4 years during the Vietnam war. During \nhis service in the Navy, Second Class Petty Officer Humphreys served on \nthe USS Kitty Hawk and was a member of the VF 213 Black Lions F-14 \nfighter squadron. He spent his Navy time in the Pacific, with service \nin Japan, China, Hong Kong, Australia, Hawaii, and the Philippines.\n  After returning home from duty in the Navy, it was not long before \nHumphreys decided to continue his service to country by joining the \nU.S. Capitol Police in August of 1973. During his many years of duty in \nthe Nation's Capitol, Sergeant Humphreys has worked in the Rayburn \nHouse Office Building, Communications, Patrol Division, and is \ncurrently assigned to the Senate Chamber section.\n  Sergeant Humphreys will enjoy his well-earned retirement with his \nwife of over 30 years, Leslie, and their daughters Casey and Lindsey. \nEven in retirement, Sergeant Humphreys will continue to serve his local \ncommunity as a member and administrator of the North Beach Volunteer \nFire Department--which he joined at age 16.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I am pleased to thank Sergeant Humphreys for \nhis service to country and wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9448-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF POLISH SOLIDARITY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, at the end of World War II, Poland, \nlike other Central European countries, fell behind the Iron Curtain. As \nthe country struggled to recover from the brutal ravages of war and \noccupation, Soviet-backed communist elements seized the reigns of \npower. For many decades, those who sought to be free fought what seemed \nto be a losing, even hopeless, battle. Many were sent to prison, others \nwere murdered or executed.\n  The light of freedom in Poland was never truly extinguished. Year \nafter year, decade after decade, disparate individuals pursued separate \npaths towards the same goal: a free Poland, a free people.\n  By 1980, these individuals had learned much. First, they had learned \nto build bridges, bridges that would unite disparate segments of \nsociety. By 1980, workers and intellectuals, who had separately fought \nfor reform, and separately failed, came together: electricians and \nfactory workers, writers and teachers. And they learned, following the \nhistoric visit of Pope John Paul II to his homeland, in 1979, to ``be \nnot afraid.'' Together, Poles could carve out a space of independence \nfrom the regime that sought to control them. Together, in the shipyards \nof Gdansk, they gave birth to the Solidarity movement.\n  1980 was not, of course, the first time Polish workers had gone on \nstrike, nor would it be the last. But it was the strike that, for \nPoland and beyond, demonstrated the capacity of a nonviolent movement \nto stare down a seemingly more powerful force.\n  Of course, the imposition of martial law on December 13, 1981, was a \ndark and shadowy detour on the path to freedom. Introduced to stave off \na Soviet invasion, it could not, ultimately, stave off the inevitable \nmarch of democracy: Solidarity had let the genie out of the bottle, and \nthere was no getting it back. In 1983, Lech Walesa, the electrician who \nbravely scaled the shipyard wall in August 1980, to join his fellow \nstriking workers, was awarded the Nobel peace prize. Elsewhere in \nCentral Europe, dissident movements intensified their demands for human \nrights. Economic reform moved from an option to a necessity. Even in \nMoscow, a pro-reform apparatchik, Mikhail Gorbachev, rose to lead his \ncountry.\n  By 1989, Solidarity leaders sat across the table from Wojtech \nJaruzelski, the general who had imposed martial law. They negotiated \nwhat had seemed to most of the world impossible: the peaceful \ntransition from communism to free and fair elections. In August of \n1989, less than a decade after the Gdansk shipyard strikes that gave \nbirth to Solidarity, Poland would elect its first non-communist prime \nminister since the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n  Today, we remember and honor those events, not only because of what \nit meant for Poland, but for what it means for all of us, and for \npeople round the globe who continue to struggle to live in freedom and \ndignity. The Solidarity movement represented the culmination of \nenormous, powerful, even irresistible ideals, ideals that we must seek \nto spread to the dark corners of the globe that have yet to see their \nlight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9448-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9448-S9449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HEAD START PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 40th \nAnniversary of the Head Start Program.\n  In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched an 8-week summer \nprogram he called Project Head Start. Initially, funding was modest, \nbut the charge was significant and admirable. In order to break the \ncycle of poverty, Project Head Start would provide comprehensive \nservices to low-income children and their families to help these \nchildren prepare for school.\n  Project Head Start would ensure that low-income children were given \nthe same opportunity to succeed in school that every child in America \ndeserves. Since then, this project has evolved into a well-established \nnational program that serves more than 1 million children across the \nNation.\n  Head Start is a wise investment in our future with lasting, real \neffects. Research has shown that Head Start helps to reduce crime as \nformer Head Start students are less likely to engage in criminal \nactivity than their siblings who do not participate in the program. In \naddition, students enrolled in Head Start have better self-esteem and \nmotivation, and are less likely to be held back a grade than similar \nchildren not in the program. Most importantly, the recently released \n``Head Start Impact Study'' found that Head Start nearly cut in half \nthe achievement gap between low-income Head Start children and more \naffluent, non-Head Start children.\n  Today in Colorado, close to 10,000 children attend the 62 Head Start \nand Early Head Start programs. Each of Colorado's programs is unique \nand tailored to meet the needs of the communities they serve. However, \nall Head Start programs, whether located in the rural San Luis Valley \nor downtown Denver, work to incorporate parents into their children's \neducational development. It is this critical component parental \ninvolvement that distinguishes Head Start from other early education \nand care programs.\n  In every region of Colorado, Head Start and Early Head Start programs \nwork to provide comprehensives services from dental and medical care \nfor students to educational and work training courses for their \nparents. Teachers and administrators create a stimulating educational \nenvironment. They make certain parents feel a part of their children's \neducation by asking them to serve as teacher's aides or as members of \nHead Start policy committees. All of this is accomplished as the \nFederal government continually requires that Head Start improve the \nquality of their services.\n  As Head Start embarks on its fifth decade of service to America, I \nwish the program continued success. Because the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee recently passed bi-partisan \nreauthorization legislation, I expect the Senate to consider this \nimportant bill in the coming months. I look forward to strengthening \nthe Head Start program by passing strong reauthorization language. In \naddition, I hope to work with the Colorado Head Start community in the \nfuture to find mechanisms to improve our commitment to giving all\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\nchildren an opportunity to achieve the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9449-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JUDY ANSLEY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an outstanding \npublic servant, Judy Ansley who for many years has worked as diligently \nand as ably as anyone with whom I have had the privilege of serving \nduring my years in the Senate. Today Judy serves as the first woman \nstaff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During my time \nas vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Judy was the \nminority staff director.\n  How proud I am; how proud the Senate is that Judy Ansley has been \nselected for the position of Special Assistant to the President and \nSenior Director for European Affairs at the National Security Council. \nThe administration could not have made a better choice for this \nimportant post, and I am confident that Judy will serve her country \nwith dignity and honor, as she has done throughout her extensive career \nin public service.\n  My only regret is that Judy Ansley will be stepping down as the staff \ndirector for the Armed Services Committee after next week. Over the \ncourse of the last 6 years, Judy has dedicated her time, energy, and \nintelligence to the work of the Committee with great enthusiasm. As the \ndeputy staff director and staff director, Judy has provided exceptional \nleadership to the committee during challenging times, and I am deeply \ngrateful for her profound concern for the issues facing the men and \nwomen of our armed services. I am confident that my colleagues on the \ncommittee would agree that she has been an indispensable resource for \nour efforts.\n  In those instances where she had professional views in opposition to \nmine, she never hesitated to express them. I trust she will most \nrespectfully continue to offer her candid assessments in her new job at \nthe White House.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to observe closely Judy's indefatigable efforts. Before she \njoined the committee, Judy served as my national security advisor for 5 \nyears, and her keen judgment and incisiveness were readily apparent \nthroughout her work. Truly, while I am pleased that the administration \nwill be gaining such a remarkable asset, I will miss Judy's wise \ncounsel. I send my deepest gratitude to Judy as she begins her \ntransition to the National Security Council, and I join with her \nwonderful family--husband Steve and daughters Megan and Rachel--in \ncelebrating this achievement.\n  I also take this opportunity to announce Judy's successor as staff \ndirector for the Armed Services Committee. I have asked Mr. Charles S. \nAbell, the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel \nand Readiness, to become the new staff director, and it gives me great \npleasure to note that he has accepted this responsibility.\n  A humble and devoted patriot, Charlie Abell has served his country \nwith valor in every endeavor. Before joining the administration, \nCharlie was an exceptional member of the Armed Services Committee \nprofessional staff. During his years with the committee staff, Charlie \nwas the lead staffer for the Subcommittee on Personnel, including \nissues of military readiness and quality of life. A highly decorated \nsoldier, he retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel after 26 \nyears of distinguished service. I was privileged to work with this \noutstanding public servant during his previous term with the Committee, \nand I look forward to collaborating with him in the months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9449-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9449-S9451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BLOODSHED IN CHECHNYA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the Romans, said Tacitus, ``created a \ndesert and called it peace.'' The Russian Government has created a \nwasteland of death and destruction in Chechnya and called it \n``normalization.''\n  Over 10 years since the beginning of the Chechen war in post-Soviet \nRussia, the carnage in Chechnya continues, taking the lives of Chechens \nand Russians alike. Moreover, the echoes of the conflict are now \nstretching across the entire North Caucasus region. Given the \ninformation blockade that the Russian Government has thrown up around \nChechnya, the world hears little of the violence and suffering taking \nplace in those mountains far away.\n  Nevertheless, some information does get out. As Chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I would like to share some of this information \nwith my distinguished colleagues.\n  According to Agence France Press, on June 4, 2005, an estimated 200-\n300 armed men, arriving in jeeps, trucks and armored personnel \ncarriers, staged an attack on the village of Borozdinovskaya, near the \nborder with neighboring Dagestan. These villagers are not Chechen, but \nAvars, Dagestan's most numerous ethnic group. The raiders beat dozens \nof men and torched at least three houses. Eleven men vanished and are \nfeared dead. The villagers have no idea who the assailants were, but \nevidence points to a battalion of amnestied former Chechen rebels \nallegedly operating under the command of Russia's military \nintelligence.\n  In fear of their lives, almost the entire village has fled to the \nDagestan side of the border, camping out in tents in a field, fearing \nto return.\n  There has been no official explanation for the raid.\n  This is only one example of the violence that may engulf an \nunsuspecting village that comes into the crosshairs of the pro-Moscow \nChechen militias that operate with impunity and unrestrained cruelty. A \nnumber of these militias are no more than marauding gangs only \nnominally under the authority of the pro-Moscow regime in the Chechen \ncapital of Grozny.\n  In its March 2005 publication, ``More of the Same: Extrajudicial \nKillings, Enforced `Disappearances', Illegal Arrests, Torture,'' the \nInternational Helsinki Federation reports:\n\n       ``There are a few signs of peaceful life. Compensations for \n     lost housing are slowly beginning to be paid (on rare \n     occasions, even without kick-back to relevant officials), \n     separate islands of reconstruction are appearing in Grozny, \n     and many cars are visible on the streets. The central open-\n     air market is ever so busy.\n       But some other things have not changed at all: Abductions \n     and illegal detentions of civilians by unknown armed persons \n     dressed in camouflage are still pervasive. The only \n     difference is that these people now do not arrive exclusively \n     in military vehicles, but in regular cars as well. As a \n     result, murders, torture, and beatings have remained \n     unchanged. And the prosecutor's office is still unable or \n     unwilling to provide effective investigation into these \n     endless cases.''\n\n  Let me make it clear. I have no sympathy for Chechen partisans, or \nthose purporting to sympathize with them, who have committed, and may \nyet commit, terrorist attacks against the innocent citizens of the \nRussian Federation, or against those Chechens who may not support the \nsecessionist movement. When we speak of the terrorist attacks on New \nYork, Washington, Madrid, London, Bali, and other cities around the \nworld, we must not forget Moscow, Budennovsk, and Beslan. There must be \nno double standard in judging terrorism, nor is there any justification \nfor people resorting to terrorism against innocent civilians.\n  But I refer to one of the most perceptive editorials written on the \nsubject of Chechnya. In the November 11, 2002 issue of Newsweek, Fareed \nZacharia wrote:\n\n       ``[The Chechens] have been ruthless warriors for their \n     cause, utterly unable to form a stable government, and have \n     indeed resorted to terror. But Russia's actions have helped \n     turn them into terrorists. Russia has destroyed Chechnya as a \n     place, as a polity and as a society. Chechnya is now a \n     wasteland, populated by marauding gangs Putin has spoken of \n     Al Qaeda's presence in Chechnya, but none existed until \n     recently when Chechens, devastated by the Russian onslaught, \n     took help from wherever they could get it.\n\n  Some residents of Chechnya, having despaired of finding justice in \nthe Russian judicial system and rejecting terrorism, have applied to \nthe European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. They are seeking \nredress for human rights violations committed under cover of Moscow's \n``anti-terrorism campaign.'' Many of these applicants have been \nharassed and detained by the authorities.\n  One applicant, Zura Bitieva, had filed an application with Strasbourg \nregarding the abuses at the notorious ``filtration'' prison at \nChernokosovo. Subsequently, she was killed in May 2003 along with her \nhusband and son during a raid on their home.\n  The world recoiled in horror from the murderous attack on children in\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\nBeslan, North Ossetia. This is but one example of the spread of the \ncancer of violence emanating from Chechnya. A few days ago, President \nPutin made an unannounced visit to Dagestan to review the deteriorating \nsecurity situation in that unquiet Russian republic. Unrest and \nviolence have occurred also in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.\n  Russia is entitled to protect its territorial integrity and to \npreserve order within its borders, but Moscow's methods hark back to \nthe practices of the Middle Ages. It is as if the principles of the \nGeneva Accords, the UN, the Council of Europe and the OSCE are \ncompletely unknown let alone apply--in Chechnya.\n  To the best of my knowledge, no one in the Russian Ministry of \nInternal Affairs has had to answer for the brutality that has taken \nplace at the Chernokosovo prison. When horrific practices at \nChernokosovo became known to the international community, Moscow merely \nshifted the facility's jurisdiction to the Ministry of Justice. \nAccording to human rights activists, ``filtration'' procedures simply \nmoved to smaller, less visible places.\n  Does no one in the Kremlin stop to consider that continued \nbrutalization of the population and corrupt governance will likely \nincrease the appeal of Islamic radicals in the region? Is Russia's \npolicy in Chechnya the strategy of a serious partner in the war against \ninternational terrorism? Or is Russia fighting a fire with an \nextinguisher filled with gasoline?\n  Next year Russia will chair the G8. Many informed observers doubt \nwhether Russia should remain a member of the G8, given the downward \ntrajectory of human rights and civil liberties in Russia today.\n  The Russian Federation's policy in Chechnya reinforces those doubts.\n\n\n           FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE MURDER OF PAUL KLEBNIKOV\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith my colleague from New York and fellow member of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, Senator Clinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in a colloquy with \nthe senior Senator from Kansas, and my chairman on the Helsinki \nCommission, Mr. Brownback. We are united in believing the subject we \nwill address is of great importance to this body. I appreciate my \nchairman's willingness to present these issues to our colleagues.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, 1 year ago this month a tragic crime \noccurred on the streets of Moscow. On July 9, 2004, Paul Klebnikov, the \n41-year-old American editor of Forbes Russia, was murdered in a \ngangland-style shooting near his Moscow office. His death was an \nenormous loss for investigative journalism and for efforts to establish \nthe kind of transparent civil society that the Russian people so want \nand deserve.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The most plausible explanation for his murder appears \nto be the power of his investigative journalism, which explored the \nconnections between business, politics, and crime in Russia. His murder \nhas galvanized those who care deeply about justice, as well as the fate \nof democracy and the rule of law in Russia.\n  Paul Klebnikov was a descendant of Russian emigres and a New Yorker. \nHis widow Musa Klebnikov and children still live in New York City. \nPaul's murder shows us in tragic terms one of the threats faced by the \npress and civil society in Russia. The silencing of Paul Klebnikov's \nvoice is a direct challenge to independent journalism, democracy, and \nthe rule of law.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reading his reporting from Russia, one could tell that \nhe was deeply troubled by the crime and corruption that plagued his \nancestral homeland. His personal association with his subject, combined \nwith an educational background in economics, his excellent command of \nthe Russian language, and 15 years experience with the Forbes \norganization, made him uniquely qualified to report on the nexus of \nbusiness, politics, and crime in today's Russia.\n  Paul Klebnikov's killing epitomizes the brazen lawlessness that still \nplagues Russia even after the ascension to power of a putatively ``law \nand order'' ex-KGB official. For all the talk about stability in Russia \ntoday, it is sometimes a stability based on not asking the wrong \nquestions about the wrong people.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Paul Klebnikov's widow Musa has explained that Paul, \nthrough his journalism, sought to foster hope in the hearts of the \nordinary Russian citizen, bring corruption to light and focus attention \non positive models of how a democracy ought to operate.\n  Chairman Brownback and I have sought to keep the attention of the \nUnited States Government focused on reinforcing with Russian \nauthorities the vital need to hold to account all those responsible for \nPaul Klebnikov's murder. I was pleased to join with nine of my \ncolleagues on the Helsinki Commission in writing to President Putin and \ncalling for an aggressive investigation into the killing.\n  I also wrote to President Bush to ask him to raise the issue of \nPaul's murder with President Putin during their meeting in Bratislava, \nSlovakia on February 24th. That meeting with President Putin presented \nan opportunity to make clear that all those involved in instigating, \nordering, planning and carrying out the murder should be prosecuted to \nthe full extent of the law.\n  The Helsinki Commission and my office have been assured that \nrepresentatives of the State Department have expressed to the \nGovernment of Russia the United States Government's desire to see a \nthorough and complete investigation of this murder.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, State Department and other administration \nofficials have raised the issue frequently with their Russian \ncounterparts. Furthermore, State and other relevant Government agencies \nhave formed an interagency working group to follow the case and consult \non strategy. Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice met \nwith Klebnikov family members to keep them informed on progress. In \naddition, Secretary Rice's public remarks during her February 5 visit \nto Warsaw are heartening. She said it ``is important that Russia make \nclear to the world that it is intent on strengthening the rule of law, \nstrengthening the role of an independent judiciary, permitting a free \nand independent press to flourish. These are all the basics of \ndemocracy.''\n  Mrs. CLINTON. For their part, Russian law enforcement authorities \nhave made arrests and filed charges. While Russian authorities should \nbe commended for the energy they have shown to date, there are \nadditional steps that would increase the chances that all those \nresponsible are held to account. I hope that the United States \nGovernment will continue to make clear to Russian authorities that \nresources such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation are available to \nassist Russian authorities in the investigation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Earlier this year, Russian authorities charged two \nChechens, Musa Vakhayev and Kazbek Dukuzov, with killing Paul \nKlebnikov, and subsequently announced that the man who ordered the \nmurder was one Khozh-Akmed Nukaev a former official of the rebel \nChechen government. Klebnikov had interviewed Nukaev extensively in his \nbook ``Conversations with a Barbarian,'' and supposedly Nukhayev wanted \nrevenge for the journalist's critical portrayal of him in the book. Mr. \nNukaev's present whereabouts are unknown. I should add that relatives \nand friends of Paul have expressed their doubts about this accusation, \nwhich raises more questions than it answers.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. These recent developments underline the fundamental \nimportance of transparency. I hope the Russian authorities will share \nas much information as possible with Paul Klebnikov's family. Without a \ntransparent process, doubt will remain that the person or persons truly \nresponsible for ordering Paul's murder will be brought to justice.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Paul believed that the press was the last outpost of \nfreedom of speech in Russia. The fear and self-censorship generated by \nkilling journalists benefits corrupt government officials and \nbusinessmen, as well as organized crime figures.\n  Solving the murder no matter where the investigation leads--will send \nthe signal to other malefactors who seek to muzzle free speech that the \ndays of impunity and lawlessness are over. As we wrote to President \nPutin, this case is not just about one person, but about what he \nrepresented to a new and democratic Russia. I would note also\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nthat at least two more journalists have been killed in Russia since \nPaul's death.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Paul Klebnikov's work continues to serve the people of \nRussia and the cause of democracy. We should continue to press \nauthorities to find everyone who was involved in Paul's murder and hold \nthem to account.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree with my colleague from New York. And as \nMembers of the Helsinki Commission, let us work to achieve the goal of \nfreedom of the press, transparency and democracy in Russia.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That would be an appropriate gesture in honor of Paul \nKlebnikov. I look forward to continuing my work with the senior Senator \nfrom Kansas and chairman of the Helsinki Commission, and I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I commend the active interest the junior Senator from \nNew York has taken in the Klebnikov case, and I look forward to our \nfurther collaboration on other vital OSCE issues before the Helsinki \nCommission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9451-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DR. KENT AMES\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise on the floor today to express my \nthanks and appreciation to Dr. Kent Ames, who today completes his \nfellowship in my office, after 9 months of dedicated work with me, my \nstaff, and my constituents in Oregon.\n  Dr. Ames is a distinguished member of two occupations: veterinary \nmedicine and higher education. He was selected by the Association of \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Colleges as the North American Outstanding \nTeacher in 1995. In 2001, Kent served as president of the American \nAssociation of Bovine Practitioners.\n  Kent's fellowship in my office was sponsored by the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science. During his time here in \nWashington, DC, Kent has provided a unique scientific perspective on a \nnotable array of policy issues across the spectrum. In the Commerce \nCommittee, he has worked on nanoscience, NASA authorization and the \nconfirmation of the current NASA Administrator. It is thus only fitting \nthat the last week of Kent's fellowship coincided with the successful \nlaunch of Shuttle Discovery.\n  Kent's passions seem to be sparked most when politics and science \nconverge. There is no better arena to experience this than in natural \nresources, especially if one is a veterinarian. In a short time period, \nKent has lent his scientific background and outlook to issues such as \nmad cow disease and international beef trade, foodborne disease, \nbiosecurity, wolf reintroduction, and animal treatment. The management \nof feral horse populations in the West, which significantly affects \nOregon, has been of particular interest to Kent. He developed an \nenthusiastic and widely recognized expertise in the issue, as well as \nthe scientific and ethical implications of varying policy options.\n  More than all of this, however, my staff and I deeply value the \nfriendship we have made with Kent Ames. We will miss his warm character \nand his stories, and wish him happy trails for the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9451-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          POLICIES RELATED TO DETAINEES FROM THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, when the Senate reconvenes in \nSeptember, one of the first orders of business will be the Defense \nauthorization bill. During August, I respectfully suggest the President \nreconsider his opposition to legislation that would set the rules for \nthe treatment and interrogation of detainees.\n  I have decided to cosponsor three amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill that clarify our policies relative to detainees from \nthe war on terror. There has been some debate about whether it is \nappropriate for Congress to set rules on the treatment of detainees, \nbut for me this question isn't even close.\n  The people through their elected representatives should set the rules \nfor how detainees and prisoners under U.S. control are treated and \ninterrogated. In the short term, the President can set the rules, but \nthe war on terror is now nearly 4 years old. We don't want judges \nmaking up the rules. So, for the long term, the people should set the \nrules. That is why we have a independent Congress.\n  In fact, the Constitution says, quite clearly, that is what Congress \nshould do: article I, section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress, \nand Congress alone, shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning \nCaptures on Land and Water.''\n  So Congress has a responsibility to set clear rules here.\n  But the spirit of these amendments is really one that I hope the \nWhite House will decide to embrace. In essence, these amendments codify \nmilitary procedures and policies, procedures in the Army Field Manual, \npolicies regarding compliance with the Convention Against Torture \nsigned by President Reagan, and policies the Defense Department has set \nregarding the classification of detainees.\n  That is right. All three of these amendments uphold or codify \npolicies and procedures the administration says we are following today \nand intend to follow moving forward.\n  Senator Graham's amendment No. 1505 authorizes the system the Defense \nDepartment has created--Combat Status Review Tribunals--which are there \nfor determining whether a detainee is a lawful or unlawful combatant \nand then ensures that information from interrogating those detainees \nwas derived from following the rules regarding their treatment. Senator \nGraham's amendment also allows the President to make adjustments when \nnecessary as long as he notifies Congress.\n  The first McCain Amendment No. 1556, prohibits cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment or punishment of detainees. The amendment is in \nspecific compliance with the Convention Against Torture that was signed \nby President Reagan. The administration says that we are already \nupholding those standards when it comes to treatment of detainees, so \nthis should be no problem.\n  The second McCain amendment No. 1557 states simply that the \ninterrogation techniques used by the military on detainees shall be \nthose specified by the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. \nThe military, not Congress, writes that manual, and we are told that \nthe techniques specified in that manual will do the job. Further, the \nmanual is under revision now to include techniques related to unlawful \ncombatants, including classified portions, that will continue to give \nthe President and the military a great deal of flexibility.\n  If the President thinks these are the wrong rules, I hope he will \nsubmit new ones to Congress so that we can debate and pass them. I am \none Senator who would give great weight to the President's views on \nthis matter. It is quite possible the Graham and McCain amendments need \nto be altered to set the right rules, but it is time for Congress to \nact.\n  This has been a gray area in our law. In this gray area, the question \nis who should set the rules. In the short term, surely the President \ncan. In the longer term, the people should, through their elected \nrepresentatives. We don't want the courts to write the rules.\n  In summary, it is time for Congress, which represents the people, to \nclarify and set the rules for detention and interrogation of our \nenemies. During the next few weeks, I hope the White House will tell us \nwhat rules and procedures the President needs to succeed in this \neffort. That way we can move forward together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9451-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, the Senate recently passed S. Res. 31, a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the week of August \n7, 2005, be designated as ``National Health Center Week.''\n  In keeping with this resolution, I rise today to commend the work of \nthe Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers and of all of \nthe health centers of Delaware for the role they play in delivering \nquality, affordable health care to the people of Delaware.\n  Community health centers are community-run and open to all Americans \nregardless of their ability to pay. Delaware has a number of community \nhealth centers, including Westside Health in Wilmington and Newark, \nHenrietta Johnson in Wilmington, Delmarva Kent Community Health Center \nin Dover, and La Red Health Center in Sussex County. These centers and \nthose across our Nation are extremely valuable, operating in both rural \nand urban medically underserved areas and providing care that might not \notherwise be available to residents.\n  By serving as a point of access for affordable primary and preventive \ncare, health centers also help patients stay healthier or, if they are \nill, allow them to receive treatment earlier. This prevents patients \nfrom having to seek care in the most expensive setting--the emergency \nroom--and therefore can save money for our health system as a whole.\n  Again, I wish to commend the health centers of Delaware for their \ndedication. I thank them for the valuable services they provide to all \nDelawareans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9452-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING DELEGATE GLENN M. WEATHERHOLTZ\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize one \nof Virginia's most dedicated public servants, Delegate Glenn M. \nWeatherholtz, who is retiring this year after five terms in the \nVirginia House of Delegates.\n  Born and raised in Shenandoah County, Delegate Weatherholtz has made \na career out of serving his country and his community. His public \nservice includes a two year tour of duty in the U.S. Army. Later, he \njoined the Virginia State Police, where he served for over 10 years. \nAnd I was pleased during my term as Governor to appoint Glenn to be on \nthe Hazardous Materials Commission in Virginia.\n  Much of Delegate Weatherholtz's career has been spent in law \nenforcement. In 1971, Glenn was elected sheriff of Rockingham County \nand Harrisonburg. He was subsequently reelected five times to the \nposition. During his career, he has served as chairman of the \nAccreditation Committee for the Virginia Sheriffs' Association and the \nVirginia Chiefs of Police Association.\n  Glenn's law enforcement record is exceptional. He was named \nOutstanding Law Enforcement Officer of the Year by the Harrisonburg \nMoose Lodge, and Outstanding Lawman of the Year by the Harrisonburg \nKiwanis Club. As sheriff, he was appointed to be an Honorary United \nStates Deputy Marshal and received the Law Enforcement Commendation by \nthe Sons of the American Revolution. He also graduated from the F.B.I \nNational Academy.\n  In 1995, Glenn was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. His \ncommittee assignments include: Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural \nResources; Courts of Justice; Militia, Police and Public Safety; and \nCounties, Cities and Towns. As a delegate, Glenn has shown a strong \ncommitment to commonsense business practices, law and order, education, \nfamilies, and support for those with mental illness.\n  Delegate Weatherholtz is married to the former Blanche Gordon. The \ncouple has four children together and they are active in the Brown \nMemorial United Church of Christ, where Glenn sings in the choir; he is \nalso a lay reader and an elder on the church governing board.\n  The 26th District, and indeed all of Virginia, will surely miss the \nleadership and talents that Delegate Weatherholtz displayed in the \nVirginia General Assembly and throughout his career of service. I thank \nGlenn for his commitment to improve the Commonwealth of Virginia. And I \ncongratulate him on his retirement and wish him many more years of \nsuccess and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9452-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9452-S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH, WEIRTON, WV\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I \nrise today to publicly recognize the 175th anniversary of the First \nChristian Church in Weirton, WV. The church has ministered to the Ohio \nValley since West Virginia was recognized as our country's 35th state.\n  The Christian Church, which is also known as the Disciples of Christ, \nis a Protestant denomination of approximately 800,000 members in the \nUnited States and Canada. It is one of the largest faith groups founded \non American soil. The founders of the Christian Church were Thomas \nCampbell and his son Alexander Campbell. Both of these men and other \ndistinguished leaders of the Disciples of Christ ministered at the \nFirst Christian Church in Weirton.\n  Members of the church have been faithful in serving their country. \nOne of the church's original members, in fact, received a Congressional \nMedal of Honor in 1898. Mr. Uriah Brown received the award for his \nheroism in the Civil War, especially at the siege of Vicksburg.\n  Weirton is very much a city that reflects the struggles of the steel \nindustry in our Nation. The city was once a booming steel town, \nemploying up to 20,000 people. Unfortunately, the steel industry has \nhad a very tough time recovering from the massive dumping of steel by \nour foreign competition in the late 1990s, and the church has had to \nadapt its ministries to meet the needs of the city's now dwindling \npopulation. The challenges that First Christian Church has faced \nreflect the difficulties faced by the city.\n  The church helped to create Weirton's Christians Helping Arrange New \nGrowth Enterprises, or the CHANGE program, which encourages the \nintegration of services, the building of partnerships, and the pooling \nof resources to empower families toward self-sufficiency. As Governor, \nI saw first-hand the work of the First Christian Church in helping \nestablish Weirton Steel's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP, in \n1983. When the ESOP was in its beginning stages, First Christian Church \nprovided financial support to the employees as they pulled together to \nprevent the city's primary business from closing. The church also \nprovided food for those who were in need and assisted members of the \ncongregation who were unemployed throughout this period.\n  As the church enters it 176th year, it remains an important part of \nthe community, directly addressing the many needs of an aging steel \ntown. Among the several ministries of the church, one includes the \nchurch's Food Cupboard, which provides financial and food aid for laid-\noff steel workers and their families living in the Upper Ohio Valley. \nThe church also has a food relief fund, and it works with the Salvation \nArmy.\n  The church has not only been influential in Weirton and the Ohio \nValley but also in the world. It is a leader in the denomination's \nReconciliations Ministry, which is a ministry designed to specifically \nfight racial prejudice. First Christian Church has been one of the top \nfive financial givers to the Reconciliations Ministry. In addition, \nthey work closely with St. Peter's AME\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\nChurch, which has an African American congregation. Even though St. \nPeter's is not the same denomination as the First Christian Church, the \nchurch considers it a sister church.\n  Since 1830, the First Christian Church has provided a place of hope, \nfaith, shelter, and witness for the people of West Virginia. I join \nwith them in celebrating its good works and wishing it all the best as \nit prepares for another century of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9453-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DONALD T. BUTLER\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to \nmeet a wonderful American, Donald Butler, who served his country ably \nin Vietnam. His story is typical of so many Americans who have placed \ntheir lives and health at risk for their country.\n  Donald Butler was drafted 6 months after graduating from Straughn \nHigh School in Covington County, AL. After completing basic training \nand advanced infantry training, he left for Vietnam on April 17, 1966.\n  Having trained as an infantryman, he was slated to go with the Big \nRed One, the first division called to fight in Vietnam, but at the last \nminute became a replacement for the 25th Infantry Division and later \nwent with the 27th Infantry, Tropic Lightening, Charlie Company in \nCuChi, Vietnam.\n  CuChi, Vietnam, as the world later learned, was home to the CuChi \ntunnel complex--130 miles of underground passageways started during the \nwar against the French and expanded when the Americans arrived. Built \nby night over many years, the tunnels allowed the Vietcong to become \ninvisible to the enemy, conceal snipers and move weapons silently. The \nG.I.'s that fought in the tunnels were a special breed, known by their \npeers as ``Tunnel Rats.'' They were fearless warriors. Donald Butler \nwas one of them.\n  At a slight 100 pounds, Donald was able to do what many of his fellow \nsoldiers could not, squeeze through the tight trap doors and crawl \nalong the narrow passages of the clay tunnels with relative ease. Make \nno mistake, while his size aided him in his mission, it was his even \ntemperament and inquisitive mind that made him a true ``Tunnel Rat''. \nIt was not uncommon for him to crawl through narrow, pitch black \ntunnels for hours looking for the enemy.\n  Over a period of 9 months, Donald went out on 37 operations, most of \nwhich were search and destroy missions. He saw his fellow soldiers lose \ntheir limbs and, in many instances, their lives. He lived through air \nstrikes and mortar attacks and somehow managed to return from the front \nlines of Vietnam without ever sustaining a direct hit. For that, many \nwould say he was lucky.\n  Like so many of our veterans, Donald Butler returned from the war to \nface an uncertain future. ``When I got off the plane in Montgomery on \nApril 18, 1967, I thought I was going to get shot because we had heard \nof the protests back in the U.S.'' he later recalled. To this day he \nsuffers from post traumatic stress and severe hearing loss. He is an \nundecorated hero who should be applauded and thanked for his service \nand I rise to do that today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9453-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING DELEGATE ALLEN L. LOUDERBACK\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize one \nof Virginia's most dedicated public servants, Delegate Allen L. \nLouderback, who is retiring after serving three terms in the Virginia \nHouse of Delegates.\n  Delegate Louderback has been a strong advocate for lower taxes in \nVirginia, serving as the ranking majority member of the House Finance \nCommittee, and as the chairman of both the House Subcommittee on Sales \nTax Exemptions and the Subcommittee on Tax Preferences. From 2001 to \n2003, he also served on the Joint Subcommittee to Reform Commonwealth \nTax Structure.\n  In addition, Delegate Louderback served on the Agriculture, \nChesapeake and Natural Resources Committee, where he chaired the \nChesapeake Subcommittee, and sat on the House Committee on Militia, \nPolice and Public Safety. In 2002, he was named Legislator of the Year \nfor the 140-member Virginia General Assembly by the Family Foundation. \nAnd in 2003, Allen was awarded the same honor by the Commissioners of \nRevenue Association. Delegate Louderback is also a member of the \nCommonwealth Competition Council, the State Procurement Commission, and \nthe State Water Commission, where he chairs the Karst Subcommittee.\n  Prior to his small business entrepreneurship and public service in \nLuray, VA, Allen worked in Washington, DC, as an investigator and \nmanager for the U.S. General Accounting Office for 18 years. As a \nmanager at GAO, he was the recipient of the Director's Award for his \n``outstanding managerial skills'' in 1979.\n  Delegate Louderback earned his B.S. from Virginia Polytechnic \nInstitute and State University. He is a past president of the Luray \nRotary Club and the Luray Kiwanis Club. His wife, Nadia, and two sons \nattend Leaksville United Church of Christ.\n  The 15th District, and indeed all of Virginia, will surely miss the \nleadership and talents that Delegate Allen Louderback displayed in the \nVirginia General Assembly. I would like to recognize and thank Allen \nfor his commitment to bettering the Commonwealth of Virginia. I \ncongratulate him on his retirement and wish him many more years of \nsuccess and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9453-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING MAYOR RALPH H. DEAN\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nMayor Ralph Dean of Luray, VA, as he celebrates his silver anniversary \nthis month as the town's highest elected official. Since 1980, Mayor \nDean has worked to make the town of Luray a better place to work and \nlive, and I applaud him for such dedicated public service.\n  For 25 years, Mayor Dean has been a successful advocate for lower \ntaxes and business growth in Luray. His policies have helped to attract \nindustry and investment, which have in turn created more jobs for the \nlocal citizens. He has also helped develop recreational opportunities \nfor his town, such as Lake Arrowhead and Luray Recreational Park. And, \nin 2004, Ralph oversaw the beautiful new renovation of Luray Town Hall. \nThe expansion and revitalization of Luray under Mayor Dean's leadership \nhas helped the town become a more prosperous and enjoyable place to \ncall home.\n  The mayor has also built a great family with his wife Billie. They \nhave a daughter named Dixie Dean Foltz, and a grandson named Patrick \nFoltz. Mayor Dean is a member of the Luray Christian Church. He has \nalso been a member of the Luray Lions Club for over 30 years and a Boy \nScout Leader for over 20 years. Prior to his tenure as mayor, Ralph \nserved on the Luray town council from 1974 until 1980.\n  Mayor Dean is an effective leader in Luray because he genuinely \nenjoys what he does and cares about the citizens of Luray. I \ncongratulate the mayor on 25 years of dedication to public service in \nLuray, VA, and wish him and his family many more years of happiness and \nsuccess. Our Commonwealth is fortunate to have a man of his character \nand leadership leading the way in the town of Luray.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9453-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9453-S9454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING COL HENRY MITNAUL\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, Henry Mitnaul of the U.S. Air Force \nhas served as the Military Assistant in the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs for the past 2 years. As \nthe principal military contact for the Directors of Legislative Liaison \nof the Services, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense, he played a critical role in ensuring that all \ndefense-related legislative issues were addressed.\n  During this period, Colonel Mitnaul dealt with congressional requests \nfor information and the chief coordinator for military travel requests. \nColonel Mitnaul's expertise and experience with the Department's Travel \nProgram certainly made him into an invaluable asset to Congress, White \nHouse staff, and national security personnel. During his time in \noffice, Colonel Mitnaul planned and coordinated over 650 congressional \nand White House travel requests.\n  I understand that Colonel Mitnaul's proficiency in the congressional \nprocess helped him become an admired and\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nrespected member of the Military Assistant's office. His nature and \nprofessionalism served him well, as he capably worked alongside Members \nof Congress and congressional staffers, executive branch officials, and \nthose in private sector organization. Colonel Mitnaul's accomplishments \nreflect highly upon himself, the U.S. Air Force, and the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I am proud that Colonel Henry Mitnaul is a fellow North Carolinian. I \nam grateful for his lengthy and distinguished career in public service, \nas I am for all who serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DUANE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I first met Duane Johnson when he \ncame on the baseball field at Wilcox County High School in 1965. We \nwere a small school. I was a senior in a class of 30 and Duane, a \njunior, had just moved to town. Though we had a competitive team, \nwinning our division of the Black Belt Conference that year, we were \nnot particularly talented. While we knew a good bit about baseball, we \nhad not grown up as kids do today, playing well-coached and competitive \nbaseball from elementary school on up. Duane, however, impressed us at \nonce with his skill and knowledge of the game. I liked the way he \nhandled first base and he could hit too. More importantly, he was never \nshowy but played within himself. We were impressed and liked him.\n  That was quite a few years ago and we have not seen one another \nsince, I don't think. So it was with real pleasure that I read that my \nold teammate, now the head coach of Patrician Academy in Butler, \nAlabama, had just completed a sterling season with a 25-7 record, \nwinning the AISA State Championship. Further, Duane was named AISA \n``Coach of the Year''. He has been the head coach at Patrician for 20 \nyears and has been a part of 6 state championships as a Saint. This \nyear's team produced two All-State players, Bo Meeks and Brent Bonner, \nand an honorable mention, Brandon Mosely. Quick to give credit to \nothers, Duane praised assistant coach Jim Archibald to the Choctaw Sun \nsaying, ``We couldn't have done it without him.'' After graduating from \nWilcox County High School in 1966, Duane attended Livingston \nUniversity, now the University of West Alabama, where he played \nbaseball. He is married to the former Nara Gyles, a Choctaw County \nnative, and has three children. Typical of so many of Alabama's \nteachers and coaches, Duane was a member of the Alabama National Guard \nand was a veteran of ``Desert Storm''. Our country is deeply indebted \nthose civilians who serve in the Guard and Reserve and who are prepared \nto respond when called upon. Coaches mean a lot to young people and I \nknow that the consistent record of success that Duane has had at \nPatrician demonstrates his ability to positively impact these young \npeople. All over this country, coaches give their time and attention to \nboys and girls, introducing them to the thrill of victory and the agony \nof defeat. More importantly, they teach them teamwork. Teamwork is a \nvery important strength of Americans. We have the ability to quickly \norganize ourselves and function as one whether in business or combat. \nSuch character traits are largely developed on the athletic field. \nGreat teamwork comes from great coaches.\n  Let me close by giving my sincerest congratulations to Coach Johnson \nand his state championship Saints. They have had a most memorable \nseason and they will be able to savor their achievement for the rest of \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9454-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BICENTENNIAL OF THE BIRTH OF HIRAM POWERS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, July 29, 2005, is the \nbicentennial of the birth of Hiram Powers, an American neoclassical \nsculptor whose works are admired in museums throughout this Nation and \nin this beautiful Capitol. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow lovers of art \nand students of history are gathering in Woodstock, VT, the town of \nHiram Powers birth and his early years, to celebrate and rediscover his \ncontributions to American art and sculpture.\n  I sincerely wish I could join the Hiram Powers Celebration Committee \nin Woodstock this weekend. However, to enjoy Hiram Powers work, I only \nhave to walk a few steps out of this Chamber. At the foot of the East \nStaircase, just outside the Senate Chamber, stands a statue of Benjamin \nFranklin sculpted by Hiram Powers. That statue, commissioned by \nPresident James Buchanan in 1859, was delivered to its present location \nin 1862. In the corresponding location in the House Wing of the Capitol \nstands a statue of Thomas Jefferson, completed by Hiram Powers in 1863. \nAlso here in the Capitol, a bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice John \nMarshall by Hiram Powers resides, fittingly, in the Old Supreme Court \nChamber.\n  The Smithsonian American Art Museum collection includes 70 works by \nHiram Powers. The Corcoran Gallery of Art and the National Gallery of \nArt, both located here in Washington, also include works by Hiram \nPowers in their distinguished collections. In other U.S. cities--\nincluding New York City, Boston, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee, to name a \nfew--museums of fine arts hold Hiram Powers' works.\n  Hiram Powers' most well-known sculpture is ``The Greek Slave,'' first \ncompleted in 1843. One rendition from 1846 sits today at the Corcoran, \nand a later rendition from 1873 can be found at the Smithsonian. To \nquote a curator of American Art at the corcoran, ``The Greek Slave,'' \nthe first publicly exhibited, life-size American sculpture depicting a \nfully nude human figure, met with unprecedented popular and critical \nsuccess. Arguably the most famous American sculpture ever, the Slave \nnot only won Powers enormous international acclaim but also enhanced \nthe overseas reputation of American art and culture.'' Hiram Powers was \nan outspoken abolitionist in the decades preceding the Civil War. ``The \nGreek Slave'', which depicts a Greek Christian woman, captured during \nthe Greek War of Independence, awaiting her sale in the slave market, \nbecame a symbol of the savagery of slavery in the United States. \nScholars note that it was the most widely viewed statue of its time \nthanks to its tour of Eastern and Midwestern States.\n  Hiram Powers died in 1873, leaving behind the richest legacy of art \nof, perhaps, any American sculptor. I close today by thanking the Hiram \nPowers Celebration Committee. I wish them success during this weekend's \nevents to remember Hiram Powers, his contributions to American art, and \nhis Vermont heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9454-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9454-S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF L. D. ``DICK'' OWEN, JR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nlong time friend and lifelong Alabamian who recently passed away. Mr. \nL. D. ``Dick'' Owen, Jr. died at the age of 86 following a life \ndedicated to service, family, his community and his State.\n  Dick has led a remarkable life. As a war hero, he received six Bronze \nStars and an Arrowhead. He served as a U.S. Paratrooper during World \nWar II in North Africa and Europe, and in the Far East during the \nKorean Conflict. As a public official, he was devoted to the \nenvironment, agriculture and education. And as a member of the Bay \nMinette community, Dick was a dedicated public servant to his hometown \nand served in numerous volunteer positions throughout his life.\n  Born in Baldwin County on April 10, 1919, he attended Baldwin County \nSchools and graduated from the University of Alabama in 1941. Upon \ncollege graduation, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy Reserve and entered Active Duty on June 27, 1941.\n  In August 1942, Dick attended Airborne School, and after completion \nof training at Fort Benning, GA, he was assigned to the 504th Paratroop \nInfantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division at Ft. Bragg, NC.\n  He served overseas from May, 1943, until November, 1945, and it was \nduring his service in Europe that he received six Bronze Stars and an \nArrowhead for his participation in the invasions into Sicily, Naples, \nRome (Anzio), Rhineland, the Aredenes (Battle of the Bulge) and Central \nEurope. He was awarded the highest Dutch military decoration, the \nMilitaire Willems Order, and also the Belgium Citation Fourogere, while \nhis unit, the 504th, received the Distinguished Unit Citation.\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\n  Upon his separation from Active Duty, Dick served in the Army \nReserves and was recalled to Active Duty in November, 1950, serving at \nFt. Jackson, SC, and deploying to Japan and Korea with the 187th \nAirborne Regimental Combat Team. He retired as a Lt. Colonel from the \nU.S. Army Reserve in 1963.\n  Upon retirement from the Army, he settled back in Bay Minette serving \non the School Board, as President of the Bay Minette Chamber of \nCommerce, and as an active participant in the United Fund, the American \nRed Cross and the American Cancer Society. In 1950, he was elected \nState Commander of the V.F.W.\n  He was appointed to the Alabama Battleship Commission in 1963, a \nposition he held for the remainder of his life. He was also a member of \nthe Bay Minette City Council, was Probate Judge in Baldwin County, and \nwas one of two Alabama members on the Gulf Marine Fisheries Commission.\n  It was not until my time in the Alabama Legislature that I was really \nable to get to know Dick Owen. He was extremely committed to his \npositions in both the State House and State Senate, and his \nconstituents were well served by his dedication to them and his \ndevotion to the issues. He was elected to the House in 1965 and served \ntwo terms before being elected to the Senate in 1970 where he also \nserved two terms.\n  In the Senate, he was Chairman of the Finance and Taxation Committee \nand Chairman of the Conservation Committee. He also served as a member \nof the Commerce, Transportation and Common Carriers Committee; the \nInsurance Committee; the Constitution and Elections Committee; the \nAgriculture Committee; and the Local Legislation No. 1 Committee. He \nalso held positions on the Interim Insurance Study Committee and was \nChairman of the Fishing Reef Committee.\n  During his career, Dick focused his energy on a number of issues. \nWhether it was agriculture, education, conservation or prison reform, \nhe recognized the importance of these issues to his constituency and \nthe entire State of Alabama.\n  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he supported \ndevelopment, growth and protection of Alabama's agriculture and \nforestry industry. He led the fight to keep farm truck prices low, and \nhe favored expansion of the Farmer's Market Authority. In addition, he \nsponsored a number of bills relating to conservation, forestry, \nagriculture and law enforcement. Among these were the $43 million State \nParks Program and the Anti-water Pollution Act.\n  As a Representative and Senator, Dick Owen was a strong advocate for \neducational opportunities for all people, and he recognized the need to \nmake improvements to the education system in Alabama. Before his \nelection to the Alabama legislature, he was proud to help bring \nFaulkner State Community College to Bay Minette.\n  He sponsored many bills in both houses to conserve our natural \nresources and ensure continued growth of renewable resources. He \nreceived the ``Governor's Conservation Legislator off the Year'' award \nin 1971 from the Alabama Wildlife Federation.\n  Dick was also active in prison reform work and was recognized by law \nenforcement and prison officials for legislation he authored regarding \nthis issue.\n  Year after year, he was a champion for his constituents.\n  Well after Dick left politics and public life, he continued to serve \nhis community and State well. He owned Builders Hardware and Supply and \nwas active in the Bay Minette Rotary Club. He was a devoted alumnus of \nthe University of Alabama, contributing his time and energy to the \ngrowth of the Alumni Association. He was also a Mason, Shriner and \nactive in the Baptist Church.\n  A devoted family man, he is survived by his beloved wife, the former \nAnnie Ruth Heidelberg of Mobile; his son L.D. Owen III of Bay Minette; \nhis brother James R. Owen of Bay Minette; and his sister, Nell Owen \nDavis of Gulf Breeze, Florida. He also has three grandchildren and two \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  I cannot say enough about the impact this man had on so many lives. \nAs a war hero, a legislator, a community advocate, a husband and a \nfather, Dick Owen spent his life making Alabama and this country a \nbetter place. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9455-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF DR. ROBERT H. BARTLETT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Dr. Robert H. Bartlett, an accomplished \nsurgeon, professor and inventor, who recently retired from seeing \npatients at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Dr. Bartlett, \nwho earned his bachelor's degree from Albion College and graduated cum \nlaude from the University of Michigan Medical School, was honored by \nhis peers during a ceremony on June 23, 2005.\n  Dr. Bartlett is admired across Michigan for his dedicated service to \nhis patients and his contributions to the advancement of medicine. His \nexcellence in the practice of medicine has been demonstrated throughout \nhis exemplary career, which spans more than 40 years. In particular, \nhis work in developing a heart-lung bypass technique called \nextracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, has saved the lives of \nover 30,000 infants, children, and adults.\n  Dr. Bartlett began his work on ECMO in 1965 while an assistant \nresident at Boston's Brigham and Children's Hospital. After his \nresidency, Dr. Bartlett received a series of surgical teaching and \nresearch fellowships at Harvard to continue his research. In 1970 Dr. \nBartlett became an assistant professor of surgery at the University of \nCalifornia in Irvine, while also practicing medicine at the Orange \nCounty Medical Center. Five years later the first successful use of \nECMO in an infant would take place at the Orange County Medical Center. \nOver the next 5 years, Dr. Bartlett would use this technique \nsuccessfully 25 times.\n  In 1980, Dr. Bartlett returned to the University of Michigan Medical \nCenter to continue to conduct research and treat patients until his \nretirement earlier this year. It was there that ECMO transistioned from \nbeing an experimental procedure to becoming standard practice at more \nthan 90 medical facilities worldwide. In addition to this work, Dr. \nBartlett continued to treat patients and served as chief of critical \ncare medicine at the University of Michigan. Dr. Bartlett plans to \ncontinue his groundbreaking medical research.\n  Dr. Bartlett has published numerous articles, monographs, chapters, \nand books throughout his illustrious career. In 2003, he was awarded \nthe prestigious Jacobson Innovation Award from the American College of \nSurgeons. He was also elected to the Institute of Medicine and was the \nrecipient of the Medal of Special Recognition from the National Academy \nof Surgery of France. Dr. Bartlett has served as president of both the \nAmerican Society for Artificial Internal Organs and the International \nSociety for Artificial Organs. Dr. Bartlett has been married for more \nthan 30 years to his college sweetheart, Wanda, with whom he has 3 \nchildren and 4 grandchildren.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Bartlett on his \nsuccess and achievements in the field of medicine. I am pleased to \noffer my best wishes on his retirement from seeing patients and his \ncontinued efforts to advance medical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9455-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9455-S9456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE HON.

Mr. President, I will to make some remarks today \nabout a very valuable public servant, Judge Charles R. ``Randy'' \nButler, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama.\n  Judge Butler was born in New York. He earned a B.A. degree from \nWashington and Lee University in 1962, and a law degree from the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law in 1966. He served as an assistant \npublic defender for Mobile County, Alabama, from 1969 to 1971; as \ndistrict attorney for Mobile County from 1971 to 1975; and, he was \nengaged in the private practice of law in Mobile from 1975 until \nOctober 15, 1988, when he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as a \nU.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Alabama. He served as \nchief judge from July 9, 1994 to February 20, 2003, and served on the \nJudicial Conference, the principal policy-making body for the Federal \ncourt system, from 1999 through 2003.\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\n  As the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama from 1981 \nuntil 1992, I had the opportunity to practice before Judge Butler and \nsaw first hand that his experience gained from having been a former \nprosecutor, a former public defender, and a former private practitioner \nwere extremely valuable to him.\n  During several years of Judge Butler's service, the Court was \nunderstaffed by one or more judges. During this time, Judge Butler \nworked very hard not only handling his own caseload, but handling a \ngreat deal of extra work caused by the shortage. While doing all of \nthat, he also found time for the many demanding duties of his position \nas chief judge and as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates.\n  In describing his service to the Southern District, I would like to \nquote from his letter of nomination for the 2003 Judicial Award of \nMerit, which he received: ``Despite the overwhelming demands on his \ntime, Judge Butler worked tirelessly to reasonably maintain the civil \nand criminal docket of the Court. Judge Butler routinely held hearings \non criminal matters before civil trials commenced, during his lunch \nhour, and after civil trials concluded for the day. As Chief Judge, \nJudge Butler further worked to improve the administrative efficiency \nand user-friendliness of the Court. During his tenure, court rooms have \nbeen updated with cutting edge trial presentation technology.\n  ``All the while, Judge Butler has served with the dignity and decorum \ndeserving of our Federal courts and he has given his undivided and \nthoughtful attention the myriad and varied matters routinely presented \nto him.''\n  Judge Butler brought a natural courtesy to the courtroom that made \nall feel at ease. While he was a strong judge who never, ever lost \ncontrol of his courtroom, his ease of manner facilitated a courtroom \natmosphere most conducive to fair outcomes. His strong faith and \ncharacter reflect the essence of who he is. He was raised right and his \nfaith has deepened over the years. While he routinely imposes sentences \naccording to the guidelines on wrongdoers, he is compassionate and felt \nfor those he sentenced. Indeed, he is an active backer of his wife, \nJacque, and her faith-based outreach to women prisoners and their \nfamilies. They are active Episcopalians and strong believers that every \nhuman being is precious and worthy of compassion.\n  I also have been pleased and proud to watch Judge Butler's active and \nimportant leadership role on the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates. He has served as a member and on its executive committee. Judge \nButler's experience in a wide variety of trials and his personal \nknowledge of a working courtroom have been most valuable to the \nJudicial Conference.\n  Finally, I would like to commend him for his stewardship of and \nleadership of my courthouse and its remarkable family. For many years, \nthe court family, in which I include the Magistrates, the Clerk, the \nProbation Officers, and the security personnel, has worked together \nclosely and harmoniously over the years, committed always to the \nhighest ideals. Judge Butler inherited an excellent court family and \nhas raised their teamwork for justice to an even higher level. I wish \nall courts could operate so harmoniously. The U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Alabama has a proud record of integrity, \nindustry, legal skill and collegiality. Judge Butler has been an \noutstanding judge under some demanding circumstances. His dedication \nand commitment to duty have greatly benefitted this court.\n  My appreciation and respect for the service of Judge Butler is \nunbounded. He has served the people of the United States and the rule \nof law with fairness and integrity. I am glad that he remains fit and \nactive. While he deserves to catch his breath, I am sure that he will \ncontinue to reward the citizens of this great country by carrying an \nactive caseload. That will be a blessing indeed.\n  On March 28, 2005, Judge Butler took senior status and on June 17, \n2005, his portrait presented by the Mobile Bar Association, was \nunveiled in the ceremonial courtroom of the John A. Campbell Courthouse \nin Mobile, Alabama. I was honored to have a place on that \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9456-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SID HARTMAN\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, while the Senate is in recess next \nmonth, a remarkable event will take place in Minnesota, the Sid Hartman \n``Close Personal Friends'' Celebration. It is worth a few moments of \nthe Senate's time for me to honor this great Minnesota personality.\n  They say that history is just the biography of very significant \npeople. Individuals create history with their words, their style, and \ntheir accomplishments. Sid Hartman never ran a company or held elective \noffice. But he has had an impact on Minnesota just by being who he is: \na hardworking, opinionated, and irrepressible sports journalist for \nmore than 50 years.\n  Sid's life began the way most great lives start: with humble \nbeginnings and hard work. He worked his way up from being a newspaper \ndelivery boy, to copy boy to reporter. He helped run the original \nMinneapolis Lakers NBA team. He had a hand in the start of two of \nMinnesota's other major sports franchises: the Twins and the Vikings.\n  And to this day, his column appears in the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nevery Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Saturday. It is full of news, \nspeculation and prophesies about the world of sports, and everything \nthat touches it.\n  Sid Hartman's popularity and impact comes from three sources we \nshould all tap into:\n  First, he works harder than anyone else. He frequently reminisces \nthat he develops news stories the way he sold newspapers: start early, \nkeep moving and be aggressive.\n  Second, he understands the power of relationships. He is a ``Google'' \nof first hand sports information about the main figures of sports over \nthe last 50 years. Just mention Bud Grant or Bobby Knight or George \nSteinbrenner or any famous player to him and you get a fascinating \npersonal download. He builds and maintains relationships.\n  And third, Sid is just who he is: nothing more, nothing less. I don't \nknow if Bill Cosby is a ``close personal friend'' but he sure describes \nhis life with this quotation: ``I don't know the key to success, but \nthe key to failure is trying to please everybody.'' In an era of \ncarefully measured words and hypersensitivity, Sid Hartman just speaks \nhis mind.\n  Half the fun of sports is talking about the games after they are over \nand anticipating them before they begin. Sid has livened up the \nconversation. He has made us laugh, made us angry and some times made \nus wonder where in the world he was coming from. But he always added \nspice to our lives.\n  Sid Hartman is being honored on August 7, 2005, in Minneapolis. But \nthe event is not about him: it is about bringing people together to \nsupport the scholarship fund of the University of Minnesota, Sid's \ngreat love. Despite his sometimes gruff exterior, Sid has a soft spot \nin his heart for the athletes of the U and all Gopher sports. His love \nand support and his encouragement, public and private, has made a big \ndifference in hundreds of young lives.\n  Growing up, I heard the expression: ``Hearts that are tender and kind \nand tongues that are neither make the finest company of all.'' Sid has \nbeen great company for thousands of ardent and casual sports fans of \nthe Upper Midwest. He has helped make Minnesota the fun, interesting \nplace it is today.\n  Congratulations, Sid Hartman, for your example and your contribution \nto the quality of life of our State--and Go Gophers!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9456-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9456-S9457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING MR.

In the winter of 2005, Edward won the Kentucky \ncompetition for the 2005 Voice of Democracy Patriotic Audio Essay \nContest.\n  This nationwide competition is sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign \nWars and is now in its 58th year. The competition requires high school \nstudent entrants to write and record a 3- to 5-minute essay on an \nannounced patriotic theme. The theme for 2005 is ``Celebrating Our \nVeterans' Service.''\n  Mr. Brown's accomplishment has also earned him the ``$1,000 \nDepartment of Wyoming and its Ladies Auxiliary\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\nScholarship Award.'' A student of Clinton County High School, Edward \nalso finds time to pursue academic and cultural interests such as \npolitical science, music, and art.\n  The Albany Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1952 and its Ladies \nAuxiliary can be proud to sponsor Mr. Edward Brown. Being recognized by \nthis organization is truly an honor. I congratulate Edward for his hard \nwork and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9457-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN D. WASON\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional officer of the United States Army, Lieutenant Colonel John \nD. Wason, upon his retirement after more than 20 years of distinguished \nservice.\n  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel Wason has personified the \nArmy values of duty, integrity, and selfless service across the many \nmissions the Army provides in defense of our Nation. During his time \nas--a Congressional Legislative Liaison Officer in the office of the \nSecretary of the Army, many of us on Capitol Hill have enjoyed the \nopportunity to work with Lieutenant Colonel Wason on a wide variety of \nArmy issues and programs, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments. I commend his superb service to the U.S. Army and this \ngreat Nation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel John D. Wason was commissioned as a Second \nLieutenant, Field Artillery, after graduating from California State \nUniversity-Sacramento in 1985. His first assignment was as a Company \nFire Support Officer, Battery Fire Direction Officer, and Battery \nExecutive Officer for the 3rd Battalion, 19th Field Artillery, 5th \nInfantry Division at Ft. Polk, LA from 1985 to 1989. He commanded B \nBattery, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery in the Federal Republic of \nGermany from 1990 to 1992. Following his assignment in Germany, LTC \nWason spent 28 months as a Recruiting Company Commander in Northern \nCalifornia from 1992 to 1994. In 1994, LTC Wason was selected as a \nmember of the Army Acquisition workforce. From 1994 to 2001 LTC Wason \nserved in a variety of Army Acquisition positions at White Sands \nMissile Range, NM and Picatinny Arsenal, NJ working on major Army \nweapons programs such as the Army Tactical Missiles System, Crusader, \nand the LW 155 Artillery system.\n  In 2001, LTC Wason was selected as a Department of Defense \nCongressional Fellow. His selection was followed by a 1 year assignment \nworking on my personal staff. Following his Fellowship, LTC Wason \nserved in Programs Division, Office of the Chief of Legislative \nLiaison. Lieutenant Colonel Wason maintained a constant liaison with \nProfessional Staff Members of the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees on issues relating to Army Procurement programs focusing on \nArmy Aviation, Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicles.\n  Throughout these varied and demanding assignments, Lieutenant Colonel \nWason provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional \njudgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the \nArmy and Congress. John's counsel and support were invaluable to Army \nleaders and Members of Congress as they considered the impact of their \ndecisions on these important issues.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nColonel Wason, his wife Betsy, and his entire family for the \ncommitment, sacrifices, and contribution that they have made throughout \nhis honorable military service. I congratulate Lieutenant Colonel John \nWason on completing an exceptional and extremely successful career, and \nwish him blessings and success in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9457-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9457-S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MARY CLUTTER, NSF\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to honor Dr. Mary E. Clutter \nwho will be retiring in August from the National Science Foundation, \nNSF. To say that Dr. Clutter has had a distinguished career at the NSF \nwould be an understatement due to her countless achievements in the \narea of biological science. Today's biological science has not only \nbeen assisted by Dr. Clutter but in many respects, it has been defined \nby Dr. Clutter, and her leadership in this important scientific area.\n  Dr. Clutter personifies the model public servant with a career at the \nNSF that spanned almost three decades. Dr. Clutter began her career as \na temporary program officer at the NSF. Over the ensuing years, she has \nserved with distinction in many important leadership roles at NSF: as \nthe division director of Cellular Biosciences, Senior Science Advisor \nto the NSF Director, acting deputy director, and assistant director for \nthe Directorate for Biological Sciences. She has served four \nPresidential administrations beginning with President Ronald Reagan to \nour current President George W. Bush. As a member of the Senior \nExecutive Service, Dr. Clutter has received numerous awards, including \nthe Meritorious and Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Awards \nfrom Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and William Clinton.\n  During her career, Dr. Clutter has worked to develop a long-term and \nforward-thinking strategic vision for the biological sciences within \nNSF covering plant biology, environmental biology, computational \nbiology, biodiversity research, long-term ecological research, and \nnonmedical microbiology. Further, these areas of research have \ninfluenced other scientific research areas and will continue to \ninfluence the biological sciences for years to come.\n  In my opinion, Dr. Clutter's most important achievement has come in \nthe area of plant genome research. It is without question that what we \nnow know and will know about plant genome research would not have \noccurred without Dr. Clutter's vision, leadership, and hard work. In \n1997, I asked the Office of Science and Technology Policy, OSTP, to \ncreate an interagency working group to develop a new national plant \ngenome initiative. OSTP wisely appointed Dr. Clutter to cochair the \nworking group and, under her leadership, a plan for the national plant \ngenome program was born in June 1997. Under the new National Plant \nGenome Initiative, Dr. Clutter brought together key Government research \npersonnel from NSF, the Department of Agriculture, the National \nInstitutes of Health, and others to develop and implement the plant \ngenome program.\n  The plant genome research program at NSF has grown from an initial \n$40 million in fiscal year 1999 to $95 million today and Dr. Clutter \nhas ensured that every penny has been spent wisely and, with this \ninvestment, the United States is the world leader in plant genome \nresearch. The plant genome program has already yielded tremendous \nresults that will eventually contribute to better agricultural products \nthat will improve human health and nutrition. For example, Dr. \nClutter's leadership has contributed to the completion of the \nMultinational Arabidopsis Sequencing Project. This project was \ncompleted 3 years ahead of schedule and produced the first complete \nsequence of a higher organism. This work has further contributed to the \nsequencing work of other plants such as maize, soybeans, and other \neconomically significant crops.\n  With this research, scientists are now beginning to understand the \nbasic mechanisms underlying important plant traits such as cold \ntolerance, disease resistance, and seed development. Dr. Clutter's \nleadership has created a new scientific foundation on plant \nbiotechnology that will eventually yield major breakthroughs in our \nunderstanding of plants, which will eventually lead to the development \nof new advances in agriculture, energy, and the environment. I strongly \nbelieve that the impressive research being done with plant genomics, \nled by Dr. Clutter, can eventually be a very powerful tool for \naddressing hunger in many developing countries such as those in Africa \nand Southeast Asia.\n  While Dr. Clutter's contributions to plant biology and genomics are \nextremely distinguished and too numerous to list in this tribute, I do \nwant to emphasize the role she has played in broadening the \nparticipation of women and minorities in the fields of science. \nCountless number of today's scientists and our future scientists have \nbeen positively influenced by Dr. Clutter. She has promoted and \nemphasized international research collaboration between U.S. and \nforeign scientists and\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\nprovided opportunities for international research experiences for young \nscientists.\n  As the former chairman of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee, my staff and I have found Dr. Clutter to \nbe an invaluable resource and ally in advancing plant genome research. \nI especially enjoyed her professionalism and passion for science, which \nnever waned or wavered during the years I worked with her.\n  Finally, on a personal level, in addition to being a leading \nintellect, she is warm, engaging, enthusiastic, and has a high \ntolerance for the less knowledgeable. Dr. Clutter's new liberties are \nwell deserved but her departure will be a major loss to the NSF and the \nFederal Government. She will clearly be missed by the science \ncommunity, and I will definitely miss her in this capacity, both as a \nfriend and a public servant. I wish Mary and her family all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9458-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE WANZER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor Clarence Wanzer, a resident of Coal Branch Heights, Charleston, \nWV, who has devoted his life to leadership and service in his \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Wanzer, who will turn 95 on September 4, was born in Charleston, \nWV. In 1919, Mr. Wanzer joined Simpson Church but soon moved to \nColumbus, OH to be raised by his grandmother. Mr. Wanzer did not return \nto Charleston until the 1930s.\n  After Mr. Wanzer returned to his birthplace, he took a job with the \nU.S. Postal Service. Later, he purchased a piece of property in Coal \nBranch Heights, a residential community in Charleston. The community \nreceived its first glimpse of Mr. Wanzer's personal determination and \nconviction when he began construction on his home. Without outside help \nand during his spare time, Mr. Wanzer hand-dug the basement and \ncompleted construction on his block house.\n  Since the 1930s, Mr. Wanzer, working tirelessly to better his \ncommunity, has participated in numerous community organizations. These \nactivities have benefited the residents of Charleston and West Virginia \nas a whole.\n  In 1950, Mr. Wanzer's life forever changed. He assisted Rev. Ernest \nSmith, a local pastor, by polling the residents of Coal Branch Heights \nas to which Christian denomination they would like to belong. The \nresidents chose the Methodist faith, and a developer donated land to \nthe Methodist Conference for the construction of a new Methodist \nchurch.\n  Although Mr. Wanzer helped to build St. Stephens Methodist Church, \nthe Methodist district superintendent refused him the right to worship \nwithin the building's walls. At that time, half of Coal Branch Heights' \npopulation was Black and the other half was White. Mr. Wanzer, an \nAfrican American, was not permitted to worship with St. Stephens' all-\nWhite congregation. In response to this injustice, Mr. Wanzer purchased \na small parcel of land, and he courageously constructed a second \nbuilding in which all people of color could worship.\n  In 1965, the Methodist district superintendent invited Coal Branch \nHeights' Black families, the same families he had once turned away, to \njoin the St. Stephens' parish. Mr. Wanzer's family joined St. Stephens \nin 1965, and he was able to enjoy the fruits of his decade-old labor.\n  Since 1965, Mr. Wanzer has touched the lives of those around him by \nholding a variety of leadership offices as well as inspiring other \ncommunity members to become activists of the Christian faith. Today, he \ncontinues to serve his community. He recently, in his early 90s, \nundertook the task of seeking funds to fix a large sinkhole on Twilight \nStreet.\n  I thank Mr. Wanzer for his unswerving loyalty and dedication to his \ncommunity. Additionally, I wish him good health as he continues to \nserve the people of West Virginia. He serves as an inspiration to all \nof us as he continues to rely on his faith to do good works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9458-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Saunders, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9458-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9458-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MESSAGE FOR THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on July 28,2005, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 45.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the recommended \n     closure of 13 military installations in Pennsylvania by the \n     Department of Defense; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Defense recently \n     recommended numerous military base closings and realignments \n     to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission; and\n       Whereas, the recommendation included 13 military \n     installations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, the Pittsburgh International Airport Air Reserve \n     Station, located in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, and the \n     Charles E. Kelly Support Center, with facilities located in \n     Oakdale and Neville Island, Pennsylvania, were among those \n     recommended for closure; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense recommended moving the \n     99th Regional Readiness Command, located in Moon Township, to \n     Fort Dix, New Jersey; and\n       Whereas, Allegheny County and western Pennsylvania will \n     lose more than 850 civilian and military jobs if these bases \n     close or are realigned; and\n       Whereas, the biggest potential loss will be the closing of \n     the Air Reserve Station, home of the 911th Military Airlift \n     Wing; and\n       Whereas, the Air Reserve Station has been based at the \n     Pittsburgh International Airport since 1942; and\n       Whereas, since 1963, the base has been home to the 911th \n     Military Airlift Wing; and\n       Whereas, the 911th Military Airlift Wing is an Air Force \n     Reserve wing that flies the C-130 cargo plane; and\n       Whereas, approximately 1,220 Air Force reservists are \n     assigned to the Air Reserve Station, which also employs 320 \n     civilians; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that closing the Pittsburgh \n     International Airport Air Reserve Station will eliminate 44 \n     military and 278 civilian jobs; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that closing the Pittsburgh \n     International Airport Reserve Station will cost the local \n     economy approximately $94 million a year; and\n       Whereas, land constraints were cited as one reason for \n     including the Air Reserve Station on the closure list; and\n       Whereas, the Pittsburgh International Airport has made \n     available, through a Memorandum of Understanding, an \n     additional 53 acres at the airport facility that were not \n     considered in the Air Force/BRAC review of the facilities; \n     and\n       Whereas, additional acreage exists upon which the facility \n     can expand to address the needs of the Department of Defense; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Charles E. Kelly Support Center provides \n     logistical support to active and reserve Army units in the \n     Middle Atlantic Region, including a transportation office \n     that facilitates travel for Army reservists to and from \n     active duty; and\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Defense, closing \n     the Charles E. Kelly Support Center would result in the loss \n     of an estimated 174 military and 136 civilian jobs; and\n       Whereas, closing the Charles E. Kelly Support Center and \n     its commissary would affect an estimated 100,000 active and \n     retired military members in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and \n     Ohio; and\n       Whereas, the 99th Regional Readiness Command oversees more \n     than 20,000 Reserve soldiers in 185 units in five states and \n     the District of Columbia; and\n       Whereas, the 99th Regional Readiness Command has \n     approximately 220 full-time positions; and\n       Whereas, the Army estimates that this unit contributes \n     about $100 million to the local economy each year; and\n       Whereas, all three of these military installations are \n     critical to national defense and homeland security; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has already lost \n     more than 16,000 military and civilian jobs over the previous \n     four rounds of base closings; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania strongly urge the President and Congress of the \n     United States and the members of the 2005 BRAC Commission to \n     remove the Pittsburgh International Airport Air Reserve \n     Station and the Charles E.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to requiring financial institutions to notify \n     consumers prior to publication of negative credit information \n     and to allow adequate time for correction; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        A Concurrent Resolution\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to take such \n     actions as are necessary to require financial institutions to \n     notify consumers prior to publication of negative credit \n     information and to allow adequate time for correction.\n       Whereas, consumer credit scores help to determine the cost \n     of financing consumer purchases including the purchase of \n     vehicles and homes; and\n       Whereas, some insurance companies use credit scores to \n     determine risk and establish the price of insurance premiums; \n     and\n       Whereas, the accuracy of consumer credit scores is \n     essential to control the rising cost of credit, financing \n     consumer purchases, and insurance premiums; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act allows \n     financial institutions to release negative credit information \n     without prior notice to consumers but provides for consumer \n     notification no later than thirty days after such negative \n     credit information has already been released to consumer \n     credit reporting agencies (15 USC 1681s-2(a)(7)); and\n       Whereas, this delayed notification requirement allows for \n     the dissemination of incorrect credit scores without giving \n     consumers adequate time to determine if there was a credit \n     reporting error or take necessary steps to correct the \n     inaccurate information; and\n       Whereas, only Congress has the authority to change this \n     consumer notification requirement because the Federal Fair \n     Credit Reporting Act specifically preempts state law with \n     respect to this subject matter which is regulated by this \n     Federal law (15 USC 1681t(b)(1)(F)).\n       Therefore, be it resolved that the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take \n     such actions as are necessary to require financial \n     institutions to notify consumers prior to publication of \n     negative credit information and to allow adequate time for \n     correction.\n       Be it further resolved that a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-169. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the continued funding for the \n     Community Development Block Grant Program; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the Members of the One Hundred and \n     Twenty-second Legislature of the State of Maine now assembled \n     in the First Special Session, most respectfully present and \n     petition the Congress of the United States as follows:\n       Whereas, the Community Development Block Grant program has \n     helped communities throughout the nation since 1974, and is \n     one of the oldest programs in the United States Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development; and\n       Whereas, the Community Development Block Grant program \n     provides annual grants on a formula basis to many different \n     types of grantees through several programs as entitlement \n     grants, loans and disaster relief grants; and\n       Whereas, the Community Development Block Grant program has \n     helped Maine families, businesses and communities and Maine's \n     neediest citizens over the years, and this program is now \n     being severely cut back due to federal budget constrictions; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than $314,000,000 in Community Development \n     Block Grant funds was granted in Maine for the years 1982 to \n     2004, and from 1998 to 2004 $23,400,000 in funds created or \n     retained 3,764 jobs for Maine workers, inc1uding 656 jobs \n     still being created; and\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\n       Whereas, from 1998 to 2004, more than $54,400,000 in \n     Community Development Block Grant funds was spent in Maine \n     and benefited more than 132,000 Maine residents, or more than \n     one in every 10 citizens of Maine, outside the large \n     population centers of Portland, Lewiston, Auburn and Bangor; \n     and\n       Whereas, those cities, along with South Portland and \n     Biddeford, receive Community Development Block Grant funds \n     directly from the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     by way of the Entitlement Communities Grants program, which \n     is slated for elimination; and\n       Whereas, Community Development Block Grant funding is often \n     the only extra funding to allow communities a chance to \n     finance such projects as water infrastructure projects, \n     wastewater infrastructure projects, fire station \n     construction, downtown revitalization and low-income housing \n     improvement projects such as the Maine Home Repair Network, \n     Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility modifications, \n     senior activities programs, medical services programs and \n     economic development and planning programs; and\n       Whereas, during 2005, 8 grants in the amount of $2,994,000 \n     were awarded in Maine for public infrastructure while 19 \n     applications were left unfunded, and 9 grants in the amount \n     of $1,917,000 were awarded for public facilities while 13 \n     applications were left unfunded; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved: That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge \n     that the Federal Government continue full funding for the \n     Community Development Block Grant program as important needs \n     continue to exist throughout Maine and the nation; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved: That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives and each Member of the \n     Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-170. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to condemning the National Football \n     League's recent actions restricting the availability of \n     televised games; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is home to two \n     professional National Football League (NFL) teams; and\n       Whereas, the substantial fan base within the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania for each of these teams is due to each team's \n     legacy of excellence on and off the field; and\n       Whereas, revenues from these professional football teams \n     exceed more than $1.2 billion; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and its citizens \n     have invested substantial amounts of money in the \n     construction of stadiums for these professional football \n     teams and have supported their efforts during the preseason, \n     regular season and playoff season through ticket purchases, \n     concession sales and other direct economic impacts; and\n       Whereas, the National Football League has recently used its \n     monopoly status to institute national television arrangements \n     which has the practical effect of removing this substantial \n     fan base from everyday enjoyment of professional football; \n     and\n       Whereas, this recent action to move ``Monday Night \n     Football'' from a free national television network (ABC) to \n     cable television (ESPN) will directly result in a large \n     number of Pennsylvanians being unable to watch ``Monday Night \n     Football'' in 2006; and\n       Whereas, ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC has been an \n     institution and a pillar in the sports fan community since \n     1970; and\n       Whereas, while the move of ``Monday Night Football'' from \n     ABC to ESPN may have some positive impact on the bottom line \n     of The Walt Disney Company due to its ownership rights in \n     both, it should not come at the expense of the citizens of \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, while the additional six-year deal the NFL entered \n     into with another national television network, NBC, whereby \n     Sunday night football games will be televised starting in \n     2006, is a step in the right direction, such action would not \n     contemplate the marquee contests scheduled by the NFL for \n     ``Monday Night Football''; and\n       Whereas, removal of ``Monday Night Football, coupled with \n     archaic local market television rules, is systematically \n     distancing the football fan who cannot afford to buy cable or \n     attend a game in person from the game of professional \n     football; and\n       Whereas, the NFL was created with the general public in \n     mind, and bringing professional football to the masses via \n     national television networks is the most viable means to \n     satisfy this end; and\n       Whereas, expensive cable channels, season television \n     packages or wholly owned cable networks such as the NFL \n     Network do not deliver professional football to the masses; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is often said that it is the fans for whom all \n     professional sports are played; and\n       Whereas, currently there are still 10% of households in the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without basic cable television; \n     and\n       Whereas, Federal law allows the NFL to make television \n     programming changes without further review by any court or \n     regulatory body; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania condemn this most recent \n     practice in particular and the trends in the telecasting of \n     football games generally; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urge the NFL to \n     reconsider the effect of its actions to narrow the access of \n     high-profile football games for the average fan; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urge the NFL to \n     respond to these concerns; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the commissioner of the National Football League, Paul \n     Tagliabue, 410 Park Avenue, New York NY 10022, and to the \n     members of the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-171. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to advocating changes in the Federal Motor Carrier \n     Safety Regulations, specifically 49 C.F.R. 383.3; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                      A Concurrent Resolution 103\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to take such \n     actions as are necessary to advocate changes in the Federal \n     Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, specifically 49 C.F.R. \n     383.3, relative to issuance of restricted commercial drivers' \n     licenses, which currently prohibit aerial applicators from \n     qualifying for issuance of such licenses.\n       Whereas, aerial applicators provide a valuable and \n     necessary service to farmers by crop-dusting their fields in \n     order to prevent crops from being destroyed or harmed by \n     pests; and\n       Whereas, crop-dusting, like farming, is seasonal work with \n     its top season lasting no more than four months; and\n       Whereas, since crop-dusters are small planes which are \n     heavily weighted with crop protection products, it is \n     necessary for a fuel source to be near the farm which the \n     crop-duster is servicing in order to maximize the time and \n     efficiency of the aerial applicator; and\n       Whereas, since most farmers are not equipped to provide \n     fuel service to crop-dusters on site and most farms are \n     located miles away from fuel service stations, it is \n     necessary for trucks to carry aviation kerosene, also known \n     as Jet A, or Avgas fuel to the crop-duster on site; and\n       Whereas, trucks used to transport aviation kerosene and \n     Avgas fuel are considered commercial trucks; therefore, the \n     drivers of such vehicles are required to possess a commercial \n     driver's license; and\n       Whereas, since most farm workers are seasonal employees, it \n     is a very difficult and expensive proposition to burden \n     aerial applicators and farmers with the requirement of \n     educating workers to pass the knowledge and skills tests for \n     issuance of a commercial driver's license; and\n       Whereas, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Regulations, specifically 49 C.F.R. 383.3, authority is \n     granted to allow a state to waive the required knowledge and \n     skills tests and to issue restricted commercial drivers' \n     licenses to employees for certain farm-related service \n     industries; and\n       Whereas, holders of restricted commercial drivers' licenses \n     are prohibited from having any endorsements on such licenses, \n     and holders of such licenses are prohibited from operating a \n     commercial vehicle beyond one hundred fifty miles from the \n     place of business or the farm currently being served; and\n       Whereas, aerial applicators who participate in crop-dusting \n     activities for rural farmers had previously been eligible for \n     issuance of the restricted commercial driver's license; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the terrorist attacks launched upon \n     the United States on September 11, the federal government has \n     closely guarded waivers to the commercial drivers' license \n     requirements because of the potential for terrorists to once \n     again breach the confidence of this nation; and\n       Whereas, as a result, changes have been made in federal \n     regulations to more closely regulate transportation of \n     hazardous materials; and\n       Whereas, aviation kerosene, or Jet A fuel, and Avgas are \n     classified as hazardous materials according to federal \n     regulations; however, a holder of a restricted commercial \n     driver's license is permitted to carry placardable quantities \n     of hazardous materials such as diesel fuel so long as the \n     quantity does not exceed one thousand gallons; and\n       Whereas, aviation kerosene, or Jet A, and Avgas, which are \n     used as fuel for crop-dusting planes, are chemicals very \n     similar to diesel fuel which is already recognized as an \n     exception to the transportation of hazardous materials \n     endorsement; and\n       Whereas, while farmers and aerial applicators can \n     understand why the federal government is attempting to \n     regulate the transportation of hazardous materials, the \n     current waiver allowed in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Regulations for issuance of restricted drivers' licenses is \n     written so narrowly, legitimate groups are prevented from \n     utilizing the exemption and are being penalized; and\n       Whereas, changes can be recommended to the Federal Motor \n     Carrier Safety Regulations such as reclassifying aviation \n     kerosene, or Jet A fuel, and Avgas as non-hazardous \n     materials, or adding aviation kerosene, or Jet A, and Avgas \n     in the exception currently recognized for diesel fuel, which \n     changes would allow farmers and aerial applicators to qualify \n     for issuance of restricted commercial drivers' licenses.\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\n       Therefore, be it resolved that the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take \n     such actions as are necessary to advocate changes in the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, specifically 49 \n     C.F.R. 383.3, I relative to issuance of restricted commercial \n     drivers' licenses, which currently prohibit aerial \n     applicators from qualifying for issuance of such licenses \n     because the fuel they need to transport in order to conduct \n     crop-dusting activities is classified as a hazardous \n     material.\n       Be it further resolved that a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States \n     of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-172. A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to protecting the citizens of the State of Arizona \n     by enacting legislation to ensure reasonable rates; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                         A Concurrent Memorial\n\n       Urging the Congress of the United States to protect the \n     citizens of the State of Arizona by enacting legislation to \n     ensure reasonable rates.\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Arizona is \n     committed to our nation's free market economic model and \n     believes, specifically, that markets subject to competition \n     should not be regulated by the local, state or federal \n     governments but that those markets that are not subject to \n     competition and yet supply important commodities, products or \n     services to the citizens of Arizona must be subject to \n     effective local, state or federal government regulation; and\n       Whereas, important commodities, such as coal for electric \n     generating facilities and grain for dairy and beef cattle \n     production, are dependent on railroad transportation into the \n     State of Arizona; and\n       Whereas, dairy and beef cattle producers in Arizona are \n     dependent on the railroad to import seventy-five percent of \n     the grain necessary to produce milk and beef in Arizona; and\n       Whereas, the coal that is brought by rail into the State of \n     Arizona to be consumed by Arizona electric generating \n     facilities often is dependent on a single railroad for \n     transportation, such that normal market forces are not \n     present to constrain the price charged Arizona electric \n     generators or the transportation service that they receive; \n     and\n       Whereas, coal brought into the State of Arizona by Arizona \n     electric generating facilities is used to generate forty \n     percent of the electricity produced in the state and all of \n     this imported coal is delivered by a class 1 railroad in a \n     ``captive'' relationship; and\n       Whereas, the cost to transport coal to an electric \n     generating facility in the State of Arizona where there is no \n     effective rail competition present is often at least twice \n     the cost of transporting coal where effective rail \n     competition exists, even though the cost to the railroad of \n     such transportation is no higher than for transportation \n     where competition exists; and\n       Wheres, the unreasonably high rail rates of captive coal \n     are passed through to the Arizona consumers of electricity, \n     thus increasing the price of electricity to the families and \n     businesses of Arizona and decreasing the disposable income \n     available for other family and business needs; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States, in 1980, \n     deregulated railroad transportation where rail competition \n     exists but directed a federal agency, now the Surface \n     Transportation Board, to ensure that ``captive'' rail \n     customers not be charged higher rates than are appropriate; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Surface Transportation Board, in implementing \n     its responsibilities under the deregulation act, has allowed \n     the railroads to increase their market power through mergers \n     and acquisitions and has allowed the railroads to avoid rail-\n     to-rail competition wherever possible; and\n       Whereas, the Surface Transportation Board has developed a \n     process that ensures ``captive'' rate are reasonable and that \n     places all burdens of proof on the rail customer in rate \n     cases that, according to recent Congressional testimony, cost \n     the rail customer at least $3 million to prosecute and take \n     at least two years for resolution and rarely result in \n     victory for the rail customer; and\n       Whereas, the Surface Transportation Board implementation of \n     its responsibilities under the deregulation act is not \n     constraining captive rail rates and is resulting in \n     unreasonably high costs for the electricity consumers of \n     Arizona; and\n       Whereas, despite the inadequacy of the current federal \n     regulatory regime for captive rail rates, the American \n     railroad industry continues to be the only American industry \n     that is exempt from major portions of the nation's antitrust \n     laws.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States protect the \n     citizens of the State of Arizona by enacting legislation that \n     ensures that the Surface Transportation Board will facilitate \n     rail-to-rail competition wherever possible, that the Surface \n     Transportation Board will develop a cost-effective and time-\n     effective process that ensures that captive rail customers \n     pay reasonable rates and that the American railroad industry \n     is subject to all provisions of the nation's antitrust laws.\n       2. That Congress enact legislation similar to the Railroad \n     Competition Act of 2003, S. 919 and H.R. 2924, from the 108th \n     Congress.\n       3. That the Members of Congress from the State of Arizona \n     support this legislation.\n       4.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to urging the Congress of the United \n     States to refrain from taking action in developing \n     legislation that would have the effect of preventing or \n     hindering the exploration, drilling, development and \n     production of natural gas in the Great Lakes; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       Urging the Congress of the United States to refrain from \n     taking action in developing legislation that would have the \n     effect of preventing or hindering the exploration, drilling, \n     development and production of natural gas in the Great Lakes.\n       Whereas, the Congress, in recognition of the need for a \n     comprehensive energy policy for this nation, is currently in \n     the process of developing legislation to establish the \n     framework for this policy; and\n       Whereas, while a vast majority of the issues relating to \n     this potential energy policy is of a broad nature, affecting \n     each state and commonwealth broadly and with similar \n     consequences, certain matters of national interest are \n     uniquely applicable to an individual state or commonwealth \n     because the immediate impact of the regulated activity will \n     be felt almost entirely by that state or commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, these activities, to the extent they occur within \n     the borders of a state or commonwealth, have been long and \n     successfully regulated by the impacted state or commonwealth, \n     and there is no national interest served by broadening the \n     powers of the Federal Government to regulate these \n     activities; and\n       Whereas, geologic and geophysical indicators show that \n     substantial oil and gas reserves underlying that portion of \n     Lake Erie within the boundaries of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania may be available for development to assist in \n     meeting the nation's energy needs; and\n       Whereas, the exploration, drilling, development and \n     production of natural gas lying under the water bodies within \n     the boundaries of each state and commonwealth are activities \n     that meet the criteria set forth in this resolution; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress, in developing \n     legislation to establish an energy policy, to refrain from \n     taking action that would have the effect of preventing or \n     hindering the exploration, drilling, development and \n     production of natural gas in the Great Lakes, including, but\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\n     not limited to, Lake Erie, so long as the state or \n     commonwealth in which the activity is conducted provides a \n     regulatory system for the conduct of operations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the members of Congress from Pennsylvania, to the members of \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the United States \n     House of Representatives, to the members of the Committee on \n     Resources of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     the members of the Energy and Natural Resources of the United \n     States Senate, to the members of the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works of the United States Senate and to others \n     holding leadership positions on committees developing \n     national energy policy legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-175. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to enabling Louisiana to receive its appropriate \n     share of revenue received from oil and gas activity on the \n     Outer Continental Shelf; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                        A Concurrent Resolution\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to enable \n     Louisiana to receive its appropriate share of revenue \n     received from oil and gas activity on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf.\n       Whereas, in an effort to preserve federal ownership of \n     public lands while still allowing the mining of minerals and \n     enabling the states where those lands and minerals were \n     located to continue receiving revenues from mineral \n     extraction, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 grants states a \n     share of revenue derived from minerals extracted from federal \n     lands within those states' borders; and\n       Whereas, the original Mineral Leasing Act provided that \n     twelve and one-half percent of the royalty revenue would be \n     shared with the states from which the minerals were \n     extracted, which percentage was increased in 1976 to fifty \n     percent for onshore royalty payments; and\n       Whereas, although all states benefit from this increased \n     share of royalty payments, the oil, gas, and coal extracted \n     from below the ground in Wyoming and New Mexico accounts for \n     the largest share, and those two states received eighty \n     percent of the $1.16 billion paid in 2004; and\n       Whereas, in addition to the revenue sharing from royalty \n     payments, another forty percent of the revenues have been \n     directed to the federal Reclamation Fund, which has financed \n     over $30 billion in water and energy projects in seventeen \n     western states; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana produces more than eighty percent of the \n     nation's offshore oil and gas supply with more than one-third \n     of the oil and gas consumed in this country, both foreign and \n     domestic, passing through the state's fragile coastal \n     wetlands by tanker, barge, or pipeline; and\n       Be it further resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be \n     sent to the presiding officer of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-176. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to enabling Louisiana to receive its appropriate \n     share of revenue received from oil and gas activity on the \n     Outer Continental Shelf; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to enable \n     Louisiana to receive its appropriate share of revenue \n     received from oil and gas activity on the Outer Continental \n     Shelf.\n       Whereas, in an effort to preserve federal ownership of \n     public lands while still allowing the mining of minerals and \n     enabling the states where those lands and minerals were \n     located to continue receiving revenues from mineral \n     extraction, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 grants states a \n     share of revenue derived from minerals extracted from Federal \n     lands within those states' borders; and\n       Whereas, the original Mineral Leasing Act provided that \n     twelve and one-half percent of the royalty revenue would be \n     shared with the states from which the minerals were \n     extracted, which percentage was increased in 1976 to fifty \n     percent for onshore royalty payments; and\n       Whereas, although all states benefit from this increased \n     share of royalty payments, the oil, gas, and coal extracted \n     from below the ground in Wyoming and New Mexico accounts for \n     the largest share, and those two states received eighty \n     percent of the $1.16 billion paid in 2004; and\n       Whereas, in addition to the revenue sharing from royalty \n     payments, another forty percent of the revenues have been \n     directed to the federal Reclamation Fund, which has financed \n     over $30 billion in water and energy projects in seventeen \n     western states; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana produces more than eighty percent of the \n     nation's offshore oil and gas supply, with more than one-\n     third of the oil and gas consumed in this country, both \n     foreign and domestic, passing through the state's fragile \n     coastal wetlands by tanker, barge, or pipeline; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is losing its coastal wetlands at the \n     alarming rate of over twenty-four square miles per year, or \n     more than a football field each day, largely due to policies \n     and practices implemented by the federal government through \n     the years to encourage and manage mineral extraction or to \n     control flooding in the lower Mississippi River basin; and\n       Whereas, our coastal wetlands are essential to the well-\n     being of the nation as a whole because not only does a large \n     portion of the oil and gas supply either come from Louisiana \n     or travel through our wetlands, but Louisiana's coast is home \n     to one of the nation's premier commercial and recreational \n     fisheries, a fishery that accounts for nearly one-third of \n     the commercial fisheries production of the lower forty-eight \n     states and that is second in the nation in total recreational \n     harvest of saltwater fish; and\n       Whereas, although Louisiana has repeatedly demonstrated its \n     intention and willingness to share in the cost of preserving \n     this vital ecosystem, preservation of Louisiana's coast will \n     necessitate an amount of funding that the state cannot \n     provide by itself, nor should the state be expected to fund \n     this fight on its own since the problems which have resulted \n     in the dramatic coastal loss were not problems created by the \n     state on its own; and\n       Whereas, an appropriate and available source for the \n     revenues needed to address our coastal land loss is royalties \n     from oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf, \n     which could and should be shared with Louisiana in much the \n     same manner and at the same level as the revenue sharing that \n     was afforded the Western states; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana, like the Western states, should receive \n     compensation for infrastructure and environmental impacts \n     associated with mineral production from its contributions to \n     the federal treasury; and\n       Whereas, the energy bill currently before Congress offers \n     far less to coastal states than the amount of revenue sharing \n     given inland states even though the impact of oil and gas \n     production is far greater in the sensitive and fragile \n     wetlands of the coastal states.\n       Therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enable Louisiana to \n     receive its appropriate share of revenue received by the \n     United States from oil and gas activity on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf.\n       Be it further resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be \n     sent to the presiding officer of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-177.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to enacting federal legislation to ensure that \n     deserving victims of asbestos exposure receive compensation; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       To memorialize the members of the United States Senate from \n     Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator David Vitter, to \n     continue to work toward enacting federal legislation to \n     ensure that deserving victims of asbestos exposure receive \n     compensation.\n       Whereas, asbestos, a mineral processed and used in \n     thousands of construction and consumer products, is a \n     dangerous substance and has caused thousands of people to \n     develop serious and often fatal diseases and cancers; and\n       Whereas, millions of workers have been exposed to asbestos, \n     and the economic toll resulting from litigation related to \n     exposure to asbestos could run into the hundreds of billions \n     of dollars; and\n       Whereas, many companies, in order to avoid bankruptcy and \n     to compensate victims with manifest injuries from exposure to \n     asbestos, have attempted to set aside sufficient resources to \n     compensate such victims; and\n       Whereas, the new claims are resulting in a depletion of the \n     funds available to compensate victims who have sustained \n     serious injuries and who are in desperate need of \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has noted that \n     federal and state courts have been inundated by an enormous \n     number of asbestos cases that defies customary judicial \n     administration and calls for national legislation; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     under the bipartisan leadership of Republican Senator Arlen \n     Specter and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, have crafted a \n     bipartisan piece of legislation that creates a fair and \n     equitable system to deal with the asbestos litigation crisis; \n     and\n       Whereas, this bipartisan legislation creates an asbestos \n     trust fund that will ensure that victims of asbestos exposure \n     will receive just and fair compensation.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, that the Louisiana House of \n     Representatives does hereby memorialize the members of the \n     United States Senate from Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu \n     and Senator David Vitter, to continue to work toward enacting \n     federal legislation to ensure that deserving victims of \n     asbestos exposure receive compensation and to continue to \n     work with Senators Specter and Leahy to pass meaningful and \n     fair asbestos litigation reform legislation.\n       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to United States Senator Mary Landrieu and United \n     States Senator David Vitter and to each member of the \n     Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-183. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to recognizing the need for an apology to the \n     victims of lynching and their descendants by the United \n     States Senate for the Senate's failure to enact anti-lynching \n     legislation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       To recognize the need for an apology to the victims of \n     lynching and their descendants by the United States Senate \n     for the Senate's failure to enact anti-lynching legislation.\n       Whereas, the crime of lynching succeeded slavery as the \n     ultimate expression of racism in the United States following \n     Reconstruction; and\n       Whereas, lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the \n     United States until the middle of the twentieth century, \n     occurring in documented incidents in all but four states; and\n       Whereas, at least four thousand seven hundred forty-two \n     people, predominately African-Americans, were reported as \n     being lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968; and\n       Whereas, at least four hundred people, predominately \n     African-Americans, were reported as being lynched in \n     Louisiana between 1882 and 1968; and\n       Whereas, ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of \n     lynching escaped punishment by state or local officials; and\n       Whereas, lynching prompted African-Americans to form the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     (NAACP) and members of B'Nai B'rith to found the Anti-\n     Defamation League; and\n       Whereas, nearly two hundred anti-lynching bills were \n     introduced in the United States Congress during the first \n     half of the twentieth century; and\n       Whereas, between 1890 and 1940, the United States House of \n     Representatives passed three strong anti-lynching measures; \n     and\n       Whereas, protection against lynching was the minimum and \n     most basic of federal responsibilities, and the United States \n     Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching \n     legislation despite repeated requests by civil rights groups, \n     presidents, and the United States House of Representatives to \n     do so; and\n       Whereas, the recent publication of Without Sanctuary: \n     Lynching Photography in America helped to bring greater \n     awareness and proper recognition to the victims of lynching; \n     and\n       Whereas, it is only by coming to terms with history that \n     the United States can effectively champion human rights \n     abroad; and\n       Whereas, a resolution is being introduced by Senator Mary \n     L. Landrieu that apologizes to the victims of lynching for \n     the failure of the United States Senate to enact anti-\n     lynching legislation, expresses the Senate's sympathies and \n     regrets to the descendants of lynching victims, and remembers \n     the history of lynching to ensure that the tragedies \n     surrounding the crime will neither be forgotten nor repeated; \n     and\n       Whereas, an apology offered in the spirit of true \n     repentance would move the United States towards \n     reconciliation and become central to a new understanding on \n     which improved racial relations can be forged.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, That the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     recognize the need for an apology to the victims of lynching \n     and their descendants by the United States Senate for the \n     Senate's failure to enact anti-lynching legislation.\n       Be it further resolved, That a suitable copy of this \n     Resolution be transmitted to the members of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-184.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to enhance \ntax incentives for small property and casualty insurance companies; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses an inequity and helps clarify a tax exemption that exists for \nsmall property and casualty (P) insurance companies under the \nInternal Revenue Code Sections 501(c)( 15) and 831(b). These small P \ninsurers, often originally organized as mutual companies to offer \ninsurance coverage to specific groups, mainly serve rural areas and \nfarming communities that otherwise may not have been able to obtain \naffordable coverage. This tax exemption helps to provide additional \nsurplus and cash flow for these small companies.\n  The Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004, ``2004 Act'', amended the \nsmall P insurer exemption because there were concerns that certain \ninvestment companies offering only a small amount of insurance could \nuse the exemption to improperly shelter investment income from federal \nincome tax. Now, under current law, the exemption applies only to P \n(i.e., non-life) insurance companies if their ``gross receipts'' for \nthe taxable year do not exceed $600,000 and if premiums make up more \nthan 50 percent of those gross receipts. A mutual P insurance company \nalso may be exempt if its premiums make up more than 35 percent of its \ngross receipts and its gross receipts do not exceed $150,000. \nAdditionally, P companies that have direct or net written premiums, \nwhichever is greater, exceeding $350,000 but not exceeding $1.2 \nmillion, Income Election Limit, can elect to be taxed under a similar \ntax structure on their net investment income.\n  While the 2004 Act helped to close a potential loophole, the special \nprovisions for small P insurers are in need of further clarification \nor reform. The term ``gross receipts'' is not defined uniformly for \npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Election Limit has \nnot been adjusted for inflation since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n  Without a clear definition of the term ``gross receipts,'' many \nunanswered questions remain with respect to determining whether a small \nP insurance company qualifies for exemption under section 501(c)(15). \nFor example, such a company typically invests a large portion of its \nassets in government bonds. If the gross proceeds on the sale of an \nasset are included in the measure of ``gross receipts,'' based on a \nbroad cash-flow definition of gross receipts, the mere maturation of \nbonds and reinvestment could cause a small P insurance company to \nfall out of the exemption even though there has been no change in the \nsize of the business and even if the company realizes a loss on the \nsale or redemption. On the other hand, this arbitrary result would not \noccur if a definition of gross receipts that includes gains from the \nsale or exchange of assets is used. Such a definition of gross receipts \nlooks to the size of the business in terms of income and overall \nprofitability, which in turn ties into the reason for the tax \nexemption.\n  If the Income Election Limit is not adjusted to keep pace with \ninflation, the impact could be severe. Take, for instance, a small P \ninsurer in my State that started insuring the local farmers in the late \n1980s. Over the ensuing years, the company's client base changed very \nlittle, but the insurance premiums increased gradually to keep pace \nwith inflationary pressures. As a result, while the business itself has \nnot grown in absolute terms, its premium base has, therefore resulting \nin the loss of the elective alternative and simpler tax on investment \nincome.\n  For the farmers and consumers covered by the small P insurer, this \nloss of the tax exemption or a simpler, more limited tax structure is \ncertain to mean higher insurance premiums, leaving the client with the \nchoice of cutting coverage or paying higher costs, neither of which is \na preferred option. This is the last thing our agricultural community \nneeds.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses both of these \nconcerns. This legislation would add definitional language for ``gross \nreceipts'' clarifying that gross receipts means premiums, plus gross \ninvestment income. In addition, the proposal simply increases the \nIncome Election Limit from $1.2 million to $1.971 million, and indexes \nit annually for inflation.\n  According to the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \nthis legislation will help hundreds of small P insurance companies \nnationwide. Under this proposed legislation, at least 56 of the 82 \nsmall insurance companies in my State will be covered, thereby enabling \nthem to continue providing critical insurance coverage to small \nbusinesses across Missouri.\n  With this legislation, we have an opportunity to infuse some fairness \ninto our tax code and at the same time help the thousands of farmers, \nhomeowners, and entrepreneurs covered by small P insurers in this \ncountry. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look \nforward to working with the Finance Committee to see it enacted into \nlaw.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to reform funding for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today with my \ncolleagues Senators Collins, Bingaman, Murray, Mikulski, Kohl and \nCorzine, to introduce bipartisan legislation enhancing the Seniors \nFarmers' Market Nutrition Program. As all of my colleagues\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nknow, the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) was created \nthrough the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-\n171). It is a program that provides grants to States, territories, and \nNative American tribal governments to provide coupons to low-income \nseniors to purchase fresh, locally grown fruits, vegetables, and herbs \nfrom farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supported \nagricultural programs. The purpose of the program is to make healthy \nfoods available to low-income seniors while simultaneously assisting \ndomestic farmers.\n  Scientific research increasingly confirms that what we eat may have a \nsignificant impact on our health, quality of life, and longevity. In \nthe United States, high intakes of fat and saturated fat, and low \nintakes of calcium and fiber-containing foods such as whole grains, \nvegetables and fruits are associated with several chronic health \nconditions that can impair the quality of life and hasten mortality.\n  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, research \ncontinues to find strong links between eating lots of fruits and \nvegetables and preventing chronic diseases such as cancer, heart \ndisease, and stroke. Eating more fruits and vegetables may also play a \nrole in preventing other diseases such as high blood pressure and \nosteoporosis, to name just two.\n  Two studies, one here in the U.S. and the other in the Netherlands, \nfound eating a diet rich in vitamins E and C may help to lower your \nrisk of Alzheimer's disease. Both found that eating foods high in \nvitamin E may reduce your risk of Alzheimer's, a degenerative brain \ndisease. The U.S. study found that people with the highest vitamin E \nintake in their diet had a 70 percent lower frequency of Alzheimer's \nthan those with the lowest amounts of vitamin E in their diet.\n  Vitamin A, which is found in many different fruits and vegetables, is \nvery important to the health of your eyes. Other nutrients in produce, \nsuch as carotenoids, also play a role in maintaining healthy eyes and \ngood vision. An example of a carotenoid is lutein. Lutein is found in \ndark green leafy vegetables like spinach.\n  While the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables may seem \nobvious, only 27 percent of women and 19 percent of men eat the \nrecommended 5 servings of fruits and vegetables every day.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service \nadministers the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program; and in \nfiscal year 2003, approximately 800,000 people received SFMNP coupons \nthroughout the country. The food made available for sale came from an \nestimated 14,000 farmers at more than 2,000 farmers' markets as well as \nnearly 1,800 roadside stands and 200 community supported agricultural \nprograms. In fiscal year 2005, 46 States, U.S. Territories, and \nfederally recognized Indian tribal governments will operate the SFMNP. \nClose to 900,000 eligible seniors are expected to receive benefits that \ncan be used at over 4,000 markets, roadside stands and community \nsupported agricultural programs during the 2005 harvest season.\n\n  In Washington State, the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program \nhas been incredibly successful in ensuring access to healthy foods for \nseniors, as well as bolstering the state's farmers and our farmers' \nmarkets. In fact, according to the Washington State University \nNutrition Education program, in Washington State, the Senior Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program reaches about 8,000 lower-income older adults \neach year in 35 of my State's 39 counties. In 2003, 472 farms, 49 \nfarmers markets, four roadside stands and one community supported \nagriculture program participated in the SFMNP and the participating \nseniors in Washington state purchased approximately 90 tons of fresh \nproduce while learning about the role of nutrition in their health in \npreventing chronic disease.\n  The bill that I am introducing today aims to better address the \ngrowing demand and need for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram in four ways.\n  First, the bill would increase funding from $15 million to $25 \nmillion for the program in fiscal year 2005 and continue to expand the \nprogram by $25 million each year, until the program's expiration in \n2007, meaning that the SFMNP would be funded at not less than $50 \nmillion in fiscal year 2006, and at not less than $75 million in 2007.\n  Second, the bill specifies that funds made available through this act \nwill remain available to the program until exhausted. As such, any \nremaining funds from one fiscal year will roll over into the subsequent \nfiscal year budget for the SFMNP.\n  Third, provisions in the bill support administrative costs. Not more \nthan ten percent of available funds in a fiscal year can be used to \ncover the operating expenses of the SFMNP.\n  Finally, the bill grants authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to \nexpand the list of foods eligible for purchase to include minimally \nprocessed foods, such as honey, as deemed appropriate.\n  We should not forget, too, that an obvious, positive outgrowth of the \nprogram is the inherent ability of the SFMNP program to strengthen \nlocal economies and communities while at the same time works to \npreserve farmland and open spaces. I sincerely appreciate that the \nWashington Association of Area Agencies on Aging, as well as the \nWashington State Farmers Market Association, are supporting this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will go a long way in \nexpanding the amount of funding available for the Senior Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program. We all know that value and importance that \nindividuals of all ages eat their requisite servings of vegetables and \nfruit each day. Such foods are high in fiber and lower the risk of \nchronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, in addition \nto colon and rectal cancer, high blood pressure, and obesity. However, \nfood costs can be a significant barrier to developing and maintaining a \nhealthy lifestyle. In establishing the Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram in 2002, Congress recognized that it is important to provide a \nmeans for low-income seniors to have access to fruits and vegetables. \nThe legislation I introduce today will further our nation's commitment \nto ensuring the health of our nation's seniors, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of \n2004 to increase the authorization of appropriations for grants to \nsupport the competitiveness of specialty crops, to amend the \nAgricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 to improve the program of \nvalue-added agricultural product market development grants by routing \nfunds through State departments of agriculture, to amend the Federal \nCrop Insurance Act to require a nationwide expansion of the adjusted \ngross revenue insurance program, and\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nsafeguard and promote specialty crops and value-added agriculture in \nOregon and in the United States. The great farmers and ranchers of \nOregon produce over 200 commodities. This bill intends to improve their \nmarketing opportunities, help Oregon farmers and processors get better \nprices for their products, and help Oregon farmers and processors \ncompete in an increasingly global market. As it will help Oregon \nfarmers so it will help specialty crop farmers from New York to \nFlorida, Wisconsin to California.\n  I introduce this bill as my colleague from Oregon, Congresswoman \nHooley, introduces the same bill in the House of Representatives.\n  In the increasingly technological world of microchips, products like \npotato chips and other agricultural commodities still remain a large \npart of Oregon's economy. In fact, agriculture is Oregon's second \nlargest traded sector and Oregon's second largest export, behind the \nelectronics industry. Oregon agriculture creates more than $8 billion \nof direct and indirect economic activity, in both urban and rural areas \nin the state.\n  At the center of this bill is the expansion of a specialty crop grant \nprogram, authorized by Congress in 2001, of which Oregon producers have \nalready made use. Oregon received about $3.2 million that was used for \nover 50 projects involving product development, marketing, research, \nand export promotion. The Oregon Department of Agriculture estimates \nthat over 3000 producers benefited from these projects. They also \nestimate that enhanced sales resulting from these projects reached $20 \nmillion--about six times what was invested.\n  The problem with this pilot program was the grants were only \navailable once. Last year Congress passed legislation that reinstated \nthese specialty crop grants but at funding level that would provide \nonly around $500,000 to Oregon. This legislation raises the authorized \nlevel to $500 million and makes the grant program permanent. Under this \nexpansion Oregon has the potential to receive $5 million a year in \nspecialty crop grants.\n  The bill I am introducing today also improves USDA's value added \ngrant program. Right now this program is run by bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC who have probably never been to Oregon and probably \ncouldn't name the top Oregon specialty crops. My office has heard \nnumerous complaints that this program is unwieldy, bureaucratic, and \ndifficult to navigate. Last year every applicant from Oregon was \ndisqualified on a technicality. This bill would make one simple but \nvery important change: instead of having the Federal Government \ndistribute the money, each State would get a share of the money to hand \nout to their chosen priorities.\n  Between these two grant programs each State in the union should have \nplenty of money to implement agricultural promotion strategies that \nmatch the needs of its individual growers, processors, and citizens.\n  This bill also authorizes funds for farmers and processors to become \n``certified.'' Certification comes in many forms like ``Good \nAgricultural Practices,'' ``Good Handling Practices,'' or ``Organic.'' \nOften getting certified is necessary before farmers or processors can \neffectively market products whether in local grocery stores or to \nforeign countries. Certified products often fetch premium prices. To \nencourage farmers to get these certifications and increase their market \nshare this legislation would have the USDA reimburse half the cost of \nthe certifications.\n  Last, this legislation improves opportunities for specialty crop \nfarmers to get crop insurance, increase loan availability, provide \nadditional funding for export promotion, and make sure that American \ntrade policy takes specialty crops into account.\n  I know that Oregonians doing a great job growing some of the best \nquality crops in the world. There are a lot of challenges facing \nagriculture: cheap imports, low commodity prices, taxation, labor, and \ndozens of others. This bill won't solve everything, but I think it will \nmake an important contribution to improving Oregon agriculture by \nmaking it more competitive on a global level and helping farmers get a \ndecent price for what they produce. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to assure the enactment of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to \nprotect family members of filers from disclosing sensitive information \nin a public filing and extend the public filing requirement for 5 \nyears; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would preserve an important means of protecting the safety of \nthose who work in the Federal judiciary system.\n  This legislation, which I am pleased to sponsor with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, pertains to information on Federal \nfinancial disclosure forms.\n  This legislation would amend the Ethics in Government Act to extend \nfor five years the authority to redact financial disclosure statements \nfiled by judges, and other officers and employees of the Federal \njudiciary. This redaction occurs after a finding is made by the \nJudicial Conference, in consultation with the United States Marshals \nService, that revealing personal and sensitive information could \nendanger the filer. In such cases, this legislation would allow \nredactions of information that could put the filer or his or her family \nat risk.\n  In 1988, Congress recognized the potential for threats against \nindividual judges. As a result, Congress authorized the judicial branch \nto redact, when circumstances require, certain information from \nindividual financial disclosure reports before they are released to the \npublic. The redaction provision was set to expire at the end of 2001, \nbut Congress extended the redaction authority for an additional four \nyears. The current authority expires at the end of this year.\n  The five-year extension in this legislation will help Congress ensure \nthat the Judicial Conference carries out the authority in a manner that \nachieves the appropriate balance between safety measures and public \ndisclosure. Given recent incidents of violence against judges and their \nfamilies, the inclusion of threats to the filer's family is necessary \nto provide security and peace of mind.\n  The record shows that this redaction authority has been used \nsparingly and wisely. In its report to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, the Judicial Conference reported \nthat, of the 3,942 Federal judiciary employees required to file \nfinancial disclosure reports in 2004, only 177\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\nreports were partially redacted before release.\n  For 40 judges, the approved redaction requests were based on specific \nthreats such as high-threat trials, ongoing protective investigations, \nidentify theft, and continuing threats from criminal defendants and \ndisgruntled civil litigants. For 137 judges, the approved redaction \nrequests were based on general threats and the disclosure of a family \nmember's unsecured place of work, the judge's regular presence at an \nunsecured location, or information that would reveal the residence of \nthe judge or members of the judge's family.\n  In response to a request by our Committee, the Government \nAccountability Office reviewed redaction requests from 1999 through \n2002. GAO found that less than 10 percent of annual judicial filers \nrequested any type of redaction.\n  In each instance where a report was redacted in its entirety, the \ndetermination was made that the judge who filed the report was subject \nto a specific, active security threat. Redactions of information \nidentifying assets, gifts, reimbursements or creditor listings were \nallowed in only a very limited number of cases, and then only until the \nspecifically identified threat ceased. According to the Judicial \nConference, the most frequent redaction requests now relate to \ninformation that would reveal where a judge or a member of the judge's \nfamily can regularly be found.\n  A fair and impartial judiciary requires a safe and secure \nenvironment. This legislation will help ensure the judicial branch has \nprocedures in place to protect personal information while ensuring the \npublic retains its right to access to the annual disclosure reports. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1560. A bill to establish a Congressional Commission on Expanding \nSocial Service Delivery Options; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nestablish a Congressional Commission to explore the expansion of social \nservices delivery options.\n  The bipartisan and bicameral Congressional Commission would undertake \na thoughtful review of existing federal social service programs and \nmake recommendations for program areas that would be appropriate for \nbeneficiary-selected or beneficiary-directed options. The goal is to \nexpand consumer choice and to minimize Constitutional concerns while \npartnering with faith-based and community providers. The importance of \nthis commission is highlighted by its inclusion in the Senate's anti-\npoverty agenda.\n  Expanding options for social services is essential to help those in \nneed. I have advocated similar proposals in the past during my time in \nthe United States Senate as it relates to the Corporation for National \nand Community Service. In 2001, I introduced the AmeriCorps Reform and \nCharitable Expansion Act. The goal of this legislation was to \ndramatically increase the scope of service opportunities and charitable \nlocations that would be eligible for voucher recipients and to focus \nefforts more on assisting low-income communities.\n  A current example of the success of this type of program is Section 8 \nHousing vouchers. The largest federal program designed to provide \naffordable housing to low-income families is the Section 8 Housing \nChoice Voucher program serving over 2 million households. Low-income \nfamilies use Section 8 vouchers tenant-based subsidies in the private \nmarket to lower their rental costs to 30 percent of their incomes. As \nyou know, the modern program began in the early 1980s and has grown to \nreplace public housing as the primary tool for subsidizing the housing \ncosts of low-income families. This approach, has opened up more \ncommunities and housing options for low-income families.\n  Since the 1996 welfare reauthorization, I have worked to ensure that \nfaith-based and community organizations are full partners in social \nservice delivery. Our nation needs more, not less, involvement from \nfaith and community organizations. Faith-based organizations are many \ntimes the best-equipped institutions in their community to improve the \nlives of those in need, but have not always been able to receive any \nhelp from the government. This bill provides an opportunity to level \nthe playing field for these providers by determining where we can \nengage the community and allow beneficiaries to be full participants in \nchoosing their provider. The current discrimination against faith-based \nprograms at the federal level prevents our communities from using all \nour resources to improve and even save lives. And for those are most in \nneed, we need to use every resource we have.\n  Expanding social service delivery options should be a simple matter \nof common sense. The formula is simple: the more opportunity \norganizations have to deliver aid, the more options people have to get \nservices, the more people we can help. For this reason, I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the creation of this commission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1561. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to grant a \nFederal charter to the Irish American Cultural Institute; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce a bill, \nalong with Senators Lautenberg and Landrieu, to grant a Federal Charter \nto the Irish American Cultural Institute, an organization that promotes \nappreciation and recognition of the important contributions Irish-\nAmericans have played throughout the history of the United States. A \nlongstanding goal of the Irish American Cultural Institute been to \nestablish a museum of Irish-American history and culture in Washington, \nDC, and I am pleased to help lay the foundation for achieving that \ngoal.\n  The Irish American Cultural Institute is a national organization \nfounded in 1962, with local chapters in 17 States, including New \nJersey. The Institute has spent the last 40 years fighting to promote, \npreserve and educate about Irish and Irish-American culture. Those \ninvolved with the Institute do this, in part, by fostering strong \ncultural and educational ties between the United States and Ireland--\nsending American high school students to Ireland, and bringing Irish \nscholars, musicians, craftspeople, actors, and artists to the Untied \nStates. They also fund academic research projects that raise awareness \nabout Irish-American history, and provide fellowships for American \nprofessors to spend a year as a visiting scholar at the National \nUniversity of Ireland. In short, the Irish American Cultural Institute \nserves as an important educational, informational, and financial \nresource for key initiatives important to the Irish and the Irish-\nAmerican community in the United States.\n  Irish-Americans comprise more than 17 percent of the population of \nthe United States, and have made enormous contributions to our Nation \nin countless ways. In my home State, more than 1.3 million New Jersey \nresidents trace their roots back to Ireland. A Federal Charter would be \nan important step in the Irish American Cultural Institute's quest to \npromote activities that recognize and celebrate the heritage of Irish-\nAmericans. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1561\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the merger of the bank and savings \nassociation deposit insurance funds, to modernize and improve the \nsafety and fairness of the Federal deposit insurance system, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Safe and Fair \nDeposit Insurance Act of 2005. As many of us in this chamber know, \nreforming the operations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nhas been an important but unfinished matter before the United States \nSenate for many years. Today, we will take a step closer to a solution \nby introducing this Act.\n  Wyoming is a rural State with small banks and lenders. Many people in \nWyoming have limited choices when they need to safely deposit their \nhard-earned money. They usually depend on their local bank or credit \nunion. These financial institutions in turn depend on deposit insurance \nto make sure that this money will be available in the case of a crisis. \nThis is a relationship based on trust. Customers trust their bank, and \nbanks trust their insurance.\n  This relationship is even more important in places like Gillette, \nWyoming. As Mayor of Gillette, I saw many coal miners retire with \nconsiderable pensions that reflected years of hard work in the mines \naround Gillette. However, these miners received their pensions as a \nlump sum. Their retirement accounts are often much higher than the \nmaximum insurance levels under current law. In fact, more and more \nretirement accounts are reaching this upper limit, not just in Wyoming. \nWorkers need a safe place to save their money and build retirement \nsecurity. That place should be in a local financial institution that \ninvests in its community and economy.\n  The current FDIC system is in desperate need of improvement. Over the \npast twenty years, deposit insurance has been eroded by inflation and \ngrowing deposits. As newer financial institutions have sprung up, they \nhave enjoyed this insurance without paying any premiums into the \nsystem. As time passes, current FDIC coverage continues to weaken, and \nso does the Agency's ability to respond to a deposit crisis, should one \narise. That is why it is so important to reform the system now, before \nit is too late.\n  This bill will make changes to the deposit insurance system that will \nmake it more flexible and quicker to adapt to the unexpected. It will \napply an index that will protect coverage levels against future \ninflation, and raise retirement coverage to protect earnings made over \na lifetime of hard work. It will also make premium charges fair by \nrecognizing those institutions who have paid into the system and those \nwho have not. Finally, it will merge the two primary deposit insurance \nfunds. This consolidation will make the system stronger and prevent \ncostly premium charges that will likely be assessed if the system is \nnot reformed.\n  I would like to thank Senator Johnson and Chairman Shelby for their \ncooperation and hard work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill and look forward to its passage with all deliberate speed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1563. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprotect and\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nstrengthen the safety net of children's public health coverage by \nextending the enhanced Federal matching rate under the State children's \nhealth insurance program to children covered by Medicaid at State \noption and by encouraging innovations in children's enrollment and \nretention, to advance quality and performance in children's public \nhealth insurance programs, to provide payments for children's hospitals \nto reward quality and performance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln, to introduce a bill called the Advancing \nBetter Coverage and Care for Children's Health Act or the ABCs for \nChildren's Health Act. It is an important piece of legislation designed \nto help improve the access and quality of children's health services \naround the country,'' including children's hospitals.\n  Children's Hospitals provide care to hundreds of thousands of \nchildren across our Nation every day. They care for the great majority \nof children who are seriously ill. They are the mainstay of the health \ncare safety net for low-income children.\n  But, a child who lacks health insurance is still much less likely to \nhave timely access to the medical care they need. That's not right. \nTwo-thirds of the more than 9 million uninsured children in the United \nStates are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. They should be enrolled in \npublic coverage when eligible, and we should streamline the eligibility \nprocess to make it easier, not more difficult.\n  President Bush said in 2004, ``America's children must also have a \nhealthy start in life . . . we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \nmillions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the \ngovernment's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of \nattention or information to stand between these children and the health \ncare they need.'' The bill we are introducing today would do just that.\n  Our bill would provide the higher SCHIP federal match to states for \nchildren covered by Medicaid at the State option so that States think \ntwice before removing children from the Medicaid rolls during State \nbudget cuts. It also would provide a 90/10 administrative-match to help \nstates update enrollment systems for children, including technology for \n``express lane'' enrollment, the determination of eligibility for \nMedicaid and SCHIP when a child applies for another public benefit, \nlike the school lunch program, and the allowance for enrollment by mail \nor phone.\n  We also need to do more to help strengthen the system of care to \nensure quality and accountability for children's coverage. Our bill \nwould do this by supporting innovative ideas at children's hospitals. \nQuality improvement funding shouldn't just be available to adult \nhospitals. Children's hospitals have good ideas, too, and we should \nsupport those good ideas.\n  Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Ohio is leading the way in \nimproving care for children with diabetes, cystic fibrosis and other \nchronic conditions. The hospital is deeply committed to transforming \nhealth care delivery to improve outcomes for children.\n  In 2001, they were selected as one of just seven hospitals in the \nPursuing Perfection initiative launched by the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, and with this funding from the Foundation, they have made \nsignificant progress. They can document improvements in patient safety, \nin the effectiveness of care, in operational efficiency, in timely \naccess to care, and in more patient-centered care. These are the \nreforms we need to pursue for children in Medicaid and for all \nchildren. Our bill would help Cincinnati Children's Hospital and our \nother Children's Hospitals speed their journey to better, safer, more \ncost-effective care.\n  A hospital that makes the effort to improve care and outcomes for \nchildren should be compensated for that effort. We need to advance \nquality and performance for children in Medicaid, like we are doing for \nseniors in Medicare. The development of hospital quality measures, \ntesting their ability to gauge effective care and rewarding \nperformance, should apply to all hospitals, including children's \nhospitals.\n  That's why we have worked with the National Association of Children's \nHospitals to introduce a bill that would provide grants to help improve \npediatric quality, so that Children's Hospitals can begin to establish \nmeasures for quality care and share what works--and what doesn't work--\nacross hospital services for children nationwide.\n  Our bill would provide for a demonstration program in Medicaid to \nevaluate evidenced-based quality and performance measures in children's \nhealth services, with grants for States and/or providers in three \nareas: health information technology and evidenced-based outcome \nmeasures, disease management for children with chronic conditions, and \nevidenced-based approaches to improving the delivery of hospital care \nfor children. The bill also would provide for a national Children's \nHospital pay-for-performance demonstration program, rewarding \nChildren's Hospitals, which provide critical access to services and \nvoluntarily participate, for reporting and meeting quality and \nperformance measures.\n  Evaluating the national measures of quality in Children's Hospitals, \ntheir success in capturing performance, and their applicability to pay-\nfor-performance across States' varying methods of payments, would gives \nStates, the Federal Government, and Children's Hospitals an essential \nbase of information in measuring performance in children's hospital \ncare. And that is something we vitally need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and co-sponsor this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1563\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Better Coverage \n     and Care for Children's Health Act of 2005'' or the ``ABCs \n     for Children's Health Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Mike DeWine to introduce ``The ABCs for Children's Health Act \nof 2005,'' which seeks to expand access to quality health care for all \nchildren who are\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\neligible for Medicaid. The bill also ensures that children get the best \nhealth care at the right time.\n  Medicaid is the single largest insurer for children. Twenty-five \nmillion children in America, one out of every four, depend on Medicaid \nfor their health care coverage. In Arkansas, more than half of the \nbirths are financed by Medicaid. Over half of the children in Arkansas \nare on Medicaid or received Medicaid services in the last year. \nMedicaid covers half of the care, on average, that children's hospitals \nprovide. As a result, the availability and quality of health care for \nall children relies greatly on Medicaid.\n  As a result of progress in children's Medicaid coverage and the \nenactment of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, Congress \nhas achieved an essential health care safety net for lower income \nchildren and children with special health care needs. Medicaid has \nsaved millions of children from being uninsured when parents are faced \nwith hard times and it has come to the aid of working families when \nchildren have exceptional medical costs. I believe that we must \ncontinue to build on that progress.\n  The ABCs for Children's Health Act of 2005 encourages States to \nprovide care for more children under Medicaid. It also helps states to \nensure that all eligible children are enrolled and that they get the \nhigh quality care they need. The bill would provide the same \ninvestments in quality and performance in children's health care \nservice's that are being made in Medicare. National quality and \nperformance measures for children are far behind those for adults.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us as supporters of this important \nlegislation to ensure that children get the quality health care they \nneed to grow and prosper. Our Nation's children deserve the best health \ncare we can offer. And this is a step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 1564. A bill to provide for the disposition of the Federal \nproperty located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, a portion of which \nis currently used by the District of Columbia as the Oak Hill juvenile \ndetention facility; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nfacilitate the orderly disposition of an 800 acre parcel of Federal \nproperty located in Laurel, Maryland, a portion of which is currently \nused by the District of Columbia as the Oak Hills Juvenile Detention \nand Commitment Center. The legislation is a companion to a measure \nwhich has been introduced in the House by Representative Benjamin \nCardin.\n  The Oak Hill Youth Center, located adjacent to the National Security \nAgency and the Baltimore-Washington parkway, is a detention facility \nfor juvenile offenders from the District of Columbia between the ages \nof 12 and 21. It has been plagued by facility and management problems \nfor many years. The buildings at the center are in deplorable condition \nand fail to meet health and safety standards. Overcrowding, \nmismanagement, escapes, drug use and abuse of detainees at the center \nhave been the subject of numerous investigations, press reports and \nlawsuits over the years, and are of great concern to juvenile justice \nadvocates, families of detainees and local residents, alike. Nearly two \ndecades ago, a consent decree stemming from the lawsuit Jerry M. v. \nDistrict of Columbia, required the District to make improvements at the \nfacility and address the chronic neglect of its adolescent detainees. \nSince the decree, ``sixty judicial orders, 44 monitoring reports and \nalmost $3 million in court imposed fines'' have been issued in \nconnection with the District's Youth Services Administration failure to \nfully comply with the decree, according to a July 2001 article in the \nWashington Post. Last year a report issued by the District's Inspector \nGeneral's office found that, ``many of the same types of problems that \nresulted in the 1986 Jerry M. lawsuit still exist today . . .'' The \nreport documented numerous security problems, health issues, \ndeficiencies in management, failures to effectively maintain the safety \nof female youth housed at the center, and drugs being smuggled into the \nfacility on a continual basis.\n  There is a consensus that the Oak Hill Youth Center should be \nshutdown. A Blue Ribbon Commission on Youth Safety and Juvenile Justice \nReform, established by Mayor Williams in August 2000, recommended in \nits final 2001 report that the Oak Hill Juvenile Detention center be \nclosed and demolished. The Justice for DC Youth coalition, whose \nmembers include parents and juvenile justice advocates, has adamantly \nsupported closing the existing Oak Hill facility and replacing it with \na smaller, more homelike facility that is closer to the youth's homes.\n  This measure seeks to ensure the closure of the facility and the \norderly disposition of the property, while addressing the concerns of \nAnne Arundel County, the NSA, the District of Columbia and all \nsurrounding neighborhoods and residences. Above all, it would serve the \nyouth currently being held at the facility by helping to place them in \nan environment that is more suitable for successful rehabilitation. I \nhope this measure can be acted upon quickly by the Congress and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restrict the use of abusive tax shelters and \noffshore tax havens to inappropriately avoid Federal taxation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tax shelter and tax haven abuses are \nundermining the integrity of our tax system, robbing the Treasury of \ntens of billions of dollars each year, and shifting the tax burden from \nhigh income individuals and businesses onto the backs of middle income \nfamilies. These abuses account for a significant portion of the more \nthan $300 billion in taxes owed by individuals, businesses, and \norganizations that goes unpaid each year. As a matter of fairness, \nthese abuses must be stopped. Today, I am introducing, with Senator \nNorm Coleman, a comprehensive tax reform bill called the Tax Shelter \nand Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005 that can help put an end to these \nabuses. Senator Barack Obama is also an original cosponsor.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, on which I serve with \nSenator Coleman, has worked for years to expose and combat abusive tax \nshelters and tax havens. In the previous Congress, we introduced \nlegislation confronting these twin threats to U.S. tax compliance; \ntoday's bill reflects not only the Subcommittee's additional \ninvestigative work but also innovative ideas to stop unethical tax \nadvisers and tax havens from aiding and abetting U.S. tax evasion.\n  Abusive tax shelters are very different from legitimate tax shelters, \nsuch as deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or \nCongressionally approved tax deductions for building affordable \nhousing. Abusive tax shelters are complicated transactions promoted to \nprovide large tax benefits unintended by the tax code. Abusive tax \nshelters are marked by one characteristic: there is no real economic or \nbusiness rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge Learned Hand \nwrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are ``entered upon for no other \nmotive but to escape taxation.''\n  Likewise, a tax haven is simply a country or jurisdiction that \nimposes little or no tax on income and offers non-residents the ability \nto escape taxes in their home country. The abuse of tax havens occurs \nwhen income is attributed to that country, even though little or no \nbusiness activity actually occurs there. Tax havens are also \ncharacterized by corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws that make it \ndifficult for other countries to find out whether their citizens are \nusing the tax haven to cheat on their taxes.\n  Today's tax dodges are often tough to prosecute. Crimes such as \nterrorism, murder, and fraud produce instant recognition of the \nimmorality involved. Abusive tax shelters and tax havens, by contrast, \nare often ``MEGOs,'' meaning ``My Eyes Glaze Over.'' Those who cook up \nthese concoctions count on their complexity to escape scrutiny and \npublic ire. But regardless of how complicated or eye-glazing, the \nhawking of abusive tax shelters by tax professionals like accountants, \nbankers, investment advisers, and lawyers to thousands of people like \nlate-night, cut-rate T.V. bargains is scandalous and has got to stop. \nHiding tax schemes through offshore companies and bank accounts in tax \nhavens with secrecy laws also needs to be attacked with the full force \nof the law.\n\n  Today, I would like to take a few minutes to try to cut through the \nhaze of these schemes to see them for what they really are and explain \nwhat our bill would do to stop them. First, I will look at our \ninvestigation into abusive tax shelters and discuss the provisions we \nhave included in this bill to combat them. Then, I will turn to tax \nhaven abuses and our proposed remedies.\n  For three years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has \nbeen conducting an investigation into the design, sale, and \nimplementation of abusive tax shelters. While I initiated this \ninvestigation when I was Chairman of our Subcommittee in 2002, it has \nsince had the support of our new Chairman, Senator Coleman.\n  In November 2003, our Subcommittee held two days of hearings and \nreleased a report prepared by my staff that pulled back the curtain on \nhow even some respected accounting firms, banks, investment advisors, \nand law firms had become the engines pushing the design and sale of \nabusive tax shelters to corporations and individuals across this \ncountry. In February 2005, the Subcommittee issued a report that \nprovided further details on the role these professional firms played in \nthe proliferation of these abusive shelters. Our Subcommittee report \nwas endorsed by the full Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs in April.\n  The Subcommittee investigation found that many abusive tax shelters \nwere not dreamed up by the taxpayers who used them. Instead, most were \ndevised by tax professionals, such as accountants, bankers, investment \nadvisors, and lawyers, who then sold the tax shelter to clients for a \nfee. In fact, as our investigation widened, we found hordes of tax \nadvisors cooking up one complex scheme after another, packaging them up \nas generic ``tax products'' with boiler-plate legal and tax opinion \nletters, and then undertaking elaborate marketing schemes to peddle \nthese products to literally thousands of persons across the country. In \nreturn, these tax shelter promoters were getting hundreds of millions \nof dollars in fees, while diverting billions of dollars in tax revenues \nfrom the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  For example, one shelter investigated by the Subcommittee and \nfeatured in the November 2003 Subcommittee hearings has since become \npart of an IRS effort to settle cases involving a set of abusive tax \nshelters known as ``Son of Boss.'' To date, more than 1,200 taxpayers \nhave admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay back taxes, interest and \npenalties totaling more than $3.7 billion. That's billions of dollars \nthe IRS has collected on just one type of tax shelter, demonstrating \nboth the depth of the problem and the potential for progress.\n  The Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005 that we are \nintroducing today contains a number of measures to curb abusive tax \nshelters. The bill strengthens the penalties on promoters of abusive \ntax shelters. It codifies and strengthens the economic substance \ndoctrine, which eliminates tax benefits for transactions that have no \nreal business purpose apart from avoiding taxes. The bill deters banks' \nparticipation in abusive tax shelter activities by requiring regulators \nto develop new examination procedures to detect and stop such \nactivities. It ends outdated communication barriers between key \nenforcement agencies to allow the exchange of information relating to \ntax evasion cases.\n  The bill also requires the Treasury Department to issue tougher \nstandards for tax shelter opinion letters. It increases incentives for \nwhistleblowers to report tax evasion to the IRS. The bill also provides \nfor increased disclosure of tax shelter information to Congress. It \nsimplifies and clarifies an existing prohibition on accountants being \npaid contingent fees which increase as phony tax losses increase. And \nit expresses the sense of the Senate that the IRS needs more funding to \ncombat tax shelter abuses.\n  Let me be more specific about these key provisions to curb abusive \ntax shelters.\n  Title I of the bill strengthens two very important penalties that the \nIRS can use in its fight against the professionals who make these \ncomplex abusive shelters possible. A year ago, the penalty for \npromoting an abusive tax shelter, as set forth in Section 6700 of the \ntax code, was the lesser of $1,000 or 100 percent of the promoter's \ngross income derived from the prohibited activity. That meant in most \ncases the maximum fine was just $1,000.\n  Many abusive tax shelters sell for $100,000 or $250,000 apiece. Our \ninvestigation uncovered some tax shelters that were sold for as much as \n$2 million or even $5 million apiece, as well as instances in which the \nsame cookie-cutter tax opinion letter was sold to 100 or even 200 \nclients. There are big bucks to be made in this business, and a $1,000 \nfine is laughable.\n  The Senate acknowledged that last year when it adopted the Levin-\nColeman amendment to the JOBS Act, S. 1637, raising the Section 6700 \npenalty on abusive tax shelter promoters to 100 pefcent of the fees \nearned by the promoter from the abusive shelter. A 100 percent penalty \nwould have ensured that the abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get \nto keep a single penny of their ill-gotten gains. That figure, however, \nwas cut in half in the conference report, setting the penalty at 50 \npercent of the fees earned and allowing the promoters of abusive \nshelters get to keep half of their illicit profits.\n  While 50 percent is an obvious improvement over $1000, this penalty \nstill\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nis inadequate and makes no sense. Why should anyone who pushes an \nillegal tax shelter that robs our Treasury of much needed revenues get \nto keep half of his ill-gotten gains? What deterrent effect is created \nby a penalty that allows promoters to keep half of their fees if \ncaught, and of course, all of their fees if they are not caught? Tax \nshelter promoters ought to face a penalty that is at least as harsh as \nthe penalty imposed on the person who purchased their tax product, not \nonly because the promoter is usually as culpable as the taxpayer, but \nalso so promoters think twice about pushing abusive tax schemes.\n\n  Effective penalties should make sure that the peddler of an abusive \ntax shelter is deprived of every penny of profit earned from selling or \nimplementing the shelter and then is fined on top of that. \nSpecifically, Section 101 of this bill would increase the penalty on \ntax shelter promoters to an amount up to the greater of either 150 \npercent of the promoters' gross income from the prohibited activity, or \nthe amount assessed against the taxpayer--including back-taxes, \ninterest and penalties.\n  A second penalty provision in the bill addresses what our \ninvestigation found to be one of the biggest problems: the knowing \nassistance of accounting firms, law firms, banks, and others to help \ntaxpayers understate their taxes. In addition to those who meet the \ndefinition of ``promoters'' of abusive shelters, there are professional \nfirms that aid and abet the use of abusive tax shelters and enable \ntaxpayers to carry out the abusive tax schemes. For example, law firms \nare often asked to write ``opinion letters'' to help taxpayers head off \nIRS questioning and fines that they might otherwise confront for using \nan abusive shelter. Currently, under Section 6701 of the tax code, \nthese aiders and abettors face a maximum penalty of only $1,000, or \n$10,000 if the offender is a corporation. This penalty, too, is a joke. \nWhen law firms are getting $50,000 for each of these cookie-cutter \nopinion letters, it provides no deterrent whatsoever. A $1,000 fine is \nlike a jaywalking ticket for robbing a bank.\n  Section 102 of the bill would strengthen Section 6701 significantly, \nsubjecting aiders and abettors to a maximum fine up to the greater of \neither 150 percent of the aider and abettor's gross income from the \nprohibited activity, or the amount assessed against the taxpayer for \nusing the abusive shelter. This penalty would apply to all aiders and \nabettors not just tax return preparers.\n  Again, the Senate has recognized the need to toughen this critical \npenalty. In last year's JOBS Act, Senator Coleman and I successfully \nincreased this fine to 100 percent of the gross income derived from the \nprohibited activity. Unfortunately, the conference report completely \nomitted this change, allowing aiders and abettors to continue to profit \nwithout penalty from their wrongdoing.\n  If further justification for toughening these penalties is needed, \none document uncovered by our investigation shows the cold calculation \nengaged in by a tax advisor facing low fines. A senior tax professional \nat accounting giant KPMG compared possible tax shelter fees with \npossible tax shelter penalties if the firm were caught promoting an \nillegal tax shelter. This senior tax professional wrote the following: \n``[O]ur average deal would result in KPMG fees of $360,000 with a \nmaximum penalty exposure of only $31,000.'' He then recommended the \nobvious: going forward with sales of the abusive tax shelter on a cost-\nbenefit basis.\n  Title III of the bill would strengthen legal prohibitions against \nabusive tax shelters by codifying in Federal tax statutes for the first \ntime what is known as the economic substance doctrine. This anti-tax \nabuse doctrine was fashioned by federal courts evaluating transactions \nthat appeared to have little or no business purpose or economic \nsubstance apart from tax avoidance. It has become a powerful analytical \ntool used by courts to invalidate abusive tax shelters. At the same \ntime, because there is no statute underlying this doctrine and the \ncourts have developed and applied it differently in different judicial \ndistricts, the existing case law has many ambiguities and conflicting \ninterpretations.\n  Under the leadership of Senators Grassley and Baucus, the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, the Senate has voted on \nmultiple occasions to enact this economic substance provision, but the \nHouse conferees have rejected it each time. Since no tax shelter \nlegislation would be complete without addressing this issue, Title III \nof this comprehensive bill proposes once more to include the economic \nsubstance doctrine in the tax code. I hope that with continued \npressure, it will become law in this Congress.\n  The bill will also help fight abusive tax shelters that are disguised \nas complex investment opportunities and use financing or securities \ntransactions provided by financial institutions. In reality, tax \nshelter schemes lack the economic risks and rewards associated with a \ntrue investment. These phony transactions instead often rely on the \ntemporary use of significant amounts of money in low risk schemes \nmischaracterized as real investments. The financing or securities \ntransactions called for by these schemes are often supplied by a bank, \nsecurities firm, or other financial institution.\n  Currently the tax code prohibits financial institutions from \nproviding products or services that aid or abet tax evasion or that \npromote or implement abusive tax shelters. The agencies that oversee \nthese financial institutions on a daily basis, however, are experts in \nbanking and securities law and generally lack the expertise to spot tax \nissues. Section 202 would crack down on financial institutions' illegal \ntax shelter activities by requiring federal bank regulators and the SEC \nto work with the IRS to develop examination techniques to detect such \nabusive activities and put an end to them.\n  These examination techniques would be used at least every 2 years, \npreferably in combination with routine regulatory examinations, and the \nregulators would report potential violations to the IRS. The agencies \nwould also be required to prepare joint reports to Congress in 2007 and \n2010 on preventing the participation of financial institutions in tax \nevasion or tax shelter activities.\n  During hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \non tax shelters in November 2003, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson \ntestified that his agency was barred by Section 6103 of the tax code \nfrom communicating information to other federal agencies that would \nassist those agencies in their law enforcement duties. He pointed out \nthat the IRS was barred from providing tax return information to the \nSEC, federal bank regulators, and the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board (PCAOB)--even, for example, when that information might \nassist the SEC in evaluating whether an abusive tax shelter resulted in \ndeceptive accounting in a public company's financial statements, might \nhelp the Federal Reserve determine whether a bank selling tax products \nto its clients had violated the law against promoting abusive tax \nshelters, or help the PCAOB judge whether an accounting firm had \nimpaired its independence by selling tax shelters to its audit clients.\n\n  A recent example demonstrates how ill-conceived these information \nbarriers are. A few months ago the IRS offered a settlement initiative \nto companies and corporate executives who participated in an abusive \ntax shelter involving the transfer of stock options to family-\ncontrolled entities. Over a hundred corporations and executives \nresponded with admissions of wrongdoing. In addition to tax violations, \ntheir misconduct may be linked to securities law violations and \nimproprieties by corporate auditors or banks, but the IRS has informed \nthe Subcommittee that it is currently barred by law from sharing the \nnames of the wrongdoers with the SEC, banking regulators, or PCAOB.\n  These communication barriers are outdated, inefficient, and ill-\nsuited to stopping the torrent of tax shelter abuses now affecting or \nbeing promoted by so many public companies, banks, and accounting \nfirms. To address this problem, Section 203 of this bill would \nauthorize the Treasury Secretary, with appropriate privacy safeguards, \nto disclose to the SEC, Federal banking agencies, and the PCAOB, upon \nrequest, tax return information related to abusive tax shelters, \ninappropriate tax avoidance, or tax evasion. The\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\nagencies could then use this information only for law enforcement \npurposes, such as preventing accounting firms or banks from promoting \nabusive tax shelters, or detecting accounting fraud in the financial \nstatements of public companies.\n  Another finding of the Subcommittee investigation is that some tax \npractitioners are circumventing current State and Federal constraints \non charging tax service fees that are dependent on the amount of \npromised tax benefits. Traditionally, accounting firms charged flat \nfees or hourly fees for their tax services. In the 1990s, however, they \nbegan charging ``value added'' fees based on, in the words of one \naccounting firm's manual, ``the value of the services provided, as \nopposed to the time required to perform the services.'' In addition, \nsome firms began charging ``contingent fees'' that were calculated \naccording to the size of the paper ``loss'' that could be produced for \na client and used to offset the client's other taxable income--the \ngreater the so-called loss, the greater the fee.\n  In response, many States prohibited accounting firms from charging \ncontingent fees for tax work to avoid creating incentives for these \nfirms to devise ways to shelter substantial sums. The SEC and the \nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants also issued rules \nrestricting contingent fees, allowing them in only limited \ncircumstances. Recently, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \nsent the SEC for approval a similar rule prohibiting public accounting \nfirms from charging contingent fees for tax services provided to the \npublic companies they audit. Each of these Federal, State, and \nprofessional ethics rules seeks to limit the use of contingent fees \nunder certain, limited circumstances.\n  The Subcommittee investigation found that tax shelter fees, which are \ntypically substantial and sometimes exceed $1 million, are often linked \nto the amount of a taxpayer's projected paper losses which can be used \nto shelter income from taxation. For example, in three tax shelters \nexamined by the Subcommittee, documents show that the fees were equal \nto a percentage of the paper loss to be generated by the transaction. \nIn one case, the fees were typically set at 7 percent of the \ntransaction's generated ``tax loss'' that clients could use to reduce \nother taxable income. In other words, the greater the loss that could \nbe concocted for the taxpayer or ``investor,'' the greater the profit \nfor the tax promoter. Think about that--greater the loss, the greater \nthe profit. How's that for turning capitalism on its head!\n  In addition, evidence indicated that, in at least one instance, a tax \nadvisor was willing to deliberately manipulate the way it handled \ncertain tax products to circumvent contingent fee prohibitions. An \ninternal document at an accounting firm related to a specific tax \nshelter, for example, identified the States that prohibited contingent \nfees. Then, rather than prohibit the tax shelter transactions in those \nStates or require an alternative fee structure, the memorandum directed \nthe firm's tax professionals to make sure the engagement letter was \nsigned, the engagement was managed, and the bulk of services was \nperformed ``in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit contingency \nfees.''\n  Right now, the prohibitions on contingent fees are complex and must \nbe evaluated in the context of a patchwork of Federal, State, and \nprofessional ethics rules. Section 201 of the bill would establish a \nsingle enforceable rule, applicable nationwide, that would prohibit tax \npractitioners from charging fees calculated according to a projected or \nactual amount of tax savings or paper losses.\n  Past laws, such as the Whistleblower Protection Act and qui tam \nlawsuits under the False Claims Act, demonstrate that individuals with \ninside information can help expose serious misconduct that the U.S. \ngovernment might otherwise miss. The tax arena is no different. Persons \nwith inside information can help expose millions of dollars in tax \nfraud if they are willing to step forward and tell the IRS what they \nknow about specific instances of misconduct.\n  Under current law, potential whistleblowers with inside information \nabout tax misconduct do not have an established IRS office that is \nsensitive to their concerns, provides consistent treatment, and \noversees the calculation and payment of monetary rewards for important \ninformation. Section 206 of this bill, which is very similar to a \nprovision developed by the Senate Finance Committee, would, among other \nmeasures, establish a Whistleblowers Office within the IRS, codify \nstandards for the payment of monetary rewards, and exempt whistleblower \nmonetary payments from the alternative minimum tax.\n  Each of these measures is intended to increase incentives for persons \nto blow the whistle on tax misconduct. The one key difference between \nour bill and the Finance Committee provision is that we would continue \nto give the IRS the discretion to determine the amount of money paid to \nan individual whistleblower; our bill would not enable whistleblowers \nto appeal to a court to obtain additional sums. The fact-specific \nanalysis that goes into evaluating a whistleblower's assistance and \ncalculating a reward makes court review inadvisable. The existence of \nan appeal also invites litigation and necessitates the expenditure of \ntaxpayer dollars--not for tax enforcement but for a court dispute. The \nnew Whistleblowers Office is intended to promote the consistent, \nequitable treatment of persons who report tax misconduct, without also \ninviting expensive and time-consuming litigation.\n  Section 205 of the bill would direct the Treasury Department to issue \nnew standards for tax practitioners issuing opinion letters on the tax \nimplications of potential tax shelters as part of Circular 230. The \npublic has traditionally relied on tax opinion letters to obtain \ninformed and trustworthy advice about whether a tax-motivated \ntransaction meets the requirements of the law. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations has found that, in too many cases, tax \nopinion letters no longer contain disinterested and reliable tax \nadvice, even when issued by supposedly reputable accounting or law \nfirms.\n  Instead, some tax opinion letters have become marketing tools used by \ntax shelter promoters and their allies to sell clients on their latest \ntax products. In many of these cases, financial interests and biases \nwere concealed, unreasonable factual assumptions were used to justify \ndubious legal conclusions, and taxpayers were misled about the risk \nthat the proposed transaction would later be designated an illegal tax \nshelter. Reforms are essential to address these abuses and restore the \nintegrity of tax opinion letters.\n  The Treasury Department recently adopted standards that address a \nnumber of the abuses affecting tax shelter opinion letters; however, \nthe standards do not take all the steps needed. Our bill would require \nTreasury to issue standards addressing a wider spectrum of tax shelter \nopinion letter problems, including: preventing concealed collaboration \namong supposedly independent letter writers; avoiding conflicts of \ninterest that would impair auditor independence; ensuring appropriate \nfee charges; preventing practitioners and firms from aiding and \nabetting the understatement of tax liability by clients; and banning \nthe promotion of potentially abusive tax shelters. By addressing each \nof these areas, a beefed-up Circular 230 could help reduce the ongoing \nabusive practices related to tax shelter opinion letters.\n  The bill would also provide for increased disclosure of tax shelter \ninformation to Congress. Section 204 would make it clear that companies \nproviding tax return preparation services to taxpayers cannot refuse to \ncomply with a Congressional document subpoena by citing Section 7216, a \nconsumer protection provision that prohibits tax return preparers from \ndisclosing taxpayer information to third parties. Several accounting \nand law firms raised this claim in response to document subpoenas \nissued by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, contending they \nwere barred by the nondisclosure provision in Section 7216 from \nproducing documents related to the sale of abusive tax shelters to \nclients for a fee.\n  The accounting and law firms maintained this position despite an \nanalysis provided by the Senate legal counsel showing that the \nnondisclosure provision was never intended to create a privilege or to \noverride a Senate subpoena, as demonstrated in federal regulations \ninterpreting the provision. This\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\nbill would codify the existing regulations interpreting Section 7216 \nand make it clear that Congressional document subpoenas must be \nhonored.\n  Section 204 would also ensure Congress has access to information \nabout decisions by Treasury related to an organization's tax exempt \nstatus. A 2003 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Tax \nAnalysts v. IRS, struck down certain IRS regulations and held that the \nIRS must disclose letters denying or revoking an organization's tax \nexempt status. The IRS has been reluctant to disclose such information, \nnot only to the public, but also to Congress, including in response to \nrequests by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  For example, earlier this year the IRS revoked the tax exempt status \nof four credit counseling firms, and, despite the Tax Analysts case, \nclaimed that it could not disclose to the Subcommittee the names of the \nfour firms or the reasons for revoking their tax exemption. Our bill \nwould make it clear that, upon receipt of a request from a \nCongressional committee or subcommittee, the IRS must disclose \ndocuments, other than a tax return, related to the agency's \ndetermination to grant, deny, revoke or restore an organization's \nexemption from taxation.\n  Section 208 of the bill would establish that it is the sense of the \nSenate that additional funds should be appropriated for IRS \nenforcement, and that the IRS should devote proportionately more of its \nenforcement funds to combat rampant tax shelter and tax haven abuses. \nSpecifically, the bill would direct increased funding toward \nenforcement efforts combating the promotion of abusive tax shelters and \nthe aiding and abetting of tax evasion; the involvement of accounting, \nlaw and financial firms in such promotion and aiding and abetting; and \nthe use of offshore financial accounts to conceal taxable income.\n  Tax enforcement is an area where a relatively small increase in \nspending pays for itself many times over. If we would hire adequate \nenforcement personnel, close the tax loopholes, and put an end to tax \ndodges, tens of billions in revenues that should support this country \nwould actually reach the Treasury.\n  In addition to abusive tax shelters, the bill addresses the abusive \ntax havens that help taxpayers dodge their U.S. tax obligations through \nusing corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws that impede U.S. tax \nenforcement. The London-based Tax Justice Network recently estimated \nthat wealthy individuals worldwide have stashed $11.5 trillion of their \nassets in tax havens. At one Subcommittee hearing in 2001, a former \nowner of an offshore bank in the Cayman Islands testified that he \nbelieved 100 percent of his former clients were engaged in tax evasion. \nHe said that almost all were from the United States and would take \nelaborate measures to avoid IRS detection of their money transfers. He \nalso expressed confidence that the government that licensed his bank \nwould vigorously defend client secrecy in order to continue attracting \nbusiness to the islands.\n\n  Corporations are also using tax havens to reduce their U.S. tax \nliability. A GAO report I released with Senator Dorgan last year found \nthat nearly two-thirds of the top 100 companies doing business with the \nUnited States government now have one or more subsidiaries in a tax \nhaven. One company, Tyco International, had 115.\n  Data released by the Commerce Department further demonstrates the \nextent of U.S. corporate use of tax havens, indicating that, as of \n2001, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations were in \ntax havens. A study released by the journal Tax Notes in September 2004 \nfound that American companies were able to shift $149 billion of \nprofits to 18 tax haven countries in 2002, up 68 percent from $88 \nbillion in 1999. Estimates show that funneling these profits from the \nU.S. to tax havens deprives the U.S. Treasury of anywhere from $10 \nbillion to $20 billion in lost tax revenue each year.\n  Here's just one simplified example of the gimmicks being used by \ncorporations to transfer taxable income from the United States to tax \nhavens to escape taxation. Suppose a profitable U.S. corporation \nestablishes a shell corporation in a tax haven. The shell corporation \nhas no office or employees, just a mailbox address. The U.S. parent \ntransfers a valuable patent to the shell corporation. Then, the U.S. \nparent and all of its subsidiaries begin to pay a hefty fee to the \nshell corporation for use of the patent, shifting taxable income out of \nthe United States to the shell corporation. The shell corporation \ndeclares a portion of the fees as profit, but pays no tax since it is a \ntax haven resident. The icing on the cake is that the shell corporation \ncan then ``lend'' the income it has accumulated from the fees back to \nthe U.S. companies for their use. The companies, in turn, pay \n``interest'' on the ``loans'' to the shell corporation, shifting still \nmore taxable income out of the United States to the tax haven. This \nexample highlights just a few of the tax haven ploys being used by some \nU.S. corporations to escape paying their fair share of taxes here at \nhome.\n  Sections 401 and 402 of our bill tackle the issue of tax havens by \nremoving U.S. tax benefits associated with jurisdictions that fail to \ncooperate with U.S. tax enforcement efforts. Dozens of jurisdictions \naround the world have enacted corporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws \nthat, in too many cases, have been used to justify failing to provide \ntimely information to U.S. officials investigating tax misconduct. Some \ntax havens have refused to provide timely information about persons \nsuspected of either hiding funds in the jurisdiction's offshore bank \naccounts or using offshore corporations and deceptive transactions to \ndisguise their income or create phony losses to shelter their U.S. \nincome from taxation.\n  Section 401 of the bill would give the Treasury Secretary the \ndiscretion to designate such an offshore tax haven as ``uncooperative'' \nand to publish an annual list of these uncooperative tax havens. We \nintend that the Treasury Secretary will develop this list by evaluating \nthe actual record of cooperation experienced by the United States in \nits dealings with specific jurisdictions around the world. While many \noffshore tax havens have signed treaties with the United States \npromising to cooperate with U.S. civil and criminal tax enforcement, \nthe level of resulting cooperation varies. For example, after one \ncountry signed a tax treaty with the United States, the government that \nled the effort was voted out of office by treaty opponents. Treasury \nneeds a way to ensure that tax treaty obligations are met and to send a \nmessage to jurisdictions that impede U.S. tax enforcement. This bill \ngives Treasury the tools it needs to get the cooperation it needs.\n  Under Sections 401 and 402 of the bill, persons doing business in tax \nhavens designated by Treasury as uncooperative would be denied U.S. tax \nbenefits and incur increased disclosure requirements. First, the bill \nwould disallow the tax benefits of deferral and foreign tax credits for \nincome attributed to an uncooperative tax haven. Second, taxpayers \nwould be required to provide greater disclosure of their activities, \nincluding disclosing on their returns any payment above $10,000 to a \nperson or account located in a designated haven. These restrictions \nwould not only deter U.S. taxpayers from doing business with \nuncooperative tax havens, they would also provide the United States \nwith powerful weapons to convince tax havens to cooperate fully with \nU.S. tax enforcement efforts and help end offshore tax evasion abuses.\n  Sections 403 and 404 further address offshore tax evasion. Section \n403 would toughen penalties on eligible taxpayers who did not \nparticipate in Treasury programs designed to encourage voluntary \ndisclosure of previously unreported income placed by the taxpayer in \noffshore accounts and accessed by credit card or other financial \narrangements. Section 404 would authorize Treasury to promulgate \nregulations to stop ongoing foreign tax credit abuses in which, among \nother schemes, taxpayers claim credit on their U.S. tax returns for \npaying foreign taxes, but then fail to report the income related to \nthose foreign taxes. Under the leadership of Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, both Sections 403 and 404 passed the Senate earlier this year \nas part of the Highway Bill, H.R. 3, but were dropped in conference.\n  The eyes of some people may glaze over when tax shelters and tax \nhavens are discussed, but unscrupulous taxpayers and tax professionals \nsee illicit\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\ndollar signs. Our commitment to crack down on their tax abuses must be \nas strong as their determination to get away with ripping off America \nand American taxpayers.\n  Our bill provides our government the tools to end the use of abusive \ntax shelters and uncooperative tax havens and to punish the powerful \nprofessionals who push them.\n  It's long past time for Congress to act to end the shifting of a \ndisproportionate tax burden onto the shoulders of honest Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill's provisions and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Summary of Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005\n\n\n              TITLE I--Strengthening Tax Shelter Penalties\n\n  Strengthens the penalties for: promoting abusive tax shelters; and \nknowingly aiding or abetting a taxpayer in understating tax liability.\n\n\n         TITLE II--Preventing Abusive Tax Shelter Transactions\n\n     Prohibit tax service fees dependant upon specific tax savings\n\n  Prohibits charging a fee for tax services in an amount that is \ncalculated according to or dependant upon a projected or actual amount \nof tax savings or losses offsetting taxable income. Builds on \ncontingent fee prohibitions in more than 20 states, AICPA rules \napplicable to accountants, SEC regulations applicable to auditors of \npublicly traded corporations, and proposed PCAOB rules for auditors. \nBased upon investigation by Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nshowing tax practitioners are circumventing current constraints.\n\n\n   Deter Financial Institution Participation in Abusive Tax Shelter \n                               Activities\n\n  Requires Federal bank regulators and the SEC to develop examination \ntechniques to detect violations by financial institutions of the \nprohibition against providing products or services that aid or abet tax \nevasion or that promote or implement abusive tax shelters. Regulators \nmust use such techniques at least every 2 years in routine or special \nexaminations of specific institutions and report potential violations \nto the IRS. The agencies must also prepare a joint report to Congress \nin 2007 and 2010 on preventing the participation of financial \ninstitutions in tax evasion or tax shelter activities.\n\n\n         Increase disclosure of certain tax shelter information\n\n  Authorizes Treasury to share certain tax return information with the \nSEC, Federal bank regulators, or PCAOB, under certain circumstances, to \nenhance tax shelter enforcement or combat financial accounting fraud. \nClarifies Congressional subpoena authority to obtain information (but \nnot a taxpayer return) from tax return preparers. Clarifies \nCongressional authority to obtain certain tax information (but not a \ntaxpayer return) from Treasury related to an IRS decision to grant, \ndeny, revoke, or restore an organization's tax exempt status.\n\n\n  Require Tougher Tax Shelter Opinion Standards for Tax Practitioners\n\n  Codifies and expands Treasury's authority to beef up Circular 230 \nstandards for tax practitioners providing ``opinion letters'' on \nspecific tax shelter transactions.\n\n\n               Increase Incentives for IRS Whistleblowers\n\n  Encourages persons to blow the whistle on tax misconduct by \nestablishing a Whistleblowers Office within the IRS to provide \nconsistent, equitable treatment of persons bringing information to the \nIRS. Codifies standards for awarding a portion of proceeds collected \nfrom actions based on information they bring to the IRS's attention. \nModeled on provision passed by the Senate in the Highway Bill. \nEstimated to raise $407 million over 10 years.\n     Deny tax deduction for fines, penalties and settlements.\n  Clarifies that penalties, fines and settlements paid to the \ngovernment are not deductible. Passed by the Senate in the Highway \nBill. Estimated to raise $200 million over 10 years.\n     ``Sense of the Senate'' on IRS Enforcement Priorities\n  Establishes the Sense of the Senate that additional funds should be \nappropriated for IRS enforcement, and that the IRS should devote \nproportionately more of its enforcement funds to combat: (I) the \npromotion of abusive tax shelters for corporations and high net worth \nindividuals and the aiding or abetting of tax evasion, (2) the \ninvolvement of accounting, law and financial firms in such promotion \nand aiding or abetting, and (3) the use of offshore financial accounts \nto conceal taxable income.\n\n\n                TITLE III--Requiring Economic Substance\n\n     Strengthen the Economic Substance Doctrine\n  Strengthens and codifies the economic substance doctrine to \ninvalidate transactions that have no economic substance or business \npurpose apart from tax avoidance or evasion. Also increases penalties \nfor understatements attributable to a transaction lacking in economic \nsubstance. Passed by the Senate in the Highway Bill. Estimated to raise \n$15.9 billion over 10 years.\n\n\n                TITLE IV--Deterring Offshore Tax Evasion\n\n     Deter Use of Uncooperative Tax Havens\n  Deters taxpayer use of uncooperative tax havens with corporate, bank \nor tax secrecy laws, procedures, or practices that impede U.S. \nenforcement of its tax laws by: (1) requiring disclosure on taxpayer \nreturns of any payment above $10,000 to accounts or persons located in \nsuch tax havens, and (2) ending the tax benefits of deferral and \nforeign tax credits for any income earned in such tax havens. Gives \nTreasury Secretary discretion to designate a tax haven as uncooperative \nand publish an annual list of those jurisdictions. Estimated to raise \n$87 million over 10 years.\n     Strengthen Penalties for Concealing Income in Offshore \n         Accounts\n  Toughens penalties on taxpayers who, despite being eligible, did not \nparticipate in Treasury programs to encourage voluntary disclosure of \npreviously unreported income placed by the taxpayer in offshore \naccounts and accessed through credit card or other financial \narrangements. Passed by the Senate in the Highway Bill. Estimated to \nraise $10 million over 10 years.\n     Stop Schemes to get Foreign Tax Credit Without Reporting \n         Related Income\n  Authorizes Treasury to promulgate regulations to address abusive \nforeign tax credit (FTC) schemes that involve the inappropriate \nseparation or stripping of foreign taxes from the related foreign \nincome so taxpayers get the benefit of the FTC but don't report the \nrelated income. The provision becomes effective for transactions \nentered into after the date of enactment. Passed by the Senate in the \nHighway Bill. Estimated to raise $16 million over 10 years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to join Senator Levin in \nintroducing the Tax Shelter and Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005. This bill \naddresses abusive tax shelters and offshore tax havens which allow tax \nevaders to avoid paying their fair share. These abuses increase the \namount of taxes for everyone else. By increasing the penalty for these \nshelters, this legislation\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\nwill do much to ensure that the public trust in our tax laws is \nrestored.\n  Two years ago, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I held Subcommittee hearings on abusive tax shelters. \nIt became clear to the Subcommittee that some tax avoidance schemes are \nclearly abusive. These abusive shelters relied on sham transactions \nwith no financial or economic utility other than to manufacture tax \nbenefits.\n  Abusive tax shelters hurt the American people. For example, a recent \nIRS study estimates the Nation's ``tax gap''--the difference between \nthe amount of taxes owed and the amount collected was $353 billion in \n2001. The study also found that over 80 percent of the ``tax gap'' is \ndue to taxpayers underreporting their taxes. This means that honest \ntaxpayers are forced to pay more to make up for those taxpayers who \ndodge Uncle Sam.\n  The use of abusive tax shelters exploded during the high-flying \n1990s, when many firms were awash in cash and were more concerned with \ngenerating fees than remaining compliant with the code. The lure of \nmillions of dollars in fees clearly played a role in the decision on \nthe part of tax professionals to drive a Brinks truck through any \npurported tax loophole.\n  Abusive tax shelters require accountants and financial advisors who \ndevelop and structure transactions to take advantage of loopholes in \nthe tax code. Lawyers provide cookie cutter tax opinions deeming the \ntransactions to be legal. Bankers provide loans with little or no \ncredit risk, yet the amount of the loan creates a multi-million dollar \ntax loss.\n  This became a game. Reputable professionals were able to earn huge \nprofits by providing services that offered a ``veneer of legitimacy'' \nto the transactions. The parties involved were careful to hide the \ntransactions from IRS detection by failing to register and failing to \nprovide lists of clients who used the transactions to the IRS.\n  It was clear to the Subcommittee that the promoters of these tax \nshelters failed to register transactions with the IRS partly because \nthe penalties for failing to register were so low compared to the \nexpected profits. In other words, the risk-benefit ratio was entirely \nlopsided in the favor of the promoters. This bill will end this \nadvantage and will strengthen the enforcement tools that are at Uncle \nSam's disposal.\n  Current law provides for penalties that amount to 50 percent of the \ngains of those who market, plan, implement and sell sham tax shelters \nto individuals and corporations. However, I agree with my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Levin, that even stronger penalties are needed. The \nprovision to substantially increase penalties to the promoters and \naiders and abettors who manufacture and implement these sham \ntransactions so that they must give back more than just half of their \nill-gotten gains is vital to restoring the integrity of our tax laws \nand deterring future tax avoidance.\n  This is not a victimless crime. It is not the government that loses \nthe money. It is working moms and dads who bear the brunt of lost \nrevenue so that a handful of lawyers, accountants, investment advisors, \nbankers and their clients can manipulate legitimate business practices \nto make a profit.\n  We need to give honest, hard working Americans a better deal--by \ncracking down on those who choose not to pay their fair share of taxes. \nThis bill is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ``Tax \nShelter and Tax Haven Reform Act of 2005,'' of which I am a cosponsor. \nThis bill seeks to improve the fairness of our tax system by deterring \nthe use of tax avoidance strategies with no economic justification \nother than to reduce tax liability and shirk responsibility.\n  Abusive tax shelters and tax havens cost this country tens of \nbillions of dollars each year and may be the largest single source of \nthe $300 billion tax gap between what is owed and what is collected by \nthe U.S. Treasury. The investigation by my colleagues on the Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that more than half of \nall federal contractors may have subsidiaries in tax havens and that \nalmost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations in a recent \nyear were in tax havens. My esteemed colleagues also heard testimony \nthat between 1-2 million individual taxpayers may be hiding funds in \noffshore tax havens. Many of these tax havens refuse to cooperate with \nU.S. tax enforcement officials.\n  This is not a political issue of how low or high taxes ought to be. \nThis is a basic issue of fairness and integrity. Corporate and \nindividual taxpayers alike must have confidence that those who \ndisregard the law will be identified and adequately punished. Those who \nenforce the law need the tools and resources to do so. We cannot \nreasonably expect an American business to subject itself to a \ncompetitive disadvantage by following the law while watching its \ncompetitors defy the law without repercussion.\n  This bill cracks down on those individuals and businesses that \nestablish virtual residences in tax havens abroad while taking unfair \nadvantage of the very real advantages of actual residence here in the \nUnited States.\n  This bill clarifies that the sole purpose of a transaction cannot \nlegitimately be to evade tax liability.\n  This bill increases the penalties for those who profit by \nmanipulating and exploiting our tax laws, resulting in higher rates and \ngreater complexity for the rest of us.\n  My mother taught me that there is no such thing as a free lunch--\nsomeone always has to pay. And when one of us shirks our duty to pay, \nthe burden gets shifted to others, in this case to ordinary taxpayers \nand working Americans without access to sophisticated tax preparers or \ncorporate loopholes.\n  This bill strengthens our ability to stop shifting the tax burden to \nworking families. The money saved by this bill, for example, can reduce \nthe burden on American children of unnecessary budget deficits being \nfinanced by rising debt to foreign nations.\n  The money saved by this bill can also be used to protect children in \nlow income families from unfair tax increases caused by inequities in \nthe child tax credit. In fact, this fall, I intend to introduce \nlegislation to ensure that the child tax credit is not reduced solely \nbecause a family's income fails to keep pace with inflation. With less \nthan half of the savings generated by this bill, we can shield more \nthan four million children from the annual tax increase their families \nface as a result of stagnant wages and inflation under current law.\n  All of us should pay our fair share of American taxes. There is no \nexcuse for benefiting from the laws and services, institutions and \neconomic structure of our nation while evading your responsibility to \ndo your part for this country. I believe it is our job to keep the \nsystem fair, and that's what this bill seeks to do.\n  I commend Senator Levin and Senator Coleman for their leadership on \nthis important issue.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \ncomprehensive program for testing and treatment of veterans for the \nHepatitis C virus; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Lautenberg, to introduce the Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C \nHealth Care Act. This bill would fundamentally change the way the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is addressing the growing Hepatitis C \nepidemic, and would create a national standard for testing and treating \nveterans with the virus.\n  Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by contact with the \nHepatitis C virus. It is primarily spread by contact with infected \nblood. The CDC estimates that 1.8 percent of the population is infected \nwith the Hepatitis C virus, and that number is much higher among \nveterans. Vietnam-era veterans are considered to be at greater risk \nbecause many were exposed to Hepatitis C-infected blood as a result of \ncombat-related surgical care during the Vietnam War. In fact, data from \nthe Veterans Administration suggests that as many as 18 percent of all \nveterans and 64 percent of Vietnam veterans are infected with the \nHepatitis C Virus (HCV). Veterans living in the New York-New Jersey \nmetropolitan area have the highest rate of Hepatitis C in the Nation. \nFor many of those infected, Hepatitis C leads to liver failure, \ntransplants, liver cancer, and death.\n  And yet, most veterans who have Hepatitis C don't even know it--and \noften do not get treatment until it's too late. Despite recent advances \nin treating Hepatitis C, the VA still lacks a comprehensive, \nconsistent, uniform approach to testing and treating veterans for the \nvirus. Only a fraction of the eight million veterans enrolled \nnationally in the VA Health Care System have been tested to date. Part \nof the problem stems from a lack of qualified, full-time medical \npersonnel to administer and analyze the tests. Most of the 172 VA \nhospitals in this country have only one doctor, working a half day a \nweek, to conduct and analyze all the tests. At this rate, it will take \nyears to test the entire enrolled population--years that many of these \nveterans may not have.\n  To address this growing problem, I am again introducing the Veterans \nComprehensive Hepatitis C Health Care Act. This legislation will \nimprove access to Hepatitis C testing and treatment for all veterans, \nensure that the VA spends all allocated Hepatitis C funds on testing \nand treatment, and sets new, national policies for Hepatitis C care. \nCongressman Rodney Frelinghuysen from New Jersey has introduced \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  The bill would improve testing and treatment for veterans by \nrequiring annual screening tests for Vietnam-era veterans enrolled in \nthe VA health system, and providing annual tests, upon request, to \nother veterans enrolled in the system. Further, it would require the VA \nto treat any enrolled veteran who tests positive for the Hepatitis C \nvirus, regardless of service-connected disability status or priority \ngroup categorization. The VA would be required to provide at least one \ndedicated health care professional--a doctor and a nurse--at each VA \nHospital for testing and treatment of this disease.\n  This bill would also increase the amount of money dedicated to \nHepatitis C testing and treatment, and would make sure these funds are \nspent where they are needed most. Beginning in FY06, Hepatitis C \nfunding would be shifted to the Specific Purpose account under the \nVeterans Health Administration, and would be dedicated solely for the \npurpose of paying for the costs associated with treating veterans with \nthe Hepatitis C virus. The bill would allocate these funds to the 22 \nVeterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) based on each VISN's \nHepatitis C incidence rate, or the number of veterans infected with the \nvirus.\n  In addition, this bill will end the confusing patchwork of policies \ngoverning the care of veterans with Hepatitis C throughout the nation. \nThis legislation directs the VA to develop and implement a \nstandardized, national Hepatitis C policy for its testing protocol, \ntreatment options and education and notification efforts. The bill \nfurther directs the VA to develop an outreach program to notify \nveterans who have not been tested for the Hepatitis C virus of the need \nfor such testing and the availability of such testing through the VA. \nAnd finally, this legislation would establish Hepatitis C Centers of \nExcellence in geographic areas with high incidence of Hepatitis C \ninfection.\n  The VA currently lacks a comprehensive national strategy for \ncombating this deadly disease. The Veterans Comprehensive Hepatitis C \nHealth Care Act will ensure that veterans will finally be provided with \nthe access to testing and treatment that they have more than earned and \ndeserve. And, the Federal Government will actually save money in the \nlong run by testing and treating this infection early. The alternative \nis much more costly treatment of end-stage liver disease and the \nassociated complications, or other disorders.\n  The VA has known about the problem of Hepatitis C among veterans \nsince 1992, but they have not acted. We must address this critical \nissue for the brave men and women who have placed their lives in danger \nto protect the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this crucial legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the application of the 100 percent Federal medical assistance \npercentage under the Medicaid program for services provided by the \nIndian Health Service or an Indian tribe or tribal organization \ndirectly or through referral, contract, or other arrangement; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill make a necessary clarification to current law regarding the \napplication of the federal medical assistance percentage or FMAP. I am \njoined by Senator Bingaman in introducing this bill.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act, IHCIA, provides for 100 \npercent Federal medical assistance percentage, FMAP, applicable to \nMedicaid services ``received through an Indian Health Service \nfacility.'' This definition has created some issues for state Medicaid \nprograms when applying for the full FMAP rate for services provided to \nNative Americans that are referred by an Indian Health Service facility \nto a non-IRS facility.\n  North Dakota and South Dakota have been in the courts with the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS over this issue. \nSince last year when CMS determined that the 100 percent FMAP was not \nallowable for referred services, North Dakota and South Dakota appealed \nand prevailed in a lawsuit at the district court level. The Federal \nappeals court has now reversed the district court's decision and \naffirmed that those states must repay CMS for the excess payments. \nWhile the court sided in favor of CMS, the decision states that there \nis a lack of clarity in the statute pertaining to how referred patients \nare covered through the Federal match.\n  CMS disallowed $4 million in payments that South Dakota's Department \nof Social Services had billed Medicaid through the 100 percent FMAP for \nIndian patients seen in non-IHS facilities through referrals. At issue \nis a lack of specificity regarding how far ``received through'' should \nextend. The most recent court decision even states ``the statutory \nlanguage is susceptible to multiple interpretations.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today will clarify the statute and \nmake it completely clear that any services provided under a state \nMedicaid plan which are referred by any Indian Health Service facility, \nwhether operated by the IHS or by and Indian tribe or tribal \norganization are to be covered by the 100 percent FMAP amount. Any \nprevious disallowance of a claim or claims by CMS will be reviewed by \nthe Department of Health and Human Services within 90 days of enactment \nof this legislation and payments adjusted accordingly if the claim \nmeets the standards set forth in this bill.\n  The Senate Indian Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, will be \nconsidering the IHCIA this fall. It is my hope that this legislation \nwill be considered within the broader context of the debate on IHCIA. \nClearly the Federal government has an obligation to live up to the \ntreaties and responsibilities to our tribes and all Native Americans. I \nsee this legislation as an extension of the obligation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1574. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a minimum update for physicians' services for 2006 and \n2007; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today with my \ncolleagues Senators Bingaman, Rockefeller, Lincoln, Murray and Corzine \nto introduce the ``Affordable Access to Medicare Providers Act.''\n  Securing access to affordable healthcare, especially for our Nation's \nseniors, is critical and it remains to be one of my top priorities. \nAccess to healthcare is impacted by two key factors: we must have \nenough well qualified healthcare providers that are willing and able to \naccept Medicare patients, and the beneficiaries must be able to afford \nthe premiums required to utilize their Medicare benefits. This bill \naddresses both of these issues--it will provide some stability in \nphysician Medicare payment rates so that physicians can continue to \noffer high quality healthcare services while ensuring that the Medicare \nbeneficiaries are not saddled with the cost and even higher premiums \nfor physicians services.\n  Medicare was written to cover the most basic health care for seniors. \nWhen the original bill passed in 1965, the legislation's conference \nreport explicitly stated that the intent of the program is to provide \nadequate ``medical aid . . . for needy people, and should ``make the \nbest of modem medicine more readily available to the aged.''\n  While the Medicare Modernization Act provided some improvements such \nas: It also had some unfortunate consequences on the Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Washington State. Medicare payments per beneficiary \nwill be further exacerbated and continue to penalize Washington state \nfor our efficient healthcare system. Fifty-seven percent of Washington \nstate physicians are limiting or dropping Medicare patients from their \npractices. Washington falling to 45th in the Nation on reimbursements \nwill not help the situation.\n  A survey conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Council, MedPAC, \nfound that 22 percent of patients already have some problems finding a \nprimary care physician and 27 percent report delays getting an \nappointment. Physicians are the foundation of our Nation's health care \nsystem. Continual cuts, or even the threat of repeated cuts, put \nMedicare patient access to physicians' services at risk. They also \nthreaten to destabilize the Medicare program and create a ripple effect \nacross other programs. Indeed, Medicare cuts jeopardize access to \nmedical care for millions of our active duty military family members \nand military retirees because their TRICARE insurance ties its payment \nrates to Medicare.\n  Now we are told by the Medicare board of Trustees that if Congress \ndoes not act by the end of the year, the Medicare physician payment \nformula will likely produce a 4.3 percent decrease next year with \nsimilar reductions to follow in the years to come. The Medicare Board \nof Trustees also estimates that the cost of providing medical care will \nincrease by an estimated 15 percent over the next six years, while \ncurrent reimbursement levels are scheduled to drop by an estimated 26 \npercent over the same time period.\n  After adjusting for inflation, Medicare payments to physicians in \n2013 will be less than half of what they were in 1991. That declining \nreimbursement rate would likely mean a growing percentage of family \nphysicians would decline to see new Medicare patients and, as a result, \naccess to care would suffer.\n  Washington stands to lose $39 million in 2006 and 1.9 billion from \n2006-2014 if these cuts go through. For physicians in Washington, the \ncuts over this period will average $13,000 per year for each physician \nin the State.\n  The American Medical Association conducted a survey of physicians in \nFebruary and March 2005 concerning significant Medicare pay cuts from \n2006 through 2013 (as forecast in the 2004 Medicare Trustees report). \nResults from the survey indicate that if the projected cuts in Medicare \nphysician payment rates begin in 2006: more than a third of physicians \n(38 percent) plan to decrease the number of new Medicare patients they \naccept; more than half of physicians (54 percent) plan to defer the \npurchase of information technology, which is necessary to make value-\nbased purchasing work; a majority of physicians (53 percent) will be \nless likely to participate in a Medicare Advantage plan; about a \nquarter of physicians plan to close satellite offices (24 percent) and/\nor discontinue rural outreach services (29 percent) if payments are cut \nin 2006. If the pay cuts continue through 2013, close to half of \nphysicians plan to close satellite offices (42 percent) and/or \ndiscontinue rural outreach (44 percent); and one-third of physicians \n(34 percent) plan to discontinue nursing home visits if payments are \ncut in 2006. By the time the cuts end, half (50 percent) of physicians \nwill have discontinued nursing home visits.\n  Physicians can simply not absorb cuts these cuts and still deliver \nhigh quality care. We must ensure our doctors have the resources they \nneed to ensure that our seniors have access to their physicians.\n  There have been efforts made to address the physician payment issue \nhowever; they have not addressed the impact on Medicare beneficiaries \nand their premiums. I'm concerned some of the proposals would result in \nan additional burden being placed on the Medicare beneficiary by way of \na $24 billion increase in part B premiums in 2006 and a $60 billion \nincrease in 2007.\n  This happens because by law, the monthly Part B premium is set at 25 \npercent of the part B Trust Fund costs. Administrative or legal changes \nto increase physician payment rates that don't include a hold-harmless \nclause, increase Medicare part B expenditures and ultimately, the Part \nB premiums paid by beneficiaries.\n  This is not a viable solution either as the beneficiaries are already \nbeing hit with premium increases and additional cost sharing due to \nimplementation of the prescription drug benefit.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize a \ndemonstration program to increase the number of doctorally-prepared \nnurse faculty; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nhelp address the critical nurse faculty shortage facing our Nation \ntoday. The Bureau of Labor statistics estimates that 1,000,000 new and \nreplacement nurses will be needed by 2012. With a nurse faculty \nworkforce that averages 53.5 years of age, we cannot and must not wait \nany longer to address nurse faculty shortages. Quite simply, we need to \neducate more doctoral level faculty, or we, as a Nation, will not have \nenough trained nurses to meet the needs of our aging society.\n  In a 2002 report, the Commission on Higher Education and the \nUniversity of New Mexico Health Sciences Center assembled nursing \neducators, healthcare providers, business organizations, professional \nassociations, legislators, and New Mexico state agencies to develop a \nstatewide strategic framework for addressing New Mexico's nursing \nshortage. The initiative revealed that 72 percent of hospitals have \ncurtailed services, 38 percent of home care agencies have refused \nreferrals, 15 percent of long term care facilities have refused \nadmissions, and public health offices have decreased public health \nservices. The number one priority listed in the statewide initiative \nwas to double the number of licensed nursing graduates in the State. \nAnd yet, this one simple priority is not so simple. With a doctoral \nnurse faculty of 53.4 years of age, on average, and 46 vacant nurse \nfaculty positions, in New Mexico, the necessary expansion of programs \nis not possible. New Mexico is not alone in facing nurse and nurse \nfaculty shortages. The nationwide nursing shortage is expected to more \nthan triple, because the average age of the workforce is near \nretirement, the population is aging and has increasing healthcare \nneeds, and the shortage is one that affects the entire nation.\n  There is a well-known saying, ``a problem clearly stated is a problem \nhalf solved.'' In 2004-2005, over 30,000 qualified nursing school \napplicants were not accepted into nursing baccalaureate programs. \nEstimates from the National League for Nursing indicate that over \n123,000 qualified applications could not be accommodated in registered \nnurse educational programs in 2004. The primary reason students are not \nadmitted is lack of trained faculty, funds, and program resources. The \nreal nursing workforce problem that we need to address at the current \ntime is lack of an adequate number of qualified nurse faculty members.\n  The Nurse Faculty Education Act will amend the Nurse Reinvestment \nAct, P.L. 107-205, to help alleviate the faculty shortage by providing \nfunds to help nursing schools increase enrollment and graduation from \nnursing doctoral programs. The act will increase partnering \nopportunities, enhance cooperative education, help support marketing \noutreach, and strengthen mentoring programs. The bill will increase the \nnumber of nurses who complete nursing doctoral programs and seek \nemployment as faculty members and nursing leaders in academic \ninstitutions. By addressing the faculty shortage, we are addressing the \nnursing shortage.\n  The provisions of the Nurse Faculty Education Act are vital to \novercoming nursing workforce challenges. By addressing nurse faculty \nshortages, we will enhance both access to care and the quality of care. \nOur families and our Nation will be well-served by integration of the \nNurse Faculty Education Act into the Nurse Reinvestment Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1575\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Faculty Education Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205) has \n     helped to support students preparing to be nurse educators. \n     Yet, nursing schools nationwide are forced to deny admission \n     to individuals due to lack of qualified nurse faculty.\n       (2) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and \n     replacement nurses will be needed by 2012.\n       (3) According to the American Association of Colleges of \n     Nursing, in the 2004-2005 academic year, 29,425 individuals, \n     or 35 percent of the qualified applicants were not accepted \n     into nursing baccalaureate programs. 2,748 potential nursing \n     master's students and over 200 nurses qualified for admission \n     to doctoral programs were not accepted. Estimates from the \n     National League of Nursing indicate that over 123,000 \n     qualified applications could not be accommodated in associate \n     degree, diploma, and baccalaureate registered nurse \n     educational programs in 2004.\n       (4) Seventy-six percent of schools report insufficient \n     faculty as the primary reason for not accepting qualified \n     applicants. The primary reasons for lack of faculty are lack \n     of funds to hire new faculty, inability to identify, recruit \n     and hire faculty in the current competitive job market, and \n     lack of nursing faculty available in different geographic \n     areas.\n       (5) Despite the fact that 75 percent of graduates of \n     doctoral nursing program enter education roles (versus about \n     5 percent of graduates of nursing master's programs), the 93 \n     doctoral programs nationwide produce only 400 graduates. This \n     annual graduation rate is insufficient to meet current needs \n     for nurse faculty. In keeping with other professional \n     academic disciplines, nurse faculty at colleges and \n     universities are typically doctorally-prepared.\n       (6) With the average age of nurse faculty at retirement at \n     62.5 years of age and the average age of doctorally-prepared \n     faculty currently at 53.5 years, the health care system faces \n     unprecedented workforce and health access challenges with \n     current and future shortages of deans, nurse educators, and \n     nurses.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Part D of title VIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 296p et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 832.

A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodentcide Act to permit the distribution and sale of certain \npesticides that are registered in both the United States and another \ncountry; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleague Senator Dorgan, a bill that addresses a persistent inequity \nin the agriculture industry.\n  Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement--in \nfact, even before then--Montana farmers have battled against false \nbarriers to trade that harm their ability to compete in a global \nmarket. While most inputs to production agriculture--fertilizer, seed, \nequipment--can move easily across the U.S.-Canadian border, pesticides \nremain segmented. The pesticide industry has a vested interest in \npreserving these borders, because the barriers allow for price \ndistortions that harm producers on both sides of the border.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to tear down these \nbarriers, and begin the process of harmonizing the pesticide \nregistration process. The bill establishes a process by which \ninterested growers can petition the Environmental Protection Agency to \nrequire a pesticide to be jointly labeled, if the product is already \nregistered in both countries. See--there's the problem. We are talking \nhere about the exact same chemical, produced by the same company, but \npriced at very different levels. Because the products have two \ndifferent labels, the lower-price chemical remains out of reach of U.S. \ngrowers. When Montana farmers have to compete against Canadian growers \nwho are getting their pesticides at a substantially lower price, that \nis an example of free trade gone wrong. In addition, this bill gives \nEPA the authority needed to require a joint label on a new product that \nis being introduced into the market.\n  It is important to note that this legislation is not restricted to \nCanada, so as not to violate U.S. trade agreements. The bill authorizes \nEPA to enter into negotiations to harmonize regulatory processes and \nrequirements with other countries, as appropriate. The United States \nand Canada have been working for over a decade to streamline their \nregistration processes, harmonize the requirements, and develop \nprotocols for work sharing and joint reviews. A lot of groundwork has \nalready been done between the U.S. and Canada, so we can move quickly \ntowards development of a joint label between our two countries.\n  And there is no reason not to. Again, we are talking about the exact \nsame product, being sold at two different prices to growers who have to \ncompete against each other in the world market. NAFTA was supposed to \ntear down borders between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and yet this \nbarrier remains. It is an irritant to Montana growers who are farming \nalong the border.\n  It is also a problem for Canadian growers, and I look forward to \nworking with Canada to resolve this issue in a mutually beneficial way. \nThere are times when pesticides are cheaper in the U.S., and U.S. \ngrowers often have access to a wider variety of products. So there is a \nshared interest in tearing down this barrier to free trade.\n  A recent study done by Montana State University underscored this \npoint. For 13 pesticides widely used in Montana and Alberta, seven were \nless expensive in Canada, five were less expensive in the U.S., and \none, glyphosate, showed little or no difference in price. False \nbarriers that prevent pesticides from moving across the border are \ncreating significant price distortions in the market, and those \nbarriers need to come down.\n  Certainly, there are a number of factors that impact pricing, but \nthere can be no doubt that trade barriers allow price differentiation, \nand that's not right. There will always be some price fluctuations--\nthey exist now, between\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\nstates, even between communities in the same state. But for a person \nfarming along the Montana-Alberta border, who can see his competitor \nacross that border and knows that his competitor's input costs are \nlower for no other reason than a trade barrier that should have been \neliminated, that's going to bother him. If the guy one town over has \nbetter prices on pesticides, I can drive to get those, or negotiate \nwith my local dealer. But if the guy across the border has better \nprices, I have no options, no bargaining power. That's just not right.\n  This is not an anti-industry bill. Growers need the crop protection \nindustry, and it is important that the research and innovation in that \nsector continue. This bill will help to streamline regulatory processes \nand reduce the obstacles to registration, by requiring only one label. \nIt simplifies distribution systems, by allowing companies to have just \none label for the same product, even when it is being sold in two \ncountries. So while this bill will address the sort of price \ndistortions that farmers on the northern border find unfair, it also \nreduces cost to industry, and will ideally result in smoother \nregistration processes.\n  In fact, representatives of the crop protection industry have said \nthat the solution to trade barriers along the northern border is a \njoint label, and have testified in support of regulatory harmonization \nbefore the Senate Agriculture Committee. Since the passage of NAFTA, a \ntechnical working group on pesticide harmonization has worked \ndiligently on the development of joint registration and labeling \nprocedures, and has enjoyed the cooperation of the industry in those \ndiscussions. This bill accomplishes what both the industry and the \nproducers have said is needed: regulatory harmonization between two \nnations, joint registration, and joint labeling.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, the National Barley Growers Association, the U.S. Durum \nGrowers Association, the National Farmers Union, the Montana Grain \nGrowers Association, and the North Dakota Grain Growers Association. It \nis time these barriers be eliminated. If we are going to have free \ntrade in grain, then we need free train in the input costs for \nproduction agriculture. This bill accomplishes that. I ask Members to \ntake a close look at this bill, and consider it seriously. Our growers \ndeserve an end to the practice of artificially inflating the price of \npesticides simply to take advantage of false barriers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing bipartisan \nlegislation to remedy a long-standing and glaring inequity in our so-\ncalled free-trade system. There are significant and costly differences \nin prices between agricultural chemicals sold in Canada and similar--\nand in some cases, identical--chemicals sold in the United States. This \ndisparity in prices puts an extra burden on American farmers, and it \nputs them at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to competing in the \nworld market.\n  Currently, American and Canadian farmers use many of the same \nproducts on their fields. These products use the same chemicals, are \nmade by the same company, and are sometimes even marketed under the \nsame name; but they are often sold at a much lower cost north of the \nborder.\n  For example, U.S. farmers use the pesticide Garlon, which is sold as \nRemedy in Canada. It is manufactured by the same company, with the same \nchemicals. But American farmers pay $8.02 more per acre than their \nCanadian counterparts. The pesticide Puma, which is widely used on \nwheat and barley, costs farmers in North Dakota $2.82 more per acre \nthan Canadian farmers pay for Puma 120 Super, which is the same \nproduct, made by the same company. That means North Dakota farmers paid \nnearly $7.9 million more to treat their fields with Puma than they \nwould have paid if they could have accessed it at prices paid by \nCanadian farmers.\n  This legislation would address that inequity by setting up a process \nthat would allow American farmers to access these chemicals, which are \nlower priced, but identical to those already approved for use in the \nUnited States.\n  Data collected by the North Dakota Department of Agriculture show \nthat farmers in just my home State of North Dakota alone would have \nsaved nearly $11 million last year if they had been able to access \nagricultural chemicals at Canadian prices.\n  But this problem does not just affect farmers in North Dakota. \nFarmers all across the northern tier of the United States would benefit \nif they were able to access U.S.-approved pesticides at Canadian \nprices.\n  I have come before the Senate time and again to talk about the hidden \ninequities of trade. For trade to benefit our country, it must be fair. \nBut the pricing inequities in the Canadian and U.S. pesticide markets \nare a failure of our current trade system.\n  This legislation I am introducing today, along with the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Burns, authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to \nrequire that certain agricultural chemicals which have already been \napproved in the U.S. carry a joint label, which would allow them to \ncross the border freely.\n  The new labels would still be under the strict scrutiny of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, as would the use of these products. \nThe EPA would continue to insure the health and safety standards that \ngovern the products we use in our food supply. This bill keeps those \npriorities intact.\n  This bill is not an ending but a beginning. Hidden trade barriers and \nschemes riddle the fabric of our trade agreements. We cannot continue \nto accept trade practices that, on the one hand, hamstring Americans, \nand on the other hand, unduly promote our competitors. We ought not \naccept second best all of the time, and this bill is a step in bringing \nAmerican producers back to a level playing field.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1580. A bill to improve the health of minority individuals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Healthcare \nEquality and Accountability Act, along with my colleagues Senators \nReid, Durbin, Bingaman, Corzine, Murray, Kennedy, Landrieu, Lautenberg, \nInouye, Pryor, Mikulski, Obama, Dodd, Lieberman, and Clinton. I want to \nthank them, as well as my colleagues in the other body, for all of \ntheir contributions to this important legislation.\n  This bill will improve access to and the quality of health care for \nindigenous people and racial and ethnic minorities who often lack \naccess and suffer disproportionately from certain diseases. It is \nessential that we expand and improve the health care safety net so that \neveryone can access the health care services that they need. This \nlegislation will expand health coverage and includes provisions that \nwill increase access to culturally-appropriate and relevant services \nfor our communities.\n  In addition to improving treatments for the diseases that \ndisproportionately effect indigenous people and racial and ethnic \nminorities, we need to also focus on preventing these diseases in the \nfirst place. This legislation will help combat heart disease, asthma, \nHIV/AIDS, and diabetes. Diabetes is a disease that disproportionately \naffects Pacific Islanders, including Native Hawaiians. Among \npopulations in Hawaii, Native Hawaiians had the highest age-adjusted \nmortality rates due to diabetes for the years 2000 to 2002.\n  Statistics for U.S.-related Pacific Jurisdictions are difficult to \nobtain due to underdeveloped reporting and data collection systems. \nHowever, available data suggests that diabetes and its complications \nare growing problems that are creating a greater burden on the health \ncare delivery systems of the Pacific Jurisdictions. For example, in the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, mortality data for 1996-2000 reflects \nthat complications from diabetes are the leading cause of death and \naccounted for 30 percent of all deaths during that period. In American \nSamoa, mortality data for 1998-2001 shows that diabetes is the third \nleading cause of death accounting for nine percent of all deaths for \nthat period. In\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nGuam, diabetes has been identified as the fifth leading cause of death \nand the prevalence rate has been estimated to be seven times that of \nthe United States. Local governments have had to focus on expensive \noff-island tertiary hospital care and curative services, resulting in \nthe reduction of funds available for community-based primary preventive \ncare and pnblic health services throughout the Pacific Jurisdictions.\n  There is a need for more comprehensive diabetes awareness education \nefforts targeted at communities with Native Hawaiian and other Pacific \nIslander populations. Papa Ola Lokahi, a non-profit agency created in \n1988 that functions as a consortium with private and state agencies in \nHawaii to improve the health status of Native Hawaiians and other \nPacific Islanders, has established the Pacific Diabetes Today Resource \nCenter. Pacific Diabetes Today is designed to provide community members \nwith basic knowledge and skills to plan and implement community-based \ndiabetes prevention and control activities. Since 1998, the Pacific \nDiabetes Today program has provided training and technical assistance \nto 11 communities in Hawaii and the Pacific Jurisdictions. However, \nmore can be done to ensure that the diabetic health needs of Native \nHawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are being met.\n  Community-based diabetes programs need to be better integrated into \nthe larger infrastructure of diabetes prevention and control. \nComprehensive, specific programs are needed to mobilize Native Hawaiian \nand other Pacific Islander communities and develop appropriate \ninterventions for diabetes complications prevention and improve \ndiabetes care. My bill, therefore, includes a provision that would \nauthorize a comprehensive program to prevent and better manage the \noverlapping health problems that are often related to diabetes such as \nobesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\n  I am also pleased that a provision has been included in this bill \nthat would restore Medicaid eligibility for Freely Associated States, \nFAS, citizens in the United States. The political relationship between \nthe United States and the FAS is based on mutual support. In exchange \nfor the United States having strategic denial and a defense veto over \nthe FAS, the United States provides military and economic assistance to \nthe Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia and \nPalau with the goal of assisting these countries in achieving economic \nself-sufficiency following the termination of their status as U.N. \nTrust territories. Pursuant to the Compact, FAS citizens are allowed to \nfreely enter the United States. They come to seek economic opportunity, \neducation, and health care. Unfortunately, FAS citizens lost many of \ntheir public benefits as a result of the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Act, PRWORA, of 1996, including Medicaid coverage. FAS \ncitizens were previously eligible for Medicaid as aliens permanently \nresiding under color of law in the United States.\n  After the enactment of PRWORA, the State of Hawaii was informed that \nit could not claim Federal matching funds for services rendered to FAS \ncitizens. Since then, the State of Hawaii, and the territories of Guam, \nAmerican Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \nCNMI, have continued to incur substantial costs to meet the health care \nneeds of FAS citizens that have immigrated to these areas.\n  The Federal Government must provide Federal resources to help States \nmeet the healthcare needs of the FAS citizens that have been brought \nabout by a Federal commitment. It is inequitable for a state or \nterritory to be responsible for all of the financial burden of \nproviding necessary social services to individuals that are residing \nthere due to a Federal commitment. Mr. President, FAS citizen \neligibility must be restored. Furthermore, the State of Hawaii, and the \nterritories of Guam, American Samoa, and the CNMI, should be reimbursed \nfor all of the Medicaid expenses of FAS citizens, and must not be \nresponsible for the costs of providing essential health care services \nfor FAS citizens.\n  Finally, there is another provision in this bill is of extreme \nimportance to the State of Hawaii, taken from legislation that my \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, has introduced. The provision \nwould provide a 100 percent Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage, \nFMAP, of health care costs of Native Hawaiians who receive health care \nfrom Federally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian Health \nCare System. This would provide similar treatment for Native Hawaiians \nas already granted to Native Alaskans by the Indian Health Service or \ntribal organizations. The increased FMAP will ensure that Native \nHawaiians have access to the essential health services provided by \ncommunity health centers and the Native Hawaiian Health Care System.\n  This bill would significantly improve the quality of life for \nindigenous people and ethnic and racial minorities, and I encourage all \nof my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Akaka \nand Senator Reid in introducing the Healthcare Equality and \nAccountability Act. Our goal is to eliminate racial and ethnic \ndisparities in health care, so that all citizens, regardless of income \nor background, have the best possible health care our Nation can \nprovide.\n  The Institute of Medicine has documented the severity of ethnic and \nracial disparities in health care. People of color face unequal \ntreatment and unequal outcomes in heart disease, infant mortality, HIV/\nAIDS, diabetes, asthma, and other serious illnesses. The health care \nneeds of communities of color are often more severe than those of white \nAmericans. Minorities often face significant obstacles, including \npoverty and the lack of health insurance. We need to attack disparities \nin all their forms.\n  A critical first step is to see that health insurance and decent \nhealth care are available and affordable for all Americans. This bill \nstrengthens the health care safety net by expanding access to Medicaid \nand the Children's Health Insurance Program, and improving health care \nfor Indian tribes, migrant workers, and farm workers.\n  The bill also contains essential measures for removing cultural and \nlinguistic barriers to good care. The United States is a Nation of \nimmigrants, and all Americans deserve to understand what their doctor \nis telling them. Interpreter and translator services save money in the \nlong run by avoiding harm when patients do not understand their \ndiagnosis or the health advice they receive. Health care institutions \ndeserve to be reimbursed for providing these critically needed \nservices.\n  Other important initiatives to reduce health disparities include \ndiversifying the health care workforce. Minority providers are more \nlikely to serve low-income communities of color, and this bill \naddresses the shortage of these providers.\n  Federal agencies can do more in this battle too. The bill requires \nall Federal health agencies to develop specific plans to eliminate \ndisparities. The bill expands the Office of Civil Rights and the Office \nof Minority Health at the Department of Health and Human Services, and \ncreates minority health offices within the Food and Drug Administration \nand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  In addition, the bill strengthens investments in prevention and \nbehavioral health and improves research and data collection. It \nstrengthens health institutions that serve communities of color, \nprovides grants for community initiatives, and funds programs on \nchronic disease. In each of these ways, we can reduce the gap in health \ncare between people of color and whites, so that all Americans can \nbenefit from the remarkable advances being made in modern health care.\n  It's time for Congress, the administration, and the Nation to end the \nshameful inequality in health care that plagues the lives of so many \npeople in our society. This bill contains numerous provisions intended \nto make that happen, and it can have a major impact on the lives of \nmillions of Americans. I commend Senators Akaka and Reid for their \nleadership on this important health issue. We intend to do all we can \nin this Congress to see that effective legislation to combat health \ndisparities is enacted into law and funded adequately to do the job.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Bunning):\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\n  S. 1581. A bill to facilitate the development of science parks, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBunning, to introduce the Science Park Administration Act of 2005.\n  This legislation is a result of my travels to Taiwan, China, Hong \nKong, and India to learn more about their science and technology \npolicies, as well as to discover how they have successfully encouraged \nsimilar industries and research entities to work so closely together in \nthese research parks.\n  Let me discuss some findings from my fact finding trips regarding the \nrole of science parks in economic development.\n  Last summer, I visited the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park \nwhich the Hong Kong Government is funding at $423 million. By 2006, \nthis investment will help construct 10 buildings, over 1 million square \nfeet of office and laboratory space, that will cluster IC design, \nphotonics, biotechnology and information technology.\n  This science park, like the others I visited in Asia, teams up with \nthe local universities on collaborative research efforts. It has an \nincubation center with 83 start-up companies, and provides them low \ncost space, business planning, marketing, and employee training, as \nwell as research and development grants from the Hong Kong Government \nto overcome the ``valley of death'' challenges so many new technology \ncompanies frequently face.\n  One of the most impressive features of this park is the Integrated \nCircuit, IC, Design and Development Support Center. This is a user \nfacility with shared state of the art equipment to support the entire \nIC product development cycle, from initiation design to production \nrelease. For example, as many as 16 vendors can combine their designs \nonto a single wafer, thus reducing initial prototype foundry costs by \n94 percent.\n  I was also briefed on the Hong Kong Cyber Port, another science park \ndevoted solely to information technology, IT, and multimedia companies \nthat trains employees and conducts collaborative research. The Hong \nKong Government is investing $2 billion between 2000 and 2007 to house \n10,000 IT professionals and 100 IT companies in over 1 million square \nfeet of work space.\n  The Hong Kong Government's combined investment in developing the \ninfrastructure to attract science-based companies to these two parks is \nabout $400 million annually over a period of six years. On a comparable \nGDP scale, the United States would have to spend $31 billion annually \nfor that same period for a total of $186 billion.\n  This past January, I spent 10 days in India reviewing their science \nand technology policies, and was particularly impressed with their \ndevelopment of Software Technology Parks. These parks were first \ndeveloped in 1991 by the Ministry of Information Technology and \nCommunications as a semiautonomous entity to promote India's developing \nIT industry. They provide the infrastructure in terms of space, \ninternet access, tax breaks and-one stop clearances for government \napprovals. Generous tax considerations exempt companies until 2010 from \ncorporate income tax and excise duties on purchased goods.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the growth rate of India's IT industry \nhave been phenomenal. There are now more than 1,000 companies in 44 \nsuch software parks in India, the largest located around Hyderabad and \nBangalore considered to be India's ``Silicon Valleys.''. Last year \nthese parks had a combined net export value of $50 billion, up 37 \npercent from the prior year.\n  Companies such as Infosys, which maintains software for large firms \noverseas, are located in these parks, and their 2004 revenues jumped by \n50 percent. Last year, they received 1.2 million online job \napplications; they gave a standardized test to 300,000, interviewed \n30,000, and hired 10,000. Much of India's success in the IT industry \ncan be attributed not only to their universities, but to the \ngovernment's decision 1991 to establish these Software Technology \nParks.\n  Building on that success, and with the government's encouragement, \nthese Software Parks are now set to launch biotechnology parks.\n  Taiwan's success in the global market place is a result of building \nthe Hsinchu Science Park in the 1980s. Today, Hsinchu has over 100,000 \ntechnically trained people, 325 companies, 6 national labs and $22 \nbillion in gross revenue. The government has duplicated these parks in \ntwo other locations of the island. The science parks being built \nthroughout Asia are modeled after Taiwan's Hsinchu Science Park.\n  Let me note that these Asian science parks have several common \nfeatures:\n  First the Government commits to provide a first-class infrastructure \nto accommodate all levels of science-based companies, from small start-\nups in incubators to large manufacturing plants.\n  Second, these parks align companies of similar interests to mutually \nreinforce each other along the supply and management chain.\n  Third, the Government provides virtually one-stop shopping for \ngovernment approvals, even including loans.\n  Fourth, the Government provides tax incentives, usually in the form \nof waiving taxes on the first several years of profit, and capital \ngains on acquired stock.\n  Fifth, and most importantly, the Government takes the long view of \npartnering with the local governments to ensure that a trained \nworkforce is readily available to support the parks' growth, by teaming \nwith universities and national laboratories.\n  If we fail to learn from these Asian success stories, we are in \ndanger of losing the very high technology industries we first started, \nbecause the low cost manufacturing operations in Asia are now moving up \nthe value chain to research intensive industries, which the Government \nfacilitates by building science parks.\n  That leads me to the legislation we are introducing today.\n  The premise of the legislation is straight forward. It does not pick \nindustry winners or losers. Rather, it simply provides a synergistic \nscience-based infrastructure that companies may compete for and thrive \nin. Just like in Asia, the government acts as a facilitator not \nmicromanager.\n  The legislation first proposes a series of competitively peer-\nreviewed science park planning grants to local governments.\n  A revolving loan fund in six regional centers is proposed to allow \nexisting science parks to upgrade their infrastructure.\n  The legislation proposes a loan guarantee fund for the construction \nof new science parks.\n  Additionally, the legislation proposes a Science Park Venture Capital \nFund similar to SBIC's, that would guarantee debentures issued by the \nFund to raise capital for start-up companies trying to bridge that \nvalley of death, where ideas must move from the laboratory to working \nprototype.\n  Moreover, the legislation proposes several tax incentives to locate \nin the park. The full cost of property placed in the park could be \ndeducted in the year it was purchased without regard to the existing \ncaps. Many times high-tech equipment is expensive and loses its value \nquickly, and this provision would cover that loss. The legislation \nproposes a flat 20 percent R tax credit without regard to any \nexpenditure in the base period to spur greater research investment on a \nbroader range of projects. Finally, the legislation ensures that the \nstatus of tax exempt bonds used to fund science park infrastructure \nremain tax exempt eliminating the uncertainty associated with its \ninterpretation under the Bayh-Dole Act.\n  I believe this legislation combines many of the best ideas I have \ndiscovered on my Asian fact finding trips. I hope it attracts the \nsupport from both sides of the aisle as a truly bipartisan effort as we \nneed this type of infrastructure investment more than ever before if we \nare to successfully compete in today's global environment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the United States Grain Standards Act, \nto facilitate the official inspection at export port locations of grain \nrequired or authorized to be inspected under such Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the U.S. Grain Standards Act, which expires September 30, \n2005.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture was granted authority by Congress to \nestablish grain standards in 1916. Sixty years later, Congress \nauthorized the Federal Grain Inspection Service in order to ensure the \ndevelopment and maintenance of uniform U.S. standards, to develop \ninspection and weighing procedures for grain in domestic and export \ntrade, and to facilitate grain marketing. The U.S. grain inspection \nsystem is recognized worldwide for its accuracy and reliability.\n  On May 25, 2005, the Agriculture Committee held a hearing to review \nthe reauthorization of the Act during which the industry expressed its \ndesire to provide authority to the United States Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, to utilize third-party entities at export terminals. \nInspections at these terminals are currently conducted by Federal \ninspectors or employees of State Departments of Agriculture. Industry \nproposes, and commodity groups support, granting USDA the authority to \nutilize third-party entities at U.S. export terminals in order to \nimprove competitiveness of U.S. agriculture worldwide.\n  Congress has a unique opportunity to provide this authority to USDA, \nand I have included the industry's proposal in this legislation. USDA \nestimates that by 2009, 75 percent of Federal grain inspectors will be \neligible for retirement. The short-term staffing situation facing USDA \nshould ease the Department's transition in delivering inspection and \nweighing services at export terminals.\n  In addition to providing USDA the authority to use third-party \nentities at export terminal locations, this 5-year reauthorization bill \nthat I am introducing contains measures to ensure the integrity of the \nFederal grain inspection system. The bill clearly states that official \ninspections continue to be the direct responsibility of USDA. USDA will \nalso have the ability to issue rules and regulations to further enhance \nthe work and supervision of these entities. The ability of the U.S. to \nincrease long-term competitiveness coupled with a system that can \nmaintain its strong reputation worldwide certainly holds great \npotential for success.\n  This bill is identical to the reauthorization bill recently \nconsidered and approved unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture in \nthe House of Representatives. It is my hope that this measure will \ngarner equivalent support in this body as reauthorization of the U.S. \nGrain Standards Act moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1583. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to expand the \ncontribution base for universal service, establish a separate account \nwithin the universal service fund to support the deployment of \nbroadband service in unserved areas of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Dorgan and Pryor \nto introduce the ``Universal Service for the 21st Century Act.'' For \nmore than 70 years, the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice has been a fundamental goal of our telecommunications laws. In \norder to ensure the long term sustainability of the fund and to add \nsupport for broadband services that are increasingly important to our \nNation's economic development, our bill reforms the system of payments \ninto the universal service fund and creates a $500 million account to \nbring broadband to unserved areas of the country.\n  The achievements of the universal service fund are undeniable. \nAffordable telephone services are available in many remote and high \ncost areas of the country, including Oregon, because of the fund. Large \nand small telecommunications carriers serve sparsely populated rural \ncommunities and schools and libraries receive affordable Internet \nservices because of the fund. The need for a robust and sustainable \nuniversal service system certainly remains, but it has become \nincreasingly clear that major reforms are needed if the fund is to meet \nthe evolving communications needs of the American people.\n  In Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \ndirected the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, and the States to \nencourage deployment of advanced telecommunications services, including \nbroadband, on a reasonable and timely basis. Earlier this month, the \nFCC released data on broadband connections that shows significant \ngains, in deployment. According to the report, there were nearly 29 \nmillion broadband connections throughout the country in 2004.\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\n  But we can do more. Although there have been well documented \nsuccesses in the deployment of broadband services in many parts of the \ncountry, others remain unserved, whether due to geography, low \npopulation density or other reasons. These largely rural areas deserve \nthe benefits of an advanced communications infrastructure and \nincreasingly need that infrastructure to build and maintain robust \neconomies.\n  Accordingly, to meet the needs of these communities, we have created \na $500 million ``Broadband for Unserved Areas Account'' within the \nuniversal service fund that will be used solely for the deployment of \nbroadband networks in unserved areas. This funding will be awarded \ncompetitively based on merit to a single broadband provider in each \nunserved area. The FCC will establish the guidelines for this new \naccount. All technologies will be eligible for funding.\n  The bill also directs the FCC to update its definition of broadband \nto ensure that our communications policies are forward-looking and \ncompetitive with the speeds and capabilities available in other \nindustrialized countries. The FCC will revisit its definition annually \nand will prepare reports for Congress regarding gains in broadband \npenetration in unserved areas and the need for an increase or decrease \nin funding.\n  In addition, the bill addresses a crisis in the structure of the \nuniversal service fund which has threatened its long term viability. \nCurrently, the burden of universal service fund contributions is placed \non a limited class of carriers, causing inequities in the system and \nincentives to avoid contribution. As demands on the fund increase, \ncontributors are being forced to pay more. This tension threatens to \ncripple the fund. Our bill therefore authorizes and directs the FCC to \nestablish a permanent mechanism to support universal service.\n  By reforming the universal service system and spurring the deployment \nof broadband services, our legislation will ensure that our Nation's \ncommunications infrastructure will continue to grow, and to be the \nrobust and connected network that Americans expect and deserve.\n  I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Universal Service for the \n     21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The preservation and advancement of universal service \n     is a fundamental goal of the Communications Act of 1934 and \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n       (2) Access throughout the nation to high-quality and \n     advanced telecommunications and information services is \n     essential to secure the many benefits of our modern society.\n       (3) As the Internet becomes a critical element of any \n     economic and social growth, universal service should shift \n     from sustaining voice grade infrastructure promoting the \n     development of efficient and advanced networks that can \n     sustain advanced communications services.\n       (4) The current structure established by the Federal \n     Communications Commission has placed the burden of universal \n     service support on only a limited class of carriers, causing \n     inequities in the system, incentives to avoid contribution, \n     and a threat to the long term sustainability of the universal \n     service fund.\n       (5) Current fund contributors are paying an increasing \n     portion of their interstate and international service revenue \n     into the universal service fund.\n       (6) Any fund contribution system should be equitable, \n     nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral, and the funding \n     mechanism must be sufficient to ensure affordable \n     communications services for all.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Inclusion of Intrastate Revenues.--Section 254(d) of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254(d)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Every'' and inserting ``Notwithstanding \n     section 2(b) of this Act, a'';\n       (2) by striking ``interstate'' each place it appears; and\n       (3) by adding at the end ``Nothing in this subsection \n     precludes a State from adopting rules or regulations to \n     preserve and advance universal service within that State as \n     permitted by section 2(b) and subsections (b) and (f) of this \n     section.''.\n       (b) Universal Service Proceeding.--\n       (1) Proceeding.--The Federal Communications Commission \n     shall initiate a proceeding, or take action pursuant to any \n     proceeding on universal service existing on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, to establish a permanent mechanism to \n     support universal service, that will preserve and enhance the \n     long term financial stability of universal service, and will \n     promote the public interest.\n       (2) Criteria.--In establishing such a permanent mechanism, \n     the Commission may include collection methodologies such as \n     total telecommunications revenues, the assignment of \n     telephone numbers and any successor identifier, connections \n     (which could include carriers with a retail connection to a \n     customer), and any combination thereof if the methodology--\n       (A) promotes competitive neutrality among providers and \n     technologies;\n       (B) to the greatest extent possible ensures that all \n     communications services that are capable of supporting 2-way \n     voice communications be included in the assessable base for \n     universal service support;\n       (C) takes into account the impact on low volume users, and \n     proportionately assesses high volume users, through a \n     capacity analysis or some other means; and\n       (D) ensures that a carrier is not required to contribute \n     more than once for the same transaction, activity, or \n     service.\n       (3) Excluded providers.--If a provider of communications \n     services that are capable of supporting 2-way voice \n     communications would not contribute under the methodology \n     established by the Commission, the Commission shall require \n     such a provider to contribute to universal service under an \n     equitable alternative methodology if exclusion of the \n     provider from the contribution base would jeopardize the \n     preservation, enhancement, and long term sustainability of \n     universal service.\n       (4) Deadline.--The Commission shall complete the proceeding \n     and issue a final rule not more than 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. INTERCARRIER COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Jurisdiction.--Notwithstanding section 2(b) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 152(b)), the Federal \n     Communications Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction \n     to establish rates for inter-carrier compensation payments \n     and shall establish rules providing a comprehensive, unified \n     system of inter-carrier compensation, including compensation \n     for the origination and termination of intrastate \n     telecommunications traffic.\n       (b) Criteria.--In establishing these rules, and in \n     conjunction with its action in its universal service \n     proceeding under section 3, the Commission, in consultation \n     with the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, \n     shall--\n       (1) ensure that the costs associated with the provision of \n     interstate and intrastate telecommunications services are \n     fully recoverable;\n       (2) examine whether sufficient requirements exist to ensure \n     traffic contains necessary identifiers for the purposes of \n     inter-carrier compensation; and\n       (3) to the greatest extent possible, minimize opportunities \n     for arbitrage.\n       (c) Sufficient Support.--The Commission should, to the \n     greatest extent possible, ensure that as a result of its \n     universal service and inter-carrier compensation proceedings, \n     the aggregate amount of universal service support and inter-\n     carrier compensation provided to local exchange carriers with \n     fewer than 2 percent of the Nation's subscriber lines will be \n     sufficient to meet the just and reasonable costs of such \n     local exchange carriers.\n       (d) Negotiated Agreements.--Nothing in this section \n     precludes carriers from negotiating their own inter-carrier \n     compensation agreements.\n       (e) Deadline.--The Commission shall complete the pending \n     Intercarrier Compensation proceeding in Docket No. 01-92 and \n     issue a final rule not more than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, today my colleagues Senators Smith, Pryor \nand I are introducing legislation to ensure the sustainability and \nlongevity of the Universal Service Fund and to support the deployment \nof broadband to unserved areas.\n  Section 254 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act sets forth the \nprinciples of universal service. Section 254 states that all citizens, \nincluding rural consumers, deserve access to telecommunications \nservices that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in \nurban areas, at reasonably comparable rates.\n  This goal to ensure that rural consumers are not left behind \ncontinues to be critical, particularly as technology advances in leaps \nand bounds in this 21st century. Access to a robust communications \ninfrastructure is a necessity for all Americans.\n  Our bill will further that goal in two ways. First, it will ensure \nthat the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, will address reform of \nuniversal service and intercarrier compensation to support the cost of \na national, quality communications network.\n  Over time, the Universal Service Fund has become increasingly \nstrained, with the burden of support placed on only a limited class of \ncarriers, creating inequities in the system and incentives to avoid \ncontribution.\n  Reform is needed, and our bill directs the FCC to embark upon this \nreform, with specific guidelines to ensure equity and fairness and \ncontinuing sufficient support for networks.\n  In addition, our legislation will set up an account within the \nUniversal Service Fund for broadband deployment to unserved areas. This \nwill enable deployment of broadband to areas of the country that remain \nprohibitively expensive to serve, leaving consumers in those areas \nbehind the technological curve.\n  This legislation is only a starting point. I believe more dialogue is \nnecessary among my colleagues and industry, in order to achieve \ncomprehensive universal service reform. I invite my colleagues to join \nme in this dialogue and in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1585. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the costs of prescription drugs for enrollees of medicaid \nmanaged care organizations by extending the discounts offered under \nfee-for-service medicaid to such organizations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenator Inouye entitled the Medicaid Health Plan Rebate Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the legislation developed \nby the Association for Community Affiliated Plans, a policy statement \nby the American Public Human Services Association on the issue, and a \nletter of support from the Medicaid Health Plans of America be printed \nin the Record.\n  I further ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Association for Community Affiliated plans--Reducing Medicaid Costs \n  Without Cutting Benefits or Beneficiaries: Congress Should Equalize \n   Description Drug Costs for Beneficiaries in Medicaid Managed Care\n\n\n                                Request\n\n       As Congress and the States struggle to control the \n     skyrocketing costs of Medicaid, the Association for Community \n     Affiliated Plans (ACAP) supports a solution that will save \n     Federal, State governments and Medicaid Managed Care \n     Organizations (MCOs) up to $2 billion over ten years by \n     equalizing the treatment of prescription drug discounts \n     between Medicaid managed care and Medicaid fee- for-service. \n     In offering Medicaid managed care plans access to the \n     Medicaid drug rebate, Congress will provide relief for \n     federal and state budgets, thereby mitigating the need for \n     added cuts to Medicaid benefits or populations.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of \n     1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires a drug \n     manufacturer to have a rebate agreement with the Secretary of \n     the Department of Health and Human Services for States to \n     receive federal funding for outpatient drugs dispensed to \n     Medicaid patients. At the time the law was enacted, managed \n     care organizations were excluded from access to the drug \n     rebate program. In 1990, only 2.8 million people were \n     enrolled in Medicaid managed care and so the savings lost by \n     the carve-out were relatively small. Today, 12 million people \n     are enrolled in capitated managed care plans. This migration \n     of beneficiaries into managed care has, in turn, increased \n     States' Medicaid pharmacy costs because fewer beneficiaries \n     have access to the drug rebate.\n\n\n                      challenge for medicaid plans\n\n       Under the drug rebate, States receive between 18 and 20 \n     percent discount on brand\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\n     name drug prices and between 10 and 11 percent for generic \n     drug prices. At the time the rebate was enacted, many of the \n     plans in Medicaid were large commercial plans who believed \n     that they could get better discounts than the federal rebate. \n     Today, Medicaid-focused plans are the fastest growing sector \n     in Medicaid managed care. According to a study by the Lewin \n     Group, Medicaid-focused MCOs typically only receive about a 6 \n     percent discount on brand name drugs and no discount on \n     generics. Because many MCOs (particularly smaller Medicaid-\n     focused MCOs) do not have the capacity to negotiate deeper \n     discounts with drug companies, Medicaid is overpaying for \n     prescription drugs for enrollees in Medicaid health plans.\n\n\n                    Opportunity or Medicaid Savings\n\n       The Lewin Group estimates that this proposal could save up \n     to $2 billion over 10 years. This legislation has been \n     endorsed by organizations representing both state government \n     and the managed care industry, including the National \n     Association of State Medicaid Directors, and the Association \n     for Community Affiliated Plans.\n       As Congress is forced to make tough choices to control the \n     costs of the Medicaid program, this proposal offers a ``no-\n     harm'' option to control costs and ensure that there is not a \n     prima facie pharmacy cost disadvantage states using managed \n     care as a cost effective alternative to Medicaid fee-for-\n     service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               American Public Human Services Association\n\n            National Association of State Medicaid Directors\n\n\n  Policy Statement: MCO Access to the Medicaid Pharmacy Rebate Program\n\n     Background\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA `90) \n     established a Medicaid drug rebate program that requires \n     pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide a rebate to \n     participating state Medicaid agencies. In return, states must \n     cover all prescription drugs manufactured by a company that \n     participates in the rebate program. At the time of this \n     legislation, only a small percentage of Medicaid \n     beneficiaries were enrolled in capitated managed care plans \n     and were primarily served by plans that also had commercial \n     lines of business. These plans requested to be excluded from \n     the drug rebate program as it was assumed that they would be \n     able to secure a better rebate on their own. Though \n     regulations have not yet been promulgated, federal \n     interpretation to date has excluded Medicaid managed care \n     organizations from participating in the federal rebate \n     program.\n       Today, the situation is quite different. 58% of all \n     Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in some type of managed \n     care delivery system, many in capitated health plans. Some \n     managed care plans, especially Medicaid-dominated plans that \n     make up a growing percentage of the Medicaid marketplace, are \n     looking at the feasibility of gaining access to the Medicaid \n     pharmacy rebate. However, a number of commercial plans remain \n     content to negotiate their own pharmacy rates and are not \n     interested in pursuing the Medicaid rebate.\n     Policy Statement\n       The National Association of State Medicaid Directors is \n     supportive of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), in \n     their capacity as an agent of the state, being able to \n     participate fully in the federal Medicaid rebate program. To \n     do so, the MCO must adhere to all of the federal rebate rules \n     set forth in OBRA '90 and follow essentially the same \n     ingredient cost payment methodology used by the state. The \n     state will have the ability to make a downward adjustment in \n     the MCO's capitation rate based on the assumption that the \n     MCO will collect the full rebate instead of the state. \n     Finally, if a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) is under \n     contract with an MCO to administer the Medicaid pharmacy \n     benefit for them, then the same principal shall apply, but in \n     no way should both the MCO and the PBM be allowed to claim \n     the rebate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Medicaid Health Plans of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2005.\n     Margaret A. Murray,\n     Executive Director, Association for Community Affiliated \n         Plans, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Murray: The Medicaid Health Plans of America \n     (MHPOA) supports your proposed initiative to provide Medicaid \n     managed care organizations with access to the Medicaid drug \n     rebate found in Section 1927 of the Social Security Act. We \n     support this effort and urge Congress to enact this common \n     sense provision.\n       Medicaid Health Plans of America, formed in 1993 and \n     incorporated in 1995, is a trade association representing \n     health plans and other entities participating in Medicaid \n     managed care throughout the country It's primary focus is to \n     provide research, advocacy, analysis, and organized forums \n     that support the development of effective policy solutions to \n     promote and enhance the delivery of quality healthcare. The \n     Association initially coalesced around the issue of national \n     healthcare reform, and as the policy debate changed from \n     national healthcare reform to national managed care reform, \n     the areas of focus shifted to the changes in Medicaid managed \n     care.\n       Your proposal to allow Medicaid managed care organizations \n     access to the Medicaid drug rebate makes sense given the \n     migration of Medicaid beneficiaries from fee-for-service to \n     managed care since 1990. Increasingly, states have not been \n     able to take advantage of the drug rebate for those enrollees \n     in managed care, thus driving up federal and state Medicaid \n     costs. The savings estimated in the Lewin Group study are \n     significant and may help to mitigate the needs for other cuts \n     in the program.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nHealthcare Equality and Accountability Act that Senator Akaka and I are \nintroducing today. We are pleased that Congressman Honda, Chair of the \nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, is introducing this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives with the support of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the \nCongressional Native American Caucus.\n  My first elected position was on the board of trustees of the largest \npublic hospital in Southern Nevada--a hospital known today as \nUniversity Medical Center (UMC) of Southern Nevada.\n  Since my time on the hospital board, Nevada has become not just one \nof the fastest growing states in the nation, but one of the most \ndiverse. The Asian and Hispanic populations have grown by over 200 \npercent, and the African-American population in Nevada has increased by \n91 percent. As a result, health care providers are struggling to meet \nthe needs of Nevada's diverse population.\n  In one example, a woman arrived at a Las Vegas emergency room \nhemorrhaging. Doctors determined that she needed a hysterectomy, but \nshe did not speak English. Her young son had to interpret, but was \nembarrassed to explain the diagnosis, so instead he told his mother she \nhad a tumor in her stomach.\n  In areas with rapidly growing diverse populations, miscommunications \nlike this one are all too common.\n  In another incident, a woman at a lab in Las Vegas was diagnosed with \nbreast cancer, but lab employees couldn't find anyone to explain her \ntest results to her in Spanish.\n  Unfortunately, a shortage of interpreters and translated material is \njust one problem that contributes to the high rate of health \ndisparities among racial and ethnic groups.\n  According to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control, \nAfrican-Americans are 30 percent more likely to die from heart disease \nand cancer than whites, and 40 percent more likely to die from stroke.\n  Yet, despite a substantial need for health care, minority groups are \nless likely to have health insurance and are less likely to receive \nappropriate care.\n  If we do nothing, the health care divide will only get worse. Since \n2000, millions more Americans are without health insurance and health \ncare cost have skyrocketed. About 33 percent of Hispanics, 19 percent \nof African Americans and 19 percent of Asians are uninsured.\n  In just one year--from 2002 to 2003--the number of Hispanics without \nhealth insurance increased by one million people.\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\n  And for the first time in four decades, infant mortality rates in \nthis nation have increased. The infant mortality rate for African \nAmericans is more than twice as high than for whites; and is 70 percent \nhigher for American Indian and Alaska Native infants.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help to: expand the \nhealth care safety net, diversify the health care work force, combat \ndiseases that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities, \nemphasize prevention and behavioral health, promote the collection and \ndissemination of data and enhance medical research, and provide \ninterpreters and translation services in the delivery of health care.\n  Everyone deserves equal treatment in health care. I hope that all of \nmy colleagues will support the Healthcare Equality and Accountability \nAct so we may begin to close the health care divide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1587. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit qualifying States to use a portion of their allotments under the \nState children's health insurance program for any fiscal year for \ncertain medicaid expenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today with Senators Domenici, Murray, \nJeffords, Alexander, Cantwell, Akaka, Reed, Chafee, Leahy, Dodd, and \nDayton we introduce legislation entitled the ``Children's Health Equity \nAct of 2005.''\n  This legislation would extend provisions that were included in Public \nLaws #108-74 and 108-127 that amended the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or SCHIP, to permit the states of Connecticut, \nHawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, \nTennessee, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin to apply some of their \nenhanced SCHIP matching funds toward the coverage of certain children \nenrolling in Medicaid that were part of expansions of coverage to \nchildren through Medicaid in those 11 states prior to the enactment of \nSCHIP.\n  As a article in the September/October 2004 issue of Health Affairs by \nGenevieve Kenney and Debbie Chang points out, when SCHIP was created, \n``Inequities were . . . introduced across states because those that had \nalready expanded Medicaid coverage to children could not receive the \nhigher SCHIP matching rate for these children . . . [and this] meant \nthat states that had been ahead of the curve in expanding Medicaid \neligibility for children were penalized financially relative to states \nthat expanded coverage after SCHIP.''\n  The article adds that ``additional cross-state inequities were \nintroduced'' during the creation of SCHIP because three states had \ntheir prior expansions grandfathered in during the bill's \nconsideration. Left behind were the aforementioned 11 states.\n  Fortunately, with the passage of Public Laws #108-74 and 108-127 in \n2003, the inequity was recognized and the 11 states, including New \nMexico, were allowed to use up to 20 percent of our State's enhanced \nSCHIP allotments to pay for Medicaid eligible children above 150 \npercent of poverty that were part of Medicaid expansions prior to the \nenactment of SCHIP. As the Congressional Research Service notes, ``The \nprimary purpose of the 20 percent allowance was to enable qualifying \nstates to receive the enhanced FMAP [Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage] for certain children who likely would have been covered \nunder SCHIP had the state not expanded their regular Medicaid coverage \nbefore SCHIP's enactment in August 1997.''\n  Unfortunately, one major problem with the compromise was that it only \nallowed the 11 states flexibility with their SCHIP funds for allotments \nbetween 1998 and 2001 and not in the future. Therefore, the inequity \ncontinues with SCHIP allotments from 2002 and on. In fact, with the \nexpiration of SCHIP funds from FY 1998-2000 as of September 2004, that \nleaves the 11 states with only the ability to spend FY 2001 SCHIP \nallotments on expansion children. For those states, such as Vermont and \nRhode Island, that have already spent their 2001 SCHIP allotments, they \nno longer benefit from the passage of this provision. Furthermore, the \nFY 2001 funds will also expire at the end of September 2005. Thus, \nunder current law, no spending under these provisions will be permitted \nin fiscal year 2006 or thereafter.\n  Therefore, our legislation today prevents the full expiration of this \nprovision for our 11 states and ensures that the compromise language is \nextended in the future. It is important to states such as New Mexico \nthat have been severely penalized for having expanded coverage to \nchildren through Medicaid prior to the enactment of SCHIP. In fact, due \nto the SCHIP inequity, New Mexico has been allocated $266 million from \nSCHIP between fiscal years 1998 and 2002, and yet, has only been able \nto spend slightly over $26 million as of the end of last fiscal year. \nIn other words, New Mexico has been allowed to spend less than 10 \npercent of its federal SCHIP allocations because the expansion children \nhave been previously ineligible for the enhanced SCHIP matching funds.\n  As the health policy statement by the National Governors' Association \nreads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that innovative \nstates not be penalized for having expanded coverage to children before \nthe enactment of S-CHIP, which provides enhanced funding to meet these \ngoals. To this end, the Governors support providing additional funding \nflexibility to states that had already significantly expanded coverage \nto the majority of uninsured children in their states.''\n  It is important to note the bill does not take money from other \nstates' CHIP allotments. It simply allows our states to spend our \nStates' specific CHIP allotments from the federal government on our \nuninsured children--just as other states across the country are doing.\n  According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, thus \nfar eight states have benefited financially from the passage of the \nlegislation. In the fourth quarter of 2003 and for all four quarters in \n2004, Hawaii reported federal SCHIP expenditures using the 20 percent \nallowance in the amount of $380,000, Maryland received $106,000, New \nHampshire received $2.1 million, New Mexico received $2.3 million, \nRhode Island received $485,000, Tennessee received $4.5 million, \nVermont received $475,000, and Washington received $22.2 million.\n  I urge that this very important provision for our states be included \nin the budget reconciliation package the Congress is preparing to \nconsider in September and ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rules relating to the suspension of interest and certain penalties \nwhere the taxpayer is not contacted by the Internal Revenue Service \nwithin 18 months; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year, the Senate passed significant \nlegislation aimed at shutting down tax shelters. We ramped up \ndisclosure requirements that make it easier for IRS to find those who \npromoted and invested in these deals. We greatly increased penalties. \nWe made law firms and accounting firms responsible for their part in \nperpetuating this distasteful business.\n  Another thing we did was to take a break on interest expense away \nfrom participants in listed transactions and those who fail to disclose \na reportable transaction.\n  Usually, if the IRS audits your tax return and doesn't tell you about \nany adjustments to your tax bill within 18 months after the return is \nfiled, the interest on that tax bill stops. It stops until the IRS does \ntell you what you owe. It is called ``the 18 month interest suspension \nrule'' and became law so taxpayers wouldn't have to pay excessive \ninterest if the IRS took a long time to figure out what they owed.\n  But, people who get involved with tax shelters play hide and seek \nwith the IRS. They hope the game lasts until the time for auditing a \ntax return has passed. This means that the IRS often doesn't know a \ntaxpayer has bought into a tax shelter until well after 18 months has \ngone by.\n  And, this problem is made even worse by those who sell the shelters. \nPromoters are supposed to keep a list of those who buy their shelters. \nThe IRS can ask for the list--it's one way the IRS can find those who \nget into these bad deals.\n  But, often the promoter won't turn that list over to the IRS right \naway. Once again, it is well after that 18 month mark before the IRS \nlearns about the investment and can do the audit.\n  It is not right that taxpayers benefit from this 18 month interest \nsuspension rule when the delays are the result of their own hand. \nTaxpayers involved in deals that abuse our tax system should not \nbenefit from their own fun and games.\n  That is why we took the interest suspension break away from these \ntaxpayers in last year's Jobs Act. But we only took it away for \ninterest charges after October 3, 2004.\n  Today, my good friend Chuck Grassley and I introduce a proposal that \ntakes this one step further and eliminates the interest suspension \nbreak for interest charges on or before October 3, 2004. Why should \nthese folks get any break when they have manipulated the system in the \nfirst place?\n  The only exception is for taxpayers who have decided to take the IRS \nup on a published settlement initiative to unwind their transaction. \nThose taxpayers would continue to qualify for suspension of their \naccrued interest expense through the October 3 date. The IRS has found \nthese settlement initiatives are a useful way to get these old cases \nresolved and off the table. I think we should help this process along \nso the IRS can deal with other aspects of the tax gap.\n  Our proposal also will plug up another unintended loophole in the \ninterest suspension rules. Earlier this year, the IRS ruled that \ntaxpayers filing amended returns showing a balance due more than 18 \nmonths after the original return was filed were also entitled to \ninterest suspension--this applies to all taxpayers, not just those with \ntax shelters. Since the IRS wouldn't have any way of knowing these \ntaxpayers even owed more tax, it doesn't make sense to give them a \nbreak on interest charges.\n  Over the past several years this country has experienced a scourge of \ntax shelters. With hard work, we have come a long way in our fight \nagainst them. We must be relentless in our quest to wipe them out. We \nneed to remove any incentives that might encourage people to get into \nthese abusive deals. Our proposal is one more blow in our fight to \nmaintain fairness and integrity in our system of tax administration. We \nrequest your support for this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9511]]\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EMTALA requires hospitals to provide \nemergency care to patients, regardless of their ability to pay. \nHowever, this stands in conflict with Medicaid law, which in most cases \nprohibits payment for psychiatric treatment for people between the ages \nof 21 to 65 years. Our legislation will remedy that situation by \nproviding Medicaid coverage for emergency treatment for mental illness, \nthus expanding access for acute psychiatric care and ensuring that \npatients with mental disorders receive the assistance they vitally need \nin a timely fashion.\n  Under current law, Medicaid payment for psychiatric treatment for \npatients between the ages of 21 and 65 years is restricted to hospitals \nthat have an in house psychiatric ward. If a patient seeks care from a \nprivate psychiatric hospital or is transferred to a private facility \nfrom a community hospital, Medicaid does not provide reimbursement due \nto the so-called Institutions for Mental Disease, IMD, exclusion. In \ncomparison, if the same patient seeks care under EMTALA from a hospital \nbecause of a physical ailment, Medicaid provides coverage regardless of \nthe type of facility that provides the treatment. I have therefore \njoined together with Senator Conrad, Senator Lincoln, and Senator \nCollins to introduce legislation that will require Medicaid to pay for \nthe cost of care associated with emergency psychiatric treatment \nnecessary to comply with EMTALA. No longer will private entities be \nrequired to shoulder the burden of this Federal mandate, and no longer \nwill Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries go without access to necessary and \nappropriate emergency care.\n  This bipartisan legislation has been carefully crafted with input \nfrom both the provider and beneficiary communities to ensure that \nassistance is directed to those who are most in need and to ensure that \nthe coverage only extends to people who require emergency treatment. \nThe definition in the EMTALA statute of an emergency is straightforward \nfor psychiatric patients. Patients must present as a danger to \nthemselves or others--for example, as being suicidal or threatening \nphysical harm to others.\n  Our bill also offers a targeted and low-cost solution to ease the \ncrisis in emergency departments. Emergency department overcrowding is a \ngrowing and severe problem in the United States, and dedicated \nphysicians and nurses who work in emergency rooms are reaching a \nbreaking point where they may not have the resources or surge capacity \nto respond effectively. Patients often face a long wait in the \nemergency room, sometimes for days, because there is no bed or other \nappropriate setting available. Tens of thousands of dollars every day \nare being spent inefficiently on extended treatment in emergency rooms \nthat is not the most appropriate or clinically effective care.\n  This crisis in emergency departments impacts everyone's access to \nlifesaving care. According to a May 2005 report by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the number of annual emergency \ndepartment visits increased 26 percent over a 10-year period, from 90.3 \nmillion in 1993 to 113.9 million visits in 2003--an average increase of \nmore than 2 million visits per year. During the same time, the number \nof hospital emergency departments decreased by more than 12 percent, \nresulting in a greater number of visits to emergency departments that \nremain open.\n\n  How do these problems affect emergency care for all of us? \nOvercrowded emergency rooms result in reduced availability of \nphysicians, nurses, and healthcare staff; fewer available examination \nareas and beds; longer waits for patients and their families; and \nhospitals more frequently having to divert patients by ambulance to \nother hospitals.\n  The existing situation is not only jeopardizing access to emergency \nrooms and treatment but ultimately, in many cases, it is overwhelming \nthe criminal justice system. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates \nthat, on average, 16 percent of inmates in local jails suffer from a \nmental illness, and in Maine, the National Alliance for the Mentally \nIII, NAMI, an advocacy group for persons with mental illness, estimates \nthat figure is as high as 50 percent. In my home state of Maine, 65,000 \npeople have a severe mental illness but with the severe shortage of \npsychiatric beds in the State, many people go without treatment. We \nmust take action to provide the mentally ill with better access to \ncare, and we must start by ensuring that Medicaid reimburses the \nfacilities that provide treatment.\n  Passing the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act and providing \nMedicaid coverage for emergency psychiatric treatment in both general \nand psychiatric hospitals will accomplish several goals. First, and \nmost importantly, it will result in better psychiatric emergency care \nfor patients. Second, it will result in more efficient and effective \nuse of both Federal and State Medicaid dollars. Third, by resolving the \ncurrent conflict in Federal law between EMTALA requirements and the \nMedicaid IMD exclusion from reimbursement, the bill will enable\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\nfreestanding psychiatric hospitals to receive reimbursement for \nMedicaid psychiatric patients on the same basis as general hospitals \nand help preserve the viability of these hospitals.\n  We have received strong support from a number of leading national \nmental health and medical associations who confirm the critical need \nfor this legislation, including NAMI, the National Association of \nCounty Behavioral Health Directors, the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American \nHospital Association, and the National Association of Psychiatric \nHealth Systems. I am especially pleased to have also received \nendorsements from a number of Maine organizations, including the Maine \nHospital Association, Spring Harbor Hospital, and NAMI Maine.\n  This legislative change is vitally important to ensure that Medicaid \npatients with mental illness receive the right care at the right time \nin the right setting, instead of prolonged stays in emergency rooms and \nin hospital settings without psychiatric specialty care. The cost of \nachieving a more efficient, effective, and clinically appropriate care \nsystem for psychiatric emergencies is small and well worth it. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 National Alliance\n\n\n                                         for the Mentally Ill,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the 210,000 members and \n     1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill (NAMI), I am writing to express support for your \n     legislation, the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act of \n     2005. NAMI strongly supports this important effort to address \n     the growing crisis in access to acute care services for non-\n     elderly adults living with severe mental illness. As the \n     nation's largest organization representing individuals with \n     severe mental illness and their families, NAMI is pleased to \n     support this important measure.\n       As NAMI's consumer and family membership knows first-hand, \n     the acute care crisis for inpatient psychiatric care is \n     growing in this country. This disturbing trend was identified \n     in the recently released Bush Administration New Freedom \n     Initiative Mental Health Commission report. Over the past 15-\n     20 years, states have closed inpatient units and drastically \n     reduced the number of acute care beds. Also, general \n     hospitals, due to severe budget constraints, have had to \n     close psychiatric units or reduce the number of beds. This \n     has resulted in a growing shortage of acute inpatient \n     psychiatric beds in many communities.\n       The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act will address an \n     important conflict in federal policy that has contributed to \n     restricted access to needed inpatient services--the Medicaid \n     Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Exclusion and the \n     Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA). EMTALA \n     requires hospitals to stabilize patients in an emergency \n     medical condition, while the IMD exclusion prevents certain \n     hospitals (psychiatric hospitals) from receiving Medicaid \n     reimbursement for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of \n     21-64 in these circumstances.\n       This important measure will allow Medicaid funding to be \n     directed to non-publicly owned and operated psychiatric \n     hospitals (IMDs) for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages \n     of 21-64 who require stabilization in these settings as \n     required by EMTALA. Today, these hospitals are denied payment \n     for care required under the EMTALA rules. The result is that \n     psychiatric hospitals are forced to absorb these added costs \n     of care to their already growing un-reimbursed care even \n     though these patients have insurance through Medicaid.\n       This legislation will go a long way in addressing the \n     growing psychiatric acute inpatient crisis, while creating \n     fairness in the reimbursement structure for psychiatric \n     hospitals under the limited circumstances required by the \n     EMTALA law. Your leadership in carefully crafting and \n     introducing this targeted legislation addressing a critical \n     problem for persons with serious mental illnesses is much \n     appreciated. NAMI looks forward to working with you and your \n     Senate colleagues to ensure passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely, \n                                   Michael J. Fitzpatrick, M.S.W.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The National Association of County \n     Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors \n     (NACBHD), which is the behavioral health affiliate of the \n     National Association of Counties, and the National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) are writing to strongly \n     support The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act--\n     legislation you are introducing to alleviate the crisis in \n     access to acute hospital inpatient psychiatric services. A \n     lack of acute inpatient services was recently highlighted in \n     President Bush's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \n     report and is a problem in many counties. In twenty of the \n     most populous states, counties have the designated \n     responsibility to plan and implement mental health services.\n       Over the past 20 years most states have closed many of \n     their state hospitals and returned individuals to the \n     community for care. General hospitals have over the past 10-\n     15 years have also begun to close psychiatric inpatient \n     units. Freestanding psychiatric hospitals have been \n     significantly reduced due to the reimbursements rates brought \n     about with the advent of managed care. Overall, the \n     availability of acute psychiatric beds, in many states, has \n     decreased dramatically in the last 10 years. Given the \n     shortage of inpatient acute beds, many individuals with \n     serious psychiatric disorders end up in county jails or \n     homeless rather than receiving basic psychiatric services in \n     hospital.\n       Your legislation specifically addresses the conflict in \n     federal law between the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor \n     Act (EMTALA) Medicaid Institution for Mental Disease (IMD). \n     Your legislation will enable psychiatric hospitals to receive \n     reimbursement on the same basis as general hospitals for \n     Medicaid patients who meet EMTALA standards of a medical \n     crisis. The legislation offers a low-cost solution to \n     alleviate the crisis in emergency rooms in general hospitals \n     caused by an overflow of individuals in need of psychiatric \n     care because inpatient beds are not available.\n       NACBHD and NACo appreciate your leadership in introducing \n     this specific legislation that will address this inherent \n     conflict in federal requirements and will assist in promoting \n     access to acute psychiatric inpatient services. We look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues in getting \n     this legislation passed through this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry E. Naake,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Counties.\n     Melissa Staats,\n       President & CEO, National Association of County Behavioral \n     Health and Developmental Disability Directors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2005.\n     Hon.

But Medicaid's Institution for \n     Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion does not allow Medicaid \n     reimbursement to non-public psychiatric hospitals for \n     stabilizing care delivered to Medicaid patients between the \n     ages of 21-64. This exclusion burdens these facilities with \n     an unfunded mandate in fulfilling their EMTALA obligations \n     for this patient population.\n       Your legislation would eliminate the IMD exclusion and \n     allow non-public psychiatric hospitals to receive appropriate \n     reimbursement for care provided under EMTALA to Medicaid \n     beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64. This will relieve \n     overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the \n     appropriate care these patients deserve in a more timely \n     manner.\n       Thank you for addressing this important issue. We support \n     the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act of 2005 and look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues to ensure \n     swift passage of this legislation.

ACEP \n     strongly support this important effort to address the growing \n     crisis in access to acute care services for non-elderly \n     adults living with severe mental illness. As the nation's \n     largest emergency medicine organization, we believe your \n     legislation will provide needed attention and support to an \n     area inadequately addressed to date.\n       The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act will address an \n     important conflict in federal policy that has contributed to \n     restricted access to needed inpatient services--the Medicaid \n     Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Exclusion and the \n     Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA). EMTALA \n     requires hospitals to stabilize patients in an emergency \n     medical condition, while the IMD exclusion prevents certain \n     hospitals (psychiatric hospitals) from receiving Medicaid \n     reimbursement for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of \n     21-64 in these circumstances. Your bill will allow Medicaid \n     funding to be directed to non-publicly owned and operated \n     psychiatric hospitals (IMDs) for Medicaid beneficiaries \n     between those ages who require stabilization in these \n     settings as required by EMTALA.\n       We commend you and the many colleagues we hope will support \n     this important measure and we stand prepared to do what we \n     can to ensure its enactment.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                  Robert E.

This legislation, if approved by Congress, would \n     result in patients receiving appropriate care for psychiatric \n     emergencies instead of prolonged stays in emergency rooms.\n       We want to recognize your leadership in developing this \n     legislation, which provides a targeted and cost-effective \n     solution to the problem of overcrowding in emergency rooms \n     for all, but particularly for those with mental illness. The \n     measure has won bipartisan support from members of Congress \n     as well as the support of key national organizations for its \n     thoughtful approach.\n       Every day patients with serious mental illness are being \n     ``boarded'' in hospital emergency departments or transferred \n     to other hospitals by ambulance because of a lack of \n     appropriate care.\n       This bill will enable psychiatric hospitals to receive \n     reimbursement on the same basis as general hospitals for \n     Medicaid patients who are in a crisis and present a danger to \n     themselves or others. This will help general hospitals to \n     address part of their overflow issues and ensure that \n     patients receive appropriate treatment. It will resolve a \n     current conflict in federal law between the Emergency Medical \n     Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Medicaid Institution \n     for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion.\n       Passage of the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act is \n     an investment that will pay off in more appropriate care for \n     patients and more effective use of Medicaid dollars.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mark Covall,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Maine Hospital Association,\n\n                                       Augusta, ME, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the Maine Hospital \n     Association's 39 acute-care and specialty hospitals, I am \n     writing in support of your bill, the Medicaid Emergency \n     Psychiatric Care Act of 2005.\n       As you know, the Medicaid program, through the Institution \n     for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, prevents non-public \n     psychiatric hospitals from receiving Medicaid reimbursement \n     for Medicaid patients between the ages of 21-64 who require \n     stabilization. When the Federal Government created Medicaid \n     they prohibited Medicaid funding for services at IMDs because \n     Washington viewed mental health services to be the \n     responsibility of the State--particularly since at that time \n     most psychiatric hospitals were State-owned hospitals. The \n     Federal Government did provide funding through the DSH-IMD \n     (Disproportionate Share Hospital Fund for Institutes for \n     Mental Disease). Initially these funds were used solely by \n     the private IMDs, however, in 1991, Maine, in response to a \n     severe budget shortfall, began to shift costs associated with \n     Augusta Mental Health Institute (AMHI) and Bangor Mental \n     Health Institute (BMHI) into the Federal DSH-IMD pool rather \n     than funding those costs with all general fund dollars.\n       In the mid-1990s the State passed a rule that entitled AMHI \n     and BMHI to be paid first out of the DSH-IMD pool leaving the \n     remainder for the two private hospitals. With a declining \n     Federal cap on the DSH-IMD pool and increasing hospital \n     expenses, there was less and less money with which to \n     reimburse the two private psychiatric hospitals for services \n     provided to this indigent population.\n       Maine has two private psychiatric hospitals: Spring Harbor \n     Hospital in South Portland and The Acadia Hospital in Bangor. \n     For fiscal year 2005, Acadia had inpatient admissions of \n     1,731 and Spring Harbor had 3,208. Adults between the ages of \n     21 and 64 represented nearly 75 percent of all Spring Harbor \n     admissions in fiscal year 2005, up from 69% in 2004. In \n     addition, Spring Harbor estimates that in fiscal year 2006, \n     patients between the ages of 21 and 64 who cannot afford to \n     pay for their care at Spring Harbor will receive close to $6 \n     million in free hospital services. Both hospitals also \n     provide a significant amount of outpatient services.\n       The two private hospitals play a pivotal role in the \n     delivery of mental health services especially for low-income \n     individuals. As the State has desired to encourage greater \n     behavior services within communities, the Department of \n     Behavioral and Developmental Services worked with both of \n     these hospitals to increase the number of beds and services \n     available to allow for certain patients to be placed in these \n     hospitals rather than the State institutes. The inability of \n     these two hospitals to effectively meet these patient needs \n     would have a detrimental impact throughout the State \n     especially because communities are already stressed \n     attempting to develop needed community-based services.\n       Your legislation will allow non-public psychiatric \n     hospitals to receive appropriate reimbursement for Medicaid \n     beneficiaries between the ages of 21-64 who require emergency \n     treatment and stabilization as required by EMTALA. This will \n     relieve overcrowding in emergency departments and provide the \n     appropriate care these patients deserve in a more timely \n     manner.\n       Thank you for addressing this important issue. We support \n     the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act of 2005 and look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues to ensure \n     swift passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely, \n                                                Steven R.

Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: Writing as CEO on behalf of Spring \n     Harbor Hospital in Maine, and a past President of the \n     National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, I would \n     like to thank you for supporting legislation to enable \n     freestanding private psychiatric hospitals in the US to \n     receive payment for the emergency stabilization services they \n     provide each year to thousands of Medicaid-eligible adult \n     clients under the Emergency Medical Treatment And Labor Act \n     (EMTALA).\n       As you know, it is becoming increasingly difficult for \n     freestanding private psychiatric facilities to absorb the \n     cost of treating Medicaid-eligible adults between the ages of \n     21 and 64 who are referred to them for emergency \n     stabilization under EMTALA. At Spring Harbor alone, the cost \n     of serving this population last year was close to $6 million.\n       Faced with both diminishing reimbursement streams and a \n     concurrent rise in demand for inpatient stabilization \n     services from overflowing emergency rooms across the country, \n     private freestanding psychiatric facilities are quite \n     literally caught between a rock and a hard place. In Maine \n     and in many other places, freestanding private psychiatric \n     hospitals are protecting their financial health by offering \n     fewer and fewer adult psychiatric services in the inpatient \n     setting. This tactic simply skirts the issue and creates a \n     further void of services for individuals with acute mental \n     illness, precisely at a time when it is widely accepted that \n     the availability of mental health services in this country is \n     substandard.\n       When all is said and done, these financial figures pale in \n     comparison to the ultimate cost to our society when these \n     adults fail to receive the treatment they deserve. It has \n     been estimated that the lifetime cost of providing for an \n     individual with an untreated serious mental illness is $10 \n     million. Though this figure includes the financial impact of\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\n     lost work days and the cost of providing Social Security \n     disability benefits, it does not even begin to speak to the \n     emotional toll of mental illness on friends or the scars \n     mental illness can have on loved ones for generations to \n     come. If we could quantify these numbers adequately, I am \n     certain that I would not need to be writing to you today.\n       In closing, I would like to acknowledge the receptiveness \n     of your office and that of Senator Collins to issues \n     concerning the plight of the one in four adults and one in \n     ten children in the US who will experience a mental illness \n     this year. It is high time that the issues surrounding this \n     illness were addressed with understanding, compassion, and a \n     concern for our country's long-term mental health. I am both \n     pleased and proud that the Maine congressional delegation is \n     leading the way on these critical Issues.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Dennis P. King,\n         Chief Executive Officer, Past President (2003), National \n           Association of Psychiatric Health Systems.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Alliance\n\n\n                                for the Mentally Ill of Maine,\n\n                                       Augusta, ME, July 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the 1.400 members and 20 \n     affiliates of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of \n     Maine (NAMI Maine), I write to express support for your \n     legislation, the Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act of \n     2005. NAMI Maine strongly supports your effort to address the \n     growing crisis in access to acute care services for non-\n     elderly adults living with severe mental illness. NAMI \n     Maine's mission is to improve the quality of life of all \n     people affected by mental illness and in this regard, we see \n     this legislation as an attempt to address an important issue.\n       We know firsthand in Maine the dire consequences that occur \n     when access to psychiatric care is not available. Like the \n     rest of the country, Maine has dramatically reduced the \n     number of state run psychiatric beds. One of the most \n     appalling results of this has been the significant increase \n     in the numbers of people with mental illness who are living \n     in Maine's jails. A snapshot review of the Cumberland County \n     jail last spring showed that 60 percent of the inmates were \n     taking medication for mental health problems; a spring survey \n     of the Kennebec County jail had the same result. Sadly, most \n     of these people are in jail for non-violent crimes connected \n     to their illness and their inability to obtain services to \n     treat that illness. Maine is one of the states with the \n     highest rates in the nation of incarceration for people with \n     mental illness. Unfortunately, the outcomes for people with \n     mental illness who are jailed instead of treated are \n     abysmal--and the financial costs are also very high. It is \n     not unusual for a person in need of a psychiatric bed in \n     Maine t0 wait several days in the emergency room for a bed to \n     open. Despite these statistics, the recent state budget has \n     significantly reduced funding for mental health services. \n     This will result in a growing shortage of community mental \n     health services--placing additional stress on hospitals, \n     emergency rooms, and people with mental illness and their \n     families. The inadequate number of acute inpatient \n     psychiatric beds will continue to be a significant problem.\n       Tne Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Care Act will address an \n     important conflict in federal policy that has contributed to \n     restricted access to needed inpatient services--the Medicaid \n     Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Exclusion and the \n     Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act (EMTALA). EMTALA \n     requires hospitals to stabilize patients in an emergency \n     medical condition, while the IMD exclusion prevents certain \n     hospitals (psychiatric hospitals) from receiving Medicaid \n     reimbursement for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages of \n     21-64 in these circumstances.\n       This important measure will allow Medicaid funding to be \n     directed to non-publicly owned and operated psychiatric \n     hospitals (IMDs) for Medicaid beneficiaries between the ages \n     of 21-64 who require stabilization in these settings as \n     required by EMTALA. Today, these hospitals are denied payment \n     for care required under the EMTALA rules. The result is that \n     psychiatric hospitals are forced to absorb these added costs \n     of care to their already growing un-reimbursed care even \n     though these patients have insurance through Medicaid. \n     Sometimes it means that patients are discharged too soon, as \n     a cost savings measure, only to return them to their families \n     in a similar condition to when they were admitted.\n       This legislation will go a long way in addressing the \n     growing psychiatric acute inpatient crisis, while creating \n     fairness in the reimbursement structure for psychiatric \n     hospitals under the limited circumstances required by the \n     EMTALA law. Your leadership in carefully crafting and \n     introducing this targeted legislation addressing a critical \n     problem for persons with serious mental illness is much \n     appreciated. NAMI looks forward to working with you and your \n     Senate colleagues to ensure passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely, \n                                                  Carol Carothers,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1593. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenhance the access of Medicare beneficiaries who live in medically \nunderserved areas to critical primary and preventive health care \nbenefits at Federally qualified health centers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nPayment Adjustment To Community Health Centers, PATCH, Act of 2005. I \nam particularly pleased to introduce this bill with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman. Two years ago we introduced a more \ncomprehensive version of this legislation, S. 654. I am happy to report \nthat many of the provisions in S. 654 were included in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. The bill I am introducing today reflects two \nkey provisions which remain the priorities of our community health \ncenters.\n  This legislation will improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nprimary care services and preventive treatments by increasing access to \nCommunity Health Centers. Local, non-profit, commnnity-owned health \ncenters, also known as Federally Qualified Health Center, FCHQs, \nfurnish essential primary and preventive care services to low income \nand medically underserved communities. In many cases, community health \ncenters are the only source of primary and preventive services to which \nMedicare beneficiaries have access. This is especially true for people \nliving in America's medically underserved rural areas.\n  For nearly 40 years, the national network of health centers has \nprovided high-quality, affordable primary care and preventive services. \nCommunity health centers are located in areas where care is needed but \nscarce, and they improve access to care for millions of Americans \nregardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. Their costs of \ncare rank among the lowest, and they reduce the need for more expensive \nemergency, in-patient, and specialty care, saving billions for dollars \nfor taxpayers.\n  Community health centers are increasingly becoming important \nproviders of primary care and prevent1ve services to seniors--as well \nas providers of on-site dental, pharmaceu ical, and mental health \nservices. In short, community health centers provide the ease of ``one-\nstop health care shopping,'' meaning that seniors, instead of moving \nfrom location to location to receive comprehensive primary hearh \nservices, can usually receive all of their essential primary care in \none place.\n  The PATCH Act will ensure that community health centers can fully \nparticipate in the Medicare program and provide seniors with these \nvital services. Ensuring that Medicare pays its fair share is important \nto the stability of community health centers. While 17 percent of \nhealth center patients in Maine are Medicare beneficiaries, the \nMedicare program pays only 78 cents on the dollar for the health center \ncosts incurred in delivering comprehensive primary care services to \nthem. For health centers to remain a viable part of the health care \ndelivery system, we must make changes.\n  Over the last 15 years, Congress has made many improvements to the \nMedicare program through the addition of new primary and preventive \nbenefits, including screening mammograms, pap smears, colorectal and \nprostate cancer screenings, flu and pneumococcal vaccinations, bone \nmass measurement, and glucose monitoring and nutrition therapy for \ndiabetics. However, Congress has not updated the Medicare law to add \nthese crucial services to the health center reimbursement package, so \nhealth centers are denied payment for these services when provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries. This lack of reimbursement has caused \nsignificant losses for health centers every time they deliver these \nservices to Medicare patients. Our bill will add these essential \nservices to the health center package of benefits so that they can \nreceive payment for these services.\n  The Medicare law has also neglected to include health care for the \nhomeless grantees as Federal qualified health centers. The bill would \nalso restore these centers for recognition within the Medicare statute. \nOur legislation is strongly supported by the National Association of \nCommunity Health Centers, and I ask unanimous consent that their letter \nof support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\n  The PATCH Act makes these two technical and straightforward changes \nto the Medicare program to ensure that Community Health Centers can \nfully participate in Medicare and provide seniors with these vital \nprimary and preventive services. These changes are vitally important in \nmy state of Maine and also to health centers throughout our nation. By \nmaking these two straightforward changes, we will be able to enhance \nthe care that all Medicare beneficiaries receive, especially those \nliving in rural and medically underserved communities. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               Community Health Centers, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Community Health Centers (NACHC), I am writing to express \n     our support for your bill, the Medicare Payment Adjustment to \n     Community Health Centers (PATCH) Act of 2005. We sincerely \n     appreciate your continued commitment to improve the Medicare \n     program for all health centers.\n       Community health centers are local, non-profit, community-\n     oriented health care providers serving low income and \n     medically underserved communities. For nearly 40 years, the \n     national network of health centers has provided high-quality, \n     affordable primary care and preventive services, and often \n     provide on-site dental, pharmaceutical, mental health and \n     substance abuse services. America's health centers provide \n     care to nearly one million Medicare beneficiaries; furnishing \n     essential primary and preventive care services in underserved \n     areas of the country. Health centers provide ``one-stop \n     health care,'' allowing seniors to receive all of their \n     essential primary care in one convenient location.\n       Over the last 15 years, Congress has made many improvements \n     to the Medicare program through the addition of new primary \n     and preventive benefits, including: screening mammograms, pap \n     smears, colorectal & prostate cancer screenings, flu/\n     pneumococcal vaccinations, glucose monitoring and self \n     management training for diabetics, bone mass measurement, and \n     medical nutrition therapy for diabetics. Unfortunately, \n     Congress did not update the Medicare law to add these vital \n     services to the health center reimbursement package, thus \n     denying health centers payment for these services when \n     provided to Medicare beneficiaries. This lack of \n     reimbursement has caused significant losses for health \n     centers every time they deliver these services to Medicare \n     patients, even though it was the clear intent of Congress to \n     cover these services for all beneficiaries.\n       Health Centers are pleased that your bill remedies this \n     issue by updating the Medicare law to add these essential \n     services to the health center package of benefits. We \n     strongly believe that this will allow health centers to build \n     on their record of providing quality care to seniors.\n       We also are appreciative that your legislation would \n     correct a long-standing oversight relating to Health Care for \n     the Homeless grantees. Your legislation would ensure that the \n     original intent of Congress was reflected in the law.\n       Thank you for your leadership in addressing these critical \n     issues and we stand ready to assist you in your efforts to \n     enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Daniel R. Hawkins, Jr.\n\n                                Vice President for Federal, State,\n                                               and Public Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 1594. A bill to require financial services providers to maintain \ncustomer information security systems and to notify customers of \nunauthorized access to personal information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, identity theft is a serious and growing \nconcern facing our Nation's consumers. According to the Federal Trade \nCommission, nearly 10 million Americans were the victims of identity \ntheft in 2003, which represents a tripling of the number of victims \nfrom just 3 years earlier. Research shows that there are more than 13 \nidentity thefts every minute.\n  According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, identity theft \nvictims spend on average nearly 600 hours recovering from the crime. \nAdditional research indicates the costs of lost wages and income as a \nresult of the crime can soar as high as $16,000 per incident. No one \nwants to suffer this kind of hardship.\n  Technological innovation has delivered tremendous benefits to our \neconomy in the form of increased efficiency, expanded access, and lower \ncosts. And it has spurred the creation of an entire industry of data \ncollectors and brokers who profit from the packaging and \ncommoditization of one's personal and financial information. But, \nregrettably, this technology has also provided identity thieves with an \nattractive target, and relative anonymity, with which to ply their \nsinister trade.\n  While many sectors of our economy are affected, financial \ninstitutions face a particularly difficult challenge. By definition, \nthe information they use to conduct their daily business is sensitive, \nbecause it is tied so closely to their customers' finances. A breach of \nthis data has the potential to cause large and damaging losses in a \nvery short amount of time.\n  Events over the past several months have further served to highlight \nhow serious this risk has become. The announcement not long ago by \nCitigroup that a box of computer tapes containing information on 3.9 \nmillion customers was lost by United Parcel Service in my own state of \nNew Jersey while in transit to a credit reporting agency is the latest \nin a line of recent, high profile incidents. In fact, I myself was a \nvictim of a similar loss of computer tapes by Bank of America earlier \nthis year.\n  In both of these cases, Citigroup and Bank of America acted \nresponsibly and notified possible victims in a prompt and timely \nmanner. But this is not always the case. And both of these cases \ninvolved accidental loss--not even active attempts to steal personal \nfinancial information.\n  At the very least consumers deserve to be made aware when their \npersonal information has been compromised. Right now, they must hope \nthat the laws of a few individual states, such as California, apply to \ntheir case, or that victimized institutions will act responsibly on \ntheir own.\n  In the event that an information breach does occur, the legislation I \nam introducing today, the ``Financial Privacy Protection Act of 2005,'' \nwould require prompt notification of all victims in all cases, subject, \nof course, to the concerns of law enforcement agencies. Based on this \nnotification, victims could then take immediate action to include an \nextended fraud alert in their credit files to minimize the damage done.\n  But on top of notification, customers need to know that if they trust \na bank with their sensitive personal information--which they must do in \norder to engage in a financial transaction--that that bank will be \ndoing everything in its power to protect their information.\n  For that purpose, the ``Financial Privacy Protection Act of 2005'' \nwould also direct financial regulators, in concert with the Federal \nTrade Commission, to establish strong and meaningful standards for the \nprotection of information maintained by financial institutions on \nbehalf of their customers. Because these measures are so important, the \nchief executive officer or the chief compliance officer of every \ninstitution must personally attest as to the effectiveness of these \nsafeguards.\n  It is imperative that we take action to combat the growing threat of \nidentity theft. This crime harms individuals and families, and drags \ndown our economy in the form of lost productivity and capital. We can \ndo more and we must do more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to award posthumously a Congressional gold medal to \nConstantino Brumidi; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a special pleasure for me, as an \nItalian American to introduce legislation to the Senate that will mark \nthe 200th anniversary of the birth of Constantino Brumidi.\n  As I introduce this legislation, I do so to recognize not only \nConstantino Brumidi, but all those who have come to our shores to \npursue a dream and share in the blessings of liberty and freedom that \nis our birthright as American citizens.\n  For Constantino Brumidi, there was no higher honor or greater calling \nthan to be an American citizen. It was a title he sought and then \nsigned with pride on some of his best work.\n  That experience is by no means unique to Constantino Brumidi. The \nsame call that he heard to come to America continues to be heard every \nday as more and more people from all over the world come to the United \nStates in the pursuit of a dream and the freedom that marks our way of \nlife.\n  For my own family, it wasn't all that long after Constantino Brumidi \nleft for America that my own ancestors heard the call for freedom and \ncame here as well. Just like Constantino Brumidi they left the beauty \nof Italy--its mountains and its sunny shores--to come and be a part of \nthe great adventure that is the United States.\n  That is my background, and when I came to Washington to serve in the \nSenate, I found a renewed sense of purpose and inspiration every time I \nwalked through the corridors of the Capitol Building and saw \nConstantino Brumidi's artwork so prominently and proudly displayed. \nThis is a special place and if you walk through these halls late at \nnight you can almost hear the whispers of the past and the hushed \nechoes of the voices of our Founding Fathers and past Senators and \nRepresentatives as they debated and discussed the issues of the day. \nStatuary Hall, home to so many of our Nation's heroes particularly \ndraws you near as the Chamber's historical record calls to mind the \nlegends of our past--Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Adams and \nFranklin.\n  That is when it hits you--that the story of the United States isn't a \nrandom series of events, but the result of the vision and heartfelt \ncommitment of those who played an active role in our history. As an \nItalian American it gives me a great sense of pride to know that one of \nthose great Americans was Constantino Brumidi.\n  The history books tell us that Constantino Brumidi was born in Rome \nof Italian and Greek heritage. He had a great talent for painting that \nrevealed itself at an early age, and it was already beginning to earn \nhim a reputation as one of Europe's great artists when he heard a \ndifferent call--a call to make beautiful the home of democracy and \nliberty--the United States of America.\n  One day, after completing a commission, Constantino Brumidi stopped \nin Washington, DC, to visit the Capitol on his way home. Looking at its \ntall, blank walls and empty corridors, he must have felt the excitement \nand inspiration only an artist facing an empty canvas can know. On that \nday he began what was more than an assignment for him--it was a labor \nof love--as he brought to life the great moments in American history \nfor all to see on the walls and ceiling of this great building. His \nefforts were destined to earn him the title of America's Michelangelo.\n  There aren't many quotes that are attributed to Constantino Brumidi, \nbut one that appears on the marker where he is buried is a beautiful \nexpression of his love for our country:\n  ``My one ambition and my daily prayer is that I may live long enough \nto make beautiful the Capitol of the one country on earth in which \nthere is liberty.''\n  That is the philosophy that guided Constantino Brumidi's hand as it \nfired his imagination and inspired his creations in the Capitol. \nImagine what he would think if he could walk these corridors today. He \nwould see that his beautiful work has stood the test of time and gained \nthe appreciation and admiration of countless visitors to our shores and \nour Capitol Building. He would see that it continues to thrill the \nmillions who flock here every year. I believe he would be both proud \nand\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\nhumbled to be the center of such attention.\n  It is only fitting that over the years Constantino Brumidi has become \na symbol of all those who came to the United States in pursuit of a \ndream that we all too often take for granted. It was freedom and \nliberty that drew Constantino Brumidi to our land and it is what \ncontinues to draw us together, American, Italian, Greek, Irish and \nevery other nationality you can name to make this world a better place \nfor us all to live.\n  Throughout the Capitol, each carefully planned stroke of Brumidi's \nbrush will continue to remind us that we are blessed and truly \nfortunate to live in a land of promise and opportunity where we are all \ncalled to greatness. Constantino Brumidi dared to be great and he will \nbe forever remembered for the gifts and talents he shared with us.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will ensure that the legacy he \nleft us all as Americans is never forgotten. Constantino Brumidi wanted \none thing--to be forever remembered as an Artist Citizen of the United \nStates--the home of liberty that he loved. We must all ensure his story \ncontinues to be told so that it may continue to serve as a source of \ninspiration and encouragement to all those who come to our shores that \nany one of them can make a difference in the world by making the most \nof the opportunities that are available to them here in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Smith, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1598. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a nonrefundable tax credit against income tax for individuals who \npurchase a residential safe storage device for the safe storage of \nfirearms; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to speak very \nbriefly on another topic. I am an unqualified supporter of the \n``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,'' on which we will be \nvoting later today.\n  My colleague, Senator Craig, should be commended for his hard work on \nthis important legislation, which will protect gun manufacturers and \ndistributors from unwarranted lawsuits.\n  While we must always be vigilant in protecting our rights--including \nour Second Amendment rights--it is also critical that we encourage \nresponsible exercise of those rights. For that reason, I want to say a \nfew words in support of the ``Child Protection and Home Safety Act of \n2005,'' which I am introducing today. This Act would promote the safe \nstorage of firearms by providing a 25 percent tax credit toward the \npurchase of a gun safe, up to a maximum of $250. I am pleased that my \ncolleagues, Senators Schumer, Craig, Burns, Lincoln, and Smith, are \ncosponsoring this important bipartisan legislation. Our bill will \nencourage gun owners to purchase gun safes for the safe storage of \nfirearms, thereby preventing the mishandling of guns and keeping our \nfamilies and communities safer.\n  This bill has widespread support from numerous national \norganizations, including the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the American Association of Suicidology, the American \nEthical Union, the National Black Police Officers Association, and \nSAVE, the Suicide Awareness Voice of Education. In my home State of \nUtah, law enforcement has given this bill unqualified support. In \naddition to the Utah Sheriff's Association and the Utah Police Corps, \nthe Utah Highway Patrol Association has enthusiastically endorsed this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to include a copy of \ntheir letter of support in the Record.\n  Many of the guns used in violent acts are acquired on the black \nmarket, having been stolen from the homes of law abiding Americans. \nNearly 10 percent of state prison inmates incarcerated on gun crimes \nsay the weapons they used were stolen. Safely securing a firearm within \na person's home is a fundamental way to help ensure that firearms do \nnot fall into the wrong hands. One important step that can be taken in \nthis regard is for families to lock firearms within a theft-resistant \nsafe. This bill, by encouraging the purchase and use of gun safes, will \nsignificantly reduce the rate of stolen guns, thereby reducing the \nincidents of homicides and violent crimes.\n\n  Another problem plaguing America today is that of children gaining \naccess to their parents' firearms and using those firearms to commit \nhomicide or suicide. The school shootings in Columbine, Santee, Lake \nWorth, Florida, Fort Gibson, Oklahoma and Deming, New Mexico, are a sad \nlegacy we hope to leave far behind us. It is the responsibility of gun \nowners to ensure that our children cannot gain access to firearms and \nunintentionally or intentionally use those firearms to harm themselves \nor someone else. This bill, by encouraging gun owners to lock up their \nfirearms in gun safes, will make it more difficult for children to \naccess their parents' guns.\n  Utah is home to several fine manufacturers of gun safes. The \nemployees at companies such as Liberty, Fort Knox, and others know that \nwhile there are many ways to attempt to secure a firearm, gun safes are \nthe best way to reliably secure firearms and keep them out of the hands \nof those who should not have access to them. Other methods of securing \nfirearms may only give the purchaser a false sense of security.\n  Trigger locks do not prevent loading and can easily be opened by a \nchild with a screwdriver. Cable locks can easily be cut open with a \nsimple wire-cutter. Locked case boxes are small and light and can \neasily be picked up and carried away by a thief.\n  Quality gun safes can provide the security our children and our \ncommunities deserve. And through the vehicle of a tax credit, this bill \nencourages gun safety while preserving Second Amendment liberties.\n  I want to thank everyone who has worked with us to craft this bill. \nBy encouraging gun owners to purchase residential gun safes for the \nsafe storage of firearms we move a little bit closer to creating a \nsafer America.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support the ``Child \nProtection and Home Safety Act of 2005,'' and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill and the letter to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Protection and Home \n     Safety Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Utah Chiefs of Police Association \n     enthusiastically endorses legislation which would provide a \n     25% tax credit toward the purchase of a gun safe, up to a \n     maximum of $250.\n       This legislation would encourage gun owners to purchase gun \n     safes for the safe storage of firearms. An increase in the \n     use of gun safes will help prevent the theft of firearms, \n     reducing incidents of suicide, homicide and violent crimes.\n       Senator Hatch, we urge you to introduce this legislation in \n     the Senate, support it and use your best efforts to see that \n     it gets passed. The passage of this vital legislation will \n     prevent the mishandling of guns and keep our families and \n     communities safer.\n       Thank you in advance for all your work and your support of \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Chief Ed Rhoades,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                Utah Chiefs of Police Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1599. A bill to repeal the perimeter rule for Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nEnsign and Kyl in introducing the Abolishing Aviation Barriers Act of \n2005. This bill would remove the arbitrary restrictions that prevent \nAmericans from having an array of options for nonstop air travel \nbetween airports in western States and LaGuardia International Airport \n``LaGuardia'', and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, \n``Washington National''.\n  LaGuardia restricts the departure or arrival of nonstop flights to or \nfrom airports that are farther than 1,500 miles from LaGuardia. \nWashington National has a similar restriction for nonstop flights to or \nfrom airports 1,250 miles from Washington National. These restrictions \nare commonly referred to as the ``perimeter rule.'' This bill would \nabolish these archaic limitations that reduce consumers' options for \nconvenient flights and competitive fares.\n  The original purpose of the perimeter rule was to promote LaGuardia \nand Washington National as airports for business travelers flying to \nand from East Coast and Midwest cities and to promote traffic to other \nairports by diverting long haul flights to Newark and Kennedy airports \nin the New York area and the Dulles airport in the Washington area. \nHowever, over the years, Congress has rightly granted numerous \nexceptions to the perimeter rule because the air traveling public is \neager for travel options. Today, there are nonstop flights between \nLaGuardia and Denver and between Washington National and Denver, Las \nVegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Seattle. Rather than \ncontinuing to take a piecemeal approach to promoting consumer choice, I \nurge Congress to take this opportunity once and for all to do away with \nthis outdated rule.\n  As many in this body know, I have been fighting against the perimeter \nrule for years. I continue to believe that Americans should have access \nto air travel at the lowest possible cost and with the most convenience \nfor their schedule. Therefore, I have always advocated for the removal \nof any artificial barrier that prevents free market competition. Last I \nco-sponsored legislation to repeal the ``Wright Amendment'' which \nprohibits flights from Dallas'' Love Field airport to 43 States. This \nweek I am proud to come together with colleagues once again to \neliminate another unnecessary restraint through the Abolishing Aviation \nBarriers Act of 2005.\n  Some opponents, mainly those with parochial interests, have \ncriticized me over the years for my efforts to remove the perimeter \nrule for Washington National, particularly because such removal would \nallow flights between Phoenix and Tucson and Washington National. Due \nto such criticism, I made a pledge in 1998 that I would not take such \nflights if they were made available. Shortly thereafter, the Federal \nAviation Administration granted an exemption for two nonstop flights \nper day between Washington National and Phoenix. I have never taken \nthese flights. Instead I have routinely used connecting flights or \nflown out of Dulles International Airport. Being a frequent flier and \nhaving flown from both Dulles and Kennedy in the past few months, I can \nassure my colleagues, that both airports have enormous business and no \nlonger need to be ``fed'' long haul traffic to promote airport usage.\n  In fact, a 1999 study by the Transportation Research Board stated \nthat perimeter rules ``no longer serve their original purpose and have \nproduced too many adverse side effects, including barriers to \ncompetition . . . The rules arbitrarily prevent some airlines from \nextending their networks to these airports; they discourage competition \namong the airports in the region and among the airlines that use these \nairports; and they are subject to chronic attempts by special interest \ngroups to obtain exemptions.''\n  That same year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, stated \nthat the ``practical effect'' of the perimeter rule ``has been to limit \nentry'' of other carriers. The GAO found that airfares at LaGuardia and \nWashington National are approximately 50 percent higher on average than \nfares at similar airports unconstrained by the perimeter rule. Such an \nanticompetitive rule should not remain in effect, particularly where \nits anticompetitive impact has long been recognized. For this reason, I \nwill continue the struggle to try to remove the perimeter rule and \nother anticompetitive restrictions that increase consumer costs and \ndecrease convenience for no apparent benefit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure \nfull access to digital television in areas served by low-power \ntelevision, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have the support of many of my colleagues \non the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to \nintroduce legislation to help rural America transition to an age of \ndigital television. Television is an important media outlet for local \nnews, weather and information. Years ago, it was decided that the \nUnited States should transition to a higher standard of television \nservice. Digital television is much more than simply a sharper picture; \nit allows for an increase in the number of channels, more efficient use \nof spectrum and many new features for consumers. As the Senate \nconsiders broader digital television transition legislation, it is \nimportant not to leave rural America behind.\n  The bill I introduce today is aimed to assist translator stations and \nlow power analog stations. Translator stations are small stations that \nrepeat a signal from full power stations so that the signal may be \nreached in remote areas. Low power analog TV stations are television \nstations that typically serve smaller, rural communities. While \ntranslators and low power analog TV stations are located in many parts \nof the country, most are concentrated in rural areas, including many \nparts of Maine.\n  There has been a long time understanding that low power stations \nwould not be a part of the full power digital television transition. \nThis understanding, however, does not mean that Congress can simply \nlook away. We must ensure that low power stations have the necessary \ntime and adequate funds to move into the digital age. The Digital Low \nPower Television Transition Act aims to address these needs.\n  First, the bill I am introducing today puts a deadline for the low \npower digital televison transition four years out from whatever the \nhard date is that Congress ultimately decides for the full power \ndigital television transition. Full power stations have had years to \ntransition to digital. Low power stations have yet to even receive \ntheir digital allocations, and therefore need additional time to \nupgrade equipment. This delay will also allow consumers in rural areas \nto continue to use analog television sets to receive over-the-air \nsignals until digital television equipment becomes more prevalent in \nsmall town consumer electronics stores.\n  Second, the Digital Translator and Low Power Television Transition \nbill establishes a grant program within the National Telecommunications \nand Information Agency, NTIA, to help defray the cost of upgrading \ntranslators and low power television stations from analog to digital. \nThis money for the grant program would come from a trust fund set up \nwith proceeds of the spectrum auctions that will take place because of \nthe full power digital television transition. The Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, estimates that approximately $100 \nmillion will be needed for the 4474 translators and 2071 low power \nanalog and to upgrade. The trust fund's size reflects the FCC's \nestimate.\n  The goal of this Act is to assist the rural, low power stations \nwithout interrupting the greater digital televison transition. Because \nof the secondary status of translators and low power stations, the \nauction of full power analog spectrum will remain unaffected. These \nstations do play an important role in rural communities, therefore this \nbill calls upon the FCC to report to Congress on the status of \ntranslators and low power analog.\n  This bill is not meant to be a comprehensive approach to the digital \ntelevision transition. It is merely a solution to one of the many \nquestions Congress will face this Congress. Rural America deserves the \nsame benefits that digital televison will bring that will be available \nin urban areas. This Act gives translators, low power analog and Class \nA stations the assistance they need to smoothly transition to digital.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Bayh, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1602. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act require \nStates to disregard benefits paid under long-term care insurance for \npurposes of determining medicaid eligibility, to expand long-term care \ninsurance partnerships between States and insurers, to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow individuals a deduction for \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums, the use of such insurance \nunder cafeteria plans and flexible spending arrangements, and a credit \nfor individuals with long-term care needs, to establish home and \ncommunity based services as an optional medicaid benefit, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Bayh and Senator Clinton in introducing the Improving Long-term \nCare Choices Act. This legislation sets forth a series of proposals \naimed at improving the accessibility of long-term care insurance and \npromoting awareness about the protection that long-term care insurance \ncan offer. It also seeks to broaden the availability of the types of \nlong-term care services such as home- and community-based care, which \nmany folks prefer to institutional care.\n  Before I begin my discussion of the merits of the legislation that I \nam introducing today, I want to take this opportunity to once again \nemphasize my commitment to enacting the Family Opportunity Act. I have \nworked to get the Family Opportunity Act enacted for many years now.\n  I have been motivated to work so hard because I have been deeply \nmoved by a number of stories from families, both from my State of Iowa \nand elsewhere, who have had to turn down promotions, or even put their \nchild with a disability up for adoption in order to secure for these \nchildren the medical services they so desperately need.\n  The Family Opportunity Act would provide a State option to allow \nfamilies with disabled children to ``buy in'' to the Medicaid program; \nestablish mental health parity in Medicaid Home and Community Based \nWaiver programs; establish Family to Family Health Information Centers \nand restore Medicaid eligibility for certain SSI beneficiaries.\n  As part of the on-going negotiations relative to the FOA, many \nstakeholders have agreed that a modification of a feature of the \nPresident's New Freedom Initiative, a demonstration program known as \n``Money Follows the Person'' should be enacted along with the FOA. \nMoney Follows the Person allows the Secretary to provide grants to \nstates to increase the use of home and community based care and \nprovides States a financial incentive for the first year to do so.\n  I want stakeholders in the disability community as well as the many \norganizations who support the Family Opportunity Act to understand that \nthe legislation I am introducing today compliments rather than \nsupplants my efforts to enact FOA and Money Follows the Person. I \nbelieve that we should provide a wide array of options to the states to \nencourage them to identify and eliminate barriers to community living \nincluding access to consumer direction and respite care.\n  Long-term care services can be prohibitively expensive. Just one year \nin a nursing home can cost well over $50,000. In many cases, \nindividuals deplete their savings and resources paying for long-term \nand ultimately qualify for Medicaid coverage. Right now, Medicaid pays \nfor the bulk of long-term care services in this country. In 2002 alone, \nwe spent nearly $93 billion on long-term care services under Medicaid. \nWith our aging population, one thing is clear: spending will only \nincrease.\n\n  When most people think about purchasing long-term care insurance, \nthey think, ``that's something I can put off until tomorrow.'' We need \nto change the perception because the older you are when you first buy \ncoverage, the more expensive the premiums are.\n  Our legislation calls for the Secretary to educate folks about the \nprotection that long-term care insurance can offer. We envision people \nhaving the opportunity to compare policies available in their States. \nAmong other means, this could be accomplished\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\nthrough an internet website for example.\n  Making people aware of long-term care insurance won't go very far \nthough, unless we make some other changes to enhance the value and \nprotection that long-term care insurance can bring. Our bill takes \nseveral steps in this regard.\n  First, the legislation would require that States disregard benefits \npaid under a long-term care insurance policy when determining \neligibility for Medicaid. Second, it incorporates a series of consumer \nprotections recommended by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioner, NAIC, into the definition of `qualified long-term care \nservices.' Individuals who purchase a policy that have these consumer \nprotections will be eligible for an above the line tax deduction and a \ntax credit for out-of-pocket expenses made by caregivers. Third, the \nbill would expand the long-term care partnership program, which \ncurrently operates as a demonstration in four states. The long-term \ncare partnerships combine private long-term care insurance with \nMedicaid coverage once individuals exhaust their insurance benefits. \nSeveral States would like to pursue their own long-term care \npartnerships and this legislation will enable them to do that.\n  The Improving Long-term Care Choices Act also builds on the \nPresident's New Freedom Initiative by taking further steps toward \nremoving the ``institutional bias'' in Medicaid, giving States the \noption of providing home- and community-based services as part of their \nState Medicaid Plan.\n  In doing so, the bill gives States the flexibility to design long-\nterm care benefits that will reduce the reliance on costly \ninstitutional settings and meet the needs of elderly and disabled \nindividuals who overwhelmingly wish to remain in their homes and \ncommunities.\n  In his New Freedom Initiative announced shortly after taking office, \nPresident George W. Bush outlined a plan to tear down barriers \npreventing people with disabilities from fully participating in \nAmerican society.\n  The President also endorses the idea of shifting Medicaid's delivery \nsystem towards one that promotes cost-effective, community-based care \ninstead of one weighted so heavily towards institutional settings.\n  This legislation also challenges us to think beyond funding and \nprogram silos and directs the Secretary to address administrative \nbarriers that impede the integration of acute and long-term care \nservices. The Secretary also must develop recommendations for statutory \nchanges that will make it easier for States to offer better coordinated \nacute and long-term care services.\n  The Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act is consistent with our \nideals about families, individual choices in health care and financial \nresponsibility. This bill aims high. But it is sorely evident that we \nneed to think creatively and comprehensively, even boldly, if we hope \nto make the type of inroads in promoting the availability of good long-\nterm care insurance policies and in rebalancing the institutional bias \nin long-term care services that no longer reflects the needs and \npreferences of many stakeholders.\n  The Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act is a good bill. The American \nNetwork of Community Options and Resources, the Arc & United Cerebral \nPalsy Disability Policy Collaboration, and the National Disability \nRights Network, the United Spinal Association, and the Association of \nUniversity Centers on Disabilities support the bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the \nlegislation and letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act--Summary\n\n\n         TITLE I: LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS\n\n     Subtitle A\n       Section 101: State Medicaid Plan requirements regarding \n           Medicaid eligibility determination, long-term care \n           insurance reciprocity, and consumer education\n       Requires each state in its Medicaid plan to exclude \n     benefits, including assigned benefits, paid under a \n     qualified-long term care policy in determining income for \n     purposes of determining eligibility for medical assistance.\n       Requires that states with a long-term care insurance \n     partnership program to meet requirements for reciprocity to \n     with other long-term care insurance partnership states. \n     Reciprocity rules to be developed as specified in section \n     103.\n       Requires the Secretary to educate consumers on the \n     advisability of obtaining long-term care insurance that meets \n     federal standards and the potential interaction between \n     coverage under a policy and federal and state health \n     insurance programs.\n       Section 102: Additional consumer protections for long-term \n           care insurance\n       Establishes additional consumer protections with respect to \n     long-term care insurance policies based on the October 2000 \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model \n     regulations including non-cancellability, prohibitions on \n     limitations and exclusions, extension of benefits, \n     continuation of conversion coverage, discontinuance and \n     replacement, prohibitions on post-claim underwriting, \n     inflation protection, and prohibitions on pre-existing \n     condition and probationary periods in replacement policies or \n     certificates.\n       Issuers of long-term care insurance policies must also \n     comply with NAIC model provisions related to disclosure of \n     rating practices, application forms and replacement coverage, \n     reporting, filing requirements for marketing, suitability, \n     standard format outline of coverage, and delivery of \n     shopper's guide.\n       Issuers must comply with model act policies related to \n     right to return, outline of coverage, certificates under \n     group plans, monthly reports on accelerated death benefits, \n     and incontestability period.\n       Applies to policies issued more than 1 year after \n     enactment.\n       Section 103: Expansion of State Long-term Care Partnerships\n       Permits the expansion of long-term care partnership \n     insurance policies to all states.\n       Requires all new partnership policies to be ``qualified \n     long-term care insurance policies'' defined as a policy that: \n     (1) disregards any assets or resources in the amount equal \n     payments made under the policy; (2) requires the holder, upon \n     the policy's effective date, to reside in the state or a \n     state with a qualified long-term care partnership; (3) \n     includes the consumer protections specified in 7702B of the \n     tax code as amended by Section 102 (additional consumer \n     protections); (4) requires compound inflation protection; and \n     (5) requires that any agent selling such policies receive \n     training and demonstrate knowledge of such policies,\n       Medicaid asset protection would apply in an equal amount to \n     the insurance benefit paid under the policy, referred to as a \n     dollar-for-dollar model.

LTC tax credit would be phased-in over 4 years as \n     follows: $1000 in 2005, $1500 in 2006, $2000 in 2007, $2500 \n     in 2008, and $3000 in 2009 or thereafter. The credit phases \n     out by $100 for each $1000 (or fraction thereof) by which the \n     taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the \n     threshold amount set at $150,000 for a joint return and \n     $75,000 for an individual return.\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\n       Section 123: Treatment of exchanges of long-term care \n           insurance contracts\n       Includes a waiver of limitations, allowing individuals to \n     make claims if there are changes to law.\n\n\n TITLE II: MEDICAID HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES OPTIONAL BENEFIT\n\n       Section 201: Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services \n           Optional Benefit\n       Provides states with a new option to offer home and \n     community-based services to Medicaid-eligible individuals \n     without obtaining a federal waiver. Under this option states \n     may include one or more home and community-based services \n     currently available under existing waiver authority. States \n     would also be permitted to allow individuals to choose to \n     self-direct services. Under this option, states must \n     establish a more stringent eligibility standard for placement \n     of individuals in institutions, than for placement in a home \n     and community-based setting. States would be permitted to \n     offer a limited benefit consisting of home and community-\n     based services only, to certain populations not otherwise \n     eligible for Medicaid, but not to exceed individuals whose \n     income exceeds 300% of SSI income and resource standards. At \n     states option, provides presumptive eligibility for aged, \n     blind and disabled for home and community-based services. If \n     enrollment under the state plan exceeds state projections, \n     the state would be permitted to change eligibility standards \n     to limit enrollment for new applicants, while grandfathering \n     those individuals already receiving services.\n\n\n  TITLE III: INTEGRATED ACUTE AND LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES FOR DUALLY \n                          ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS\n\n       Section 301: Removal of barriers to integrated acute and \n           long-term care services for dually eligible individuals\n       Directs the Secretary, in collaboration with directors of \n     State Medicaid programs, health care issuers, managed care \n     plans, and others to issue regulations removing \n     administrative barriers that impede the offering of \n     integrated acute, home and community-based, nursing facility, \n     and mental health services, and to the extent consistent with \n     the enrollee's coverage for such services under Part D, \n     prescription drugs. The Secretary also must submit \n     recommendations to address legislative barriers to offering \n     integrated services. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n     (MedPAC) will comment on the Secretary's recommendations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Network of Community\n\n\n                                        Options and Resources,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Bayh: On behalf of the American \n     Network of Community Options and Resources (ANCOR)--the \n     national association representing more than 850 private \n     providers of supports and services to more than 380,000 \n     people with significant disabilities--we extend our \n     appreciation and offer our support in the introduction today \n     of your ``Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act of 2005.''\n       It is especially noteworthy that you introduced this bill \n     on the eve of Medicaid's 40th anniversary. Medicaid has \n     worked for millions of people with disabilities, improving \n     their lives over the past four decades. However, Medicaid can \n     and should do better on behalf of the 8 million individuals \n     with disabilities that depend daily upon this program for \n     their health services and long-term supports. This is a \n     propitious moment to send a message to the nation--people \n     with disabilities can count on Medicaid. It makes clear to \n     all that Congress intends to maintain its commitment for a \n     strong federal role in enhancing the lives of people with \n     disabilities.\n       People with disabilities, their families, and providers \n     have for years called for the removal of Medicaid's \n     institutional bias. ANCOR provided testimony in. September of \n     2001 in conjunction with the President's New Freedom \n     Initiative that the Congress must change the structure of \n     Medicaid to include state plan home and community-based \n     services. Your bill builds upon the President's initiative, \n     the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, and ANCOR's commitment \n     to community integration.\n       In addition to helping millions of people of all ages who \n     depend upon Medicaid for long-term supports, your legislation \n     will assist millions of moderate-income Americans to address \n     their future long-term needs. By encouraging reliable long-\n     term care insurance and tax incentives to defray costs for \n     long-term needs, your bill begins the important process to \n     adopt a national comprehensive long-term care policy. This \n     step is critical as the nation stands on the precipice of the \n     fast approaching ``sleeping giant''--the retirement of the \n     baby boom generation and shift in demographics. In this way, \n     the bill will help reduce the financial pressures on Medicaid \n     and our nation's reliance on it as the only public long-term \n     care program.\n       ANCOR is pleased and proud to offer its support to you on \n     this momentous day and to pledge our help in making the \n     ``Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act of 2005'' a reality \n     this session. We are grateful for your leadership and ongoing \n     commitment to people with disabilities and those who provide \n     them with daily supports.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Suellen R.

Charles Grassley,\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Bayh: The Arc of the \n     United States and United Cerebral Palsy strongly support your \n     introduction of the Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act. The \n     Arc is the national organization of and for people with \n     mental retardation and related developmental disabilities and \n     their families. United Cerebral Palsy is a nationwide network \n     of organizations providing advocacy and direct services to \n     people with disabilities and their families.\n       The creation of a Medicaid home and community-based \n     services optional benefit is an important improvement in the \n     federal/state Medicaid program and one for which we have \n     advocated for many years. We believe that the addition of \n     this benefit as an option for states will make it easier for \n     states to serve people with severe disabilities where they \n     want to be served--in their own home communities, rather than \n     in institutions or other facilities. This will increase \n     opportunities for improved quality of life for many children \n     and adults with severe disabilities and their families.\n       We applaud your efforts and are grateful for your \n     leadership in introducing this important legislation and \n     pledge to work with you to secure its passage and enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul Marchand,\n\n                                                   Staff Director,\n     Disability Policy Collaboration.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Disability\n\n\n                                               Rights Network,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: The National Disability Rights \n     Network (NDRN) is the nonprofit membership organization for \n     the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P) Systems \n     and the Client Assistance Programs (CAP) for individuals with \n     disabilities. Through training and technical assistance, \n     legal support, and legislative advocacy, NDRN works to create \n     a society in which children and adults with all types of \n     disabilities are afforded equality of opportunity and are \n     able to fully participate by exercising choice and self-\n     determination.\n       NDRN strongly supports your introduction of the Improving \n     Long Term Care Choices Act of 2005. One of the major goals of \n     the P/CAP network is for all individuals with disabilities \n     to live in their own communities--independently, with their \n     families, or with other individuals of their choice. Your \n     determination in bringing forward this bill--with the \n     critical component of establishing home and community-based \n     services and supports as a optional Medicaid benefit, instead \n     of only available through a waiver--is a major step in the \n     right direction.\n       NDRN and the entire P/CAP network look forward to the day \n     when community-based supports and services for children and \n     adults with disabilities are the norm and institutional \n     services are non-existent or require a waiver.\n       We believe that this bill also is very important because it \n     will shine a light on the need for a true long-term care \n     system in our nation. While long-term care insurance is not \n     the answer for everyone, it can be useful--if affordable and \n     if it covers people for a long enough span of time; The \n     availability of long-term care insurance also could help to \n     take the pressure off of the Medicaid program.\n       Thank you again for your continuing recognition of the \n     needs of children and adults with disabilities and their \n     families. The disability community looks upon you as one of \n     its leading advocates in the U.S. Congress.

The proposal would also encourage individuals \n     to purchase private long-term care insurance, which could \n     help elevate some of the financial pressures off of state \n     Medicaid programs. In addition, this bill will help states in \n     their efforts to comply with the Supreme Court Olmstead \n     decision.\n       People with disabilities should be able to live and work in \n     their communities, not segregated in large and costly \n     institutions.

This legislation would take several important steps \ntoward assisting Americans and their caregivers to meet their long-term \ncare needs.\n  Issues related to long-term care are of growing concern to many in \nNew York and around the Nation. Individuals and families are struggling \nto afford costly care, obtain appropriate information regarding long-\nterm care insurance, and maintain dignity and choice regarding these \nimportant services. As I talk with seniors around the State of New York \nand throughout the country, what I hear most is that people want to \nstay in their homes with their loved ones for as long .as they can. \nHowever, too many individuals and families struggle to be able to \nafford quality home and community based care. In addition, families are \nunsure where to find the resources they need to purchase long-term care \ninsurance.\n  That is why I have joined with my colleagues to introduce this \nlegislation. The Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act will assist \nindividuals in meeting their long-term care needs, while reducing \nMedicaid costs.\n  This bill will improve access to home and community based services \nthrough Medicaid that will help seniors remain in their homes and \ncommunities. It will also expand long-term care insurance consumer \nprotections, provide tax deductions for the cost of long-term care \ninsurance, and allow tax credits for individuals and their caregivers \nto help cover long-term care expenses not covered by insurance. \nFinally, this legislation would establish a national clearinghouse on \nlong-term care information.\n  This legislation takes some important steps to assist individuals and \nfamilies in gathering the resources necessary to prepare for their \nlong-term care needs and gain access to services in their preferred \nchoice of setting.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Grassley and Bayh \nand all of my colleagues to ensure that all Americans have access to \nthe resources that help them access high quality long-term care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1603. A bill to establish a National Preferred Lender Program, \nfacilitate the delivery of financial assistance to small businesses, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill, the Small \nBusiness Lending Improvement Act of 2005, which I have introduced today \nto provide small businesses with easier access to loans and to increase \nefficiency in the Small Business Administration's largest loan program, \nthe 7(a) program, which provided $12.7 billion in small business loans \nin 2004.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am committed to supporting our Nation's Main Street \nsmall business community by increasing its access to capital. This \nlegislation will reform a cumbersome SBA lender licensing process that \ndoes not provide our small businesses with the most efficient means of \naccessing the capital they must have to start and sustain their firms. \nThe bill would allow the SBA's 7(a) loan program to better capitalize \non the demonstrated potential small business have to create jobs and \neconomic growth.\n  As our Nation continues to prosper from economic growth, low \ninflation, and low unemployment, we should not forget the critical role \nplayed by our small businesses. Without strong and successful small \nbusinesses, our prosperity would not be what it is today.\n  Under current law, the most prolific lenders in the SBA's 7(a) loan \nprogram can participate in the ``Preferred Lender Program'' (PLP \nProgram), which allows them to use their own processing facilities and \ntherefore both increases lenders' efficiency and reduces costs for the \nSBA. However, PLP lenders are required to apply for PLP status in each \nof the 71 SBA districts nationwide to obtain PLP status in that \ndistrict, and they must re-apply each year in each district. This is \nextremely inefficient and wasteful, and creates enormous unnecessary \nadministrative costs.\n  Section 2 of this bill would allow qualifying lenders to participate \nin the PLP Program on a nationwide basis after just one licensing \nprocess. This provision was in S. 1375, the Small Business \nAdministration 50th Anniversary Reauthorization Act of 2003, which I \nintroduced in 2003 and which the Senate approved unanimously in \nSeptember 2003.\n  This provision would drastically reduce administrative costs and \nwould standardize the operation of the PLP program. A National \nPreferred Lenders Program would eliminate the inefficiencies and cost \nof applying for PLP status in each district, and would increase the \nease with which loans are made to small businesses, thereby improving \nsmall businesses' access to capital. Competition among lenders for \nsmall business customers would increase, increasing financing \nalternatives and lowering costs for small businesses.\n  In addition to simplifying licensing processes for both lenders and \nthe SBA, the bill would allow the SBA's lender oversight to be done \nmore efficiently and effectively, on a national basis. The current \nprocess of having to renew licenses in each district is extremely time-\nconsuming and administratively burdensome for the lenders and the SBA. \nA National Preferred Lenders Program could remedy the inefficiencies \nand cost of applying for PLP status in each district and save a \ntremendous amount of taxpayer dollars.\n  Section 3 of the act increases the maximum size of a 7(a) loan to $3 \nmillion, from the current $2 million, and increase the maximum size of \na 7(a)\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\nguarantee to $2.25 million, from the current $1.5 million. This would \nmaintain the maximum 75 percent guarantee. Small businesses' financing \nneeds are increasing and, especially with the high cost of real estate \nand new equipment, it is appropriate to respond to those needs by \noffering larger loans.\n  In the SBA's 504 Loan Program, loans may now be as large as $10 \nmillion, with $4 million guaranteed, for manufacturing projects, $5 \nmillion (with $2 million guaranteed) for loans that serve an enumerated \npublic policy goal (such as rural development), and $3.75 million (with \n$1.5 million guaranteed) for all other ``regular'' 504 Program loans. \nThus, this increase in 7(a) Program loans to $3 million would bring \n7(a) loans closer in size to 504 Program loans, while still leaving \n7(a) loans smaller than 504 Program loans.\n  Section 4 of the bill increases the program's authorization level to \n$18 billion for fiscal year 2006, instead of the $17 billion authorized \nfor fiscal year 2006 in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, enacted in \nDecember 2004. The program is on pace to achieve loan volume of between \n$14 and $15 billion in fiscal year 2005, and this provision would allow \nthe program adequate ability to grow unimpeded in fiscal year 2006, \nespecially if the maximum loan size is increased.\n  Section 5 of the bill requires the SBA to implement an alternative \nsize standard, in addition to the program's current standard, for the \n7(a) program. The SBA would create an alternative size standard for the \n7(a) program, as it has already done for the 504 program, that \nconsiders a business's net worth and income. This provision would bring \nthe 7(a) program into conformity with the 504 Program. This provision \nwas also in S. 1375 in the 108th Congress, passed unanimously by the \nSenate in 2003.\n  Currently, in the 7(a) program a small business's eligibility to \nreceive a loan is determined by reference to a multipage chart that has \ndifferent size standards for every industry that can be very confusing, \nespecially for small lenders that do not make many 7(a) loans. In the \n504 Program, however, lenders can use either the industry-specific \nstandards or an ``alternative size standard'' that the SBA created, \nwhich simply says a small business is eligible for a loan if it has \ngross income of less than $7 million or net worth of less than $2 \nmillion.\n  This would simplify the 7(a) lending process and provide small \nbusinesses with a streamlined procedure for determining if they are \neligible for 7(a) loans, and it would conform the standards used by the \n7(a) and 504 programs.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \npublic safety officers, judges, witnesses, victims, and their family \nmembers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Law Enforcement \nOfficers' Protection Act of 2005. This act will guarantee tough, \nmandatory punishment for criminals who murder or assault police \nofficers, firefighters, judges, court employees, ambulance-crew \nmembers, and other public-safety officers in the course of their \nduties. Attacks on police officers and judges are serious crimes. They \nmerit the toughest penalties. LEOPA imposes the following terms of \nimprisonment for attacks on public-safety officers: (1) second degree \nmurder, 30 years to life; (2) voluntary manslaughter, 15 to 40 years; \n(3) assault resulting in serious bodily injury, 15 to 40 years; (4) \nassault with a dangerous weapon, 15 to 40 years; and (5) assault \nresulting in bodily injury, 5 to 20 years. The act also imposes \ncommensurate penalties for retaliatory murders, kidnappings, and \nassaults committed against the family members of public-safety \nofficers.\n  LEOPA includes additional provisions that will deter attacks upon \npolice officers. The act expedites Federal-court review of state \nconvictions for murder of a public-safety officer; it limits the \ndamages that can be recovered by criminals for any injuries experienced \nduring their arrest; it removes arbitrary barriers to retired officers' \nright to carry concealed weapons under Federal law; it makes it a crime \nto publicize a public-safety officer's identity in order to threaten or \nintimidate him; and it increases existing penalties for obstruction of \njustice and interference with court proceedings.\n  Aggravated assaults against police officers are a serious national \nproblem. According to the most recent F.RI. report on the subject, 52 \nlaw-enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the United States \nin 2003. In the 10 year period from 1994 through 2003, a total of 616 \nlawenforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty in \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\n  These officers' assailants unquestionably are among the worst \ncriminals. Of those individuals responsible for unlawful killings of \npolice officers between 1994 and 2003, 521 had a prior criminal arrest, \nincluding 153 who had a prior arrest for assaulting a police officer or \nresisting arrest. The individuals who commit these types of offenses \nare among the most dangerous members of the criminal class. Tough \nsentences for these criminals not only protect those who risk their \nlives to protect us; they also directly protect the public at large by \nremoving a dangerous class of criminals from society.\n  Ordinary assaults against police officers have become a widespread \nproblem. More than 57,000 law enforcement officers were assaulted in \nthe course of their duties in 2003, and more than a quarter of these \nassaults resulted in injury to the officer. These numbers represent \nmore than one of every 10 officers serving in the United States. Our \nsociety apparently has reached a point where criminals feel entitled to \nassault a police officer when they are being arrested. LEOPA is \ndesigned to change that understanding, to show criminals that assaults \nagainst police officers are unacceptable.\n  It bears mention that because of improvements in technology, recent \nyears' numbers of officers killed in the line of duty even understate \nthe extent of the violence that officers face. As the Los Angeles Times \nnoted in 1994, ``the number of officers killed--an average of 60 to 70 \na year since the late 1980s--would have broken records, too, if not for \nthe advent of bulletproof vests, police experts say; about 400 officers \nhave survived shootings over the last decade because they were wearing \nprotective armor.'' (Faye Fiore & Miles Corwin, Toll of Violence Haunts \nFamilies of Police Officers, N.Y. Times, Feb. 21, 1994, at 1). As the \nexecutive director of the Fraternal Order of Police noted recently, \n``there's less respect for authority in general and police officers \nspecifically. The predisposition of criminals to use firearms is \nprobably at the highest point in our history.'' (Jerry Nachtigal, Crime \nDown, but Number of Police Officers Killed Holds Steady, Associated \nPress Newswires, Apr. 11, 1999).\n  Violence against police officers also inhibits effective law \nenforcement. It breeds caution among officers and hinders robust \ninvestigation. LEOPA is designed to restore balance to the law. It is \ndesigned to ensure that police officers do not fear for their safety \nwhen enforcmg the law, but instead, that criminals fear the \nconsequences of breaking the law.\n  Finally, aside from their broader effects on law enforcement and \nsociety, aggravated assaults and murders of police officers simply are \nterrible crimes. The victims often are young and in the prime of life, \nleaving behind young children, spouses, and grieving parents. A few \nrecent incidents in the news serve to illustrate the horrific toll that \nthese homicides take on the surviving victims:\n  Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Shayne York, 26 years old, was \nmurdered during an invasion robbery while waiting for his fiancee at a \nhair salon on August 16, 1997. He was killed solely because of his \nstatus as a police officer. The Los Angeles Times gave the following \naccount of the crime from the testimony at the killer's trial:\n\n       The robbers yelled racial slurs and ordered customers and \n     employees to the floor, snatching valuables from everyone \n     inside. When one of the bandits found a law enforcement badge \n     in York's wallet, he kicked York as he lay on the ground, \n     according to testimony from [York's fiancee], also a Los \n     Angeles County sheriff's deputy. The gunman asked York if he \n     ever mistreated blacks and Crips gang members at Los Angeles \n     County's Pitchess Detention Center, where York worked. York \n     responded, ``No, sir.'' [The killer,] an alleged Crips gang \n     member, then pointed a pistol at the back of York's head and \n     squeezed the trigger, prosecutors said. [York's fiancee] \n     testified she saw York's body go limp as she felt his blood \n     flowing onto her legs. She said she heard the gunman say, ``I \n     always wanted to kill a pig.'' (Jack Leonard & Monte Morin, \n     Man Guilty of Killing Off-Duty Deputy, L.A. Times, Aug. 23, \n     2000, at B1.)\n\n  Deputy York's killer never expressed any remorse over this senseless \ncrime. When jurors read their verdict at his trial, he shouted at them, \n``May Allah kill you all, pagans, infidels.'' (Stuart Pfeifer & Richard \nMarosi, Jury Recommends Death for Robber Who Killed Deputy, L.A. Times, \nSept. 8, 2000, at B7.)\n  California Highway Patrol Officer Don Burt, 25 years old, was shot \nseven times by a member of a street gang during a traffic stop on July \n13, 1996. As Officer Burt lay wounded on the ground, the killer shot \nhim in the head. The Los Angeles Times, covering the killer's trial, \ngave the following account of the testimony describing the devastating \nimpact of Officer Burt's death on his family:\n\n       [Don Burt's father] relived some of his happiest memories \n     with his son--the wedding of his son and [daughter-in-law] \n     Kristin, and the day he was told he was going to be a \n     grandfather. But the proudest moment for both father and son \n     was when the younger Burt joined the Highway Patrol. ``I \n     pinned on his badge and 1 hugged him,'' the father said, \n     tearfully. ``The proudest I'd ever seen him. The gleam he had \n     in his eye--he was so proud.''\n       It was a quiet summer night the night his son died, [Burt's \n     father] told the 12-member jury. He and his wife had just \n     finished dinner. The telephone rang. It was their daughter-\n     in-law's father, also a CHP officer, saying there had been a \n     shooting in the area that the younger Burt patrolled. The \n     elder Burt, a 30-year veteran trooper, called the CHP \n     dispatch center to learn more. A patrol car arrived to take \n     the parents to the hospital. ``We drove [to the hospital] in \n     dead silence,'' Burt said. ``I knew my son was dead and 1 \n     couldn't tell my wife. She was sitting there with hope and 1 \n     couldn't tell her.''\n       Jeannie Burt said she didn't realize how serious her son's \n     injuries were until a few minutes after they arrived at the \n     hospital. ``I thought he wasn't hurt too bad, that everything \n     was going to be all right,'' Jeannie Burt told jurors. But \n     then, ``I saw Kristin's brother and he just shook his head. \n     And 1 knew my son was dead.'' Tears streamed down Jeannie \n     Burt's cheeks through most of her testimony. ``He wasn't \n     perfect, but pretty close to it,'' the mother said through \n     her tears. ``I'm grateful 1 had my son for the 25 years 1 had \n     him. 1 wouldn't trade that with anything. I'm just so sad \n     that my daughter-in-law has lost the love of her life. That \n     his son does not have a father.''\n       Kristin Burt, widow of the slain officer, said she was \n     seven months pregnant with their first child when her husband \n     of nearly three years was killed. She took the stand Monday, \n     faltering and fighting back tears as she described how the \n     coroner told her that her husband was dead. The coroner \n     ``held my hand and slipped Don's wedding ring into my hand,'' \n     Kristin Burt said. (Louis Roug & Meg James, Rage in the \n     Courtroom, L.A. Times, Apr. 18, 2000, at B1.)\n\n  Officer Burt's son, Cameron, was born two months after he was killed.\n  Compton Police Officers Kevin Burrell and James MacDonald were shot \nand killed by a wanted criminal during a traffic stop on February 22, \n1993. Newspapers gave the following account of the crime: ``The \nofficers were wearing bulletproof vests when they stopped a red pickup \ntruck about 11 p.m., but were knocked to the ground by bullet wounds to \ntheir limbs. With the officers lying in the rain-soaked street, [the \nkiller] pumped bullets into their heads, execution-style.'' (Jodi \nWi1goren, Killer of 2 Compton Police Officers Sentenced to Death, L.A. \nTimes, Aug. 16, 1995, at 1.)\n  Officers Burrell and MacDonald were both young men, with all of their \nparents still living, at the time of their deaths. At the killer's \ntrial, their families described the deep trauma that the crime created. \nThe Los Angeles Times gave the following account:\n\n       One after another, the mothers and fathers of Officers \n     James Wayne MacDonald and Kevin Michael Burrell took the \n     stand to cry out their losses. Three could not complete their \n     testimony without breaking down so badly that court recessed. \n     Burrell's mother told how she had heard the shots that killed \n     her son a few blocks from her home. MacDonald's father, \n     sobbing uncontrollably, blurted, ``Come home, Jimmy, let me \n     trade places with you,'' when he was asked what he would tell \n     his son if he could bring him back.\n       James and Tonia MacDonald told how they visit their son's \n     grave twice each day in their hometown of Santa Rosa, just to \n     chat. Clark and Edna Burrell told how neither of them can \n     bear to visit the cemetery where their son now lies.\n       ``I heard the shots,'' Edna Burrell said. Then she told how \n     she reasoned that her son had been hit. ``I was listening to \n     my police scanner,'' she said, ``and I knew it was Kevin \n     because I didn't hear them call his name'' on other dispatch \n     calls. ``So when she (a police officer) knocked on my door, \n     all I could do is scream, 'Oh God, they shot my baby. ``, \n     With that, Edna Burrell broke down. Overwhelmed, she was led \n     from the courtroom, past where [ the killer] sat staring \n     straight ahead. Sobbing softly, she repeated what she had \n     said on the stand: ``How could he do that? How could he do \n     that?''\n       Both sets of parents said the deaths of their sons left \n     them feeling empty, lost and angry. ``The whole time I was \n     praying, just to let Jimmy live until I could see him \n     again,'' Tonia MacDonald sobbed, remembering the hours after \n     she was told about the\n\n[[Page S9526]]\n\n     shooting. ``And then I was so mad at God. All I wanted was to \n     see him one more time.''\n       All four parents said old friends have fallen away as grief \n     consumed their lives. Mother's Day, James MacDonald \n     testified, has become unbearable. ``This year, when I got up, \n     I didn't tell her (his wife) 'Happy Mother's Day' because \n     it's a tough day,'' he said. ``I could see the tears in her \n     eyes.'' (Emily Adams, Slain Officers'' Parents Tell of Pain, \n     L.A. Times, June 1, 1995, at 1.)\n\n  It bears mention that all of the criminals responsible for the \nmurders described here were convicted of capital offenses, and will be \nsubject to the expedited federal review provisions in section 6 of \nLEOPA once they complete their State appeals.\n  Section 6 of the bill is named for Dr. John B. Jamison, a Coconino \nCounty, AZ, Reserve Sheriffs Deputy who was murdered while responding \nto a fellow deputy's call for assistance on September 6, 1982. The \nkiller fired 30 rounds from an assault rifle into Dr. Jamison's car, \nkilling the deputy before he could reach his gun or even unbuckle his \nseatbelt. Dr. Jamison was survived by his 13-year-old son and 10-year-\nold daughter. State courts completed their review of the killer's \nconviction and sentence in 1985. Federal courts then delayed the case \nfor an additional 15 years. One judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit even tried to postpone the killer's final execution \ndate on the alleged basis that the killer was wrongfully denied state \nfunds to investigate a rare neurological condition that his lawyer had \nlearned of while watching television. Dr. Jamison's killer ultimately \nwas executed in 2000--18 years after the crime occurred, and 15 years \nafter federal habeas-corpus proceedings began.\n  Section 6 is designed to prevent these kinds of delays in Federal \nreview of cases involving state convictions for the murder of a public-\nsafety officer. In the district court, parties will be required to move \nfor an evidentiary hearing within 90 days of the completion of \nbriefing, the court must act on the motion within 30 days, and the \nhearing must begin 60 days later and last no longer than 3 months. All \ndistrict-court review must be completed within 15 months of the \ncompletion of briefing. In the court of appeals, the court must \ncomplete review within 120 days of the completion of briefing. In most \ncases, these limits will ensure that federal review of a defendant's \nappeal is completed within less than 2 years. This section also makes \nthese deadlines practical and enforceable by limiting federal review to \nthose claims presenting meaningful evidence that the defendant did not \ncommit the crime--defendants would be barred from re-litigating claims \nunrelated to guilt or innocence. (Defendants still will be permitted to \nlitigate all their legal claims in state court on direct review and \nstate-habeas review, and in petitions for certiorari in the U.S. \nSupreme Court.)\n  The need for this provision is particularly stark in the judicial \ncircuit that includes my home state of Arizona. The U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit's pattern of blocking capital punishment \nfor all murderers--including those who kill police officers--is well \ndocumented. A recent committee report of the U.S. Senate, for example, \nnotes that: ``Data for the last ten years show that outside of the \nNinth Circuit, usually 70 to 80 percent of death sentences are affirmed \nby a [federal] Court of Appeals on collateral review. In almost every \nyear, however, the Ninth Circuit has reversed the majority of death \nsentences that it reviews. Moreover, this percentage has climbed \nsharply in recent years . . . In the last three years, the Ninth \nCircuit has reversed 88 percent, 80 percent, and 86 percent of the \ndeath sentences that it has reviewed.'' (S. Rep. No. 107-315 (2002), at \n72-73) The Senate report also notes that a core group of Ninth Circuit \njudges vote to reverse virtually every death sentence that they review. \nJudge Stephen Reinhardt, for example, had reviewed 31 death sentences \nby 2002, and voted to reverse every single one. Other Ninth Circuit \njudges have similar records.\n  As Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski has noted, ``there are those of \nmy colleagues who have never voted to uphold a death sentence and \ndoubtless never wil1.'' He continued: ``Refusing to enforce a valid law \nis a violation of the judges' oath--something that most judges consider \na shameful breach of duty. . . . [But] to slow down the pace of \nexecutions by finding fault with every death sentence is considered by \nsome to be highly honorable.'' (Alex Kozinski, Tinkering with Death, \nThe New Yorker, Feb. 10, 1997, at 48-53)\n  This pattern of behavior extends to the Ninth Circuit's review of \ndeath sentences imposed for the murder of police officers. In the nine \nStates under the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, 34 criminals have been \nsentenced to death for murdering police officers since the late 1970's. \nOnly one--the man who killed Dr. Jamison--has ever been executed. The \nNinth Circuit consistently has obstructed all other death sentences for \ncriminals convicted of murdering police officers in the western States.\n  As one Orange County newspaper columnist notes, these numbers reflect \npoorly on our society's commitment to ensuring justice for slain police \nofficers and their families:\n\n       When California voters reinstated the death penalty in \n     1978, they made killing an on-duty peace officer one of the \n     ``special circumstances'' that could subject the killer to \n     execution. The idea behind that was simple enough. If you \n     made killing a cop a death-penalty offense, maybe it would \n     make criminals think twice before doing it. . . . But it's \n     doubtful that the special circumstance concerning peace \n     officers strikes any fear into the heart of a would-be cop-\n     killer. Because in the 24 years since the new death-penalty \n     law was passed, not one cop-killer has been executed in \n     California. During that time, more than 200 California peace \n     officers have been murdered in the line of duty, including \n     eight in Orange County, and dozens of cop-killers have been \n     sent to death row. But not one has died for his crime. True, \n     California hasn't been in any hurry to execute other \n     murderers, either. Since 1978, more than 700 killers have \n     been sent to death row, but only 10 have been executed. But \n     the justice system seems particularly reluctant to actually \n     enforce the death penalty against cop-killers. ``That sends a \n     terrible message,'' says Marianne Wrede of Anaheim Hills, \n     whose son, West Covina Police Officer Kenneth Wrede, was \n     murdered in 1983. ``It says the justice system doesn't \n     respect the sacrifices of police officers and their \n     families.'' (Gordon Dillow, State Balks at Executing Cop-\n     Killers, The Orange County Reg., Dec. 5, 2002)\n\n  These unconscionable delays have greatly increased the suffering \nexperienced by the surviving families of murdered police officers. \nAgain, a few examples from recent news stories illustrate the nature of \nthe problems created by the current system of decades-long post-\nconviction review:\n  On August 31, 1983, West Covina Police Officer Kenneth Wrede, 26 \nyears old, responded to a call about a man behaving strangely in a \nresidential neighborhood. Wrede confronted the man, who became abusive \nand tried to hit Wrede with an 8-foot tree spike. Wrede could have shot \nthe man, but instead attempted to defuse the situation. The man then \nreached into Wrede's car and ripped the shotgun and rack from the \ndashboard. Wrede drew his gun and persuaded the man to lay down the \nshotgun, but the man picked it up again when Wrede lowered his revolver \nand shot Wrede in the head, killing him instantly.\n  Years later, Wrede's parents described the terrible impact of this \ncrime on their family. Marianne Wrede told of how ``a half hour before \nlocal television newscasts would broadcast the story, her doorbell \nrang. On the steps stood her son's commander and a police lieutenant. \nBetween them stood Kenneth Wrede's distraught wife. `I knew it was bad \nnews,' Marianne Wrede said. `I shut the door in their faces and I said, \n`It can't be my boy.' '' (Laura-Lynne Powell, Grief Unites Kin of \nFallen Officers, The Orange County Reg., June 20,1991, at EO1) Many \nyears after the crime, she reflected that ``every day I miss my son and \nit never goes away.'' (Anne C. Mulkern & Tiffany Montgomery, Caring \nCounts in Line of Duty, The Orange County Reg., Sept. 25, 1996, at BO1) \nKen Wrede's father also described the impact of the loss of his son. \n``My life will never be the same. I deal with it every day; when I hear \na police siren and immediately think of my son, when I pull up next to \na police car and think that that could have been him. I still stop as \noften as I can and tell the officers to have a good day and be \ncareful.'' (David Haldane & Michael Wagner, For Some, a Reminder of \nPast Tragedy, L.A. Times, July 15, 1996, at A3)\n  Officer Wrede's killer was sentenced to death in 1984, and that \nconviction was affirmed by the California Supreme Court in 1989. Then \nin 2000--17 years after Ken Wrede's murder--a divided panel of the \nNinth Circuit reversed the killer's death sentence. The\n\n[[Page S9527]]\n\nNinth Circuit found that the killer's lawyer provided ineffective \nassistance of counsel at the penalty phase because he did not present \nadditional evidence of the killer's abusive childhood and drug use.\n  At the time, Marianne Wrede noted, ``We thought we finally were close \nto getting this behind us. And now this.'' (Gordon Dillow, Long Wait \nfor Justice Gets Worse, The Orange County Reg., May 11, 2000, at BO1) A \nCalifornia Deputy Attorney General denounced the decision, stating that \n``it can always be suggested a jury should have heard something else in \nthe penalty phase of a death penalty case.'' (Richard Winston, Reversal \nof Death Penalty in Officer's Killing Decried Courts, L.A. Times, May \n10, 2000, at B3) West Covina Corporal Robert Tibbets, the original \ninvestigator at the scene of Wrede's murder, described the Ninth \nCircuit's decision as a ``miscarriage of justice.'' (Id.) He had \npromised Wrede's parents that he would accompany them to every court \nhearing for their son's killer. He made good on his promise, even 19 \nyears later, when the killer was retried and again sentenced to death \nin 2002. But the Wredes now face another round of state and then \nfederal appeals. At the retrial, Ken's father noted that ``my family \nand 1 had endured 19 years of trial, appeals, delays, causing us to \nrelive the trauma of Kenny's death over and over again.'' The trial \njudge agreed. He stated, ``It is an obscenity to put anyone through \nthis needlessly for 19 years. It is inexcusable for us in the system \nthat we need to look at this case for 19 years to get it resolved. The \nsystem at some point in the line has become clogged and broken.'' \n(Larry Welborn, 19 Years and no Resolution for Parents, The Orange \nCounty Reg., Sept. 21, 2002)\n  Riverside Police Officers Dennis Doty and Philip Trust were killed by \na man whom they attempted to arrest at his home on May 13, 1982. The \nman was in bed when the officers arrived and they permitted him to \ndress. The man then pulled out a gun that he had been sitting on and \nshot and killed both officers. He apparently sought revenge for \ninjuries that he sustained when he was shot while committing a bank \nrobbery. Officer Doty had served a tour of duty in Vietnam, where he \nhad received a purple heart and bronze star. The State supreme court \naffirmed the killer's conviction and death sentence in 1991.\n  In 2002, 20 years after the murders, Federal district court reversed \nthe killer's death sentence, finding that he had received ineffective \nassistance of counsel because he did not trust his lawyers. Local \nSuperior Court judge Edward Webster denounced the decision, declaring \nthat he was ``outraged by the entire federal process.'' He declared \nthat ``this [ decision] is just a product of judges'' personal opinions \nand philosophies opposing the death penalty.'' (Marlowe Churchill, \nRiverside Judge Takes Federal Court to Task, The Press-Enterprise, July \n22, 1995, at BO1) The Riverside assistant police chief noted that the \ndecision was particularly unfortunate for the officers' families: \n``They lived this 20 years ago, and not to have closure on the trial \nprocess is particularly difficult'' (Mike Kataoka, Court Annuls Death \nDecree, The Press Enterprise, May 31, 2002, at BO1)\n  Los Angeles Police Detective Tom Williams was shot and killed by a \nman against whom he had testified several hours earlier in a robbery \ntrial on October 31, 1985. Detective Williams was killed while picking \nup his son at a day-care center. A local newspaper gave the following \naccount of the crime: ``With [his son] Ryan sitting beside him in the \nfront seat of his truck, Williams, 42, saw the man in the ski mask, saw \nthe automatic weapon pointing out of the driver's side window of the \npassing car. But he was helpless to do anything to protect himself. All \nhe had time to do was scream for Ryan to get down, then cover the boy \nwith his own body.'' (Dennis McCarthy, Youth Feels Need to Serve, L.A. \nDaily News, Aug. 24, 1993, at Nl) The Los Angeles Times gave the \nfollowing account of testimony from the killer's trial:\n\n       A seventh-grade pupil at a Canoga Park church school \n     testified Wednesday that he saw 6-year-old Ryan Williams \n     sitting on the ground crying moments after the boy's father, \n     a Los Angeles police detective, had been gunned down in the \n     street on Oct. 31,1985. Thomas C. Williams, 42, was picking \n     up Ryan from school at 5:40 p.m. when he was struck by eight \n     bullets from an automatic weapon. The detective died, slumped \n     against the driver's side of his orange pickup truck. . . . \n     [The pupil] said he looked toward Williams' truck, parked in \n     front of the Faith Baptist Church school, and saw the \n     windshield shatter. ``It split into pieces,'' [he] said. \n     ``Then I ducked. I couldn't see anything. I got up because I \n     heard some little boy cry. I walked over. He was sitting on \n     the ground and he was crying and he had a bloody lip.''

The killer appeared at first \nto cooperate with police, but then pulled a pistol from his jacket and \nbegan firing. One officer who comforted Reed as he lay on the ground \ndescribe the scene: ``I could see a sense of panic in Don's eyes. He \nsaid, `I am not gonna make it' '' (Daniel Yi, Slain Officer's Family \nTestifies, L.A. Times, Feb. 9, 2000, at B1)\n  When Reed died, he had two toddler sons, ages 3 and 1\\1/2\\. Reed's \nkiller was sentenced to death, but the sentence was reversed on appeal, \nand he was retried and sentenced to death again in 2000. Reed's sons \nwere 22 and 21 by the time of the retrial. Still coping with the loss \nof their father, they chose not to attend the second trial. ``I was a \nmother, a father, I had to teach them everything,'' Reed's widow \nstated. (Id.) Of her husband, she simply noted, ``He was taken \nunnecessarily.'' (John McDonald, Officer's Widow Details Trauma, The \nOrange County Reg., Feb. 9, 2000, at B01) She also described the impact \non her family of holding a second trial 20 years after the crime. ``We \nhad all moved on, and then this came back and smacked us in the face. \nIt really just tears you apart.'' (Daniel Yi, Slain Officer's Family \nTestifies, L.A. Times, Feb. 9, 2000, at B1)\n  Los Angeles Police Officer Paul Verna was gunned down during a \ntraffic stop on June 2, 1983, by two men who earlier had committed a \nseries of violent robberies. The first man shot Verna from inside the \ncar, and the second then exited the vehicle and shot Verna five more \ntimes as he lay on the ground. Verna was survived by his wife and two \nyoung sons. Years later, the state supreme court reversed the death \nsentence of one of the killers. A new trial was held in 2000. At the \nfirst trial, Verna's widow described the devastating impact of the \ncrime on her family. She spoke of how ``no one who has not done it can \nknow how difficult it is to tell two young boys that the daddy they \nloved so much is gone.'' (Janet Rae-Dupree, 2 Sentenced to Die for \nKilling Policeman, L.A. Times, Sept. 21, 1985, at 6) A local newspaper \ngave the following accounts of the sentencing retrial:\n\n       Vema's sons were young boys, 4 and 9, when he was murdered. \n     This past week, they testified as young men. They told the \n     jury that they did not have a lot of first-hand recollection \n     of their dad. They did have the memories of stories from \n     their mom and many others as to what their dad was like. Ryan \n     [the younger son] spoke of sometimes feeling uneasy at being \n     told how much he looked like and even acted like his dad, \n     whom he does not remember. Sandy, Verna's widow, spoke of the \n     challenge of properly raising two very young boys alone. (Jim \n     Tatreau, Who Was Paul Verna? Murdered Officer Deeply Missed \n     Hero, L.A.

The very hardest part was when they were very young \n     kids--when Ryan, who was 4 years old when his father died, \n     would get hurt and would cry to his mother at bedtime, \n     `Mommy, I just want my daddy.' I couldn't give that to him, \n     no matter how hard I tried. I could do everything else, but I \n     couldn't give him his daddy.''

He has learned most \n     of the details of the death from three weeks of testimony \n     during the penalty retrial, and his killer's image won't \n     disappear. ``My father didn't deserve to die in that manner, \n     especially what was said to him and the gun being thrown on \n     him when he's lying on the ground,'' he said in tears. ``My \n     father wasn't around for a lot of things, a lot of special \n     things in my life.'' (Id.)\n\n  Our society must do everything that it can to deter these types of \ncrimes to ensure that punishment for those who commit them is swift and \ncertain. For\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\nall of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Law-\nEnforcement Officers' Protection Act.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nCornyn of Texas, to introduce the ``DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005.'' This \nact will allow State and Federal law enforcement to catch rapists, \nmurderers, and other violent criminals whom it otherwise would be \nimpossible to identify and arrest.\n  The principal provisions of the DNA Fingerprint Act make it easier to \ninclude and keep the DNA profiles of criminal arrestees in the National \nDNA Index System, where that profile can be compared to crime-scene \nevidence. By removing current barriers to maintaining data from \ncriminal arrestees, the act will allow the creation of a comprehensive, \nrobust database that will make it possible to catch serial rapists and \nmurderers before they commit more crimes.\n  The impact this act will have on preventing rape and other violent \ncrimes is not merely speculative. We know from real life examples that \nan all-arrestee database can prevent many future offenses. In March of \nthis year, the city of Chicago produced a case study of eight serial \nkillers in that city who would have been caught after their first \noffense--rather than after their fourth or tenth--if an all-arrestee \ndatabase had been in place. This study is included in the record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The first example that the Chicago study cites involves serial rapist \nand murderer Andre Crawford. In March 1993, Crawford was arrested for \nfelony theft. Under the DNA Fingerprint Act, the state of Illinois \nwould have been able to take a DNA sample from Crawford at that time \nand upload and keep that sample in NDIS, the national DNA database. But \nat that time--and still today--Federal law makes it difficult to upload \nan arrestee's profiles to NDIS, and bars States from keeping that \nprofile in NDIS if the arrestee is not later convicted of a criminal \noffense. As a result, Crawford's DNA profile was not collected and it \nwas not added to NDIS. And as a result, when Crawford murdered a 37-\nyear-old woman on September 21, 1993, although DNA evidence was \nrecovered from the crime scene, Crawford could not be identified as the \nperpetrator. And as a result, Crawford went on to commit many more \nrapes and murders.\n  On December 21, 1994, a 24-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned building on the 800 block of West 50th place in Chicago. DNA \nevidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the \nperpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's \nprofile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have \nbeen identified as the perpetrator of the September 1993 murder, and \nthis December 1994 murder could have been prevented.\n  On April 3, 1995, a 36-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned house on the 5000 block of South Carpenter Street in Chicago. \nDNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as \nthe perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and \nCrawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he \nwould have been identified as the perpetrator of the two earlier \nmurders that he had committed, and this April 1995 muurder could have \nbeen prevented.\n  On July 23, 1997, a 27-year-old woman was found murdered in a closet \nof an abandoned house on the 900 block of West 51st Street in Chicago. \nDNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as \nthe perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and \nCrawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he \nwould have been identified as the perpetrator of the three earlier \nmurders that he had committed, and this July 1997 murder could have \nbeen prevented.\n  On December 27, 1997, a 42-year-old woman was raped in Chicago. As \nshe walked down the street, a man approached her from behind, put a \nknife to her head, dragged her into an abandoned building on the 5100 \nblock of South Peoria Street, and beat and raped her. DNA evidence was \nrecovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If \nthe DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's profile had been \ncollected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as \nthe perpetrator of the four earlier murders that he had committed, and \nthis December 1997 rape could have been prevented.\n  In June 1998, a 31-year-old woman was found murdered in an abandoned \nbuilding on the 5000 block of South May Street in Chicago. DNA evidence \nwas recovered. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the \nperpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's \nprofile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have \nbeen identified as the perpetrator of the four earlier murders and one \nrape that he had committed, and this June 1998 murder could have been \nprevented.\n  On August 13, 1998, a 44-year-old woman was found murdered in an \nabandoned house on the 900 block of West 52nd Street. Her clothes were \nfound in the alley. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence \nidentifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had \nbeen law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his March \n1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of the \nfive earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nAugust 1998 murder could have been prevented.\n  Also on August 13, 1998, a 32-year-old woman was found murdered in \nthe attic of a house on the 5200 block of South Marshfield. Her body \nwas decomposed, but DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence \nidentifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had \nbeen law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his March \n1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of the \nsix earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nadditional murder could have been prevented.\n  On December 8, 1998, a 35-year-old woman was found murdered in a \nbuilding on the 1200 block of West 52nd Street. She had rope marks \naround her neck and injuries to her face. DNA evidence was recovered. \nThat DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA \nFingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's profile had been collected \nafter his March 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the \nperpetrator of the seven earlier murders and one rape that he had \ncommitted, and this December 1998 murder could have been prevented.\n  On February 2, 1999, a 35-year-old woman was found murdered on the \n1300 block of West 51st Street. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA \nevidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint \nAct had been law, and Crawford's profile had been collected after his \nMarch 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as the perpetrator of \nthe eight earlier murders and one rape that he had committed, and this \nFebruary 1999 murder could have been prevented.\n  On April 21, 1999, a 44-year-old woman was found murdered in the \nupstairs of an abandoned house on the 5000 block of South Justine \nStreet. DNA evidence was recovered. That DNA evidence identifies \nCrawford as the perpetrator. If the DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, \nand Crawford's profile had been collected after his March 1993 arrest, \nhe would have been identified as the perpetrator of the nine earlier \nmurders and one rape that he had committed, and this April 1999 murder \ncould have been prevented.\n  And on June 20, 1999, a 41-year-old woman was found murdered in the \nattic of an abandoned building on the 1500 block of West 51st Street. \nDNA evidence was recovered from blood on a nearby wall, indicating a \nstruggle. That DNA evidence identifies Crawford as the perpetrator. If \nthe DNA Fingerprint Act had been law, and Crawford's profile had been \ncollected after his March 1993 arrest, he would have been identified as \nthe perpetrator of the ten earlier murders and one rape that he had \ncommitted, and this additional murder could have been prevented.\n  As the city of Chicago case study concludes:\n\n       In January 2000, Andre Crawford was charged with 11 murders \n     and 1 Aggravated Criminal Sexual Assault. If his DNA sample \n     had been taken on March 6, 1993, the subsequent 10 murders \n     and 1 rape would not have happened.\n\n  The city of Chicago study goes on to discuss the cases of 7 other \nserial rapists and murders from that city. Collectively, together with \nAndre Crawford, these 8 serial rapists and\n\n[[Page S9529]]\n\nkillers represent 22 murders and 30 rapes that could have been \nprevented had an all-arrestee database been in place.\n  The DNA Fingerprint Act eliminates current federal statutory \nrestrictions that prevent states from adding and keeping arresttee \nprofiles in NDIS. In effect, the Act would make it possible to build a \ncomprehensive, robust national all-arrestee DNA database.\n  Here is how the DNA Fingerprint Act works: First, under current \nFederal law, a DNA profile from an arrestee cannot be uploaded to NDIS \nuntil the arrestee is charged in an indictment or information. Thus \ntoday, even an arrestee charged in a pleading cannot have his DNA \nuploaded to the national index. The act eliminates this restriction, \nallowing arrestees to be included as soon as they are arrested. It also \neliminates a statutory restriction that bars inclusion of profiles from \nsuspects who provide so-called ``exoneration'' samples. The act \nrecognizes that criminal suspects have no legitimate interest in \nevading identification for crimes that they have committed.\n  Second, the act requires an arrestee to take the initiative to opt \nout of NDIS if charges against him have been dismissed or he has been \nacquitted, and he does not want his DNA profile compared to future \ncrime scene evidence. Current law places the burden of determining who \nmay be removed from the index on the administrator of the DNA database, \nthus requiring the administrator to track the progress of individual \ncriminal cases. This bureaucratic burden discourages states from \ncreating and maintaining comprehensive, all-arrestee DNA databases. It \nalso effectively precludes the creation of a genuine national all-\narrestee database. In effect, only convicts' DNA profiles can be kept \nin the database over the long term. The act would allow arrestee \nprofiles to be kept in the database as well.\n  Third, the DNA Fingerprint Act would allow expanded use of CODIS \ngrants. Congress currently appropriates funds for use by states to \nexpand their DNA databases. Current law restricts the use of these \ngrants, however, to only building databases of convicted felons. This \nbill expands this authorization to allow use of these funds to build a \ndatabase of all DNA samples collected under lawful authority--including \nsamples taken from arrestees.\n  Fourth, the DNA Fingerprint Act allows the Federal Government to take \nand keep DNA samples from arrestees. The act gives the Attorney-General \nthe authority to develop regulations allowing collection of DNA \nprofiles from federal arrestees or detainees. The authority to issue \nsuch regulations would give the Attorney General the flexibility needed \nto respond to new legal developments and changes in technology.\n  And finally, the act tolls the statute of limitations for Federal sex \noffenses. Current law generally tolls the statute of limitations for \nfelony cases in which the perpetrator is implicated in the offense \nthrough DNA testing. The one exception to this tolling is the sexual-\nabuse offenses in chapter 109A of title 18. When Congress adopted \ngeneral tolling, it left out chapter 109A, apparently because those \ncrimes already are subject to the use of ``John Doe'' indictments to \ncharge unidentified perpetrators. The Justice Department has made \nclear, however, that John Doe indictments are ``not an adequate \nsubstitute for the applicability of [tolling].'' The Department has \ncriticized the exception in current law as ``work[ing] against the \neffective prosecution of rapes and other serious sexual assaults under \nchapter 109A,'' noting that it makes ``the statute of limitation rules \nfor such offenses more restrictive than those for all other Federal \noffenses in cases involving DNA identification.'' The DNA Fingerprint \nAct corrects this anomaly by allowing tolling for chapter 109A \noffenses.\n  Further evidence of the potential effectiveness of a comprehensive, \nrobust DNA database is available from the recent experience of Great \nBritain. The British have taken the lead in using DNA to solve crimes, \ncreating a database that now includes 2,000,000 profiles. Their \ndatabase has now reached the critical mass where it is big enough to \nserve as a highly effective tool for solving crimes. In the U.K., DNA \nfrom crime scenes produces a match to the DNA database in 40 percent of \nall cases. This amounted to 58,176 cold hits in the United Kingdom \n2001. (See generally ``The Application of DNA Technology in England and \nWales,'' a study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice.) A \nbroad DNA database works. The same tool should be made available in the \nUnited States.\n\n  Some critics of DNA databasing argue that a comprehensive database \nwould violate criminal suspects' privacy rights. This is simply untrue. \nThe sample of DNA that is kept in NDIS is what is called ``junk DNA''--\nit is impossible to determine anything medically sensitive from this \nDNA. For example, this DNA does not allow the tester to determine if \nthe donor is susceptible to particular diseases. The Justice Department \naddressed this issue in its statement of views on S. 1700, a DNA bill \nthat was introduced in the 108th Congress:\n\n       [T]here [are no] legitimate privacy concerns that require \n     the retention or expansion of these [burdensome expungement \n     provisions]. The DNA identification system is already subject \n     to strict privacy rules, which generally limit the use of DNA \n     samples and DNA profiles in the system to law enforcement \n     identification purposes. See 42 U.S.C. 14132(b)-(c). \n     Moreover, the DNA profiles that are maintained in the \n     national index relate to 13 DNA sites that do not control any \n     traits or characteristics of individuals. Hence, the \n     databased information cannot be used to discern, for example, \n     anything about an individual's genetic illnesses, disorders, \n     or dispositions. Rather, by design, the information the \n     system retains in the databased DNA profiles is the \n     equivalent of a ``genetic fingerprint'' that uniquely \n     identifies an individual, but does not disclose other facts \n     about him.\n\n  Elsewhere in its Views Letter, the Justice Department also explained \nwhy the restrictive expungement provisions in current law are \nunnecessary and contrary to sound public policy. The letter noted that \nthe FBI maintains a database of fingerprints of arrestees--without \nregard to whether the arrestee later was acquitted or convicted. The \nletter states, ``With respect to the . . . exclusion of DNA profiles of \nunindicted arrestees, it should be noted by way of comparison that \nthere is no Federal policy that bars States from including fingerprints \nof arrestees in State and Federal law enforcement databases prior to \nindictment.'' The Justice Department also pointed out that ``[t]here is \nno reason to have a . . . Federal policy mandating expungement for DNA \ninformation. If the person whose DNA it is does not commit other \ncrimes, then the information simply remains in a secure database and \nthere is no adverse effect on his life. But if he commits a murder, \nrape, or other serious crime, and DNA matching can identify him as the \nperpetrator, then it is good that the information was retained.''\n  From the Chicago study--which examines the experience of just one \nAmerican city over recent years--we know that an all-arrestee database \ncan and inevitably will make the critical difference in solving and \npreventing violent sex offenses. From the British experience, we know \nthat a comprehensive database can be a highly effective tool in solving \ncrimes. And we know that DNA databasing does not violate the right to \nprivacy. I urge the Congress to enact the DNA Fingerprint Act--before \nanother preventable sex crime occurs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Chicago study be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Case Study of 8 Serial Killers and Rapists: 60 Violent Crimes Could \n    Have Been Prevented, Including 22 Murders and 30 Rapes, City of \n                          Chicago, March 2005\n\n       If Illinois collected DNA from 8 serial killers and rapists \n     during any of their felony arrests, over 60 serious violent \n     crimes would never have occurred.

A bill to amend section 10501 of title 49, United States \nCode, to exclude solid waste disposal from the jurisdiction of the \nSurface Transportation Board; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \naddress a serious problem in New Jersey and across the nation--the \nunregulated sorting and processing of garbage at rail facilities in our \ncommunities.\n  A conflict in Federal laws and policy has resulted in certain solid \nwaste-handling facilities located on railroad property being \nunregulated. Environmental laws such as the Solid Waste Disposal Act \nshould apply to the operation of these facilities. However, a broad-\nreaching Federal railroad law forbids environmental regulatory agencies \nfrom overseeing the safe handling of trash or solid waste at these \nsites.\n  These unintended consequences require our attention, and are the \nreason\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\nfor the Solid Waste Environmental Regulation Clarification Affecting \nRailroads Act of 2005.\n  The Federal railroad law in question was enacted most recently in the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 to protect the \noperation of interstate rail service. The law gives `exclusive' \njurisdiction over rail transportation--and activities incident to such \ntransportation--to the Federal Surface Transportation Board.\n  I realize this law is necessary for the efficient operation of \ncommerce in our modern economy. I serve on the Committee on Commerce, \nScience and Transportation, as well as the Subcommittee on Merchant \nMarine and Surface Transportation, which oversees the Surface \nTransportation Board and considers nominations of its members. The \nboard's reputation and expertise in rail regulation is second to none.\n  However, the Board is limited to only a passive role in ensuring that \nrail facilities are operated with minimal detriment to the public \nhealth and safety. These sites require active environmental regulation, \njust like other solid waste handling facilities.\n  The recent proliferation of solid waste rail transfer facilities has \naffected the ability of State and local governments to engage in long-\nterm waste management planning. These agencies also are responsible for \nresponding to accidents and incidents occurring at these facilities.\n  Although transporting solid waste by rail can reduce the number of \ntrucks hauling solid waste on public roads, handling this waste without \ncareful planning and management presents a danger to human health and \nthe environment.\n  These transfer operations create thick dust, which is potentially \nhazardous and is breathed in by local residents and business owners.\n  Some transfer facilities don't have proper drainage on site, leading \nto the potential contamination of surface and groundwater and nearby \nwetlands.\n  In addition, these facilities raise serious concerns about the safety \nof their workers and the exemptions they claim from strong State worker \nprotection laws.\n  As a result of these chilling reports, I asked state agencies in New \nJersey, railroads, and other interested groups to provide input into \npossible legislation to address this problem.\n  Many experts in New Jersey, including the Department of Environmental \nProtection, the Meadowlands Commission, the Pinelands Commission, and \nthe Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic, provided excellent suggestions. I \nlook forward to working with them throughout the process to find a \nsolution to this problem.\n  I have also met with railroad interests, who are concerned about \ntheir ability to continue hauling solid waste. Some operators of these \nrail facilities have voluntarily complied with State environmental \nlaws, even though they could claim that Federal railroad law preempts \nany enforcement action States could take. I would like to thank members \nof the solid waste handling industry for their concern and input as \nwell.\n  One reason this legislation is needed is that the Surface \nTransportation Board has never clarified whether it even has \njurisdiction over the processing and sorting of solid waste at a rail \nfacility.\n  This bill would make it clear that Congress' intent was not to \nsubvert the policies of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and other \nenvironmental laws covering the handling of garbage.\n  The bill will clarify the intent of Congress in passing these two \nimportant laws, and ensure that they work together to provide for a \nrobust, environmentally responsible rail system.\n  Some have suggested that perhaps this clarification should not be \nlimited to the processing and sorting of solid waste. But these are the \nactivities that require the greatest environmental oversight, because \nthey pose the greatest environmental risk.\n  Many towns across the country are beginning to understand the problem \nof having an unregulated polluting neighbor, and having nowhere to turn \nfor help. Many influential organizations support this effort, \nincluding: United States Conference of Mayors, National Governors \nAssociation, Solid Waste Association of North America, Mass Municipal \nAssociation, National Solid Wastes Management Association, Integrated \nWaste Services Association, and Construction Material Recyclers \nAssociation.\n  These garbage transfer facilities should not be able to circumvent \nand ignore our environmental and. safety laws. I realize that the \nSurface Transportation Board must have broad jurisdiction over rail \ntransportation, but that jurisdiction should not be interpreted in a \nway that puts our environment at risk.\n  Railroading has a bright future in New Jersey and throughout our \ncountry, as freight loads have increased to levels we have not seen in \nsome time. I have fought for many years to ensure that our freight \ntransportation system, the backbone of our national economy, continues \nto flourish. But we need this legislation to ensure that these solid \nwaste rail transfer facilities are run in the same environmentally \nresponsible manner as other solid waste sites.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Solid Waste Environmental \n     Regulation Clarification Affecting Railroads Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FROM THE \n                   JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD.\n\n       Section 10501 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(2), by inserting ``except solid waste \n     management facilities (as defined in section 1004 of the \n     Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6903)),'' after \n     ``facilities,''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)(2)--\n       (A) by striking ``over mass'' and inserting the following: \n     ``over--\n       ``(A) mass''; and\n       (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting the \n     following: ``; or\n       ``(B) the processing or sorting of solid waste.''.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation being \nintroduced today by my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg. \nThis legislation, the Solid Waste Environmental Regulation \nClarification Affecting Railroads Act of 2005, would deal with a \ngrowing problem in my state: the problem of railroads avoiding strict \nenvironmental standards by constructing waste transfer facilities next \nto rail lines. I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation.\n  I first became aware of this problem when constituents contacted me \nabout a waste transfer facility proposed to be built by a railroad in \nMullica Township, New Jersey. There could not be a worse place for such \na facility. Mullica Township is located in the Pinelands National \nReserve, which encompasses more than 1.1 million acres of ecologically \nsensitive land. The Pinelands was designated as our nation's first \nnational reserve in order to protect its streams, bogs,and cedar and \nhardwood swamps, as well as the many species that live there. Yet many \nof these protections could be circumvented if this proposed facility is \nbuilt. The railroad argues that federal statute provides a shield from \nall environmental standards for any trash facility built adjacent to a \nrail line. This same argument has been used by railroads in the case of \n5 similar facilities that are already in operation in North Bergen. \nThese facilities lie near New Jersey's Meadowlands, another \nenvironmental treasure.\n  The statute being used by the railroads establishes the Surface \nTransportation Board, STB, as the reulatory agency for the nation's \nrailroads, title 49 of the United States Code. Under section 10501, the \nSTB has exclusive jurisdiction over the ``construction, acquisition, or \noperation'' of ``facilities'' located adjacent to a rail line. The \nrailroads argue that facility means any facility, including a trash \ntransfer station. They argue that because of this statute, federal law \npreempts all other state and local protections.\n  I cannot believe that Congress intended these types of facilities to \nbe exempt from State and local environmental standards. The risk to the \nsurrounding communities from the air pollution and groundwater \ncontamination that could occur when open rail cars carrying solid waste \nare allowed\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\nto load and off-load is too great. However, I believe that we must take \nsteps to clarify the law's intent. The ``Solid Waste Environmental \nRegulation Clarification Affecting Railroads Act of 2005 will do this. \nThe Act makes it clear that all state and local environmental laws and \nrestrictions apply to these facilities.\n  This is a commonsense measure that insures that the public remains \nfully involved in decisions relating to these facilities, regardless of \nwhere they are built. I urge its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida):\n  S. 1608. A bill to enhance Federal Trade Commission enforcement \nagainst illegal spam, spyware. and cross-border fraud and deception, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators McCain, Inouye, \nand Nelson of Florida to introduce the ``Undertaking Spam, Spyware, and \nFraud Enforcement With Enforcers Beyond Borders Act of 2005'' or the \n``U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2005''.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has a constitutionally mandated \nresponsibility to protect the American consumer from all types of fraud \nand deception. Today, the American consumer is increasingly falling \nprey to a new type of fraud unknown just a few years ago. The US SAFE \nWEB Act of 2005 will take the important steps necessary to help combat \nthis disturbing and growing trend.\n  The rise in the use of the internet has provided the American \nconsumer with innumerable benefits. The global market place in which we \nlive knows no borders, and the FTC must be provided with all the tools \nnecessary to fulfill its duty in this type of environment.\n  Using internet and long-distance telephone technology, unscrupulous \nbusinesses are increasingly able to victimize consumers in ways not \npreviously imagined. Deceptive spammers can easily hide their \nidentities, forge the electronic path of their email messages, and send \nmessages from anywhere in the world to anyone in the world. These \nbusinesses can strike quickly on a global scale, victimize thousands of \nconsumers, and disappear nearly without a trace--along with their ill-\ngotten gains.\n  There are dangers that come into U.S. homes through some of the \nharmful online networks, including some peer-to-peer networks, who \npurposefully locate outside the United States to avoid our Federal laws \nand put American families at risk.\n  Cross-Border fraud, as it is known, is becoming an increasingly \ncommon problem facing the American consumer and the FTC. In 1995, fewer \nthan 1 percent of all consumer fraud complaints received by the FTC \nwere directed at foreign entities. In less than a decade, the \npercentage had grown to 16 percent. In 2004 alone, the FTC received \nmore than 47,000 complaints by U.S. consumers against foreign companies \ncomplaining about transactions involving more that $92 million. In the \npast three years, over 100,000 consumers logged cross-border fraud \ncomplaints with the FTC.\n  Remarkably, these high numbers likely understate the problem. \nConsumers who reported instances of cross-border fraud only did so when \nthey knew that they were complaining about foreign entities. In many \nmore instances, consumers do not know that their complaints are against \nforeign entities. Fully one-third of all complaints to the FTC do not \nreveal the location of the entity being complained about.\n  The Federal Trade Commission also testified at a recent Aging \nCommittee hearing on elder fraud that many sweepstakes and lottery \nscams originate in Canada, and consumer fraud has become increasingly \ncross-border in nature.\n  The US SAFE WEB Act helps to address the challenges posed by \nglobalization of fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices.\n  Our bill draws on established models for international cooperation \npioneered by agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The FTC faces \nsignificant challenges in battling sophisticated cross-border schemes. \nJust as improved authority to act in cross-border cases gave the SEC \nand CFTC important new tools to fulfill their missions, enactment of \nthe US SAFE WEB Act would help the FTC fulfill its mission of \nprotecting and assisting U.S. consumers. The Act will substantially \nimprove the FTC's ability to meet the challenges posed by international \ninvestigations and litigation.\n  The US SAFE WEB Act will provide the FTC with important new tools in \nmany important areas. The provisions contained within the Act are \nneeded to help the FTC to protect consumers from cross-border fraud and \ndeception, and particularly to fight spam, spyware, and Internet fraud \nand deception.\n  Among key provisions within the bill are those that broaden \nreciprocal information sharing, expand investigative cooperation \nbetween U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies, increase information \nfrom foreign sources, and enhance the confidentiality of FTC \ninvestigations.\n  These provisions are needed to allow the FTC to share important \ninformation with foreign agencies so that they can halt fraud, \ndeception, spam, and spyware targeting U.S. citizens, and for the FTC \nto obtain, reciprocally, foreign information needed to halt these \ncnmes.\n  Furthermore, this legislation enhances the FTC's ability to obtain \nconsumer redress in cross-border cases. The US SAFE WEB Act would allow \nthe FTC to target more resources toward foreign litigation to \nfacilitate recovery of offshore assets to redress U.S. consumers.\n  In the 108th Congress, Senator McCain and I introduced this \nlegislation and it quickly passed the Senate by unanimous consent. \nUnfortunately, the bill was not signed into law before Congress \nadjourned. I urge my colleagues to support quick passage of this very \nimportant legislation this year.\n  The American consumer is far too vulnerable to this growing type of \nfraud and deception. Enactment of the US SAFE WEB Act would help the \nFTC fulfill its mission of protecting and assisting U.S. consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With \n     Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2005'' or the ``U.S. SAFE WEB \n     Act of 2005''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from \n     fraud and deception. Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses.\n       (2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       (3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       (5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its foreign \n     counterparts to share information about cross-border fraud \n     and deception, to conduct joint and parallel investigations, \n     and to assist each other is critical to achieve more timely \n     and effective enforcement in cross-border cases.\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enhance the \n     ability of the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers \n     from illegal spam, spyware, and cross-border fraud and \n     deception and other consumer protection law violations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DEFINED.\n\n       Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     44) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       `` `Foreign law enforcement agency' means--\n       ``(1) any agency or judicial authority of a foreign \n     government, including a foreign state, a political \n     subdivision of a foreign state, or a multinational \n     organization constituted by and comprised of foreign states, \n     that is vested with law enforcement or investigative \n     authority in civil, criminal, or administrative matters; and\n       ``(2) any multinational organization, to the extent that it \n     is acting on behalf of an entity described in paragraph \n     (1).''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AVAILABILITY OF REMEDIES.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. \n     45(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4)(A) For purposes of subsection (a), the term `unfair \n     or deceptive acts or practices' includes such acts or \n     practices involving foreign commerce that--\n       ``(i) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable \n     injury within the United States; or\n       ``(ii) involve material conduct occurring within the United \n     States.\n       ``(B) All remedies available to the Commission with respect \n     to unfair and deceptive acts or practices shall be available \n     for acts and practices described in this paragraph, including \n     restitution to domestic or foreign victims.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 225\n\n       Whereas child survival is a key element of global health \n     and is of utmost importance to the United States and all \n     countries of the world;\n       Whereas child survival must be addressed on a global scale;\n       Whereas increasing child survival rates is critical to \n     population growth in countries around the world;\n       Whereas child survival depends on access to key nutrients \n     that can avert millions of unnecessary deaths in third world \n     countries from preventable diseases;\n       Whereas 5 simple interventions, if delivered to children \n     before the age of 5, may significantly increase their chances \n     of survival;\n       Whereas these 5 interventions--vaccines, antibiotics, \n     Vitamin A and micronutrients, oral rehydration therapy, and \n     insecticide-treated bednets--can be provided to third world \n     countries at minimal cost;\n       Whereas 10,000,000 children die each year from preventable \n     diseases in third world countries and 6,000,000 of those \n     deaths could be prevented by the use of these interventions: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of November 2005 as the ``Month of \n     Global Health'';\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that children \n     around the world receive the interventions necessary for \n     survival as an integral component of efforts to improve \n     global health; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the ``Month of Global Health'' with appropriate participation \n     in key activities, programs, and fundraising in support of \n     worldwide child survival.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to take time to comment on the \nresolution I am introducing today which designates the month of \nNovember 2005 as the ``Month of Global Health.''\n  Today we live in a global community where all nations both benefit \nfrom those countries that prosper, and suffer with those that do not. \nThe Month of Global Health is a great opportunity to increase awareness \nof the pressing global health crisis that threatens our own public \nhealth and that of all nations around the world.\n  I believe this resolution is important and draws attention to the \nneeds of a growing population of children in the developing world that \nare living without proper health care and the essential nutrients they \nneed to survive. The resolution also highlights the necessary steps \nthat must be taken to increase child survival rates in developing \ncountries.\n  Child survival is one of the key elements to addressing global \nhealth. As a nation, there is much more we can do to assist developing \nnations in their effort to increase child survival rates. We must work \non a global scale to avert the millions of unnecessary deaths among \nchildren caused each year from preventable diseases.\n  This resolution reaffirms our commitment to the children of the world \nand sends a message that child survival is a fundamental component in \nour efforts to improve global health.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Murray in introducing an important resolution that will \nrecognize November as the ``Global Health Month.''\n  Every year, 10 million children die from preventable diseases in \nThird World countries. As many as 6 million of these deaths can be \nprevented by\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\nvaccines, antibiotics, hydration adequate nutrition, and other simple, \nlow-cost interventions.\n  As a long-time champion of helping the most vulnerable populations \nboth here and abroad, I believe it is important to bring this issue to \nthe attention of the American public. We can and must do more to ensure \nchildren around the world receive the interventions necessary for \nsurvival.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9538-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 226--CALLING FOR FREE AND FAIR PARLIAMENTARY \n                ELECTIONS IN THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Hagel) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 226\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Azerbaijan is scheduled to hold \n     elections for its parliament, the Milli Majlis, in November \n     2005;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan has enjoyed a strong relationship with \n     the United States since its independence from the former \n     Soviet Union in 1991;\n       Whereas international observers monitoring Azerbaijan's \n     October 2003 presidential election found that the pre-\n     election, election day, and post-election environments fell \n     short of international standards;\n       Whereas the International Election Observation Mission \n     (IEOM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, deployed by the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of \n     Europe, found that there were numerous instances of violence \n     by both members of the opposition and government forces;\n       Whereas the international election observers also found \n     inequality and irregularities in campaign and election \n     conditions, including intimidation against opposition \n     supporters, restrictions on political rallies by opposition \n     candidates, and voting fraud;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan freely accepted a series of commitments \n     on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law when that \n     country joined the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe as a participating State in 1992;\n       Whereas, following the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1358 (2004) demanding \n     that the Government of Azerbaijan immediately implement a \n     series of steps that included the release of political \n     prisoners, investigation of election fraud, and the creation \n     of public service television to allow all political parties \n     to better communicate with the people of Azerbaijan;\n       Whereas, since the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Government of Azerbaijan has taken some positive steps by \n     releasing some political prisoners and working toward the \n     establishment of public service television;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and opportunity to exercise \n     their civil and political rights, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, threats of political retribution, or other \n     forms of coercion by national or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a transparent, free and fair \n     election process for the 2005 parliamentary elections is an \n     important step in Azerbaijan's progress toward full \n     integration into the democratic community of nations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan \n     to hold orderly, peaceful, and free and fair parliamentary \n     elections in November 2005 in order to ensure the long-term \n     growth and stability of the country;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     the full participation of opposition parties in the upcoming \n     elections, including members of opposition parties arrested \n     in the months leading up to the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections;\n       (3) calls upon the opposition parties to fully and \n     peacefully participate in the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections, and calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to \n     create the conditions for the participation on equal grounds \n     of all viable candidates;\n       (4) believes it is critical that the November 2005 \n     parliamentary elections be viewed by the people of Azerbaijan \n     as free and fair, and that all sides refrain from violence \n     during the campaign, on election day, and following the \n     election;\n       (5) supports recommendations made by the Council of Europe \n     on amendments to the Unified Election Code of Azerbaijan, \n     specifically to ensure equitable representation of opposition \n     and pro-government forces in all election commissions;\n       (6) urges the international community and domestic \n     nongovernmental organizations to provide a sufficient number \n     of election observers to ensure credible monitoring and \n     reporting of the November 2005 parliamentary elections;\n       (7) recognizes the need for the establishment of an \n     independent media and assurances by the Government of \n     Azerbaijan that freedom of the press will be guaranteed;

Res. 227\n\n       Whereas although there is enough food to feed all of the \n     people in the world, as of summer 2005, 852,000,000 people \n     are in need of food aid;\n       Whereas almost 200,000,000 children under the age of 5 are \n     malnourished and underweight and 1 child dies every 5 seconds \n     from hunger and related ailments;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Programme estimates \n     that more than 5,000,000 metric tons of food is needed to \n     prevent widespread hunger, 80 percent of which will be used \n     for emergency programs to provide aid for people threatened \n     by famine in 2005;\n       Whereas, as of summer 2005, the United States contributed \n     approximately \\1/2\\ of the total food aid received by the \n     United Nations World Food Programme in 2005;\n       Whereas, as of summer 2005, 1 person out of every 3 people \n     in Africa is malnourished as a result of drought, conflict, \n     the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune \n     deficiency syndrome (AIDS), locust infestations, and economic \n     dislocation, and countries in Africa will lack at least \n     1,500,000 metric tons of the food necessary to provide \n     sufficient nutrition to the people in these countries if the \n     level of donations does not increase;\n       Whereas the World Food Programme, as of summer 2005, had \n     barely \\1/2\\ of the contributions needed to provide food aid \n     to the 26,000,000 victims of food shortage in Africa;\n       Whereas more than 14,000,000 people in the Horn of Africa \n     are experiencing or are vulnerable to experiencing a severe \n     food shortage;\n       Whereas approximately \\2/3\\ of the population of Eritrea \n     needs food aid and nearly \\1/2\\ of the women and children in \n     the country are malnourished;\n       Whereas, as of summer 2005, 8,300,000 people in Ethiopia \n     are in need of food aid and other assistance as a result of \n     poor harvests, degraded land, small land holdings, high \n     population growth, loss of crops, and loss of livestock and \n     other assets;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Programme food aid \n     programs in Ethiopia have received less than \\1/2\\ of the \n     funding necessary to continue these operations;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Programme had \n     received, as of summer 2005, less than 10 percent of the \n     funding necessary to provide aid to the 3,500,000 people in \n     Sudan who will need food in 2005, particularly during the \n     height of the annual hunger season that lasts from August to \n     October, due to political instability and weather conditions \n     that ruined harvests in the country;\n       Whereas a lack of funds will require the United Nations \n     World Food Programme to reduce the amount of aid given to \n     2,000,000 people in Burundi, including to 210,000 \n     malnourished children and nursing mothers who face a food \n     shortage as a result of drought and instability;\n       Whereas a lack of funds is expected to drastically \n     constrain food aid programs worldwide and the critical \n     efforts of private voluntary organizations of the United \n     States that play a central role in implementing such \n     programs;\n       Whereas a lack of funds forced the United Nations

\n     locusts;\n       Whereas humanitarian agencies report rising rates of \n     malnutrition among children under 5 years of age in \n     Mauritania, Mali, and Niger, which can lead to developmental \n     difficulties and growth stunting;\n       Whereas nearly 4,000,000 people in Niger, including 800,000 \n     children, will face a food\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\n     shortage in 2005 at a time when the child malnutrition rate \n     in the Niger region has reached emergency levels and the \n     country has been afflicted by locusts and drought;\n       Whereas the Government of Mauritania had received only \\1/\n     2\\ of the aid necessary to prevent a food shortage as of \n     summer 2005, leaving 60 percent of the families in Mauritania \n     without access to a sufficient amount of food in 2005;\n       Whereas a lack of food in Sierra Leone forced the United \n     Nations World Food Programme to reduce the amount of aid \n     given to 50,000 Liberian refugees residing in the country in \n     the summer of 2005, causing additional strife in an already \n     tense political environment;\n       Whereas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United \n     Nations World Food Programme has a 47 percent funding \n     shortfall as of summer 2005, which could force reductions in \n     the amount of food aid delivered to 2,900,000 people in the \n     war-torn country;\n       Whereas, as of summer 2005, donors had provided less than \n     20 percent of the total funding that the United Nations World \n     Food Programme needs to provide an adequate amount of food \n     for the people of southern Africa;\n       Whereas, due to increasingly severe drought conditions, the \n     number of people who are in need of food aid in southern \n     Africa increased from 3,500,000 people in the beginning of \n     2005 to 8,300,000 people by the summer of 2005, of which \n     4,000,000 are located in Zimbabwe, 1,600,000 in Malawi, \n     1,200,000 in Zambia, 900,000 in Mozambique, 245,000 in \n     Lesotho, 230,000 in Swaziland, and 60,000 in Nambia;\n       Whereas international donors determined that hunger and \n     poverty in Zimbabwe are largely attributed to the political \n     corruption of the governmental structure in the country;\n       Whereas the United Nations World Food Programme and the \n     World Bank proposed using aid to fund innovative weather and \n     famine insurance policies that could protect small farmers \n     from hardships suffered as a result of droughts and natural \n     disasters;\n       Whereas food insecurity, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and weak \n     government institutions leave countries more vulnerable to \n     external shocks and internal political unrest; and\n       Whereas the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust was established \n     solely to meet emergency humanitarian food needs in \n     developing countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) encourages expanded efforts to alleviate hunger \n     throughout developing countries; and\n       (B) pledges to continue to support international hunger

Res. 228\n\n       Whereas reports by the Energy Information Administration \n     entitled ``Annual Energy Outlook 2005'' and ``May 2005 \n     Monthly Energy Review'' estimated that, between January 1, \n     2005 and April 30, 2005, the United States imported an \n     average of 13,056,000 barrels of oil per day and that, by \n     2025, the United States will import 19,110,000 barrels of oil \n     per day;\n       Whereas technology solutions already exist to dramatically \n     increase the productivity of the energy supply of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas energy efficiency and conservation measures can \n     improve the economic competitiveness of the United States and \n     lessen energy costs for families in the United States;\n       Whereas the dependence of the United States on foreign oil \n     imports leaves the United States vulnerable to oil supply \n     shocks and reliant on the willingness of other countries to \n     provide sufficient supplies of oil;\n       Whereas, although only 3 percent of proven oil reserves in \n     the world are located in territory controlled by the United \n     States, advances in fossil fuel extraction techniques and \n     technologies could increase the United States energy \n     supplies; and\n       Whereas reducing energy consumption also benefits the \n     United States by lowering the environmental impacts \n     associated with fossil fuel use: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it should be a goal of the United States to reduce the \n     amount of foreign oil that will be imported in 2025 by 40 \n     percent from the amount the Energy Information Administration \n     estimates will be imported in 2025;\n       (2) the President should take measures to reduce the \n     dependence of the United States on foreign oil by--\n       (A) not later than 1 year after the date of passage of this \n     resolution, and every 2 years thereafter--\n       (i) developing and implementing measures to reduce \n     dependence on foreign oil by reducing oil in end-uses \n     throughout the economy of the United States sufficient by \n     2015 to reduce by 1,000,000 barrels per day the total demand \n     for oil in the United States projected for such year in the \n     Reference Case in the Annual Energy Outlook 2005 report \n     published by the Energy Information Administration; and\n       (ii) developing and implementing measures to reduce \n     dependence on foreign oil by reducing oil in end-uses \n     throughout the economy of the United States sufficient by \n     2025 to reduce by 7,640,000 barrels per day the total demand \n     for oil in the United States projected for such year in the \n     Reference Case in the Annual Energy Outlook 2005 report \n     published by the Energy Information Administration; or\n       (B) if the President determines that there are insufficient \n     legal authorities to achieve the target for 2025, developing \n     and implementing measures to reduce dependence on foreign oil \n     by--\n       (i) reducing oil in end-uses throughout the economy of the \n     United States to the maximum extent practicable; and\n       (ii) submitting to Congress proposed legislation or other \n     recommendations to achieve the target;\n       (3) in developing measures under paragraph (2), the \n     President should--\n       (A) ensure continued reliable and affordable energy for the \n     United States, consistent with the creation of jobs and \n     economic growth and maintaining the international \n     competitiveness of businesses in the United States, including \n     the manufacturing sector; and\n       (B) implement measures under paragraph (2) under existing \n     authorities of the appropriate Federal agencies, as \n     determined by the President;\n       (4) not later than 1 year after the date of passage of this \n     resolution, and annually thereafter, the President should \n     submit to Congress a report, based on the most recent edition \n     of the Annual Energy Outlook published by the Energy \n     Information Administration, that assesses the progress made \n     by the United States toward the goal of reducing dependence \n     on foreign oil imports by 2025, including by--\n       (A) identifying the status of efforts to meet the goal \n     described in paragraph (1);\n       (B) assessing the effectiveness of any measure implemented \n     under paragraph (2) during the previous fiscal year in \n     meeting the goal described in paragraph (1); and\n       (C) describing plans to develop additional measures to meet \n     the goal described in paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9539-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9539-S9540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 229--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 2005 AS \n                    ``NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MONTH''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 229\n\n       Whereas terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other \n     emergencies could strike any part of the United States at any \n     time;\n       Whereas natural and man-made emergencies disrupt hundreds \n     of thousands of lives every year, costing lives and causing \n     serious injuries and billions of dollars in property damage;\n       Whereas Federal, State, and local officials and private \n     entities are working to deter, prevent, and respond to all \n     types of emergencies;\n       Whereas all citizens can help promote the overall emergency \n     preparedness of the United States by preparing themselves and \n     their families for all types of emergencies;\n       Whereas National Preparedness Month provides an opportunity \n     to highlight the importance of public emergency preparedness \n     and to encourage the people of the United States to take \n     steps to be better prepared for emergencies at home, work, \n     and school;\n       Whereas the people of the United States can prepare for \n     emergencies by taking steps such as assembling emergency \n     supply kits, creating family emergency plans, and staying \n     informed about possible emergencies; and\n       Whereas additional information about public emergency \n     preparedness may be obtained through the Ready Campaign of \n     the Department of Homeland Security at www.ready.gov or the \n     American Red Cross at www.redcross.org/preparedness: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2005 as ``National Preparedness \n     Month''; and\n       (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe ``National \n     Preparedness Month'' with appropriate events and activities \n     to promote public emergency preparedness.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n229, a resolution designating September 2005 as National Preparedness \nMonth.\n  As the horrific attacks in London again demonstrate, the threat of a \nterrorist attack is very real. Although we have made significant \nstrides in preventing and deterring another attack from occurring in \nthe United States, it is imperative that steps be taken to mitigate the \neffects of the attack. In addition, natural disasters can strike at any \ngiven moment and we must know how to respond.\n  During the month of September, the Department of Homeland Security \nand the American Red Cross will co-sponsor National Preparedness Month \n2005. This nationwide effort will involve more than 130 private sector \norganizations that will host and sponsor activities across the Nation \nto increase public awareness of preparedness. Activities such as CPR \nand first aid classes, blood drives, and other events is a simple and \neffective way for communities to become involved in preparedness \nefforts. Families, schools, and businesses can prepare for emergencies \nby taking steps such as making emergency supply kits, becoming informed \nabout emergencies, and creating a family communications plan.\n  I join Senator Lieberman in cosponsoring this resolution to promote \ncitizen emergency preparedness. I hope that my colleagues will join us \nby supporting this important initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9540-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 230--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2005 AS ``NATIONAL \n                   PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nBunning, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 230\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States have a \n     family member that suffers from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States is diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas throughout the past decade, prostate cancer has \n     been the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer other than \n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2005, more than 232,090 men in the United \n     States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 30,350 men \n     in the United States will die of prostate cancer according to \n     estimates from the American Cancer Society;\n       Whereas 30 percent of the new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of being diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African American males suffer from prostate cancer \n     at an incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than white males \n     and at a mortality rate double that of white males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the chance that the disease will lead \n     to death;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnosis, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnosis, he has a 97 percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     detect prostate cancer in earlier and more treatable stages \n     and reduce the rate of mortality due to the disease;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting our families: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2005 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that it is critical to--\n       (A) raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and the treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) increase research funding to be proportionate with the \n     burden of prostate cancer so that the causes of the disease, \n     improved screening and treatments, and ultimately a cure may \n     be discovered; and\n       (C) continue to consider methods to improve both access to \n     and the quality of health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons to--\n       (A) promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) take an active role in the fight to end the devastating \n     effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their families, \n     and the economy; and\n       (C) observe September 2005 with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9540-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9540-S9541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 231--ENCOURAGING THE TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY \n OF IRAQ TO ADOPT A CONSTITUTION THAT GRANTS WOMEN EQUAL RIGHTS UNDER \n               THE LAW AND TO WORK TO PROTECT SUCH RIGHTS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Biden, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Obama, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Allen, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Santorum) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

which was referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 232\n\n       Whereas brave people in the United States, known and \n     unknown, of different races, ethnicities, and religions, \n     risked their lives to stand for political equality and \n     against racial discrimination in a quest culminating in the \n     passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas numerous individuals paid the ultimate price in \n     pursuit of political equality, while demanding that the \n     United States enforce the guarantees enshrined in the 14th \n     and 15th amendments to the Constitution;\n       Whereas, on March 7, 1965, a day that would come to be \n     known as ``Bloody Sunday'', the historic struggle for equal \n     voting rights led nonviolent civil rights marchers to gather \n     on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama where the \n     bravery of such individuals was tested by a brutal response \n     from State and local authorities, which in turn sent a \n     clarion call to the people of the United States that the \n     fulfillment of democratic ideals could no longer be denied;\n       Whereas 8 days after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson called for a comprehensive and effective voting \n     rights bill as a necessary response by Congress and the \n     President to the interference and violence, in violation of \n     the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, encountered \n     by African-American citizens when attempting to protect and \n     exercise the right to vote;\n       Whereas a bipartisan Congress approved the Voting Rights \n     Act of 1965 and, on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson signed this landmark legislation into law;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 stands as a tribute \n     to the heroism of countless individuals and enactment of the \n     Act was one of the most important civil rights victories in \n     the history of the United States, enabling political \n     empowerment and voter enfranchisement for all citizens of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 effectuates the \n     permanent guarantee of the 15th amendment that ``the right of \n     citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or \n     abridged by the United States or by any State on account of \n     race, color, or previous condition of servitude'';\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was amended in 1975 \n     to facilitate equal political opportunity for language-\n     minority citizens and was amended in 1982 to protect the \n     rights of voters with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has helped advance \n     the true spirit of democracy in the United States by \n     encouraging political participation by all citizens and \n     ensuring for voters the ability to elect representatives in \n     Federal, State, and local governments;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has increased voter \n     registration among racial, ethnic, and language minorities, \n     as well as enhanced the ability of citizens in those minority \n     groups to participate in the political process and to elect \n     minority representatives to public office, resulting in 81 \n     African-American, Latino, Asian, and Native American Members \n     of Congress and thousands of minority State and local \n     officials across the United States;\n       Whereas despite the noteworthy progress from 40 years of \n     enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, voter \n     inequities, disparities, and obstacles still remain for far \n     too many minority voters and serve to demonstrate the ongoing \n     importance of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides extensive \n     voter protections, such as equipping voters with the means to \n     challenge election laws that result in a denial or \n     abridgement of voting rights on account of race, color, or \n     language minority status (in section 2 of such Act), \n     eliminating literacy tests nationwide (in section 201 of such \n     Act), requiring Federal approval before jurisdictions with a \n     history of practices that restrict minority voting rights may \n     implement changes in voting practices and procedures (in \n     section 5 of such Act), providing the Department of Justice \n     with the authority to appoint Federal election monitors and \n     observers to ensure that elections are conducted free from \n     discrimination and intimidation (in sections 6 through 9 of \n     such Act), and mandating language assistance and translated \n     voting materials in jurisdictions with substantial \n     concentrations of language minorities (in section 203 of such \n     Act);\n       Whereas several of these provisions of the Voting Rights \n     Act of 1965 will expire in August 2007 unless Congress acts \n     to preserve and reauthorize them;\n       Whereas it is vital to democracy in the United States, and \n     to the efforts of the United States to promote democracy \n     abroad, that the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n     are fully effective to prevent discrimination and dilution of \n     the equal rights of minority voters;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the year marking the 40th anniversary of \n     the Voting Rights Act of 1965, people in the United States \n     must applaud the substantial progress that has been made in \n     protecting the right to vote, but also continue efforts to \n     ensure fairness and equal access to the political process in \n     order to protect the rights of every citizen of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been widely \n     hailed as the single most important civil rights law passed \n     in the history of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes and celebrates the 40th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       (2) reaffirms its commitment to advancing the legacy of the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965 to ensure the continued \n     effectiveness of the Act in protecting the voting rights of \n     all citizens of the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to celebrate \n     the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 40 years ago, after the Selma-Montgomery \nmarch, many of us in the Senate and House worked hard to pass the \nlandmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, to guarantee that racism and its \nbitter legacy would never again close the polls to any citizen. The \nfailure to ensure voting rights regardless of race or national origin \nwas a national shame, which was finally addressed in this long overdue \nbill. As we look toward August 6, the 40th anniversary of the Civil \nRights Act, we must recall the sacrifices of those who worked \ntirelessly to ensure that all Americans have access to the ballot, \nregardless of race.\n  All of us are grateful for those sacrifices, which forced America to \nlive up to its highest ideals, the ideal of equality and justice for \nall. And when we say all, we mean all. I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague Congressman John Lewis for his leadership and his courage in \njoining Dr. Martin Luther King and so many others on the march across \nSelma's Pettus Bridge to demonstrate the need for voting rights. Those \nwho marched and endured hatred and violence provided the guiding light \nfor Congress. As we celebrate the Voting Rights Act, we also celebrate \ntheir contributions.\n  This celebration must also be a wake up call to remind us of the need \nto strengthen and reauthorize the provisions of the Voting Rights Act \nthat are scheduled to expire in 2007. We must reauthorize section 5, \nwhich provides for Federal oversight of voting changes in--areas where \na history of discrimination has limited the right to vote. We must also \nreauthorize Section 203, which provides for bi-lingual elections in \nareas where necessary, to ensure that American citizens can vote, even \nif they have limited English proficiency.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the House and \nSenate, and on both sides of the aisle, on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9541-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9541-S9544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 49--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \nWITH RESPECT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MEDICAID IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF \n                               OUR NATION\n\n  Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Obama, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Dayton, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Bayh, Mr. Liberman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Byrd, and Mr. Carper) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            S.

and\n       (3) Congress must continue and strengthen the State-Federal \n     partnership that provides this vital health insurance \n     program.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this Saturday marks the 40th anniversary \nof Medicaid. Over the past 4 decades, Medicaid has provided quality \nhealth care to millions of the most vulnerable members of our society--\nlow-income children and parents, pregnant women, disabled persons, and \nsenior citizens. While anniversary should be a time to celebrate the \nprogress we have made in improving the health of those who are less \nfortunate--but instead, we find ourselves defending the program against \nharsh cuts that will destroy the health security of many of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  Medicaid has served the Nation well over the past 40 years. It \nprovides a critical safety net for those with nowhere else to turn for \nhealth care. The majority of Medicaid beneficiaries are too poor or too \nsick to buy coverage in the private market. Many have disabilities or \nmultiple chronic conditions, or need long-term care. Others have severe \nmental health problems. More than 50 million people receive health \ncoverage under Medicaid today, and most of them would be uninsured and \nuninsurable without it. States have significant flexibility to design \nMedicaid programs that meet the needs of their residents, with \nimportant Federal oversight to make sure that minimal standards are \nmaintained.\n  Today, Medicaid covers nearly 40 percent of all births. It provides \nhealth coverage for one in four children. It's Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnosis, and Treatment benefit has been a success in \nmaking sure that children receive the care they need.\n  Medicaid also provides prenatal care for many low-income women, and \nit fills in the gaps in coverage for low-income seniors and disabled \npersons, covering long-term care services that are not covered by \nMedicare. It is also a major source of coverage for mental health and \nsubstance abuse care and is the largest payer of services for AIDS \npatients.\n  Medicaid enrollment has grown rapidly over the past few years as more \nand more Americans not only lost their jobs but lost the health care \ntheir employers offered. Low-income working families increasingly lost \ncoverage as employers dropped coverage or couldn't afford it, because \nhealth costs soared while wages stagnated. It's true that Medicaid \ncosts have risen over the past few years, but this growth is driven \nprimarily by increased need. Medicaid does its job well--responding to \neconomic downturns and providing a health safety net for those with \nnowhere else to turn.\n  Yet Medicaid is once again under attack by some who want to undermine \nthe progress we have made. This year's budget mandates mean-spirited \ncuts in the program under the guise of balancing the budget, even \nthough the very same budget includes large new tax breaks for the \nwealthy. These cuts were ordered even though a bipartisan majority of \nSenators voted against them.\n  Any changes in Medicaid should be made to improve the care offered to \nits beneficiaries, not to pay for even greater tax breaks for the \nwealthy. We need to consider ways to improve Medicaid and make it \nfunction more effectively, and we can't accept reforms that do \notherwise. Cutting benefits or increasing costs for the poor will keep \nthem from getting the care they need, and cost the Nation far more in \nthe long-run.\n  Cutting health care for those who rely on Medicaid has real \nconsequences. We know what limiting their access to care will do: it \nwill result in more pain and suffering; it will lead to more deaths \nbecause treatable diseases will be diagnosed too late; it will lead to \nemergency rooms overcrowded with patients with no where else to turn; \nand it will lead to increased costs for those with health insurance, as \nthey are charged more to make up for the cost of covering those with no \ninsurance.\n  I look forward to celebrating many more Medicaid anniversaries. My \nhope is that we will continue to improve and modernize the program, not \nabandon it. We need to make it work for those it serves, especially the \nmillions of low-income children who will grow up to healthy adults \ntomorrow, because we kept the faith with Medicaid today.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, tomorrow marks the 40th Anniversary of \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs. On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson traveled to Independence, MO to sign the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs into law. That day, President Johnson signed a \ncontract with the citizens of this country. The contract states that \nour Nation recognizes that health care is a fundamental human right and \nthat a just society will marshal resources to provide basic medical \ncare for those most in need. Forty years later, the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs continue to abide by that contract, providing \ngovernment safety nets that keep the elderly, disabled, and \neconomically disadvantaged from falling into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  In passing legislation to establish the Medicare program, Members of \nthis\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\nbody took a courageous step by guaranteeing health insurance coverage \nto seniors and people with disabilities--regardless of a person's \nincome and regardless of a person's illness. Medicare is a commitment \nto America's seniors that if you are over 65 or disabled, no matter \nwhat your income, we will stand by you and you will get the health care \nyou need.\n  Before the Medicare program was established, nearly 50 percent of \nseniors lived their golden years without health coverage. Seniors were \nforced to choose between a trip to the grocery store and a visit to the \ndoctor's office. Today, because of Medicare, 98 percent of older \nAmericans have access to and can afford to get the medical care they \nneed. Of the forty-two million Americans currently covered by Medicare, \nincluding 35 million seniors and 6 million people with disabilities or \nend-stage renal disease, 1.3 million live in my home State of New \nJersey. I've spoken with many of those beneficiaries from throughout my \nState and it's clear there is great uncertainty about what the future \nof Medicare holds for beneficiaries.\n  On the 40th Anniversary of the Medicare program, we should be \ncheering the dramatic impact Medicare has had on the health and \nwellbeing of this country. Yet, I would be remiss if I failed to \nmention the real fear I have that Medicare beneficiaries will be in for \na rude awakening early next year. This coming January, a prescription \ndrug benefit will be added to the Medicare program. Since the day I \njoined the Senate, I consistently supported ensuring seniors access to \naffordable prescription drugs by adding prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare. In June, 2003, I was one of 76 Senators to vote to pass \nlegislation to establish a comprehensive, affordable prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare. While bill was not perfect, on the whole the \nlegislation would have been good for Medicare beneficiaries in New \nJersey and those across the Nation. Yet, Mr. President, the bill that \ncame back from House-Senate conference and was ultimately signed by the \nPresident does more harm than good.\n  For most New Jersey beneficiaries, the prescription drug plan set to \ntake effect January 1, 2006 is neither affordable, nor comprehensive. \nIt will cost seniors $3600 for $5,000 in drug benefits, will result in \nover 90,000 New Jersey retirees losing their drug coverage from their \nformer employers, and could force nearly 200,000 New Jersey seniors out \nof Medicare as they know it into private HMOs.\n  Most troubling is the impact that the prescription drug plan will \nhave on low and middle income beneficiaries in my state. My colleague \nSenator Lautenberg and I worked hard to save New Jersey's PAAD and \nSenior Gold programs--which the original Republican plan would have \nscrapped. But unlike New Jersey's PAAD and Senior Gold programs, the \nMedicare plan will have drug formularies that will restrict seniors' \naccess to certain drugs. This means that a senior in PAAD or Senior \nGold who now has complete prescription drug access may face limited \ndrug access or substantially higher costs for their drugs.\n  One of the few bright spots that came of the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill is the establishment of a ``Welcome to Medicare'' physical \nexam for new beneficiaries. For the majority of Medicare beneficiaries, \nthis program has been a treatment program, not a preventive health \nprogram. Instead of covering preventive services like colonoscopy, \ncardiovascular screenings, and wellness programs that keep \nbeneficiaries healthy, Medicare has traditionally focused more on \ntreating the patient once he or she gets sick. We need to continue to \npromote prevention, instead of just reacting to illness, under the \nprogram. Not only will a focus on prevention keep our beneficiaries \nhealthier and more independent, but the imminent retirement of the baby \nboom generation will continue to drive the costs of the program higher. \nThe simplest way to constrain Medicare spending while also keeping \nAmericans in their home and out of the hospital is to advance the \nprogram's focus on providing coverage of preventive health services.\n  I have no doubt that expanding Medicare coverage to include \npreventive measures will continue to improve the health and wellbeing \nbeneficiaries. On the whole, however, I have grave reservations about \nthe impact that the new prescription drug plan will have on what has, \nfor 40 years, been a reliable and affordable health coverage program \nfor this country's elderly and disabled citizens. One of the guiding \nprinciples of health care is, ``do no harm.'' My real fear is that the \nprescription drug plan will seriously undermine the Medicare program by \nshifting costs and limiting access to lifesaving services. These terms \nwere not part of the contract President Johnson signed to establish \nMedicare.\n  Forty years ago, along with the Medicare program, President Johnson \nsigned legislation establishing Medicaid. This health insurance program \nwas designed to keep the Nation's most vulnerable populations--the \npoorest and sickest, from falling onto the rolls of the uninsured. \nMedicaid is based on the proposition that the health of a nation should \nbe judged by the health of its people. For the last 40 years, Medicaid \nhas provided health care for 105 million Americans with disabilities, \nworking families, the elderly, children, and pregnant women. The \nsuccess of this federal-state partnership is a tribute to President \nJohnson and the members of Congress who were brave enough to recognize \nthat, in the world's richest country, basic medical care should be a \nright, not a privilege.\n  The Medicaid program has grown and evolved from a safety net program \nto the primary source of care for millions of Americans. Today, \nMedicaid provides vital health care services more than 53 million \nAmericans. For millions of low-income children and families, including \n500,000 children in New Jersey, Medicaid covers primary and preventive \nhealth care services that they otherwise could not afford. Medicaid \nprovides crucial primary care health services for children with \ndisabilities. And as my colleagues know, Medicaid is the Nation's \nlargest payer of nursing home and other long-term care services. The \namazing thing about Medicaid is the fact that the program covers people \nwho can't get health coverage anywhere else, and it does so at a \nfraction of the cost of other programs. A recent study found that the \ncost of serving an adult in Medicaid in 2001 was about 30 percent lower \nthan if that same person were instead covered by private health \ninsurance. And Medicaid spends about half as much on administrative \ncosts as private insurance. In 2003, only 6.9 percent of Medicaid costs \nwere administrative expenses compared to 13.6 percent for private \ninsurance. It is truly remarkable that Medicaid is able to do so much \nfor so many Americans.\n\n  As we take time to celebrate the dramatic success Medicaid has had in \ncovering our most vulnerable populations, we must be cognizant that \nthere is much more to do and that the program itself is vulnerable. \nClearly, Medicaid does a remarkable job covering Americans who would \notherwise be uninsured, but the reach of the program is becoming more \nand more limited. Forty-five million Americans were uninsured at some \npoint during the past year. For many of these Americans, their primary \nsource of care is hospital emergency rooms. Many could have been kept \nout of the hospital emergency room if they had access to basic health \nservices under Medicaid, and this could have been achieved at a \nfraction of the cost. Yet, arguing that the program is rife with waste, \nfraud, and abuse, Republicans passed a budget earlier this year that \ncuts $10 billion out of the Medicaid program. Clearly, there's always \nroom for improvement, and I don't think there is a member of this body \nwho believes we shouldn't rid the program of any waste, fraud, and \nabuse that exists. However, I have seen no credible evidence to \nconvince me that there is $10 billion in savings to be had from such \nefforts. Instead the evidence suggests that $240 million of the $10 \nbillion in cuts will come directly from the New Jersey Medicaid \nprogram. For $240 million, New Jersey could cover 100,000 more \nchildren, 17,000 more seniors, or 12,000 more residents with \ndisabilities. Instead of expanding the Medicaid program to these \npopulations, the $10 billion in cuts will likely come at the expense of \nbeneficiaries--pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities--\npeople who rely on the program for their basic medical needs.\n  Dramatic changes to Medicaid based not on sound public policy but on\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\nachieving $10 billion in savings would be a grave mistake. It would be \na huge step backward for Medicaid beneficiaries in New Jersey or across \nthe country. It simply is not possible to cut $10 billion from the \nMedicaid program without chipping away at the foundation on which the \nprogram is based. Make no mistake about it, in a federal-state \npartnership such as this, cutting $10 billion from Medicaid means \ntaking $10 billion away from the States ability to cover their \nuninsured. It means that States will be left with the tough choices of \ndecreasing reimbursements to providers, eliminating services like \nprescription drugs and specialized services for the mentally ill, or \nraising taxes to preserve these services.\n  The most egregious aspect of the proposed Medicaid cuts is that these \ncuts come in a budget that includes the $204 billion cost of making \npermanent the President's tax cuts for millionaires. How do we, as \nlegislators, look hard-working Americans in the eye and tell them \nhonestly that we can't afford $10 billion for health coverage for low-\nincome Americans, but we can afford $204 billion in tax breaks for the \nmost well-off? Is this the same legislative body that recognized the \nsocial value of offering a helping hand to those who could otherwise \nnot help themselves? Instead of tax cuts for those Americans least in \nneed of tax cuts, we should be preserving and expanding access to \nhealth care for our Nation's most vulnerable by maintaining our Federal \nobligation to the States to pay our fair share for these services.\n  As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, we \nmust recognize that some of those who have urged the dismantling of \nthese programs are the same people who argue that these programs are \nthe epitome of big government run amuck. On the contrary, Medicare and \nMedicaid are government at its finest. For 40 years, these programs \nhave been examples of government up to the plate to provide a lifeline \nfor citizens who would otherwise fall through the cracks of society. On \nJuly 30, 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were the vision of a stronger, \nhealthier, more prosperous America. We must continue to share this \nvision today, as we have for the past 40 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9544-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9544-S9547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 50--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \nCONCERNING THE VITAL ROLE OF MEDICARE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OF OUR \n                     NATION OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Obama, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Dayton, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \nLautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Byrd, and Mr. Carper) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.

This Saturday, Medicare \nand its sister program Medicaid turn forty, and for millions of \nAmericans, these vital health care programs have literally meant the \ndifference between life and death.\n  I am proud to be sponsoring a resolution to commemorate Medicare's \nbirthday on behalf of the Democratic caucus and to be co-sponsoring a \nsimilar resolution for Medicaid. Medicare is a great American success \nstory, and one of the most successful federal programs of all time. It \nhas lifted countless seniors out of poverty, allowing them to live with \ndignity and independence, and it has ensured access to necessary, \naffordable,\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\nquality medical care for our most vulnerable citizens. Prior to the \nintroduction of Medicare, half of America's seniors couldn't find or \nafford health insurance. Today, Medicare is the closest thing our \nNation has to universal coverage, providing health care to nearly 42 \nmillion Americans, including over 1 million in Michigan.\n  Moreover, Medicare has been remarkably efficient, especially \nconsidering the population it covers. Its administrative costs average \nless than 2 percent of its expenditures; in comparison, the \nadministrative costs for private insurance can run 12 to 13 percent, \nsometimes as high as 25 percent. Administrative costs this low are \nparticularly striking when we consider the overwhelming majority of \nseniors and people with disabilities 87 percent--are enrolled in \ntraditional Medicare, giving them full access to specialized care and \ntheir choice of physicians.\n  Medicaid, too, is celebrating its birthday this weekend. I began my \npolitical career in State government so I know the challenges facing \nour governors and State legislatures. One in seven Michiganians, or \nmore than 1.4 million in my State, are enrolled in Medicaid. Michigan \ndoes a great job at trying to control its Medicaid costs. In fact, \nprivate insurance has been rising almost twice as fast as Michigan's \nMedicaid costs. That's remarkable when you realize that the program \nenrolls some of the sickest and most vulnerable Americans, people that \ncould never afford private insurance.\n  I recognize that there are challenges facing both programs, but I do \nnot believe that making arbitrary cuts--putting our patients and \nproviders in jeopardy--is the way to improve either program. We \ncertainly must ensure the efficiency of the programs' use of taxpayer \ndollars. While doing so we must not lose sight of the fact that, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicare and Medicaid \naverage spending growth on a per capita basis from 2000-2004 was lower \nthan that of private insurance. We need to find ways to lower health \ncare costs system-wide; addressing only Medicare and Medicaid means we \noften simply shift unaffordable costs to the states, our businesses, \nworkers and patients. Let's work together on a bipartisan basis to make \nhealth care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Medicare has changed the lives of \nmillions of senior citizens over the past four decades. Before \nMedicare, vast numbers of elderly Americans were unable to afford the \nhealth care they needed. Since then, Medicare has made a real \ndifference in their lives. Medicare has also made a real difference in \nthe lives of millions of disabled persons, who became eligible for \nMedicare in 1972.\n  Today, Medicare means good health care for more than 42 million \nAmericans across the country. It is one of the most popular government \nprograms ever enacted. The number of senior citizens living in poverty \nhas declined dramatically as seniors because of Medicare. Our seniors \nare able to get the health care they so desperately need.\n  Many important changes have been made over the years to improve the \nprogram. One of the most important changes was extending coverage to \ndisabled persons. Another important change is moving Medicare's focus \nfrom caring for beneficiaries when they became sick to one that not \nonly treats illnesses but also emphasizes preventive care and the \nmanagement of chronic illnesses that affect so many senior citizens and \ndisabled persons.\n  While Medicare has accomplished so much over the past four decades, \nthere are still improvements to be made. The lack of coverage of \nprescription drugs is the most obvious problem, and many of us are \ndeeply concerned that the new prescription drug benefit enacted by the \nlast Congress will not in fact benefit many seniors who need and \ndeserve the coverage. We had a real opportunity to provide all seniors \nwith a good drug benefit, but politics won out.\n  Another significant failure has been ``privatization,'' which has \nforced many of the elderly into HMOs that cost more than traditional \nMedicare.\n  The lack of long-term care in Medicare is another shortcoming. Too \nmany Medicare beneficiaries must impoverish themselves in order to \nobtain the long-term care they need through Medicaid.\n  A further serious problem affects the disabled, who often have no \ncoverage during the two-year waiting period before Medicare is \navailable.\n  We can do better. Bills pending this year will modernize health \ninformation technology, and improve the quality of care. We need to \nprovide stronger incentives to reward quality and encourage the \navailability of the best possible care. We can improve treatment and \nachieve better coordination of care for those with multiple chronic \nconditions. And we can use the purchasing power of Medicare to make \nsure that prescription drugs are priced reasonably.\n  Medicare was a landmark achievement in its day, and we in Congress \nwho revere it now have a responsibility to see that it continues to \nmeet the needs of both current and future beneficiaries in our own day \nand generation. Putting beneficiaries first is what has made Medicare \nso popular and successful over the past four decades, and if the same \nfundamental priority is respected by Congress today and in the years \nahead, Medicare will have forty more years of brilliant accomplishment \nin meeting the needs of our seniors and our fellow citizens with \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this Saturday marks the 40th anniversary of \nthe creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. On July 30, 1965, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law in \nIndependence, MO. There are currently 87 million people enrolled in \nMedicare, Medicaid, or both, yet we often talk about these two programs \nwith inhuman terms and confusing acronyms. It is easy to forget that \nMedicare and Medicaid have human faces too.\n  Pauline Goldmann in Las Vegas is one of those faces. Two months ago, \nPauline suffered a collapse related to diabetes. She is back at home \nnow, thanks to Medicare's coverage of services she needed in a \nrehabilitation hospital. Without coverage for those services, she would \nhave had to go to a nursing home. Eventually, she would have become \neligible for Medicaid, and the Government would have picked up the tab \nfor that costly institutionalization. More importantly, Pauline would \nhave lost her independence and the ability to live in her home and \ncommunity.\n  She is just one of the 42 million people currently served by \nMedicare. Before Medicare, about one-half of seniors could afford \nprivate health insurance. Now it is a program that they know and trust. \nWithout it, many seniors and people with disabilities would have no \nhealth coverage at all. That this is practically inconceivable now is a \ntestament to Medicare's success.\n  Over the years, Medicaid has helped ensure that children in poverty \nhave access to the health care services they need. It has made sure \nthat pregnant women get the prenatal care we know is so important for \nhealthy babies. It has helped our senior citizens to pay for the costs \nMedicare doesn't cover. And it has assisted people with disabilities as \nthey struggle to afford the services they need.\n  In the past 40 years, we have made changes to these programs. For \nexample, we have expanded Medicare to cover people with disabilities \nand end-stage renal disease in 1972. In 1997, we created the successful \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. And a new Medicare drug program \nwill begin in 2006.\n  For years, we worked to add drug coverage to Medicare, but I am \nafraid Republican leaders fell short in 2003 when they created this new \nbenefit. I am very concerned as we enter this time of uncertainty in \nthe drug benefit's implementation. I hope we will have the opportunity \nto revisit some of the problematic aspects of that legislation so we \ncan make it less confusing and give seniors and people with \ndisabilities the drug benefit they deserve.\n  These are also uncertain times for Medicaid. Republican leaders have \ndemanded cuts to that vital program. To be sure, the cost of Medicaid \nis growing, and our states struggle with their budgets as a result. But \nMedicaid's problems are the same 5 problems that exist in our health \ncare system as a whole. Medicaid's rolls grow as more people become \nuninsured, and Medicaid faces the same unchecked health care cost \nincreases we all do. Moreover, Medicaid fills in Medicare's gaps, \ncovering long-term care and prescription\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\ndrugs for people eligible for both programs. Rather than alleviating \nthose drug costs, the new drug benefit continues this cost-shift to the \nStates.\n  As our Republican counterparts look at ways to derive savings from \nMedicaid, we call on them to eliminate waste or other problems in the \nprogram, but also to redirect those savings to Medicaid. We also \nimplore them to reject increases in cost-sharing for beneficiaries or \nallowances for changes to Medicaid's benefit package. Most of all, we \nask them to keep in mind the faces of people covered by Medicaid.\n  Neither Medicare nor Medicaid could perform their missions without \nthe providers who participate in the programs. I thank these \nindividuals and institutions for the services they provide every day. \nTheir commitment to the health of our citizens is tremendous, and in \nexchange, we must ensure that they are fairly treated by our public \nprograms.\n  Today, I join my colleagues in submitting resolutions commemorating \nthis important anniversary. Democrats created these two great programs \nin 1965. They are two of our proudest achievements. I look forward to \nmany future birthday celebrations as these programs continue to address \nthe basic health care needs of America's seniors, children, pregnant \nwomen, and people with disabilities.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on July 30, 1965, with one stroke of \nthe pen, President Lyndon Baines Johnson created two Federal programs \nthat gave America's poor and elderly access to high-quality \ncomprehensive health care. Having grown up in the Hill Country of \nTexas, President Johnson knew first hand of the lack of health care for \nthe poor, the elderly, and the disabled. He had witnessed the bitter \nconsequences of men, women, and children denied access to meaningful \nand affordable health care.\n  While President Johnson's signing of the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms into law was historic, it would be inaccurate to bestow the \nsole credit for the creation of these vital programs on one person \nalone. The Social Security Amendments of 1965 represented the decades \nlong work of both Democrats and Republicans who shared a commitment to \nimproving the health of our nation. The amendments were a compromise \nbetween those who wanted a social insurance program solely for the \nelderly and those who believed we needed a similar program for the \npoor.\n  The addition of Medicaid to the Social Security Amendments of 1965 \nwas of particular significance. Far from being the afterthought that it \nis typically described as, the creation of Medicaid was actually a \nreflection of a tradition of community and mutual obligation that, if \nnot uniquely, is at least characteristically American. It was an \nextension of a guiding principle of our Nation's founding--a shared \nresponsibility for the greater good of all, despite the broader \nspectrum of political beliefs. President Theodore Roosevelt, a \nRepublican who embodied our Nation's commitment to the public good, was \namong the first to propose comprehensive health insurance for working \nfamilies. Our language still bears witness to the type of Good \nSamaritan ideal that preceded the creation of Medicaid in local \nsituations such as ``barn raising'' and ``quilting bees.'' And on a \nnational level, we have always rallied in times of crisis, channeling \npersonal and individual efforts into a pursuit of the greater good.\n  This type of social contract with our fellow Americans was the basis \nfor the creation of Medicaid. The economic disasters of the Depression \nleft many families unable to pay for health care and, therefore, at the \nmercy of preventable and treatable diseases. Because of the poor health \noutcomes that occurred during the Great Depression, the Federal \nGovernment began to give serious consideration to a health care safety \nnet. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress recognized our \ncountry's moral obligation to its most vulnerable citizens, and they \npushed for action. And, in various ways, virtually every President from \nHarry Truman to Dwight Eisenhower to John F. Kennedy helped lay the \nframework for the comprehensive health insurance legislation that \nJohnson ultimately finished.\n  Just as significant as the bipartisan support for the creation of \nMedicaid is the fact that subsequent administrations--Democratic and \nRepublican--have reaffirmed a commitment to Medicaid because it is the \nfulfillment of a social contract between American citizens and their \nrepresentative government.\n  Unfortunately, during the last decade, we have seen a misguided, \ndarker view of Medicaid emerge, one that loses sight of the nobler \nefforts underlying that social contract. Medicaid had become a \nscapegoat for the larger ills facing our entire health care system. \nBut, Medicaid isn't the problem. Instead, this vital program has \ninherited the problems of our entire health care system, and over the \nyears has been asked to take on more and more responsibility for the \nhealth of our Nation with fewer and fewer resources. Because Medicare \nhas never provided significant long-term care benefits, Medicaid has \nbeen left to foot the bill for individuals eligible for both Medicare \nand Medicaid. And, each year, more and more employers are dropping \ntheir employer-sponsored health insurance coverage, which drives more \nworking families to Medicaid. With cost shifts of this magnitude, State \ngovernments are finding themselves having to dedicate more and more of \ntheir budgets to Medicaid. As a former governor, I understand concerns \nabout balancing budgets. However, the solution proposed by this \nadministration--cutting billions of dollars out of Medicaid--does not \nfit the problem, which is our health care system as a whole.\n  We can and should reform our entire health care system to make it \nmore responsive to the needs of our Nation's citizens, and there are \nrelatively easy ways to do this. We can start by creating a Federal \nlong-term care system to provide all Americans greater retirement \nsecurity. At the same time, we can provide employers with more \nincentives to retain health care coverage for their employees. And, \nfinally, the Federal Government can lower the cost of prescription \ndrugs for all Americans by allowing reimportation and improving access \nto generic drugs. If we do these things, then Medicaid can continue to \nbe a vital, stable, and efficient health care program.\n  I believe taking care of our most vulnerable people is a moral \nobligation.\n  And it is an obligation that we, as Americans, have fulfilled time \nand again because it reaffirms our fundamental belief in democracy and \ncommunity. As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in Democracy in America, a \nrecord of his 19th century travels through the United States, America's \n``equality of conditions'' not only characterized the new country's \ndemocratic political structure, but it reflected the community and \nmutual obligation that he saw as part and parcel of America's \nrevolutionary form of government.\n  The social contract with America that was forged 40 years ago this \nweek is no less valid or necessary today. According to the most recent \nCensus data, nearly 24 million people with incomes below 200 percent of \nthe poverty line were uninsured in 2003, including approximately 18 \nmillion adults under age 65 as well as 6 million children. Those \nnumbers are expected to rise in the years ahead. Our representative \ndemocracy has a responsibility to do for the future what we have \nrepeatedly done in the past: protect, preserve, and strengthen \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on July 30, 1965, legislation was signed \ninto law that created two fundamental programs: Medicare and Medicaid. \nThe creation of those programs was a landmark for this country. When \nsigning the Medicare legislation 40 years ago, President Johnson \nremarked, ``We marvel not simply at the passage of this bill, what we \nmarvel at is that it took so many years to pass it.''\n  At that time, senior citizens were identified as the group most \nlikely to be living in poverty in the U.S. Many had no type of health \ninsurance. Since 1965, and largely thanks to Medicare and the access it \nhas afforded seniors, the poverty rate has dropped significantly and \nolder Americans are enjoying longer and healthier lives.\n  As John Gardner, Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary during \nPresident Johnson's administration, once stated, ``Medicare was a great \nturning point, but it has to be continually revised.'' And Medicare has \nchanged. Since 1972, Medicare has also included Americans with \ndisabilities and those with end stage renal disease bringing access and \ncoverage to millions of\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\nAmericans in need of it. In 2003, Congress passed the Medicare \nModernization Act to add a prescription drug benefit. Medicare began \nwith about 19 million seniors, but faces an estimated 77 million \nAmericans, almost double the number of Americans enrolled in the \nprogram now in 2030. These Medicare beneficiaries will live longer, and \nface very different needs than the first 19 million.\n  With the creation of Medicaid, our Nation affirmed that we wanted \nthose who were poor to be able to have health care. Like Medicare, \nMedicaid has faced changes. Other categories of people in need have \nbeen added; States like my home State of Oregon have been able to \nexperiment in creative ways to provide care to more people; and as more \nseniors need long-term care and do not have the funds to pay for it, \nMedicaid plays an important role in providing long-term care. Medicaid \nhas uniquely borne the brunt of the failings of the health care system. \nFor many, this program is a lifesaver and it must be maintained.\n  Both Medicare and Medicaid are facing financial crises. Those who \nfought hard for the creation of these fundamental programs could not \nhave foreseen the technology and scientific breakthroughs that would \nchange health care delivery. Nor could they have foreseen the costs. We \nneed to continually revise these programs to find better ways to \nprovide affordable care and to assure that these programs are up to \ndate with the best science and medicine but--that they keep their \noriginal purpose--to provide care to those who are aged, disabled, or \npoor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9547-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1644.

Akaka, Patrick Leahy, Harry \n           Reid, Dick Durbin, Patty Murray, Jack Reed, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Herb Kohl.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nHawaii for a comment on the Native Hawaiians bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader. I rise today \nto express my thanks to the Majority Leader for laying down the cloture \npetition on the motion to proceed to S. 147. As many of my colleagues \nare aware, I have worked closely with Hawaii's senior senator to bring \nthe Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act to the Senate floor \nfor debate and vote. We have struggled for five years to bring this \nbill to the floor.\n  I applaud the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader for their \nefforts to uphold a commitment that was made last year for a debate and \nvote on the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act prior to the \nAugust recess. While I am very disappointed that we were not able to \nconsider the bill, I look forward to action on S. 147 when we return in \nSeptember.\n  This is a bipartisan bill which is widely supported in Hawaii. The \nbill is supported by Hawaii's Governor, Linda Lingle, the first \nRepublican governor in Hawaii in 40 years, who testified in strong \nsupport of the bill before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. The \nbill is also supported by the Hawaii State Legislature which passed \nresolutions in support of the bill in 2000, 2001, and 2005. The bill is \ncosponsored by Senators Cantwell, Coleman, Dodd, Dorgan, Graham, \nInouye, Murkowski, Smith, and Stevens. I want to especially thank the \nbill cosponsors who have actively worked with us to try to get this \nbill before the Senate.\n  S. 147 sets up a process for the reorganization of the Native \nHawaiian governing entity for the purposes of a federally recognized \ngovernment-to-government relationship. Congress has always treated \nNative Hawaiians in a manner similar to that of American Indians and \nAlaska Natives because of its recognition of Native Hawaiians as \nindigenous peoples.\n  Some have argued that Native Hawaiians are not native ``enough'' for \na government-to-government relationship. There is no doubt that Native \nHawaiians are indigenous to Hawaii. There is no doubt that Native \nHawaiians exercised sovereignty over the Hawaiian archipelago. There is \nno doubt that Native Hawaiians had a governing structure and entered \ninto treaties with the United States, similar to that of their American \nIndian and Alaska Native brethren.\n  Where we differ is that whereas most tribes have been allowed to \nretain their governing structure, Native Hawaiians, following the \noverthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, were forbidden from maintaining \ntheir government. Native Hawaiians did, however, maintain distinct \ncommunities, and retained their language, customs, tradition, and \nculture despite efforts to extinguish these ``native'' practices.\n  The bill does not create a new relationship--Congress has long \nrecognized its legal and political relationship with Native Hawaiians \nas evidenced by the many statutes enacted to address the conditions of \nNative Hawaiians. This bill does not create a new group of natives--we \nhave always been here, in fact we were here before the United States. \nRather, this bill establishes parity in federal policies towards native \npeoples in the United States by formally extending the federal policy \nof self-governance and self-determination to Native Hawaiians.\n\n[[Page S9558]]\n\n  I look forward to a full and thorough debate on this bill in \nSeptember. I urge all of my colleagues to support the petition to \ninvoke cloture--after five years, the people of Hawaii deserve to have \nthis issue considered by the Senate. If you oppose the bill, then vote \nagainst it, but give us the opportunity to debate the merits of this \nbill. Unfortunately, there are some in this body who do not even want \nto allow us to debate this issue. I ask them to carefully consider \ntheir position over the August recess. While I respect their ability to \nuse Senate procedure to prevent us from considering this measure, I do \nnot agree with their tactics. I believe the people of Hawaii deserve \nmore than that--we deserve a full debate and up or down vote on this \nbill.\n  Once again, I thank the Majority and Democratic leaders for working \nwith us to bring this issue before the Senate for its consideration.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, this cloture \nvote occur at 5:30 on Tuesday, September 6, with the mandatory live \nquorum waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3199, the House-passed \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization bill. I further ask unanimous consent that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the committee-\nreported substitute to Calendar No. 171, S. 1389 be inserted, the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed, and the Senate insist on \nits amendment and request a conference with the House with a ratio of \nsix to four.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to be very brief. Tonight the \nSenate is passing the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act by unanimous \nconsent. It is certainly not often that such a procedure would be used \nfor a statute of such extraordinary importance. I believe that it is \npossible to fight terrorism ferociously without sacrificing civil \nliberties. Tonight I remain concerned that there will be an effort in \nthe conference between the House and the Senate to authorize what are \nknown as administrative subpoenas for the FBI under the law. These \nadministrative subpoenas are warrants that FBI field offices can write \nthemselves without having to make an application to a judge.\n  Under an administrative subpoena, an FBI field office could get \nrecords secretly for just about anything from just about anybody. Here \nis an example of how intrusive these administrative subpoenas could be. \nThere are 56 field offices, one in almost every major city. The head of \na field office could issue an administrative subpoena to a hospital \ndirector and ask for all of the hospital's medical records simply by \nclaiming they were relevant to an investigation, the hospital director \nwas busy or didn't have the resources to make a challenge. No judge \nwould ever see the subpoena. The patients would not know their records \nhad been seized. They would be totally in the dark. Your mother's, your \nhusband's, your own medical records could move into the Government's \nhands, and you would be none the wiser.\n  Despite the very aggressive efforts in the Senate to include this \npower to conduct these what I believe are fishing expeditions, it is \nnot in the version of the PATRIOT Act that is being passed tonight, \nsince it is not in the House bill either. My view is that under rule \nXXVIII, it would be outside the scope of the conference to include \nthese administrative subpoenas in any form in the PATRIOT Act. If I am \ninformed later that it is in the conference report in some form, I will \nmake a point of order at that time and the conference report would \nfall.\n  Finally, I want to state that I commend our leader, Senator Reid and \nSenator Leahy, for their handling of this. I know Senator Durbin has \nbeen very involved in these issues for years as well. I also want to \ncommend Chairman Specter who has talked with me about the PATRIOT Act \non a number of occasions. We can strike a balance. We can ensure that \nwe pull out all the stops to fight the terrorists without throwing our \ncivil liberties into the ash can. If these administrative subpoenas \nshow up in that conference report, that will skew the balance that is \nso important to make sure we can win the war on terrorism but also to \nprotect the rights that we have brave men and women fighting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week, after negotiations that went late \ninto the night and early morning, the Judiciary Committee unanimously \napproved S. 1389, a bipartisan, compromise bill to build on the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  This bill, entitled the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization \nAct of 2005, is not perfect. Like all compromises, it includes \nprovisions that are not supported by everyone in this body. However, \nDemocratic and Republican members of the Judiciary Committee came \ntogether in a spirit of cooperation and compromise to agree on this \nbill, and I strongly support it.\n  I am very pleased that we have also been able to bring Republicans \nand Democrats together in the full Senate to pass this bill by \nunanimous consent. Given the divisions we have seen over this \nlegislation in the years since it was passed, I believe it is very \nimportant for our Nation and for the American people that we have been \nable to compromise and to come together in a spirit of bipartisanship \nto pass this legislation unanimously.\n  This bill preserves the vital tools the Government needs to protect \nour national security. At the same time, it puts in place some \nimportant checks on the expanded authorities granted the government by \nthe original PATRIOT Act.\n  Although Members of both parties may feel there are additional \nimprovements that can be made to this bill, Senate Democrats have \nagreed to join our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take up \nand pass the compromise legislation approved unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee with no amendments in order.\n  The President and other officials in his administration have \nrepeatedly called upon Congress to renew the PATRIOT Act as quickly as \npossible. Senate Democrats agree with the President that we should \nreauthorize the PATRIOT Act and do so quickly. We\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\nare pleased to be able to pass this bill today.\n  I only hope the spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation we have \nwitnessed to this point continues throughout the rest of the \nlegislative process. The next step in this process is a conference with \nthe House. The Senate is passing a very good bill, and I urge Senate \nconferees--Democratic and Republican--to do everything they can to \ndefend its provisions in the conference report. If they do so, I am \nconfident the bipartisanship and cooperation we see today will continue \nand we will get a conference report that will be strongly supported by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on the \nSenate's passage of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act \nof 2005. When I introduced this legislation just 2 weeks ago with my \ncolleagues Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl, I did not expect to be \nlauding its passage so soon but I am gratified by what we have \naccomplished in so short a period of time.\n  The alacrity of the bill's passage is a testament to the significant \nwork that preceded its introduction and the intense efforts of many in \nthe days that followed. The bill has been refined and improved to \naddress the concerns of those on both sides of the political aisle.\n  The bill has been modified to exclude some provisions that may have \nhad unintended consequences. For example, a provision that would have \nrequired criminal investigators to notify a court after sharing the \ncontents of a criminal wiretap with intelligence officers was deleted \nin response to concerns that it might have discouraged interagency \ninformation sharing. Likewise, a provision that increased requirements \nfor pen registers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or \nFISA, was removed to maintain parity between intelligence-related pen \nregisters and criminal pen registers. And, a provision requiring public \nreporting of FISA pen register information was removed, in favor of \nenhanced congressional access to this information.\n  At the same time, additional safeguards have been added to the bill \nto ensure that the authorities conferred by the PATRIOT Act are \nutilized in a manner that preserves civil liberties. For example, for \ndelayed notice or so-called ``sneak and peek'' warrants, the bill now \nrequires notice of the search to be given within seven days of its \nexecution, unless the court finds that the facts of the case justify a \nlater date. This change is consistent with pre-PATRIOT case law in at \nleast two circuits, which favored initial delays of seven days. \nNevertheless, the revised bill gives law enforcement the flexibility to \nobtain longer delays with court approval, if justified by the facts.\n  We have also modified the relevance standard for court orders to \nobtain business records and tangible things in intelligence cases, the \nso-called ``library'' provision. As introduced, the bill required \napplications for such orders to include ``a statement of facts'' \nshowing ``reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other \nthings sought are relevant to an authorized investigation.'' The \nrevised bill further defines relevant records as those that: (1) \npertain to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; (2) are \nrelevant to the activities of a suspected agent of a foreign power; or \n(3) pertain to an individual in contact with, or known to, a suspected \nagent of a foreign power. This language addresses concerns about \ngovernment ``fishing'' expeditions, but maintains substantial latitude \nfor legitimate terrorism investigations.\n  These changes and similar improvements, many of which were hammered \nout during late-night negotiations among Judiciary Committee staff, led \nto a hard-won unanimous vote when the committee considered the \nlegislation last week. Indeed, this compromise secured the support of \nardent conservatives and liberals alike, including the one member who \nvoted against the original PATRIOT Act--my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold.\n  As I said when I introduced this legislation, the recent attacks in \nLondon serve as reminder that the danger of international terrorism \nremains real, and has not abated in the years since 9/11. So, we must \nremain vigilant, and we must be cautious not to recreate the legal \ncircumstances that arguably contributed to significant intelligence \nfailures before 9/11. As I have said, reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, \nwhile incorporating improvements designed to safeguard our liberties \nand enhance oversight, is the right thing to do. So I am very pleased \nthat the Senate has overcome partisan differences to endorse this bill \nunanimously.\n  Before I close, I would like to take a moment to thank those who have \ncontributed to this significant achievement. First, I thank my original \ncosponsors, Senators Feinstein and Kyl, for the leadership they have \ndemonstrated on terrorism matters. I also thank Senator Leahy, the \ncommittee's ranking member, for working to secure broad bipartisan \nsupport of this measure and contributing substantially to the bill \nitself. I am also grateful to all of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee who made important improvements to the final bill and \ndemonstrated a remarkable willingness to work together in a collegial \nfashion.\n  I offer a special thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, Senator Roberts. Together with the vice \nchairman, Senator Rockefeller, he held several oversight hearings on \nthe PATRIOT Act, and reported a separate reauthorization bill. His \nbill, and his expertise, will continue to inform our review of the \nPATRIOT Act's intelligence provisions.\n  I am also grateful to my predecessor as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, who played a leading role in passage of the \noriginal PATRIOT Act and has been a strong advocate for the act in the \nyears since it was enacted.\n  I also thank our majority and minority leaders, Senators Frist and \nReid, for the personal attention that they and their staffs have \ndevoted to this legislation and the efforts to secure unanimous consent \nfor its passage.\n  Finally, I thank my own staff who have worked tirelessly on this \nbill. Those who have assisted with this measure are too numerous to \nmention, but I would like to acknowledge the steady leadership of the \nJudiciary Committee's chief counsel, Michael O'Neill, chief of staff \nand staff director, David Brog, and deputy chief counsel, Joe Jacquot. \nI also thank chief crime counsel Brett Tolman and counsel Nick Rossi \nfor spearheading this effort. They were greatly aided by my general \ncounsel, Carolyn Short, counsels Hannibal Kemerer and Evan Kelly, and \nstaff members Adam Turner, Lisa Owings, Kim Aytes, Viana Cabral, Diane \nPaulitz and Lissa Camacho. We all know that our work is supported by a \nlarge cast of talented staff, and I am very grateful to my staff, and \nthe entire staff of the Judiciary Committee, for their efforts on this \nimportant legislation.\n  With regard to the staff of other Members, I extend my personal \nthanks to Steven Cash with Senator Feinstein; Joe Matal and Stephen \nHiggins with Senator Kyl; Bruce Cohen, Julie Katzman and Tara Magner \nwith Senator Leahy; Bruce Artim and Ken Valentine with Senator Hatch; \nJoe Zogby with Senator Durbin; Rita Lari and Chad Groover with Senator \nGrassley; Reed O'Connor with Senator Cornyn; Neil McBride and Eric \nRosen with Senator Biden; Ajit Pai with Senator Brownback; Preet Bahara \nwith Senator Schumer; Paul Thompson with Senator DeWine; Lara Flint \nwith Senator Feingold; Cindy Hayden and Amy Blankenship with Senator \nSessions; Mary Chesser with Senator Coburn; Mark Blumberg and Christine \nLeonard with Senator Kennedy; Nate Jones and Patricia Curran with \nSenator Kohl; and James Galyean with Senator Graham. Their willingness \nto work closely with my staff under sometimes difficult circumstances \nwas much appreciated.\n  This bill heeds President Bush's call to renew the PATRIOT Act. All \nof the act's provisions have been renewed, and all but two provisions \nhave been made permanent. At the same time, we have made responsible \nchanges to safeguard civil liberties. Now we must move forward to a \nconference with the House in the hopes of quickly presenting President \nBush with a bill he can sign into law. I am proud of what we have \naccomplished thus far, and I look forward to our conference with the \nother body.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week, the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\ndid something that the administration has been urging us to do all \nyear--we reported a bill that reauthorizes every expiring provision of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act. This achievement was particularly notable for its \nbipartisanship. Following months of intense negotiations involving \nmembers from both sides of the aisle, we produced a consensus bill that \nwon the support of every member of the committee. I commend Chairman \nSpecter and all members of the committee for their work on this \nimportant legislation. We made possible something that many of us would \nhave thought impossible just a few weeks ago: a PATRIOT Act improvement \nand reauthorization package approved by every Member of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The bill we pass today--S. 1389, as reported--has three key elements.\n  First, the bill protects the privacy interests of Americans. It \nrequires the Government to convince a judge that a person is connected \nto terrorism or espionage before obtaining their library records, \nmedical records or other sensitive personal information. It also \nrequires the Government to notify the target of a ``sneak and peek'' \nsearch within 7 days, instead of the undefined delay that is currently \npermitted by the PATRIOT Act.\n  Second, the bill enhances judicial oversight and protects free speech \nrights. It gives the recipient of an order for sensitive personal \ninformation the right to challenge the order in court on the same \ngrounds as they could challenge a grand jury subpoena. It also provides \na right to challenge the gag order that currently prevents people who \nreceive a request for records from speaking out even if they feel the \nGovernment is violating their rights.\n  Third, the bill increases transparency and ensures accountability. \nOne of my principal objectives in this reauthorization process has been \nto introduce more sunshine into the PATRIOT Act. The reported bill \nrequires increased reporting by the Department of Justice on its use of \nseveral PATRIOT Act powers, including roving wiretaps, business record \norders, and ``sneak and peak'' search warrants. It also sets a 4-year \n``sunset'' on three domestic surveillance powers with great potential \nto affect civil liberties.\n  Like the PATRIOT Act itself, S. 1389 is not the bill that I, or any \nMember, would have written if compromise were unnecessary. I would have \nliked the bill to include additional checks and balances on certain \nGovernment surveillance powers granted or expanded by the PATRIOT Act. \nI would have liked the bill to include more sunshine provisions, as \nwell as additional sunsets. I regret that the bill repeals a sunset \nprovision that Congress enacted last year and that is not due to expire \nuntil the end of 2006.\n  While far from perfect, S. 1389 is a good bill, which moves the law \nin what I believe is the right direction. The bill is also \nsubstantially better, from a civil liberties perspective, than either \nthe House bill, H.R. 3199, or the bill reported by the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, S. 1266. And as the product of true \nbipartisanship--an 18-to-0 vote is something you do not see every day \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee--it is a bill in which the American \npeople can and should have confidence. I hope that the bipartisan \neffort that got us to this point will carry over to the conference and \nspeed this bill to final passage.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nversion of S. 1389, the USA PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization \nAct, that the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported last week. I am \npleased that the Senate is about to pass it without modification.\n  The compromise that the Judiciary Committee worked out addresses a \nnumber of the concerns that I have been talking about since October \n2001 when the Senate first considered the PATRIOT Act on the floor. We \nhave come a long way since that night, and I am grateful for the \nefforts of my colleagues to try to deal with the civil liberties \nconcerns that have been raised both here in the Senate and around the \ncountry. This is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill.\n  This bill does not address all of the problems with the PATRIOT Act. \nBut the compromise does deal with the core concerns that I and others \nhave had about the standard for section 215 orders, sneak and peek \nsearch warrants, and meaningful judicial review of section 215 orders \nand National Security Letters, including judicial review of the gag \nrule. It does not go as far on any of these issues as the SAFE Act, but \nit does make meaningful changes to current law.\n  I want to be clear that this will not be the end of my efforts to \nfurther fix the PATRIOT Act. This bipartisan compromise takes a big \nstep in the right direction, and I am pleased that I can support it, \nbut I will continue to push for additional changes to the law.\n  I also want to caution that the conference process must not be \nallowed to dilute the safeguards in this bill. This Senate bill goes \nmuch further than the House version in ensuring that Americans' civil \nliberties will be protected. I urge the Senate conferees to fight--and \nfight hard--for this bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support \nof the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005.\n  I understand that the Senate will shortly pass this legislation by \nunanimous consent, and I want to take this opportunity to thank \nChairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for the efforts to move this \nbill forward in a careful, collegial and effective matter. I believe \nthe bill we pass today strikes a good balance between our nations need \nto defend against terrorism, and maintaining our deeply held civil \nliberties.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act is one of the most consequential laws that has \never been passed by Congress. It made wide ranging, and necessary \nchanges to our intelligence and law-enforcement communities, giving \nthem the tools they need to defeat this Nation's most dangerous and \ninsidious enemies.\n  When we passed the PATRIOT Act shortly after September 11, 2001, we \nrecognized that this was very significant legislation, providing new \nauthorities to the Government. That's why we committed ourselves to \nvigorous and in-depth oversight of the implementation of the Act. In \nfact, sixteen of the most controversial provisions came with ``sunset \nclauses,'' which would cause them to expire in December of this year.\n  Since 2001, I have worked, along with my colleagues on both the \nJudiciary and Intelligence Committees to carry out that oversight. The \nresult has been literally hundreds of hours of hearings, briefings, and \ndocument reviews. We asked tough questions, and got answers. We did \nextensive research, and consulted with a wide array of experts.\n  As part of my effort to oversee the implementation of the USA PATRIOT \nAct, I asked the ACLU, in a letter dated March 25, 2005, to provide an \nupdate of their October 2003 statement that they did not know of any \nabuses of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  On April 4, 2005, the ACLU published a reply to my letter, in which \nthey listed what they described as `abuses and misuses' of the Act. I \ncarefully reviewed each of the examples provided in the letter. I also \nreviewed information provided to me by the Department of Justice about \neach of the examples. And while I understand the concerns raised by the \nACLU, it does not appear that these charges rose to the level of \n`abuse' of the PATRIOT Act.\n  This conclusion has been borne out by numerous inquiries, hearings \nand briefings. Simply put, there have been no sustainable allegations \nof serious abuse of the Act.\n  That said, I believe that we can, and should, make some changes to \nthe PATRIOT Act to ensure it is less likely to be abused in the future.\n  Furthermore, I am confident that the expiring USA PATRIOT Act \nprovisions should be retained. The sixteen sunsetted provisions are \ngenerally working and should be reauthorized with some of the \nmodifications reflected in the bill we take up today.\n  The bottom line is that the Judiciary Committee was able to do its \nwork, and reach appropriate compromises. This allowed the cmmittee to \nfavorably report this bill by a vote of 18-0. This type of consensus \nand bipartisanship is welcome and bodes well for our continued work on \nthese critical issues.\n  This Nation faces difficult times. We know that there are those \nalready in our country or trying to enter our country who would do us \ngrievous injury and harm unless we can stop them--and to stop them, we \nmust find\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\nthem first--before they act, not after they act. Therefore, this bill \nis necessary and prudent.\n  This legislation would permanently reauthorize 14 of the 16 \nprovisions scheduled to sunset in December 2005 and extend two other \nprovisions, multi-point, roving wiretaps, and the acquisition of \nbusiness record, until December 2009.\n  I believe it was important to extend, rather than eliminate, the \nsunsets on these two most controversial provisions--they warrant \ncontinued scrutiny.\n  But this legislation does not merely extend the sunsets. It makes \nimprovements to key portions of the act. The bill approved by \nCommittee, and which take up today, went even further in strengthening \nthe USA PATRIOT Act and protecting the civil liberties of Americans. It \nincluded the following modifications:\n  Clarifying the rules governing multipoint wiretaps as well as \nregulating the acquisition of business records in the course of foreign \nintelligence investigations by requiring that a judge determine that \nthe request is relevant to a national security intelligence \ninvestigation, and increases the amount of information that must be \nprovided to Congress to ensure adequate and effective oversight.\n  Changing Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act FISA Tangible Item Orders \nor the so-called ``library provision,'' tightening the requirement to \nmake it clear that investigators must not only show relevance but also \nthat the request pertains to a known or suspected agent of a foreign \npower or their associates.\n  Changing Section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act, Delayed Notification of \nSearch Warrants or ``Sneak and Peak,'' to include a ``7-day default'' \nfor delayed notice search warrants. Extension of this delay is \npermitted to dates certain, limited to 90 days or less unless the facts \nof the case justify a longer period of delay, but only upon showing of \nfacts supporting that request.\n  Changing Section 212 of the USA PATRIOT Act, so that electronic \nservice provider, Verizon, Comcast, etc., are authorized to \nvoluntarily, i.e., without a warrant, disclose customer records and the \ncontent of communications in an emergency situation--where delay could \nbe harmful, but without a need to show ``immediacy.''\n  Changing Section 214 of the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA Pen Registers/Trap \nand Trace Devices, in a way that makes them consistent with those used \nin criminal cases.\n  Changing Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act, National Security Letter \nProtection, c1arifying that any person contesting an order to produce a \ntangible thing, can not only challenge the order, but also any gag-\norder accompanying it.\n  Taken as a whole, these changes help ensure that these key provisions \nare used responsibly, in a focused and effective manner and against our \nNation's enemies, not against ordinary Americans. They provide critical \nadditional civil liberties protections, without sacrificing the safety \nof Americans. I strongly believe that Congress's responsibility does \nnot end when it passes a law. We have an obligation to carry out \nvigorous oversight. We have an obligation to adjust and fine-tune laws \nto fit changing circumstances. We have an obligation to see that the \nlaw accomplishes its aims and remains balanced and appropriate.\n  I believe the bill before us represents the result of fulfilling \nthose obligations, strikes a careful balance and should be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object to the \nunanimous consent request pending, I will make a brief statement \nregarding the PATRIOT Act, which is now being considered.\n  I rise in support of the compromise legislation. It is an amazing \nlegislative achievement. This revision of the PATRIOT Act was enacted \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, \nby a vote of 18 to 0--a bipartisan vote--which indicated that both \nsides of the table came together in an effort to make meaningful \nrevisions to the PATRIOT Act which will protect our freedom but not \ncompromise our security.\n  We all remember the PATRIOT Act was passed shortly after 9/11, when \nwe were the most engaged in the emotions of the moment. We worried that \nwe might have another attack, and we needed to give our Government \npowers to protect us. But we worried as well that we might go too far \nin our emotion in the moment, so we included sunset provisions in the \nPATRIOT Act which forced us to revisit it. Those sunset provisions \nturned out to be exceedingly wise. They brought us back in the last few \nweeks to take another close look at that PATRIOT Act.\n  In the meantime, many people stepped forward with criticism of the \noriginal PATRIOT Act. One of those was my colleague, Senator Larry \nCraig of Idaho. He and I probably have the most different voting \nrecords of any Senators you might find on the Senate floor--he being on \nthe Republican side and my being on the Democratic side--yet we sat \ndown and looked at the PATRIOT Act and found we had many concerns. We \nput together a bipartisan revision of the act, called the SAFE Act, \nwhich suggested some changes in the bill. We attracted support from \nacross the political spectrum--from the American Conservative Union and \nthe American Civil Liberties Union, from a wide range of different \ngroups, right and left and center, who raised serious and important \nquestions about whether the PATRIOT Act should be changed.\n  We brought that conversation to the Judiciary Committee while they \nwere deliberating on this version of the PATRIOT Act. I am happy to \nreport that many of the principles that Senator Craig and I were urging \nwere included in this final revision of the act which now comes before \nus on the floor of the Senate.\n  There were some who worried that we might not reach that point \nbecause an early version of the SAFE Act had been threatened with a \nveto by the Bush White House. Nevertheless, we found that when we could \ncome together and reason together, we could produce a work product that \nwe believe will be acceptable not only to the Senate but we hope to the \nHouse and to the President.\n  Like the SAFE Act, the Senate bill retains all of the new powers \ncreated by the PATRIOT Act. That is an important thing to say and \nunderline. Like the SAFE Act, it enhances judicial oversight and \nrequires the Government to report to the Congress and the American \npeople on the use of the PATRIOT Act.\n  Like the SAFE Act, it protects the privacy and free speech rights of \ninnocent Americans. Here is one example: The bill would require the \nGovernment to convince a judge that a person is connected to terrorism \nor espionage before obtaining their library records, medical records, \nfinancial data, or other sensitive personal information. That is the \nright thing to do. The bill isn't perfect, but it moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  Let me say a word as I close. One of the most unlikely groups became \nso important in this debate--the American Library Association. I cannot \nrecall a time in recent memory when this organization showed such \nleadership. Time and again, they came forward to tell us that they \nwanted to protect the privacy of their patrons at libraries across \nAmerica who might come in and take out a magazine or book, and they \ncertainly didn't want to do that with the knowledge that the Government \ncould sweep up all of the library records and sift through them to see \nif anybody had checked out a suspicious book. They sent us petitions \ngathered from libraries across the Nation, and I think they really did \ngood work on behalf of our Constitution and our rights and liberties \nguaranteed under the Bill of Rights.\n  I wish to dedicate any success we have with this revision of the \nPATRIOT Act to the American Library Association and all those who stood \nwith them in asking that we make meaningful changes to the act without \neliminating the important provisions that continue to make America \nsafe.\n  This bill today is not perfect. That's the nature of a compromise. \nBut it does significantly improve the Patriot Act, and it extends the \nsunset for several controversial provisions so Congress will have \nanother opportunity to review them in four years.\n  In contrast, the House of Representatives last week passed a flawed \nbill\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nthat would extend the Patriot Act's expiring provisions, but not fix \nits fundamental problems. Many Republicans and Democrats voted against \nthe bill because it doesn't protect our constitutional rights.\n  The Senate bill should serve as a model for how Republicans and \nDemocrats can come together to protect our fundamental constitutional \nrights and give the government the powers it needs. This legislation \nshows that we can fight terrorism without changing the nature of our \nfree and open society. It shows that we can be safe and free.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to maintain this \napproach and balance in the Conference Committee.\n  I withdraw any reservation and accept the unanimous consent pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3199), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 230\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States have a \n     family member that suffers from prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States is diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas throughout the past decade, prostate cancer has \n     been the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer other than \n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2005, more than 232,090 men in the United \n     States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 30,350 men \n     in the United States will die of prostate cancer according to \n     estimates from the American Cancer Society;\n       Whereas 30 percent of the new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of being diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African American males suffer from prostate cancer \n     at an incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than white males \n     and at a mortality rate double that of white males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the chance that the disease will lead \n     to death;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has double the risk of \n     prostate cancer, if he has 2 family members with such \n     diagnosis, he has 5 times the risk, and if he has 3 family \n     members with such diagnosis, he has a 97 percent risk of \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     detect prostate cancer in earlier and more treatable stages \n     and reduce the rate of mortality due to the disease;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting our families: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2005 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that it is critical to--\n       (A) raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods and the treatment of prostate cancer;\n       (B) increase research funding to be proportionate with the \n     burden of prostate cancer so that the causes of the disease, \n     improved screening and treatments, and ultimately a cure may \n     be discovered; and\n       (C) continue to consider methods to improve both access to \n     and the quality of health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons to--\n       (A) promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) take an active role in the fight to end the devastating \n     effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their families, \n     and the economy; and\n       (C) observe September 2005 with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9583-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9583-S9584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENCOURAGING THE TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1132, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1132) to provide for the establishment of a \n     controlled substance monitoring program in each State.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend our majority leader for \nbringing the Prescription Electronic Reporting Act to the floor for a \nvote so quickly, and I commend Senators Enzi, Sessions, Durbin, and \nDodd for their contributions to this bill and their efforts to prevent \nthe diversion of prescription drugs. Our goal is to help States \nestablish electronic databases to monitor the use of prescription drugs \nand deal more effectively with the growing national epidemic of \nprescription drug abuse.\n  Over 6 million Americans currently use prescription drugs for \nnonmedical purposes. Thirty-one million people say they have abused \nsuch drugs at least once in their lives. The number of people reporting \nsuch abuse is higher than the total combined number of people abusing \ncocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, and heroin.\n  The growing trend of prescription drug abuse is alarming. Since 1992, \nthe total number of people abusing prescription drugs has soared by \nover 90 percent. The number of young adults who abuse prescription pain \nrelievers and other addictive drugs has more than tripled. Prescription \ndrug abuse among youths 12 to 17 has risen by tenfold. Today, 20 \npercent of teenagers have abused prescription drugs, and 37 percent \nhave a close friend who does.\n  Better local programs to monitor addictive medications can help curb \nthis abuse. Approximately 20 States have such programs in place, \nincluding Massachusetts, but they vary greatly in the collection and \nstorage of data and the methods for using the databases.\n  The information in the databases can be used to identify physicians \nand patients who encourage the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. It \ncan help people seek treatment early for their addiction. It can also \nbe used to reduce the diversion of prescription drugs for illegal use.\n  Our bill authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make grants to States to \nestablish needed monitoring programs. States with existing programs can \nuse the grants to improve their systems and standardize the data to \nallow easy sharing of the information with other States.\n  Any such program, however, must include strong safeguards for medical \nprivacy and make certain that the databases cannot be used to put \nimproper pressure on physicians to avoid prescribing essential drugs. \nThe effective treatment of pain is an enormous medical challenge, and \ngood care will be much more difficult if patients fear that their \nprescription drug records will not be protected, or if physicians begin \nto look over their shoulder every time they prescribe pain medication.\n  We all share the goal of reaching the right balance between the \ninterests of patients, physicians, and law enforcement, and this \nlegislation does that. It requires the Secretary to develop criteria \nfor ensuring the privacy and security of the database, including \npenalties for improper use. In their grant applications, States must \nshow that they have enacted legislation with appropriate penalties, and \nexplain how they will meet privacy and security criteria, such as by \nusing encryption technology. They must have plans for purging data, and \nfor certifying that requests for information are legitimate. The bill \nalso requires the Secretary to provide a follow-up analysis of the \nprivacy protections within 3 years after funds are appropriated.\n  The problem of prescription drug abuse is growing exponentially and \nworsens every year. Today, the group most at risk is our children. Now \nis the time to act to limit the diversion of prescription drugs and \nprotect our most vulnerable citizens from prescription drug abuse.\n  Physicians want to treat pain without contributing to addiction. Law \nenforcement officials want to stop the flow of prescription drugs from \npharmacies to the streets. A national monitoring program will provide a \nvaluable resource to achieve these goals.\n  I commend Majority Leader Frist, Chairman Enzi, and Senator Sessions \nfor their leadership on this important health issue, and I urge our \ncolleagues to pass this legislation as a significant step toward ending \nprescription drug abuse.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I will be as quick \nas possible on this very important issue.\n  Four months ago the Senate Finance Committee reported S. 667, the \nPersonal Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone Act, \nknown as the PRIDE Act. This would reauthorize temporary assistance for \nneedy families, which was due for reauthorization in 2002. It is a \nbipartisan bill and received virtually unanimous support in the \ncommittee, a compromise that demonstrates how things can work.\n  The PRIDE Act contains increased funding to help parents cover the \ncosts of childcare, among other things, so that they can join the \nworkforce. It contains critical transitional medical assistance so that \nparents who work do not immediately lose their health care benefits in \nthe transition to work. In short, it will help tens of thousands of \nAmericans who are simply trying to do the right thing by their families \nand their communities.\n  That is why our Governors and State legislatures, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, have asked that we reauthorize the program and pass the \nPRIDE Act at the earliest possible date.\n  Unfortunately, instead of helping working families and listening to \nour Governors and legislatures by immediately taking up this important \nbipartisan legislation, Republicans have spent months fighting among \nthemselves, delaying its consideration. In the meantime, these working \nfamilies that I have described in our States have had to live with \nuncertainty about whether this program will continue and, if so, in \nwhat form and at what cost.\n  While we have been forced to wait several months for the majority to \nwork out their intraparty squabbles, Congress has had to pass a series \nof stop-gap extensions to keep the program going. Just before the last \nrecess we passed what was the tenth extension of this program. However, \nthat extension will expire at the end of September if we do not act on \npermanent legislation before then.\n  Even more threatening, some of our Republican colleagues are \ninterested in including TANF in reconciliation, which will mean serious \ncuts, not increases, in many of the important programs contained in the \nbipartisan legislation reported by the Finance Committee.\n  I commend Senators Baucus and Grassley, the chairman and ranking \nmember of that committee, for their efforts in behalf of this \nlegislation and the American people. The chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee have been working together for months in an \neffort to bring the committee-reported bill to the floor, but we must \nconsider this measure soon. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that no \nlater than the close of business on September 9, the Senate begin \nconsideration of Calendar No. 60, S. 667, the PRIDE Act, and that all \namendments be relevant to the subject matter of the bill without the \nneed for textual reference; and that the bill be completed before the \nSenate considers any reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the Democratic \nleader's comments on the PRIDE Act, especially stressing the critical \nimportance of this piece of legislation. It is a bipartisan bill. I do, \ntoo, want to thank the chairman and the ranking member, Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, for their diligent work, their hard work in \nbringing this bill forward. I look forward to working with the Chair \nand ranking member in appropriate scheduling of this bill.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, prior to our leaving the body for the day \nand for a number of weeks, I want to express my appreciation for the \npleasure it has been to work with the leader. I have enjoyed it. We \nhave differences every day about what Members want to do in this body. \nWe have tried, and I think we have accomplished civility. I have never \nto my knowledge raised my voice to the majority leader, nor has he \nraised his voice to me. We have distinct differences on occasion, but \nwe have been able to work through those. I hope our ability to work \ntogether, in spite of the differences of the two political parties, has \nbeen good for the country.\n  We have spent time talking about what we need to do and how we are \ngoing to accomplish that. We have sometimes even disagreements on that. \nBut the disagreements are not in any way unpleasant.\n  On behalf of the Democratic Senators, I express my appreciation for \nyour always being able and willing to respond to my phone calls \nquickly. Mr. President, I say through you to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee, he is always a gentleman, for which I am very grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do have a longer statement I will make \nhere shortly, but I think while the Democratic leader is here, what we \nhave seen over the course of the last day, in the last week, in the \nlast several weeks, does represent the very best of what this body is \nall about.\n  The American people, as the Democratic leader suggested, expect us to \ngovern in a way working together with civility, and I think we have \ndemonstrated that on some very tough and contentious issues. I look \nforward, as we enter into the post-recess session, to continuing that \nbipartisan civil spirit as we address, again, some very challenging \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9586-5", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9586-S9588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LOOKING AHEAD: ISSUES BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the last few minutes here, I do want to \nlook back very briefly and look ahead and foreshadow some of the issues \nwe will be looking at. Before we leave for this August recess, I would \nlike to look at and review very quickly some of the big, important \nissues we will be tackling this fall.\n  First and foremost, we will focus on one of the most significant and \nhistoric constitutional responsibilities, and that is, as we all know, \nto provide advice and consent on the President's Supreme Court \nnomination. Our goal, as spelled out a little bit earlier is to have a \nfair debate and a dignified debate on Judge Roberts, and to confirm him \nbefore the Supreme Court begins its new term on October 3. We can do \nthat. We will do that.\n  I have worked very closely with the Democratic leader and with the \nPresident and with Senators Specter and\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\nLeahy to lay out a hearing and floor schedule to move the process \nforward in September. To summarize, because we were on the floor a \ncouple of hours ago talking about that in a colloquy, Judge Roberts' \nhearing will begin in the Judiciary Committee on September 6 and \nChairman Specter intends to hold a committee vote on Judge Roberts \nThursday, September 15. We will begin the Senate floor debate no later \nthan the week of Monday, September 26. I look forward to an up-or-down \nconfirmation vote no later than Thursday, September 29.\n  As we approach this process, let me say a couple of words about Judge \nRoberts. He is the best of the best legal minds in America. Everybody \nwho has met him has reflected that. His credentials, so impressive, \nhave reflected that. He is a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard \nLaw School, a lawyer who has served two Presidents and argued 39 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. He is a Federal judge who was unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate to serve on the DC Circuit Court. He has earned \nbipartisan respect as one of the finest appellate advocates in the \nNation.\n  I have had the opportunity to get to know Judge Roberts personally \nover the last several weeks and I, like everyone else, have been so \nimpressed with his intellect and his modest demeanor and his \nwillingness to communicate freely and openly. He will be the kind of \nJustice who will make America proud, embodying the very best of the \nAmerican spirit, embodying the best of the qualities America expects in \na Justice on its highest court: Someone who is smart, fair, impartial, \nand committed to faithfully interpreting the Constitution and the law.\n  As we move this process forward to confirm Judge Roberts, I hope and \nI do believe that the Senate has and will put aside any sort of \npartisan delay or obstruction or personal attacks of judicial nominees.\n  I am concerned with two tactics that have emerged that should concern \nus all--tactics that at first may appear perfectly reasonable but are \nreally designed to thwart the confirmation process. One tactic is \nasking Judge Roberts to prejudge cases and predetermine outcomes that \nthreaten his judicial independence.\n  Some have asked the question: ``whose side is Judge Roberts on?'' in \na particular case. And there is only one appropriate answer to that \nquestion: Judge Roberts is on the side of the Constitution. When he \nputs on the judicial robe and takes a seat on the bench with his fellow \nJustices, he will not be serving as an advocate for a client or a \nparticular point of view. He will serve as a fair and impartial judge \nwho is sworn to uphold the Constitution.\n  The other tactic that concerns me is the fishing expedition for \nconfidential, privileged documents. The Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate will have an extensive and comprehensive record of Judge Roberts \nto review. Already, the White House has released 15,000 pages of \ndocuments from Judge Roberts's service in the Federal Government and is \nexpediting the release of tens of thousands more. The committee also \ncan review the more than 300 cases decided by Judge Roberts, the legal \nbriefs and oral argument transcripts from his 39 cases before the \nSupreme Court, and the 14 hours of hearing transcripts from his \nprevious nomination before the Senate. There will be ample evidence for \nSenators to consider when they vote yes or no on Judge Roberts, without \nrequiring review of confidential, privileged documents he wrote as a \nlawyer for his clients.\n  As we move forward, I urge my colleagues to reject these tactics and \nto work together in a bipartisan way. We must ensure that Judge Roberts \nreceives a fair hearing, and a fair up or down confirmation vote before \nthe Supreme Court begins its new term on October 3.\n  In addition to fulfilling this grave responsibility, we also will be \ncarrying out our duty to protect America's national and economic \nsecurity. The London bombings remind us that the terrorists continue to \nplot and plan their evil acts. We must stay vigilant and tireless in \nour pursuit--breaking up their cells, chasing down the money trail, and \nbringing each and every collaborator to justice.\n  Defending the homeland also requires defending our borders. The \nHomeland Security bill we passed 2 weeks ago adds 2,000 more border \npatrol agents, investigators and detention officers--don't think we \nhave ``deportation officers, per se--to our border team. It expands \nmuch needed detention space so that we can be sure that people caught \nentering the country illegally are not released before their cases are \nprocessed. The Homeland Security bill also provides $340 million for \nU.S. Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology--US VISIT. \nThis new technology will enhance our ability to verify the identity of \nvisitors with visas.\n  We are working hard to secure our borders. Part of that effort also \ninvolves reforming our immigration system. America is a natIon of \nimmigrants. It is what has made us strong, vibrant and a beacon of hope \nto the world. People come to America looking for a better life. And we \nlive better lives because of them. But we must ensure that immigrants \nwho come to America come here legally. Over 7,000 miles of land stretch \nacross our borders. Our ports handle 16 million cargo containers. And \n330 million non-citizens--students, visitors and workers--cross our \nborders every year.\n  Among these visitors is an unprecedented flow of illegal immigrants. \nAnd many of them die in the trying. Last year alone, several hundred \npeople died in the deserts and mountains that separate the United \nStates from Mexico. Most died of exposure to the elements. Some died in \naccidents. An alarming number were murdered. Along Arizona's southern \nborder--the only area for which we have good data--over 20 people died \nas a result of hanging, blunt-force trauma, gun shot wounds and other \napparently deliberate acts during 2004. More corpses may be buried in \nshallow, unmarked graves. We don't keep records. We simply don't know. \nThat is why I am asking the Government Accountability Office to produce \na report on the deaths along our border to guide our future action.\n  These tragedies challenge our standards of compassion. But the sheer \nvastness of the illegal flow also compromises our security.\n  Among those seeking a better life are those seeking to harm our \ncountry. Some bring drugs. Some traffic in human beings. A few may even \nhave links to terrorist groups. The safety and security of every \ncitizen and every visitor who wishes to share in the American dream \nrequires that we reform our laws to strengthen and improve our \nimmigration system.\n  We also will turn to finishing our work on the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. Our troops in the field are depending on it. The \nsecurity of our country depends on it. I thank our distinguished \nchairman, Chairman John Warner, who has been a tremendous leader on \nthis bill and continues to represent the very best, I believe, in what \na Senator should be as he takes that Department of Defense \nauthorization bill through the activities that we must on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  This fall, as we work hard to address the national security concerns, \nwe also will focus on another type of security--economic security, \nstarting with the deficit. For the first time in a decade, we have the \nopportunity to seriously address the national deficit. President Bush \nhas proposed a plan to cut that deficit in half in 5 years. By working \ntogether and rolling up our sleeves, we can hammer out a strategy to \nget this done.\n  We have to start that, I believe, by reducing the rate of Government \ngrowth, and the spending reconciliation bill will deliver real savings \nand strengthen our fiscal position. It has been about 9 years since we \nhave had a spending aspect of that reconciliation bill.\n  A second way we can improve our economic security for working \nfamilies is by permanently repealing the death tax. We all know the \ndeath tax is disruptive. It is unfair. It hurts small businesses. It \ndestroys small businesses and hurts families and the hard-working \npeople they hire. A typical family spends between $30,000 and $150,000 \njust trying to avoid this unfair tax. That alone is enough to start a \nsmall business or create dozens of jobs. Instead, it is simply wasted \nin trying to avoid a tax that is unfair.\n  Last week I, with another Senator, met a small group of business \nowners. The death tax was their very top concern. They talked about how \ntheir\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\nsmall family businesses were hurt--family farms and newspapers, shops \nand factories. So the death tax needs to go. It needs to be put to rest \npermanently. We will be addressing that soon after we return. Another \nissue of fairness that demands our attention is asbestos litigation. We \nhave been grappling with this issue for years. Now it is apparent to \neveryone that asbestos litigation is out of control. More than 700,000 \nindividuals have filed claims; over 8,400 defendant companies have been \nnamed in lawsuits; 300,000 claims are pending right now. More than $70 \nbillion has been spent trying to resolve the claims, driving 77 \ncompanies bankrupt.\n\n  This pace of bankruptcies is accelerating. About a third have taken \nplace in the past 4 years. These are big companies such as Johns \nManville, Owens Corning, U.S. Gypsum, and W.R. Grace. Over 90 percent \nof the industries in America are affected.\n  Even with the billions spent, and the companies bankrupted, very few \nvictims have received adequate compensation. If the victims receive \nanything at all, it is only after suffering long delays while waiting \nfor unpredictable and inequitable awards.\n  The current system has only one real winner--the trial lawyers. \nPlaintiff trial lawyers get more than half of every settlement dollar. \nAnd they are on the hunt for new companies to sue, even companies with \nlittle or no connection to the asbestos problem.\n  Last month, the asbestos fairness bill passed out of committee on a \nbipartisan vote. It is my intention to bring that bill to the floor and \npass it this fall and deliver a system based on fairness and \ncompassion. These are just a few of the issues we will be tackling when \nwe return after the Labor Day recess. We will also work to get our own \nhouse in order and finish the spending bills. And we will vote on the \nissue of Native Hawaiians, as well.\n  We have had an enormously productive 7 months. And I am proud of the \nprogress we have made on behalf of our fellow citizens. When we began \nthe 109th Congress, America faced a number of structural problems \nthreatening our safety, prosperity and freedom. We needed to take bold \naction, so we laid out an ambitious plan. We began by passing the fifth \nfastest budget in Senate history. From there, we pulled together to \npass a comprehensive class action reform bill with nearly three \nquarters of the Senate voting in favor. With this success at our backs, \nwe turned to bankruptcy abuse. And we succeeded in passing the most \nsweeping overhaul of bankruptcy law in 25 years. Like class action, the \nbankruptcy bill passed with broad, bipartisan support. And like class \naction, we voted to restore fairness, integrity and personal \nresponsibility to the legal system.\n  We then moved to the highway bill. For years, America's roads, ports \nand infrastructure have been falling into disrepair. Our highways and \ncity streets have become choked with 24-hour traffic. For millions of \nworkers, commuting has become a daily nightmare. Finally, after 3 years \nof hard work and negotiation, over a dozen hearings, and countless \nhours of testimony, we passed the highway bill by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. Communities will finally receive the funding they need \nto improve their roads and ports. And America's drivers will face less \ntime sitting in traffic, wasting time and burning up gas. Which brings \nme to energy.\n\n  Yesterday, in an historic vote, the Senate passed America's most \ncomprehensive energy plan in 40 years. After years of careful and \npatient negotiation, we finally delivered an energy plan that promises \nto make America safer and more secure, and our energy supply cleaner \nand more reliable.\n  In seven short months, we tackled big issues and got big results. \nTogether we moved America forward. We broke the impasse that was \ncrippling the judicial nomination process. We passed the Central \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement which promises to strengthen our own \nsecurity and prosperity in the Western hemisphere. CAFTA will create \nour second largest export market in Latin America, behind only Mexico. \nFrom Washington State apples to Florida oranges, America's producers \nwill thrive. And Central America's democracies will benefit.\n  We renewed our commitment to our troops and the war on terror. And \ntonight, by unanimous consent, we passed the Patriot Act and will send \nit to conference with the House. The Patriot Act is an essential tool \nin this new war on terror. It allows us to track and stop terrorists \nbefore they are able to kill innocent people. Through it, our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities are working more closely \ntogether toward the common goal of keeping America safe. We face a \ndifferent kind of enemy--one that hides in far away lands, and among us \nright here at home. The Patriot Act will help defeat terrorist cells \noperating right here in America.\n  We are working hard to defeat terrorism on all fronts. On the \nbattlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. In our own backyard. And at its \nthe roots: the evil and murderous ideology that seeks the destruction \nof our way of life. And we are winning. Our steady commitment to the \nspread of democracy is beginning to bear fruit. Elections are taking \nhold in the Middle East--in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Palestinian \nTerritories, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.\n  A new Pew Research poll shows that growing confidence in the Muslim \nworld that America truly supports democracy for their people. And even \nmore encouraging, a growing number believe that democracy can work.\n  America's policies both here at home and abroad are making America \nstronger and more secure. With continued hard work and determination, \nwe can keep the ball moving forward.\n  We have a lot to do when we get back. I am confident that with the \nPresident and the House as partners, we will continue to deliver \nmeaningful solutions to the American people. I am confident that we \nwill continue to secure a freer, safer and healthier future for \ngenerations of Americans to come. I wish my colleagues a happy, restful \nand productive August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/29/senate-section/article/S9588-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
