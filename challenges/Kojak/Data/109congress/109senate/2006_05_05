Mr. President, I will set up those votes in a bit, but I \nwant to speak to one of the issues that we will be voting on Monday \nnight, and that is the medical malpractice liability issue which, in \nmany ways, is destroying the practice of medicine today. As one who has \nspent longer in the profession of a physician/doctor than I have in \npolitics, this is something that hurts me as I look to what it is doing \nto patients, to consumers, to all Americans as it drives up their \nhealth care costs unnecessarily, wastefully, but then, even more \nimportantly than that, it affects access to health care. Literally, we \nhave expectant moms today who are having to worry whether there will be \nan obstetrician there to deliver their baby.\n  We have right now people who should be worrying, if they are in an \naccident today driving to work or driving home from work, about whether \nthere will be a trauma surgeon once they arrive at a hospital. That is \nthe threshold we have reached, affecting access, affecting cost, and \naffecting availability of health care.\n  A couple years ago, I took my son Harrison, who is in college, to \nOhio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Those were the hot States during the \nlast Presidential campaign. I took him to be\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nwith him, and he observed a lot as we went to those three States.\n  It is interesting, those three States also happen to be three States \nthat have been most dramatically impacted by the skyrocketing health \ncare medical liability premiums. Because I am a physician, when I went \nto these town meetings or we would go to cafes, physicians would come \nup, their spouses would come up, their family members would come up and \ntalk with me and pull me aside--Harrison would be at my side--and say: \nDr. Frist, something has to change. My dad was a physician. I am in \npractice with my dad. Right now we are going to have to dissolve our \npractice because our health care liability malpractice premiums have \ngotten so high we simply cannot afford to stay in business.\n\n  Then the discussion would continue a little bit and someone else \nwould come up, and Harrison would be listening--at the time studying \npre-med as well as history--and they would say: Dr. Frist, right now I \nam going to get sued. I just got out of my residency, and I am going to \nget sued on average three times in the next 10 or 15 years, sued not \njust for $1,000 or $5,000 but for $1 million or $4 million or $5 \nmillion, even if I have done nothing wrong.\n  What hurt me about this is when we got back home after traveling \naround, Harrison took me aside and said: Dad, I know your dad--his \ngrandfather, my dad--was a physician who practiced 55 years in family \npractice in cardiology in Middleton, TN. Harrison said: Dad, you love \nthat noble profession of medicine, surgery, heart and lung transplants \nand healing, but why in the world would you encourage me, your son, to \ngo into a profession that right now, based on what I have heard as we \nhave gone around the country, is being destroyed by predatory personal \ninjury trial lawyers and frivolous lawsuits?\n  It is a hard question to answer. I probably told him it's a noble \nprofession and there's nothing greater than the healing process. But he \nlooked at me and said: Dad, why would I subject my future wife and my \nfamily to lawsuit after lawsuit if I have done nothing wrong? Why would \nI jeopardize my own family no matter how noble that profession is?\n  I tell that story because it is personal in many ways, but I think it \nsignifies why it is important for us to be allowed to proceed to debate \nhow we can solve--probably not totally solve but help solve what has \ngotten out of control in our medical liability system today.\n  Across the country, rising medical malpractice premiums are driving \ndoctors from the practice of medicine, limiting access to care. What \nthat means is that your health care costs, my colleagues' health care \ncosts, the American people, everybody's health care costs are driven up \nunnecessarily and access is diminished. Doctors leave the practice of \nmedicine or they move to States where this may not be quite as big a \nproblem, and when you need a doctor, they are not there.\n  Across the country, one out of two counties do not have an \nobstetrician/gynecologist to deliver a baby or to manage that \ncomplication from an expectant mom. Seventy-five percent of \nneurosurgeons today no longer operate on children, and an even higher \nnumber have made a decision not to take a trauma call at a hospital. \nThese are highly trained neurosurgeons, surgeons who focus on the brain \nand the back, on the neurological system, which is usually damaged if \nyou are in a motor vehicle accident or any kind of blunt trauma \naccident. They basically said: We are not going to take the call; why \nsubject ourselves to these exorbitant, frivolous lawsuits that affect \nour access, access for our children, for our families.\n  My own State of Tennessee the other day was put on the crisis list, \none of 20 States now in crisis; 81 out of 95 counties in Tennessee \ndon't have a neurosurgeon; half don't have an orthopedic surgeon, an \nemergency physician or an OB/GYN.\n  So we see these unnecessarily high malpractice premiums driving \ndoctors out of the State, out of the profession. The average \nmalpractice premiums in my State of Tennessee have increased a whopping \n89 percent in the past 6 years. Again, these premium increases drive up \nthe cost of your health care.\n  Doctors pass on the premiums they have to pay to the insurance \ncompany and the insurance company passes it on to you, so it affects \neverybody's health care unnecessarily.\n  Without reforms, over two-thirds of Tennessee physicians report they \nare contemplating early retirement or just totally changing careers. \nDr. Steven Stack, a 34-year-old emergency doctor from Memphis is moving \nto Lexington, KY, to escape the litigation lottery. He told me the \nfollowing:\n\n       The high risk nature of my chosen speciality, the \n     associated predator tactics of the trial bar, and very \n     unreasonable and unfunded regulatory burdens imposed by \n     governmental agencies have robbed me of much of the \n     professional satisfaction I otherwise receive in caring for \n     the health of my patients. . . . A fair number of my friends \n     share my disillusionment and hope to leave the practice of \n     medicine as expeditiously as possible.\n\n  Dr. Stack and his friends he referred to are far from alone. We all \nhear it. We get the letters. We get the e-mails. We have the \nconversations.\n  Dr. Justin Hensley of Johnson City, TN, says:\n\n       As a Tennessee resident and having grown up in Knoxville, \n     it pains me that I will choose to do my residency and \n     practice in another State simply because the climate in my \n     State is unbearable. My fiancee, who is also a resident and \n     medical student, feels the same way.\n\n  The issue is even affecting the futures of medical students, the \nfuture of medicine, the people who will be delivering care to our \nchildren, to the next generation.\n  Patrick Emerson, writing from Memphis, reports:\n\n       As a medical student here in Tennessee, the issue of \n     medical liability is definitely a concern both to me and many \n     of my classmates. The issue is going to shape our decisions \n     in medicine drastically in the coming years, from what \n     speciality we pick to what tests we order for our patients. \n     Without reform, we are doing a grave injustice to our fellow \n     citizens of Tennessee by depriving them of cost-effective and \n     efficient care.\n\n  Patrick's story is one of the many stories that are pouring in. The \nbottom line: The system is broken and it needs to be fixed. The good \nnews, on the optimistic side, is if we are allowed to, we can fix it. \nWe can make this problem go away.\n  It is not just the bad doctors who are getting sued. People will say \nwe have to have a strong medical liability system, strong medical \nmalpractice system. I agree, I have been right in the middle of it. I \nhave been right in the middle of where medicine is practiced, and with \nthe complexity, the technology, the great miracles that can be done, is \nstill subject to malpractice, still subject to medical errors--and I \nknow that--and we need to have a fair, commonsense, balanced \ncompensation system that punishes malpractice. But good doctors are \ngetting dragged into this as well.\n  Consider this one statistic: Of those who have practiced in Tennessee \nfor the past 10 years, in my profession, heart surgery, 100 percent of \ncardiac surgeons have been sued. Of those who have been in practice 10 \nyears, 92 percent of orthopedic surgeons, bone doctors, have been sued; \n70 percent of all doctors have faced legal action.\n  That is common sense, and the American people get it. But I am not \nsure all of our colleagues get it. Does it make sense or does anybody \nbelieve that all heart surgeons in Tennessee are bad or that all are \ncommitting malpractice, bad practice or that 7 of 10 doctors across the \nState deserve to be sued? Of course not. The system is out of control. \nThe problem affects not just my State but patients and doctors from \nacross the country. Rising medical liability premiums are increasing \nbecause of health care for every American. Again, it is common sense. \nThe statistic is that 8 out of 10 doctors practice defensive medicine--\ndefensive medicine--to fend off these frivolous lawsuits, and it makes \nsense. Right now, if you know with almost 100 percent certainty or 70 \npercent certainty that you are going to be sued no matter what you do--\nno matter what you do--what you are going to do is put a paper trail \nout there that will protect you in the courtroom. It makes sense. You \nwant to protect yourself, and that is what you will do. You prescribe a \nfew extra tests that are not necessary--something you wouldn't do \notherwise. You prescribe an extra blood test, maybe an extra CAT scan, \nmaybe an extra positron emission tomography, an extra fluorodeoxy with \nglucose, a\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nPET scan--unnecessary, totally unnecessary, but you do it because the \nlikelihood is you are going to be sued. You do it to have that whole \npaper record there showing that you did the right thing. That is a \ncost. It is a huge cost, and it is a waste of money. It doesn't result \nin better patient care. It is a total waste.\n\n  Again, it gives me a sense of optimism because if you omit this \nwaste--I would call it fraud--this abuse out of the system, everybody's \ncost of health care goes down.\n  It is estimated that the defensive medicine costs in this country are \nover $100 billion. Wasted money. It is not Government money, it is your \nmoney. It is the American people's money. It is not even your tax \ndollars, it is how much you have to pay for that health care premium. \nThat is why, if you are uninsured, you can't afford an insurance \npolicy, because the cost of your insurance policy is too high.\n  Last month, I was in Texas, and again it is remarkable because \nmedical liability reform is alive and well there, and it is working. I \ntalked to patients, I talked to doctors, and I talked to nurses, and it \nis working. Since 2003, medical malpractice claims, following their \nreform, have dropped by at least 80 percent in most Texas counties. I \ntalked just moments ago about physicians fleeing States because of \nmedical liability, and since their reform was put in place, 3,000 \ndoctors haven't fled that State but are coming back into that State \ntoday. We need to get on board with that reform movement.\n  When children who are dying of cancer can't get the lifesaving \nsurgery they need, when a mother is forced to drive hundreds of miles \nto a doctor just to have her baby delivered, when doctors who have \nspent years training, years training and sacrificing to give people \nhope are having to leave the practice of medicine, it is time for us to \nact.\n  In a few moments, I will be filing cloture on the medical liability \nbill, and on Monday we will have those votes. I know a number of my \ncolleagues will come by today and on Monday to explain the legislation \nas well as make the case of the importance of that legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues, for the sake of all Americans and every citizen who is \neither walking into a doctor's office now or who will walk into a \ndoctor's office in the future, that we vote to move forward on this \nbill.\n  I have seen firsthand that we have the best medicine in the world. \nThe fact that I was able to do heart transplants with the technology on \na routine basis, the fact that I was able to do lung transplants on a \nroutine basis or to use that positron emission tomography to make a \ndiagnosis on the metabolic processes of the heart or the brain today is \ntruly astounding because it translates into better health care for all. \nWe have the best doctors, we have the best medical schools, and we have \nthe best hospitals in the world. We have the best laboratories. We have \nthe best universities and schools. I have been a beneficiary of that, \nand I have witnessed it. But we have a broken medical liability system, \nand it is bringing down that greatness. By pulling together, we are \ngoing to be able to deliver to the American people a system that works, \nand this will be a major step forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4095-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEDICAL CARE ACCESS PROTECTION ACT OF 2006--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I withdraw the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, May 8, the \ntime for debate be divided as follows: 1:30 p.m. to 2 p.m, minority \ncontrol; and 2 p.m. to 2:30 p.m., majority control. Further, that the \ntime rotate under this format, with the final time from 5 p.m. to 5:15 \np.m. under majority control. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the \nthree live quorums related to the cloture motions be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to summarize what we just went through and \nwhere we are, we have scheduled for next week the consideration of \nseveral important bills related to health care.\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nGiven the objection to the motion to proceed to these bills, it was \nnecessary to file cloture motions on the motions to proceed; thus, we \nnow have scheduled up to two cloture motions on Monday at 5:15, \nbeginning at 5:15. The first will be on a motion to proceed to the \nMedical Care Access Protection Act, and the second vote will be on the \ncloture motion relative to the motion to proceed to the Healthy Mothers \nand Healthy Babies Access to Care Act. If those cloture motions fail, \non Tuesday morning we will have a cloture vote on proceeding to the \nSmall Business Health Plans legislation.\n  Mr. President, the way this is configured is that we have a vote on \nthe first medical liability bill, which is a comprehensive bill built \npretty much on this Texas model that I referred to in my earlier \nremarks. If that is successful, we will continue the debate on that. If \nit is not, we would continue with another medical liability bill that \nhas a slightly different focus to it, again based on the Texas model. \nIt will focus on in particular where medical liability premiums are \nfelt most acutely: in women's health care and babies' health care, \npediatrics and maternal health care, and that is obstetricians and \ngynecologists. I hope we will be allowed to proceed and debate on those \ntwo. We will be voting on both of those, or at least one of those but \nup to two on Monday night, with no votes after those two votes on \nMonday night.\n  Depending on the outcome but following whatever that outcome is, we \nwill turn to the small business health reform plans. The small business \nhealth plans, as we know, have the potential for addressing many of the \nissues I talked to earlier--the cost issue, the access issue, and the \nquality issue as well--because what they do is allow small businesses--\nand most businesses in this country are small businesses; they create \nabout three-quarters of the jobs in this country--they allow small \nbusinesses to group together so that they will have that purchasing \nclout which we know comes with numbers. When we add that purchasing \nclout, you can go and bargain for better prices, negotiate for better \nprices, and with that comes a lower cost of health care to all people \nwho work in small businesses that participate. With that, people who \ndon't have health care today who work for small businesses will be able \nto get a plan that is within reach, instead of the hugely expensive \nplans that are out there today.\n  So I am very excited about addressing the skyrocketing costs of \nhealth care head-on: choice, consumerism, patient-centered health care, \nall of which will be centered on the medical liability issue we will be \ndebating and the small business health plans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to S. 22, so that \nSenators may speak to that motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of the morning we will have \nvarious speakers coming in to talk about a number of issues focusing on \nthe issues I have spoken to on health care and the cost of health care \nand how it affects people in their everyday lives.\n\n\n        Cinco De Mayo and The Contributions of Mexican Americans\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also will take a moment to interject what \nis a celebration today. It started with two events that happened 144 \nyears ago this week, two events that signify great advances in the \nhistory of freedom in North America.\n  On May 1, 1862, Admiral David G. Farragut--the first Latino flag \nofficer in any branch of the U.S. military and the first person awarded \nthe rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy--won a decisive engagement with \nConfederate naval vessels in New Orleans Harbor.\n  This was, perhaps, the most important naval engagement of the Civil \nWar.\n  While almost 3 more years of difficult fighting still awaited Union \ntroops, Farragut's victory at New Orleans: cut the Confederacy in half; \ngranted union forces control of the Mississippi; contributed greatly to \nthe Union victory; and, in turn, helped end slavery.\n  As Farragut's troops occupied the city of New Orleans, another event \nover 1,000 miles away was unfolding.\n  On May 5, 1862, a fighting force of 2,000 peasants confronted 6,000 \nwell-equipped and expertly trained French troops. The French had come \nto conquer the small town. Instead, they found a fierce and proud \nresistance, and the peasant army prevailed.\n  A Mexican defeat that day could have even undone Farragut's victory \nat New Orleans.\n  French Emperor Napoleon III hated the United States and had clear \nsympathies with the Confederacy and its slave-holding culture.\n  With a base in Mexico, Napoleon's forces might have crossed the Rio \nGrande to offer support to the South in its battle with Union forces.\n  And Union forces were fully aware of the threat. General Phillip \nSheridan supplied the Mexicans with the ammunition and equipment they \nneeded to expel the French. Some Americans even joined the Mexican \nArmy.\n  The battles were waged and won.\n  The Union prevailed, and Mexico successfully fought off the French \ninvasion.\n  The Mexican victory on Cinco de Mayo wiped the last vestige of \nindigenous monarchy from the North American continent.\n  As the Cinco de Mayo story illustrates, our countries have a long and \nintertwined history. It has, at times, been a difficult one. But it has \nalso been one of shared victory.\n  Cinco de Mayo also gives us an opportunity to recognize the \ninvaluable contributions of Mexican Americans to our culture.\n  Through their vibrant traditions and deep commitment to faith, \nfamily, and country, Mexican Americans have enriched our society.\n  They are our friends and neighbors, our fellow citizens and \nprotectors. Citizens of Mexican descent are, at this very moment, \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect the American homeland.\n  So, today, we celebrate the unique contributions of our Mexican \nAmerican comrades, and we toast our future, shared achievements.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today 46 million Americans are living with \nno health insurance.\n  I am not sure everyone understands what it means to have no health \ninsurance. We as Senators don't have a problem with that. We have \ninsurance. I think it is very good insurance.\n  I can remember my parents having no health insurance when my dad \nworked in the mines. Once in a while he would go someplace else to work \nand he would have some insurance. After my dad passed away my mother \nhad Medicare. That was the best insurance she ever had.\n  You would think that since I was a boy, America would have made \nprogress in this health care problem, but it has gone the other way. \nMore people are uninsured now than before. There is a real health care \ncrisis in America today. The crisis can be felt in people's homes, in \nneighborhoods, in the workplace, and even corporate board rooms because \nthey realize it is a problem when 46 million people have no health \ninsurance.\n  Health care costs are going up and up. In all of the newspapers \naround America today there is an article which talks about what has \nhappened. More people are forced to opt out of employers' insurance, \nthe article says. A growing number of Americans who\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nwork for companies that offer health insurance are having to turn it \ndown. Many companies don't offer insurance, but even at those that do, \npeople can't afford to opt into the system. Why? Because of a 42-\npercent jump in premiums over five years.\n  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said 3 million fewer U.S. workers \neligible for employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in 2003 \ncompared with 1998.\n  Even where insurance is available people are not opting into it. Why? \nBecause now it costs on average $3,481 to be able to afford this \ninsurance for an employer-sponsored individual policy. And these \nstatistics from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are 3 years old.\n  It would be far more than that now.\n  Health care costs too much. Premiums are going up. Premiums have \nincreased 70 percent since the year 2000. It has crippled businesses, \nincluding some of the stalwarts in American society such as Ford and \nGM. And the cost of prescription drugs is part of that.\n  The Medicare drug plan has been a mess, to say the least. In Nevada, \na relatively small State in numbers of people, almost a half million \npeople have no health insurance. More than 100,000 children have no \nhealth insurance in Nevada.\n  Then there is the fact that many diseases could be cured, which would \ncut down on the cost of health care, diseases such as diabetes, \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's. We don't know all of them for which we are \nlooking for a cure.\n  Of course, we can't move forward in research because the Republican \nmajority refuses to allow us to move forward with this crucial \nlegislation.\n  We need a new direction in health care. Republicans have had 5\\1/2\\ \nyears to put their arms around this crisis. But even with control of \nthe White House, the Senate, and the House, they failed. They continue \nto hold in their arms the insurance industry.\n  Next week, Republicans have scheduled what they call a Health Care \nWeek. This is really a mini debate in an area where we have a major \ncrisis--the Republican approach to a national emergency is one that \nbrings a number of questions to mind.\n  My first question is, Why has it taken so long even to have a mini \ndebate?\n  We are about 80 percent of the way through this 109th Congress. We \nhave spent weeks and weeks picking fights over radical judges and weeks \nto help big business on issues such as class actions and asbestos.\n  With a national emergency on health care we are going to spend a \nhandful of days, literally. This Health Care Week is a public relations \ngimmick--something like the ``Mission Accomplished.''\n  The majority couldn't be serious about helping American people with \nhealth care and do what we are expected to do about health care in a \nweek.\n  My second question is, Who do the Republicans want to help? The \npeople getting help under this Republican majority are special \ninterests. Not the people we have tried to break through and have the \nmiddle-class American people represented in Congress. Republicans don't \nhave a single prescription for America's health care emergency, except \nthat they have a cabinet full of medicine to fatten big business.\n  On Monday, they want to have a vote on this same, tired medical \nmalpractice bill that we have defeated day in, day out, week in, week \nout, month after month, year after year.\n  They keep bringing them up and having them defeated. Why? Because \nthey do not mean anything to the American people.\n  If we are going to do something about health care, are we going to do \nsomething that just makes the insurance industry even bigger and \nstronger and fatter than it now is?\n  That is what these medical malpractice bills do; they enrich the \ninsurance industry and do nothing to help working Americans.\n  Nevada is a good example. A few years ago, we were told there was a \nmedical malpractice ``crisis'' in Nevada. The Republican Governor \ncalled a special session of the legislature. They set caps on pain and \nsuffering damages.\n  Who has benefitted? Not those people who have the wrong leg taken off \nin surgery, or who have been given the wrong medicine in surgery. And \nthe doctors haven't benefitted either.\n  The insurance rates in Nevada haven't gone down. Let me repeat that, \nin the few years since that legislation passed, insurance rates have \nnot gone down in Nevada for doctors. That ``crisis'' was something that \nwas put forward by the insurance industry, and they have done well--\nthey are paying victims less but they are still charging doctors the \nsame high premiums.\n  The insurance industry wants to have this benefit in every state, \neven the states that have refused to enact caps on damages. It's the \nsame old story. Last Congress, the Senate rejected three times \nvirtually identical bills--the same one-size-fits-all medical \nmalpractice bill for the most seriously injured victims.\n  It's true that people make mistakes. But when you are talking about \nmedicine, these mistakes can be very serious. Most of these mistakes \naren't made in a wanton fashion. Rarely does that happen. But people \nmake mistakes. They are negligent.\n  Two years ago or so, I went to Walter Reed for surgery on my left \nfoot. They wheeled me into the operating room, and as I am laying there \ngetting ready for the surgery. I asked the doctor and the people in \nattendance: Why do you have a black mark on my right foot?\n  They said: That is where we are going to do the surgery.\n  Luckily, I pointed out that they had marked the wrong foot. So they \nerased the black mark on my right foot and did the surgery on the left \nfoot, the correct one.\n  This surgery was not life threatening to me, but it took 4 or 5 \nmonths for me to recover from the surgery to the foot that needed it, \nlet alone if I'd have had to recover also for a foot that didn't. \nPeople make mistakes.\n  That is what medical malpractice is all about. Doctors make mistakes \nand hurt people. In our system of fairness and justice, the only way to \nrespond is with dollars. To set these arbitrary caps to save the \ninsurance industry is senseless and unfair.\n  Not one of these bills we are going to take up next week has anything \nto do with helping people with their health care.\n  One bill they claim will help small business. The others they claim \nwill help patients and doctors. These bills will do just the opposite.\n  In the Orwellian world in which we find ourselves in Washington, \nunder Republican control, whatever they say it does just the \nopposite. Far from helping, the measure dealing with small business \nhealth care, for example, that we will get to next week, threatens the \ncoverage of those who have insurance now. It does nothing to extend \ncoverage to those who need it. It gives control of our health care to \nthe insurance companies even more. Insurers, not doctors, will decide \nif you get coverage and what you will be charged. That is what the \nlegislation is about.\n\n  After these three bills, we are done with health care this year. That \nis enough. We have had health care week. Three bills that do nothing, \nand we are done with health care and on to something else.\n  The third question: Why is this majority refusing to consider real \nsolutions to Americans' health care problems in their so-called health \ncare week? I applaud my colleagues for recognizing health care deserves \nthe Senate time. But the agenda is frightening. A Republican in the \nWhite House, both Houses of Congress controlled by Republicans--\nexcuses? They should have none. They have it all. But they have given \nAmerica nothing.\n  Where, for example, is stem cell research? Where are Medicare \nimprovements? Where is relief for the uninsured and small businesses in \nthis country?\n  In one bill, sponsored by Senators Baucus, Lincoln, and Durbin, they \nhave health care legislation in the Senate that would actually help \nsmall businesses. It would give them the ability to pool and choose \nfrom the same health care options that we as Senators have. If it is \ngood enough for us, why don't we give everyone the same opportunity we \nhave, and do it soon--such as next week?\n  Senator Leahy, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has \ninsurance reform legislation that brings the\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\ninsurance industry under the Federal antitrust laws. Right now, the \ninsurance industry can conspire and fix prices and do all kinds of \nthings other businesses cannot do because they are not subject to \nantitrust laws. Why is the insurance industry exempt? Because of the \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act. I am sorry to report that a Nevada Senator by \nthe name of Pat McCarran has his name affixed to some of the most \nunfair legislation this country has ever seen.\n  It was enacted during the height of the Depression when Senator \nMcCarran and a man by the name of Ferguson, a Member of Congress, got \ntogether and said, let's give the insurance industry a break. We will \nnot have the Sherman Antitrust Act apply to them.\n  The legislation was supposed to be in existence for a couple years, \nbut 70-plus years, it is still in effect. Who is the biggest, most \npowerful industry in America? It is the insurance industry, yet they \nare not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. The only other business \nthat isn't subject is professional baseball, major league baseball. \nSenator Leahy wants to change this. I support him in this. This is a \nreal way to bring insurance premiums in line and really help doctors \nand health costs. Make the insurance industry subject to the same laws \nall other industries are subject to and premiums will go down.\n  What about stem cell research? We talked about that yesterday. \nSenator Frist said he is going to bring it up. I hope he does. I talked \nto him about that before. Time is running out. Every day we wait to \ngive our scientists the tools they need is another day of suffering for \nmillions of Americans, fearing they will never have the opportunity to \nhave their loved ones or themselves cured of these dreaded diseases. We \nneed this groundbreaking research. If the Government acted in the 1940s \nand 1950s such as the Republicans are acting today, we would not have a \nvaccine for polio.\n  Where is Medicare on the Republican agenda? After May 15th, a few \ndays from now, any people who have not signed up for this flawed plan \nhave to wait until next year. And next year when they sign up, they \nhave to pay a penalty. They cannot sign up in the meantime. They have \nto wait until next year.\n  Five months after this program has gone into effect, it is still \nmired in confusion and red tape.\n  A real health care week would fix Medicare's problems, extend the May \n15 deadline, it might eliminate penalty from the President's drug \nprogram, and include a repeal of Medicare's prohibition from \nnegotiating with drug companies for cheaper prescription drug prices.\n  Isn't it hard to comprehend that Medicare cannot bargain for lower \nprices for the drugs they purchase? CVS can. Rite-Aid can but not \nMedicare. Why? Because when that bill was written, they wanted to give \nan unfair advantage to the drug companies. And they gave it to them.\n  America's health care crisis is real. Unfortunately, the majority's \ncommitment to solving it is not. Next week, as we did with gas prices, \nRepublican actions will tell us they care about health care, as they \ncared about gasoline prices. The best they could come up with was a \n$100 rebate which has been panned in every newspaper and by every \ncommentator in America the last 10 days.\n  It is not what they say they stand for, it is whom they stand for \nthat matters. And it is not for the American people. With their health \ncare week, the majority is making it very clear they stand with \ninsurance companies, not the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I, for one, am pleased we are moving \nforward this next week with the health care agenda in an attempt to \nhold down the costs of health care.\n  My colleague who just spoke said: I don't think any Senators have \never experienced life without health insurance. Before I came to the \nSenate, I didn't have health insurance. So I come to the Senate today \nas a small businessman who has had to struggle with the costs of health \ninsurance in my small business. I also had to struggle with my \nemployees, making sure that they had appropriate health insurance to \nmeet the immediate needs of their family.\n  The fact that the majority leader has decided this next week to \ndeclare health care week to help put forth three pieces of legislation, \nSenate bills 22 and 23 which deal with liability reform is great. We \ncannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the fact that \nlawyers, some way or the other, do not contribute to the cost of health \ncare. The fact is, the threat of lawsuits do add to the cost of health \ncare.\n  Finally, I am pleased one of the bills coming forward in the Senate \nis the bill allowing small businesses to form associations. Then, as a \npurchasing unit, they have more power in the marketplace and can \nnegotiate cheaper health insurance policies as a general rule. It does \nnot happen all the time. But at least it gives the small businessman \none more tool in trying to hold down the costs of health care.\n  As a small businessman, I had to struggle to maintain health coverage \nin my veterinarian practice and reached the point at one time where I \nsaid: I think what we finally need to do, as a small businessman I \ncannot afford health insurance, so we will work with each individual \nemployee and give them extra pay so they can go out and shop for their \nown health insurance. So many times when you have small businesses, as \nI did, you become the first employer of many new employees entering \ninto the workplace. With the idea they would be somewhat mobile and \nmoving around from one employer to another for the next few years, we \ndecided that was okay, and my wife and I decided to begin setting aside \nour own savings account to pay for health care costs in case, for some \nreason or another, I had an incident or she had an incident where we \nneeded to go to the hospital and have some health care.\n  Being a veterinarian and lifting heavy dogs on the exam table all the \ntime and not expecting the dog owner to pick up the other half of a \nGreat Dane, I ended up having back problems and had to have back \nsurgery. I didn't have health insurance. I paid for it myself out of my \nown pocket. Fortunately, my wife and I had the foresight to set aside a \nsavings plan so that if something such as this did happen, we could pay \nfor it. But it set us back. We were able to survive that particular \nincident. It was kind of an interesting thing. They did not want us to \ngo into the hospital. They would not let us in because we did not have \nhealth insurance. I said: I will pay for it. When we got in there, we \nhad the surgery, and I did very well, and I am very active today. \nConsequently, they did a great job on the surgery, and when we checked \nout of the hospital, they said they would reduce our costs 20 percent \nbecause ``we do not have to deal with the paperwork of dealing with the \ncosts of having to process your claim.''\n  So much of the paperwork is driven by trying to protect themselves \nfrom frivolous lawsuits. That has been my personal experience.\n  That is why I am in the Senate today talking in favor of Senate bill \n22, called the Medical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, which is a \ncomprehensive liability reform bill, and in support of Senate bill 23, \nwhich is called the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Health \nCare Act, and talking in favor of the association health plans bill \nthat allow small businesses to come together and form associations so \nthey can, as a bargaining unit, bargain down and get a more reasonable \ncost on their health insurance.\n  What happens if we do nothing? Right now there are many smart young \nmen and women across the country who are being literally driven away \nfrom the health care industry. We are attracting fewer and fewer high-\nquality medical students than ever before. In some States and some \nspecialties, practicing doctors are actually leaving their professions \nbehind.\n  A little later on I will give you the experiences of a doctor in a \nrural community who is actually preparing to leave his profession \nbecause of the high cost of health insurance. Most of it is because of \nthe high liability insurance, and it is extremely prohibitive for young \nstudents and doctors to stay in a field they cannot afford because of \nthe high liability insurance costs. This is creating a problem for \npatients in\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nhealth care across the country but particularly in the rural areas. I \nwill address that later on.\n  Doctors are more reluctant to perform complex and high-risk medical \nprocedures such as those involving pediatric orthopedics and spine \nsurgery. It is not an easy procedure having to repair the bone of a \nfractured infant or having to do spinal surgeries as I experienced. \nThis puts patients' access to emergency and trauma care at risk, also, \nbecause this is another high-risk area. Many times, you have to tailor \nthe treatment plan to what is happening with the patient. There is not \nalways a textbook approach, where you treat every patient exactly the \nsame. Every patient is a little bit different.\n  Doctors are moving to States with a more favorable medical liability \nclimate, leaving some areas underserved. In the State of Colorado, \nwhich I proudly represent, about a decade ago we did a lot to try and \nhold down the costs of medical insurance. We dealt with a lot of \naspects of medical liability reform. Many of those we have in this \nbill, but we actually went further than what is in the bill.\n  The bottom line is, in Colorado, we were able to hold down the costs \nof medical insurance for medical doctors fairly significantly. One of \nthe problems that happened in States such as Colorado, although we had \ndone a lot of things to hold down the cost of health insurance, we \nfound because health insurance companies pool their risks from States \nother than Colorado, we did not have the impact in some cases we \nexpected to have because other States have not done that much in trying \nto hold down the cost of health insurance and liability problems that \ndoctors incur when they are in their practices.\n  We were disappointed in that regard. That is why I, as a Senator, \nfeel we need to have a national approach to this problem. That is \nbecause there is a lot of variation out there between States, and those \nStates that are not doing anything have an adverse impact on States \nsuch as Colorado that are willing to step forward and try to reduce the \nliability risk and to reduce frivolous lawsuits.\n\n  Now, in Colorado, we are lucky enough today to already have had some \nliability reform for frivolous lawsuits. But across the Nation, States \nare experiencing extreme shortages in health care professionals because \nof the cost of liability insurance.\n  Now, another thing that may happen if we do not do anything is that \nmedical students that may eventually wish to settle in States such as \nColorado, but cannot because they cannot get the training they need \nbecause they cannot afford the liability insurance in States where they \nhave to go to do their residency. We have a medical school in Colorado, \nbut lots of times medical students are encouraged, with their residency \nand whatnot, to go to other hospitals and other institutions because \neverybody has a little bit different view of how they are going to \nhandle different types of cases, and this exposes them to different \npoints of view, so they can make up their mind what best works for \nthem. So they will lose that opportunity.\n  Now, the bill, S. 22, would create a graduated cap system similar to \nwhat was just put in place in Texas. If we look at the Texas model, we \nhave seen some remarkable results. But the bill would provide for \nunlimited economic damages. So if the patient wins a lawsuit against a \nmedical doctor to provide for a decent living for their family, then \nthey can collect those economic damages. It provides a stacked cap \nmodel that would keep non-economic damages at or below $750,000. They \nbreak it out this way: There would be up to $250,000 from a decision \nrendered against a health care provider and $250,000 from a decision \nrendered against a single health care institution and $250,000 from a \ndecision rendered against more than one health care institution, not to \nexceed $500,000. It also provides punitive damages, but those are not \nto be any greater than twice the economic damage award or $250,000.\n  This bill also guarantees that lawsuits are filed no later than 3 \nyears after the injury and extends the statute of limitations for \nminors injured before age 6. Under the age of 6, not always does an \nincident emerge right away. So if you have too short of a statute of \nliability, then it does create a problem for the patient. So this bill \nalso looks at what we can do to take care of legitimate lawsuits that \npatients might have. This is one of the aspects which is provided for \nin the bill we have before us.\n  The language also intends to maximize patient recovery of payment by \nfocusing on attorney payment regulations. It also establishes standards \nfor expert witness rules, promotes fairness in the recovery of health \nbenefits, and attempts to prevent double recovery.\n  It keeps the focus on the patient by attempting to curtail frivolous \nlawsuits, which is the key.\n  I mentioned Texas earlier in my comments, where there was legislation \nthat was recently put into effect. Here is what happened in that State \nsince September of 2003. They have added nearly 4,000 doctors in their \nState. Insurance premiums have declined. The number of lawsuits filed \nagainst doctors has been cut in half. Those are very significant \nevents. It is similar to what we experienced in the State of Colorado \nwhen we passed a far-ranging liability reform bill.\n  Currently, we are at a crossroads on a very controversial issue.\n  Now, in the interest of my constituents, I have cosponsored this \nparticular piece of legislation, S. 22, the Medical Care Access \nProtection Act of 2006. It still allows for individuals to file claims \nfor compensation for all economic damages they have incurred and allows \nfor a reasonable amount of punitive damages.\n  Now, I have a few anecdotal situations I would like to talk about \nthat affected Colorado. These are doctors who came and visited my \noffice, and here is what they had to say, why they think we had to have \nmedical liability reform.\n  The first one is about a medical doctor in Ft. Morgan. It is a \nrelatively small rural town in northeastern Colorado. He expressed his \nconcern in having to stop accepting new patients. He was concerned that \nwith the rising costs of liability insurance, he would no longer be \nable to afford to accept new patients with the amount he is reimbursed. \nEven more distressing for this doctor in rural Colorado was the fact \nthat he was going to have to start turning away patients whom he had \nbeen serving for years. His final question was, if he could not afford \nto serve them, who would? This brings up anecdotal evidence of what I \nexplained earlier, that because of the high cost of liability \ninsurance, doctors are giving up patients in rural areas because they \nsimply cannot afford to service them because of the liability incurred.\n  Last week, a student with the American Osteopathic Association \nexpressed his troubles finishing up his education. This applies to \nstudent experiences. This student is from rural Colorado, with plans to \nreturn to rural Colorado to practice. The problem is, he cannot afford \nthe medical liability insurance in other States to get the specialized \ntraining he needs to come and practice in rural Colorado.\n  Now, doctors in small bordering towns of Colorado, such as Wray, \nHolyoke, and Burlington, cross the border into Nebraska to serve the \nrural areas of both States. Now, even if they are lucky enough to be \nable to afford the medical liability insurance in Colorado, it is \nnearly impossible for them to afford the additional liability insurance \nthey would need to practice in the rural areas of the bordering State, \nwhich is probably closest and more accessible. This is another reason I \nthink we need to have some national legislation.\n\n  Doctors and specialists from Ft. Collins drive as far as Cheyenne to \nserve the patients of the frontier country in between those two \ndestinations. Without their dedication, the constituents they serve \nwould be left without health care. We are now faced with that reality \nbecause these dedicated doctors can no longer afford the medical \nliability insurance they are required to have to practice in rural \nareas.\n  It was expressed in a meeting this week that eventually the need for \nliability reform legislation would be null and void. Why? Because large \nhospitals are beginning to pay on a salary so doctors can afford the \nrising cost of medical liability insurance without worrying about the \nrate of reimbursement. That may be a solution in urban areas where \nthere is the opportunity for doctors to practice at a large hospital. \nBut in rural areas, that is not an\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\noption, and the cost of medical liability insurance will force doctors \nout of rural areas where they are desperately needed. That is why I \nthink it is so very important we move ahead with these pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I have shared with my colleagues some anecdotal evidence as far as \nthe State of Colorado is concerned. Based on the Colorado experience \nand based on my personal experience, we cannot afford to continue to \nstick our head in the sand. We need to realize and recognize there is a \nproblem out there with frivolous lawsuits against dedicated, hard-\nworking medical doctors, particularly those who are trying to make \ntheir practices operate in rural areas.\n  So I, for one, ask my colleagues to join me because of the serious \nproblem that is facing the medical community. I believe it is time for \nthe Congress to act, and I am delighted that the Senate has decided to \ntake up the bill this next week.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \ncomments. He has made a great contribution. He knows a little bit about \nthis because of his own background as a veterinarian in terms of health \ncare.\n  I come to the floor to speak as somebody who has personally \nexperienced the phenomenon of being placed in the position toward my \npractice--I am a practicing physician. I still practice on Monday \nmornings. I still practice on the weekends. I have delivered several \nbabies during this session of the Senate.\n  What the American people need to understand is we are going to spend \n$2.3 trillion this year on health care in this country. And $1 out of \nevery $3 does not go to help anybody get well. We are never going to be \nable to compete globally if we cannot control the health care costs in \nthis country. So I wish to walk you through, for just a minute, how \nthis threat of liability raises the cost of health care for everybody \nin this country.\n  Only 16 percent of the lawsuits that are filed across the entire \ncountry have any merit whatsoever. Mr. President, 84 percent of them \nare filed with the idea that we can intimidate people into settling a \ncase so a lawyer can make money. It has nothing to do with the patient. \nIt has everything to do with enriching the trial bar. I have \nexperienced that personally as a physician who has delivered over 4,000 \nchildren into this world.\n  What happens is, we change the behavior of physicians because of the \ntremendous liability that is out there. There are some very good \nstatistics that reveal that. We know that 6 percent of the cost of \nhealth care today is for tests that are ordered on patients in this \ncountry that are not needed by the patient at all but are needed by the \nphysicians to protect them in case they have some aggressive lawyer who \nwants to try to say: You didn't do everything in your power to make \nsure somebody is getting well. So we are going to waste $140 billion--\n$140 billion--this year on tests that our people do not need because of \nthe threat of liability exposure. Think what that money could do for \naccess for everybody else who does not have health care today. We could \nbuy everybody in the country who does not have health care health care \nwith just the money we are wasting on the tests.\n  The idea of extorting a settlement from a frivolous lawsuit does not \ncome without significant cost to this country. It is not just the cost \nof the tests that are ordered that are not needed, there is also the \ncost of defending it. In the one case I have had in 24 years as a \nphysician, the lawyer costs to defend me in that case, which was thrown \nout of court twice, were $65,000--for that one case. That was just the \nlawyer fees, and that was back in the 1980s. And I spent about $60,000 \nworth of time that I was not working taking care of patients to prepare \nmyself for all the grilling and interrogation that comes from an \naggressive lawyer who thinks they are going to hit a home run off my \ninsurance that I pay. The consequences of that have been that \nmalpractice rates, liability insurance rates, have skyrocketed.\n  In Texas, what we know is happening is, it is not just that with \ntheir new system, they have more doctors coming, it is not just that \nthe cost of liability insurance is going down, but the availability of \ncare is increasing, and the number of dollars spent on waste for tests \nwe don't need is declining in Texas. But it is going up everywhere else \nwhere we have not addressed this problem.\n  We are going to hear all sorts of cases: that the problem is not the \ntrial bar; the problem is we make mistakes and don't get compensated. \nWell, that is not the case because most insurance companies, if there \nis a legitimate case--and doctors make errors--they settle the case. \nThey don't go to court.\n  What actually happens some of the time as to that 16 percent of the \ncases that are legitimate, in Oklahoma, is that somebody who truly had \nan injury does not get compensated because the lawyers who are now \ndefending the doctors have gotten so good that they win cases they \nprobably should not have.\n  So we have all these distortions that are occurring because the focus \nis on how much money can we put in the hands of people who ``are \nrepresenting somebody with an injury,'' when, in fact, they are \nrepresenting themselves and their own wealth.\n  I am going to support both of these bills, but we need to wake up in \nAmerica. If we are going to compete globally, then we have to readdress \nall of health care in this country. We have to go to a consumer-driven, \ntransparent market where you know what the price is, you know what the \noutcome of the provider is, you know they are following best practices, \nand you should not be paying more than anybody else for the same thing. \nAnd the value judgment you make on your health care needs to be yours.\n  We also need to make your insurance yours, not your employers'. And \nit needs to be able to go with you wherever you go. There will never be \njob lock if we do that. We need to give the individual the tax break \nrather than the company the tax break. And we need to put everybody \nwith some skin in the game when it comes to health care. In our \ncountry, we know, if we have markets that really drive that, we will \nimprove the quality, we will increase the access, we will get rid of \nthe bad players, and we will lower the costs. And we have to lower the \ncosts of health care. We can do it.\n  At $2.3 trillion, if we took 20 percent and squeezed it out, we would \nhave $460 billion we would not be spending on health care because it is \nnot being spent on it now--it is spent on the machine of health care \nand the waste, as I just described it, on tests that are not necessary. \nThat money would go into capital which would raise innovation, which \nwould raise salaries, which would create more jobs, which would create \ngreater prosperity.\n  But when we have this false sense of entitlement to the trial bar, \nthrough extortion--and that is what it is; it is pure extortion, \nbecause most of them are filed not with the hopes of winning the case \nbut with extorting the settlement because it is cheaper to settle than \nto pay all the lawyer fees--we continue to have this ordering of tests \nthat are not necessary because we have to defend ourselves. I am glad \nwe are going to be addressing that. I plan on introducing another \ncouple of bills in the next week as we address health care to move some \nof the things I talked about.\n\n  In Oklahoma, we have three cities that have over 50,000 people. Since \n2003, they each had a total of six OB/GYNs. There are two left out of \nthose three cities because of malpractice rates. Malpractice rates for \nOB/GYNs in Oklahoma rose 89 percent last year. My partners can't \ndeliver over 100 babies a year without having a tremendous increase, \nand their average cost for the delivery per baby is over $500 per \nchild, based on the malpractice cost alone.\n  We have great problems. We can fix them. But we can't fix them by \nprotecting a special interest group that has been protected for years \nthat claims they want to do something great for people but who most of \nthe time are motivated to do something great for themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been an interesting week, and \nnext week in the Senate will also be interesting. I want to talk about \na couple of those matters.\n  I know there are a lot of people in the country, some in this \nChamber, who believe that politics in America these days is pretty \ndysfunctional. We are not speaking directly to the issues that are most \nimportant to the American people. We are not confronting the issues \nthat have developed with the American economy and foreign policy. Many \npeople are concerned about that. I count myself among them.\n  I have always been proud to serve in the Senate. I come from a town \nof 300 people, a high school class of nine students, and to go from a \ndesk in a small high school in southwestern North Dakota to a desk in \nthe Senate, I have always felt enormously privileged to do that. But \nthere are times when I am very concerned about the institution of \npolitics.\n  John F. Kennedy used to say that every mother kind of hoped that her \nchild might grow up to become President, as long as they didn't have to \nbe active in politics. But of course, politics is the method by which \nwe make decisions. The document called the Constitution that starts \nwith the three words ``we the people'' means the people are in charge. \nThey are the ones who decide, grabbing the American steering wheel, \nwhich direction we head.\n  Let me describe my concern about the dysfunctional politics and the \ndysfunctional system that exists. I don't think one party is all bad \nand the other party is all good or that one is all right and one is all \nwrong. I do think that we are on the wrong path and off track. We have \none-party control in the White House, the House, and the Senate. It \nseems to me we need to get busy and get serious about addressing the \nfundamental problems we face in domestic policy and foreign policy.\n  Next week we are going to deal with health issues, we are told. But \neven though we are going to deal with health issues, the majority \nleader has said the way the Senate will deal with health issues is, he \nwill file cloture on some bills to come to the floor dealing with \nmedical malpractice, dealing with health care costs. The purpose of \nthis process is to say: We are going to deal with the issue of medical \nmalpractice, and we are not going to allow anyone else to deal with any \nother issue dealing with health care costs.\n  I happen to have pretty strong views about this issue of medical \nmalpractice. We have somewhere, it is estimated, between 40,000 and \n90,000 people a year die in hospitals as a result of mistakes. To \nsuggest that someone should be immune from accountability because of \nmistakes is wrong. I have a longer story about all of that. But would I \nlike to see there be a process that is simpler and easier than going \nthrough the tort system to resolve these issues? Yes, I would. I \nbelieve that is possible. But to suggest that we ought to limit those \nwho are victimized by bad medicine--and there are cases of bad \nmedicine; it does exist--to suggest we ought to limit their \nopportunities to seek redress is wrong.\n  As long as we are going to talk about health care costs--and that is \na very serious issue; health care costs are increasing dramatically for \nfamilies, for businesses, for the Government in Medicaid and Medicare--\nperhaps we should talk about the array of issues we should be dealing \nwith. Let me cite some examples.\n  No. 1, the highest rate of growth in health care costs is the cost of \nprescription drugs. It used to be when someone got sick, you would put \nthem in a hospital bed for acute care, and then they would be let out, \ndischarged, a week or 2 later, and that was the way health care was \ndelivered. These days we have miracle drugs. Prescription drugs are \nused to treat illnesses so that people don't have to have acute care \nhospital stays. But the increased price in prescription drugs is almost \nunbelievable. We pay the highest prices in the entire world for \nprescription drugs. Why is that the case? It is the case because the \npharmaceutical industry can charge the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs.\n  I took a bus one day and took some North Dakota citizens to Canada. \nIn a one-room pharmacy in Emerson, Canada, just miles north of a \npharmacy in North Dakota, these North Dakota citizens purchased their \nprescription drugs.\n  They were all FDA approved, in many cases made in America and shipped \nto Canada. So our citizens went to Canada to buy prescription drugs, \nLipitor, Prevacid, a whole series of prescription drugs. All of them \nwere dramatically less expensive in Canada than they are here. And not \nonly Canada, they would have found the same thing in England and France \nand virtually every other country. We pay the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators and Members of the House believe that \nthe way to break the back of increased drug prices or drug pricing that \nis unfair to the American consumer is to allow the reimportation of \nprescription drugs from Canada. The FDA will allow someone to come \nacross for personal use with maybe 3 months' worth of drugs, but \notherwise it is illegal. In Europe, it is not illegal. If you are in \nGermany and want to buy a drug from France, if you are in Spain and \nwant to buy a prescription drug from Italy, they have a system by which \nyou do that. It is called parallel trading.\n  It has been done for 20 years. There is no safety issue. And through \nit the consumers are able to get the best prices on approved \nprescription drugs. In this country, you can't.\n  The majority leader is going to bring a health care bill to the floor \nnext week that deals with medical malpractice and will apparently \n``fill the amendment tree'' or file cloture so that no amendments can \nbe offered. But will the majority leader allow us to vote on a \nbipartisan proposal to put downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices? No, he would not do that. Why? Because the pharmaceutical \nindustry doesn't want that legislation on the floor. So we will not \nhave it, I guess.\n  We have been trying for years. A bipartisan group of Senators believe \nwe ought to do that, believe we ought to tackle the issue of increased \ncost of health care by tackling the escalating prices of prescription \ndrugs. But we can't get that bill onto the Senate floor.\n  The majority leader is taking specific steps now to prevent it. Why? \nBecause he is helping, in my judgment, the pharmaceutical industry. It \nis what they want. How about doing what the American people want for a \nchange? Let the American people in these chambers. How about opening \nthe door to having the people's interests served here? So we won't be \ndealing with the issue of prescription drug prices, I guess, next week. \nWe are going to try, but the majority leader will block us, I assume. \nThat is what we have been told.\n  How about this little provision--the most unbelievably pernicious \nprovision that was put in the bill that was passed to add prescription \ndrug coverage to Medicare. Do you know there is a provision added in \nthat bill that says, by the way, the Federal Government cannot use its \npurchasing power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices with \nthe pharmaceutical industry. Is that not unbelievable? A prohibition on \nthe Federal Government negotiating for lower prescription drug prices \nwith the pharmaceutical industry. In whose interest is that, do you \nthink? Is that in the pharmaceutical industry's interest? Of course it \nis.\n  I wish somebody would come to the Senate floor and take credit for it \nand say I wrote that, and I wrote it because I believe the \npharmaceutical industry should be able to charge higher prices and \nshould not have to negotiate. Not one Senator, I believe, will claim \ncredit for that legislation. But it was there. So the majority is \ndeciding that they are going to block an opportunity to get rid of \nthat, repeal that provision and allow the negotiation for lower drug \nprices that will put downward pressure on health care costs. The \nmajority says we don't want anything to do with that; you cannot offer \nthat amendment next week. We are going to talk about health care and \nhealth care costs, but you are prevented from offering that amendment. \nWhy? Maybe it would pass and that would not be good for the \npharmaceutical industry. It is unbelievable to me. Talk about \ndysfunctional behavior in the Senate. If we are going to deal with \nhealth care and health care costs, how about allowing legislation on \nthe Senate floor that\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nreally does that. Let's have an up-or-down vote on the issue of \nreimportation of prescription drugs so that the American people can \nbenefit from the same prices people are paying in other countries. \nShould the American people be paying the highest prices?\n  Some time ago, I sat on a hay bale on a farm at a meeting of farmers. \nAnd a fellow in his mideighties said:\n\n       My wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 years, and \n     for 3 years we have driven to Canada every 3 months to buy \n     her prescription drugs.\n\n  I asked why. He said:\n\n       Because we pay only 20 percent of the price we have to pay \n     in the United States for the same drug.\n\n  Tamoxifen is a drug to treat breast cancer. If one uses that, you can \nsave 80 to 90 percent if you buy that in Canada. It's an FDA-approved \ndrug. Is that fair to the American people--to say you should pay the \nhighest prices in the world? Oh, by the way, we are not interested in \nhelping you put downward pressure on prices in this country.\n  That makes no sense to me. Next week we will see this dysfunctional \nbehavior in the Senate. We will be prevented from the ability to \nconsider pieces of bipartisan legislation. In both cases that I have \ntalked about this morning, they will prevent votes on them. Why? Both \nare opposed by the pharmaceutical industry. So God forbid the Senate \nshould have an up-or-down vote.\n  It is interesting. Regarding pharmaceuticals, senior citizens in this \ncountry are about 12 percent of the population, and they consume about \none-third of the prescription drugs. So senior citizens are 12 percent \nof the population and consume one-third of all of the prescription \ndrugs. In many cases, they are the least able to pay these escalating \nprices. And pharmaceuticals--the prescription drugs that you need--are \nnot a luxury; you need them.\n  It is interesting that the same is true with respect to energy, isn't \nit? Another part of the dysfunctional behavior around here is dealing \nwith energy costs. That is another subject.\n  Are we going to get legislation on the floor of the Senate to deal \nwith energy issues? Not likely--at least not in a meaningful way. We \nhave seen press reports about what is happening. Exxon oil had a $36.1 \nbillion profit last year, which is the highest profit in the history of \ncorporations. I am not against profit at all. Good for them. But all \nthat profit comes at the expense and pain of the American consumer. So \nthat is not good for the consumer.\n  So what do we do about that? I say this. If all that money that is \ngoing into the coffers of the oil industry is being used to sink back \ninto the ground for exploration and development of additional supplies, \nand therefore lower prices, good for them and good for us. But I know \nthat is not happening. I know that Exxon is using about a third of its \nprofits to buy back its stock. Business Week magazine says that big oil \ninvested in trying to find oil on Wall Street. Well, there is no oil on \nWall Street. That is all about mergers and acquisitions. That doesn't \nexpand the supply of energy. I think we ought to say this to big oil: \nIf you are not using these profits to expand the supply and reduce the \nprice, then you ought to be paying a portion of that into the Federal \nGovernment as a recapture, a windfall profit recapture that we send \nback in its entirety to the consumers from whence it came. I would like \nto vote on that in the Senate. I think that is something we ought to \nconsider on the floor of the Senate.\n  Energy is not a luxury. Look, I understand we have serious problems \nwith energy. Those who come to the floor and say there is a free market \nin oil--what a load of nonsense. There is no free market in oil. First \nof all, you have OPEC ministers in a closed room around a table \ndeciding how much they are going to produce out of the sands of the \nMiddle East. OPEC ministers decide how much they are going to produce \nand what that might do to affect price. Second, the big oil companies \nhave two names now. They fell in love and got married. It was Exxon and \nMobil, and then they merged and now it is ExxonMobil. There was Philips \nand Conoco. Now it is PhilipsConoco. They decided to get hitched. The \nFederal Government turned a blind eye to that and said that is fine.\n\n  And finally, you have futures markets. The futures markets become \norgies of speculation. It is a dramatic amount of speculation that \ndrives up prices. The result is that the consumers in this country, I \nthink, are seriously injured by what is happening. All of the pain is \non the side of the person who is driving up to the gas pump or the \nfarmer who is trying to figure out how to pay for the fuel he needs for \nspring planting. All of the gain is on the side of the enterprises, the \nmajor integrated oil companies, making the highest profits in the \nhistory of corporations, and the OPEC countries. And the royal family \nof Saudi Arabia thanks you.\n  This is something wrong with this. I understand that we have long-\nterm problems and we need aggressive energy policies that address them. \nI have been working for some long while on the issue of trying to pole-\nvault over the circumstances by which we power our vehicle fleet in \nthis country. We need to get to a hydrogen fuel cell future, with twice \nthe efficiency of power to the wheel. You put water vapor out the \ntailpipe using hydrogen and fuel cells. We have, for a century, decided \nwe are going to use gasoline to run through carburetors, and now fuel \ninjectors, to power our vehicles. It doesn't make sense to me. Sixty \npercent of all of the oil comes from troubled parts of the world--Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and Venezuela. It makes no sense to be that \ndependent and for America to be hostage to that situation.\n  We need to move to a different future. I think it ought to be \nhydrogen and fuel cell. Even as we move along, we are never going to \nnot need oil, natural gas and coal, but at least let's remove our \naddiction to finding it from troubled parts of the world that hold our \neconomy hostage. We need to increase production of fossil fuels and do \nit in a way that doesn't injure our environment. We need to do much \nmore with respect to renewables. I am talking about the biofuels, \nethanol, and biodiesel. We need to do much more with respect to \nefficiency as well. Everything that we do every day with light switches \nand virtually everything that powers everything we do needs to be made \nmuch more efficient.\n  We need to tell the auto makers that you cannot do this anymore; you \ncannot build 5,000-pound cars that get 15 miles per gallon. At least we \nshould say to consumers that it is not in your interest to buy them. We \nought to say to the auto companies that the way you are going to \ncompete best is to make efficient cars, and we are going to hold you to \na better and higher standard. In the long term, we understand this.\n  We suck 84 million barrels of oil out of this planet of ours every \nsingle day--84 million barrels a day out of this Earth. We use one-\nfourth of it in the United States. This little spot uses one-fourth of \nall of the oil. China has 1.3 billion people. They now have 20 million \nautomobiles. In 15 years, China is going to have 120 million \nautomobiles. They are going to add 100 million automobiles to the \nroads. Where is the energy going to come from? That is the question.\n  That is why I say we have long-term issues we have to deal with. We \nhave to decide that we are going to go to a different future. Senator \nLindsay Graham from South Carolina and I had a caucus on hydrogen and \nfuel cells. If you don't care where you are going, you are never going \nto be lost. You have to decide what your destination is. What policies \ndo we want for our energy future? We cannot sit around thumbing our \nsuspenders and bellowing about all of these issues and doing nothing \nabout them.\n  We passed an Energy bill a while ago--and my compliments to Senators \nDomenici and Bingaman. I am one of the senior members on the Energy \nCommittee. I helped write the renewable fuels title and the hydrogen \nfuel cell title. But we need to do much more. And at the moment, what \nhas happened to oil prices at $75 a barrel--when the major oil \ncompanies had their highest profits in history when oil was at $40 a \nbarrel, it is fundamentally unfair to American consumers. We need to do \nsomething about it. I would like to vote on that in the Senate.\n  I think it is important to consider how do we deal with this issue \nbecause this is clearly unfair. The oil industry is important to us. I \nhave done a number of things to try to be helpful to\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\nthem. But when I see something that is wrong, I think we ought to set \nit right. The oil industry is upset with my saying, look, if you are \ngoing to accumulate these profits, use them to reduce price; and if \nthey are not going to do that, we ought to recapture it and use it as a \nrebate exclusively to the American consumers and find a way--not this \n$100 nonsense that floated around here, but a real rebate that takes \nsome pressure off of these American consumers. I think that is \nsomething that we have a responsibility to do.\n  I want to mention as well that yesterday we passed an emergency \nsupplemental bill. The reason we are dealing with an emergency bill is \nthat President asks for zero money, no money in his budget for \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have spoken on the floor many \ntimes about that. The administration comes in and says, all right, we \ndon't know how much it is going to cost to have our soldiers fighting \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, so we are not going to ask for money in the \nregular budget. We are going to ask for it later as an emergency, so it \ndoesn't count and isn't scored, and we add it to the Federal deficit. \nThat is a game. It should not happen. We are now spending somewhere \nbetween $7 billion to $10 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHonest budgeting would require this administration to say here is what \nwe think we are going to spend this year and ask for the money; then \nfigure out how we are going to pay for it. Is the only sacrifice we are \ngoing to ask from the soldiers who we say, go to Iraq for a year, or \nthe National Guard to whom we say, put your boots on and for the next \n16 or 18 months you are going to be gone from your home, your family, \nyour job--you are a citizen soldier, but you are going to spend 12 \nmonths in Iraq and 4 or 5 months perhaps training to get there. So we \nare going to take you away from home for 16, 18 months. Is that the \nonly sacrifice being asked in this country? Could we perhaps, as a \nCongress, decide to ask the people to begin to pay for the cost of \nthis? Is that wrong to ask the American people to sacrifice as well? We \nhave to spend this money, so maybe we can all pay for it.\n  The President doesn't want to do that. The President doesn't want to \nconfront the reality of where our fiscal policy is. We are far off \ntrack. We have the biggest deficits in history, and I know they brag \nthat they say our deficit is only going to be $300 billion, $350 \nbillion in the coming year. But look at the increase in debt. They are \nto go borrow more than $600 billion in the coming year. In addition, \nthey are borrowing over $700 billion for the biggest trade deficit in \nhistory. We are out of kilter to the tune of $1.4 trillion, and they \nsnore their way through all of this.\n  Just hang around, shine your shoes, thumb your suspenders and snore a \nlittle. Don't worry, things will be happy, things will be better.\n  What a dysfunctional system. The American people, I think, deserve \nthis Congress and this President to stare truth in the eye and \nunderstand what is going on, yes, in fiscal policy, in health care, in \neducation, in military policy and, yes, in foreign policy. I don't \nthink, regrettably, that is happening.\n  There is a remarkable thing that happens in this country, and that is \nevery even-numbered year, our Constitution provides the American people \ngrab the steering wheel.\n  Last weekend, I was in Philadelphia. I went to the Constitution \nCenter. It was the first time I had been back to Philadelphia in a \nwhile. I remember something that happened, I believe, in 1988. In \n1988--I think I have the year right--was the 200th birthday of the \nwriting of the Constitution.\n  As all of us remember, the Constitution was written by 55 White men. \nFifty-five White men went into a room in Philadelphia, pulled the \nshades--there was no air-conditioning; it was a hot Philadelphia \nsummer--and they wrote a constitution for this country. George \nWashington's chair, by the way, is still in that room.\n  When you go to the room and see where they sat, you will notice \nGeorge Washington's chair is still there with half a rising Sun \ndecorated on the back of the chair. Ben Franklin sat over here. Mason \nand Madison sat over here.\n  So on the 200th birthday--at the time 55 White men wrote the \nConstitution, and I emphasize ``White men'' only to make the point that \nour country has changed in the way we govern and the way we respond--55 \nAmericans went back into that room in Philadelphia. I was one of the 55 \nchosen to go back into that room to be involved in the 200th \nanniversary ceremony of the writing of the Constitution. Among the 55 \nwere men, women, minorities.\n  It was pretty remarkable. I sat in that room thinking about coming \nfrom a small school in North Dakota and studying the Constitution, \nunderstanding the first three words, ``We the people,'' and then trying \nto think back a couple hundred years in which these 55 men, really \nremarkable people who wrote this framework of ours, the framework of \nour Government, that has been altered only 17 times in over 220 years, \noutside of the 10 amendments for the Bill of Rights.\n  I tried to think of how they were evaluating what kind of country is \nthis, what kind of country will it become, and what kind of a \nconstitutional framework will be flexible enough to allow it to change \nwith changing times.\n  It is pretty remarkable what they did. The work they did was pretty \ndramatic. It is work that is the creation of the most successful \ndemocracy in the history of humankind, and it is relatively young, not \nmuch more than a couple hundred years old. Not very old. And yet it is \nthe most successful in the history of humankind.\n  It provides for the separation of powers, branches of Government--\nlegislative, judicial, and executive. And it provides that the American \npeople, we the people, are in charge. All the power in America is in \nthe power of one--one person casting one vote on one day. That is all \nthe power in America. There are no guns. There are no armies that \nmarch. There is just the power of one enumerated in the Constitution \nthat on even-numbered years, the American people one by one grab \nAmerica's steering wheel.\n  The reason I mention that is this is another even-numbered year. We \nhave two grand political parties in this country. I am not somebody who \nbelieves one is all bad and one is all good. Both parties have \ncontributed substantially to this country's past, and I hope they will \ncontribute to its future. Occasionally, this country gets off track, \nand I think we are very seriously off track. It is the case in fiscal \npolicy. It is the case in health policy, certainly the case in foreign \npolicy, immigration policy--you name it.\n  We have serious problems that require, should require this Congress \nto stare them in the eye and work in a bipartisan way to fix them. But \nwe have this dysfunctional system. We have a complete abject lack of \nleadership coming from the White House, in my judgment, with all due \nrespect, and we have a majority party in this Congress that now in the \nnext series of issues dealing, for example, with health care costs will \ndecide next week that we should not be able to offer amendments to deal \nwith the real issues of health care costs. So we are not addressing \nhead on the kind of issues about which the American people care.\n  Having said all of that, I want to make the point that if I felt so \ndiscouraged that nothing can get done and nothing will get done, it \nwould be hard to get up in the mornings to go to work. But I think \nthere are enough people of good will, enough people who come to these \npositions who understand that America needs good stewardship, and \nresponsible politics means addressing real issues, as hard as they are \nand as tough as they are. I think there are enough of them that at some \npoint very soon, we are going to see a different track, a different \napproach, and we are going to see real efforts to address real problems \nat long last.\n  There is much to be concerned about regarding our country's future, \nbut there is also much about which to be hopeful. This country has been \na beacon to the world in many ways. We have survived a civil war. We \nbeat back the oppression of Adolf Hitler. We have done so many \nunbelievable things. We split the atom. We spliced genes. We invented \nplastic. We invented radar. We invented the telephone, the \ntelevision, the computer. We built airplanes and learned how to fly \nthem. Then build rockets to fly to the Moon, walk on the Moon, and \nplant the American Flag. What an unbelievable place this is.\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\n  Travel around the world and ask people how they see this country--I \nhaven't talked about immigration, but if tomorrow we said as a country \nwe have no more immigration quotas, this country is open to anyone \nliving anywhere in the world who wishes to come to America, welcome, \ncome and stay and work, if that happened, we understand what the \ncircumstances would be. We would be overrun with immigration.\n  I landed in a clearing in kind of a jungle area between Nicaragua and \nHonduras one day. The helicopter ran out of gas. The campesinos had \ncome to see who came down in a helicopter. We had an interpreter with \nus and started talking because we were lost and didn't get found for \nsome hours. We asked the campesinos from Honduras and Nicaragua: What \nis it you aspire for your lives? We want to come to America; we want to \ncome to America, they said. Why? Because there is opportunity in \nAmerica.\n  It is unbelievable. So if we just said: Look, anybody who wants to \ncome can come, we would be overrun with people coming into this \ncountry. We can't do that. This is an Earth that spins around the Sun. \nIt has 6.4 billion people living on it. Half of them have never made a \ntelephone call, half of them live on less than $2 a day, and 1.5 \nbillion don't have daily access to potable water. And this little spot \ncalled the United States is extraordinary, but it didn't get there by \naccident. It got there because enough people cared about the right \nthings. Yes, about rights--especially rights--women's rights, worker \nrights, civil rights, the rights that people have, the rights to which \npeople, we the people, refer. Those are fights we have had for a long \ntime.\n  Having said all that, I still believe there is a great reservoir of \nhope for this country to have its best 200 years ahead of it. It \nrequires, however, for us to work together and to understand you can't \ngloss over problems, you have to confront problems and deal with \nproblems in a thoughtful, sensitive way.\n  I will come on Monday, I assume, and if the plans are as I heard \nyesterday to bring a bill to the floor and then prevent any other ideas \non health care costs, we will be right back in the same dysfunctional \napproach we have seen for far too long coming from both the White House \nand the Congress. I think the American people hope for better. They \ncertainly deserve better. And I hope next week we will see something \nbetter than that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 20 minutes, and I probably will not speak that \nlong.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as long as I shall require.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address two \ntopics today. The first has to do with medical liability, and the \nsecond has to do with my resolution to have the Senate express what I \nthink almost every American understands, which is that when we say the \nPledge of Allegiance, when we sing the National Anthem, when we take \nthe oath of allegiance for citizenship in America, we should do it in \nour common language: English.\n\n\n                        Medical Liability Reform\n\n  Mr. President, first let me express my concern about the medical \nliability crisis that is occurring in Tennessee and across our country. \nI am particularly concerned about a crisis in access to medical care \nfor mothers and babies in Tennessee. In 45 of Tennessee's 95 counties, \npregnant mothers have to drive for miles to get prenatal health care \nand to deliver their babies. In 15 of those counties, pregnant mothers \nhave no access whatsoever to any prenatal care within their counties. \nOnly 1 of 104 medical students graduating from Vanderbilt University \nMedical School in 2004 chose to be an OB-GYN, according to Dr. Frank \nBoehm, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Vanderbilt University \nMedical Center. Dr. Boehm cautions that:\n\n       We must not lose sight of the fact that one of the side \n     effects of our current medical malpractice crisis in OB-GYN \n     is a steady loss of medical students choosing to practice one \n     of our most important medical specialties. If this decline in \n     OB-GYN doctors continues, patients having babies or needing \n     high-risk gynecologic care will be faced with access problems \n     this country has not seen.\n\n  That is Dr. Frank Boehm, Vanderbilt Medical School, as reported in \nthe Tennessean on July 20, 2004.\n  Dr. Ron Blankenbaker, associate dean of the University of Tennessee \nCollege of Medicine, Chattanooga, said four of the six doctors at UT \nFamily Practice who provided obstetrical care have stopped working in \nthis specialty because of fears of malpractice lawsuits. That was in \nthe Chattanooga Times Free Press in February of 2005.\n  It is clear that we are in a medical crisis and we must do something \nto improve access to care for mothers and their babies. For this \nreason, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 23, the Healthy Mothers and \nHealthy Babies Access to Care Act, a bill to protect access to care for \nmothers and babies by providing medical liability reform for obstetric \nand gynecological care. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of S. 22, the \nMedical Care Access Protection Act of 2006, a comprehensive medical \nliability reform bill.\n  This is the third time during my tenure in the Senate that I have \ncome to the floor to discuss medical liability concerns. While we have \ndebated solutions every time, we have not had the votes necessary to \nenact those solutions.\n  Sadly, during this time of inaction, the situation has gotten much \nworse in my home State of Tennessee. In February of this year, \nTennessee was declared a medical liability ``Crisis State'' by the \nAmerican Medical Association, joining 20 other crisis States where \nbroken medical liability systems are jeopardizing access to health \ncare.\n  I have heard from doctors and hospitals from one end of Tennessee to \nthe other, all concerned with the skyrocketing costs of medical \nliability premiums. The average medical liability insurance premium for \nTennessee doctors has increased 84 percent since 1999 due, in large \npart, to our out-of-control jury awards. That is according to the \nTennessee Medical Association. In the past 10 years, 100 percent of \ncardiac surgeons, 92 percent of OB-GYNs, 92 percent of orthopedists, \nand 70 percent of all doctors in Tennessee have faced legal action--\nagain, according to the Tennessee Medical Association. The medical \nliability crisis is driving up the cost of health care for all \nTennesseans. The annual cost of defensive medicine,--that is the extra \ntests and procedures performed by doctors to protect them from \nlawsuits--is estimated at $70 to $120 billion per year, nationwide, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n  Defensive medicine adds $2 billion to health care costs just for \nTennesseans. That is almost $1,000 for every Tennessee household that \nis spent on unnecessary defensive medicine costs--tests, and procedures \nperformed by doctors to keep them from getting sued--and they are still \ngetting sued.\n  In Tennessee, 78 percent of doctors report ordering extra tests and \nprocedures due to litigation fears. Nearly half of those doctors \nestimate that 20 percent or more of their procedures fall into the \ndefensive medicine category. Again, I believe it is pretty clear we are \nfacing a crisis.\n  Here is what the bills would do. The Healthy Mothers and Healthy \nBabies Access to Care Act and the Medical Care Access Protection Act \nwould help us get out of this crisis. I hope we can pass these bills \nand see them signed into law. These bills ensure fair and just \ncompensation for patient injury by providing full compensation for \neconomic damages. In plain English, if you\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\nare actually hurt, this bill permits you to be paid 100 percent of the \nvalue of those damages. It does not interfere with that at all. If a \npatient is injured, he or she will have unlimited access to economic \ndamages to pay for recovery.\n  These bills also place a sensible cap of up to $750,000 on awards for \nnon-economic damages. The caps on non-economic damages are fashioned \nafter the Texas State law. After Texas passed statewide medical \nliability reform in 2003, medical malpractice rates decreased, access \nto care has been increasing, new doctors are moving to Texas, current \ndoctors are staying in Texas, and new insurers are entering the Texas \nmedical liability market, creating more choices for physicians.\n  I am happy for Texas. A lot of our family lives in Texas. But I would \nlike to see Tennesseans and other Americans have some of these same \nadvantages. Our Senate bills are modeled after the Texas law, and I \nhope to see this success story spread to Tennessee and spread \nnationwide because Tennessee mothers and Tennessee babies and all \nmedical patients deserve access to health care.\n\n\n                          THE NATIONAL ANTHEM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I turn my attention to another subject, \none I have discussed several times. As a courtesy, I want to let my \nfriends on the other side know that I intend to ask unanimous consent, \nat the end of my remarks, that my resolution be discharged from the \nJudiciary Committee. I hope that will be approved, but if it is not \napproved, I want my friends on the other side to know they need to have \na way to register their objection before I make that request.\n  Today is May 5. In Mexico and in Mexican restaurants across this \ncountry, today is known as ``Cinco de Mayo.'' That is because today is \nthe day General Ignacio Zaragoza defeated the invading French forces of \nNapoleon III.\n  In the United States, we often think of this holiday as a good reason \nto go to a Mexican restaurant and enjoy a margarita, but for our \nsouthern neighbors it is a very important holiday. France invaded \nMexico in 1862, 41 years after Mexico had won its independence from \nSpain. It took the Mexicans 5 years, but once they succeeded in driving \nout the French occupiers, their country was finally free, and it has \nremained free since that time.\n  As they celebrate this important day in their nation's history, I \nhave no doubt that many Mexicans will be singing their national anthem, \nand I suspect they will all sing it in Spanish, their nation's common \nlanguage.\n  I make this point because at the beginning of this week, on Monday, I \nintroduced a resolution in the Senate to affirm that here in the United \nStates of America, statements of national unity, especially the Pledge \nof Allegiance and the national anthem, ought to be said or sung in our \ncommon language--English.\n  I am not talking about what we are free to do as Americans, I am \ntalking about what we ought to do as Americans.\n  Last Monday, I offered this resolution which now has 12 cosponsors, \nincluding the distinguished Presiding Officer, because I thought it was \nimportant for this body to remember what unites us as Americans. Ours \nis a nation not based upon race, not based upon ethnicity, not based \nupon national origin, but based upon our shared values, enshrined in \nour founding documents, the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution, upon our history as a nation and, yes, upon our shared \ncommon language--English.\n  Every Senate office received a request for this resolution of mine to \nbe passed by unanimous consent. That request was agreed to by every \nSenator on the Republican side. But the other side, the Democratic \nside, objected. I can only assume that at least some on the Democratic \nside objected because at least some of them believe that Americans \nshould, at least some of the time, sing our national anthem in Spanish \nor some other foreign language. Perhaps they also believe we should \nrecite the Pledge of Allegiance in Chinese, which is the second most \nspoken foreign language in the United States.\n  Yesterday, I tried again. I tried to pass this very simple and \nstraightforward resolution. Again I was blocked by objections from the \nDemocratic side. I am surprised by this reaction because leading \nHispanic Democrats have said they agree with me.\n  On Monday, Wolf Blitzer of CNN asked Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa about \nsinging the national anthem in Spanish. Here is what the Mayor of Los \nAngeles, a Hispanic and a Democrat, had to say in his conversation with \nWolf Blitzer:\n\n       Wolf, let me just say to you, let me just make it \n     absolutely clear, I was offended, I was offended because, for \n     me, the national anthem is something that I believe deserves \n     respect. And I think that . . . without question, that the \n     vast majority of people in the United States of America were \n     offended as well.\n\n  Continuing the quote from the Mayor of Los Angeles, Mayor \nVillaraigosa:\n\n        . . . our anthem should be sung in English. The Spanish \n     and Mexican anthems should be sung in Spanish. The French \n     anthem in French.\n       So I was offended by it--\n\n  Said the Mayor of Los Angeles--\n\n     and I think most people were. And remember very few people \n     bought into that. It really was a non-issue, but I think it \n     was important to dismiss it as quickly as possible.\n\n  Apparently a few of the very few people in America who buy into that \nare on the other side of the aisle. They are objecting to this \nresolution that says, when we start the day with the Pledge of \nAllegiance, when we sing the national anthem, when we take the oath of \nallegiance, we ought to do it in our common language, English. It \ndoesn't require it. It doesn't make it a law. It doesn't say we are not \nfree to do whatever we want to. It just says we ought to. And as the \nmayor of Los Angeles said, he was offended by the suggestion that we \nshould not do it, and he thought very few people bought into that, it \nis a nonissue; let's dismiss it as quickly as possible. The way to \ndismiss it is to adopt this resolution sponsored by 12 Members of the \nSenate.\n  I agree with Mayor Villaraigosa, we should dismiss this idea of \nsinging the national anthem in foreign languages as quickly as \npossible, and that is what I tried to do by offering this resolution.\n  Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat and a \nHispanic, agrees. He appeared on the CBS ``Early Show'' with me on \nMonday morning. We were talking about the day without immigrants. After \nI explained my view on singing the national anthem in English and \ntalked about this resolution, here is what Governor Richardson had to \nsay:\n\n       Well, I agree. The national anthem should be in English. \n     And I believe that, again, most immigrants want to become \n     Americans. They want to learn English. They want to be part \n     of the American mainstream. They wear NFL jerseys. They want \n     to be American.\n       So I don't believe that view that immigrants want to learn \n     the anthem in Spanish is accurate. I think that was a side \n     show. But, definitely our anthem is English.\n\n  That is Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico. But apparently some \nSenate Democrats disagree. Apparently some of them think we should at \nleast some of the time sing it in a foreign language. But maybe I \nmisunderstood, so let me try again.\n  Let me say again, I understand from the other side that there is no \none here to object, that the Democrats have all gone home, and that if \nI were to bring up my resolution today, as I had intended to do, that \nit would pass by unanimous consent without an objection from the \nDemocratic side because no one is here to object.\n  I think as a matter of Senatorial courtesy I should not do that. I \nrespect my colleagues, and I don't intend to surprise them any more \nthan I would like for them to surprise me. So I will not, today, ask \nfor unanimous consent that S. Res. 458 be discharged from the Judiciary \nCommittee and that the Senate proceed to its consideration and ask that \nthe resolution and preamble be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table. I will not do that today.\n  But I would like to put my friends on the other side on notice that I \nintend to do this every other day, every other day that I am here and \nas long as this is not enacted I intend to do it, and each day I will \ndo it in a constructive way. I will try to help the American people \nhave a short civics lesson on what unites us as a country.\n  This is not a country where our identity is based on our race. This \nis not a country where our identity is based on our ethnicity or where \nour ancestors came from. This is a country that is\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\nbased on a few ideas that are found in our founding documents, based on \nour common history, and based on our common language. We are proud to \nbe from wherever we come from or where our ancestors came from. We are \nprouder to be American. Almost every American agrees with that.\n  That's why we created our common schools 150 years ago. In the words \nof Al Shanker, as I said yesterday, we created the common school to \nhelp mostly immigrant children learn to read and write in English and \nlearn math and to learn what it meant to be an American. In 1906 we \npassed a law that anyone who becomes a citizen of this country needs to \npass a test in English. Today we require it to be an eight-grade level \nof understanding of English.\n  This Senate, by a 91-to-1 vote last month, said that as we consider \nan immigration bill, we better focus especially, and redouble our \nefforts, on helping prospective citizens become Americans because when \nwe have a lot of people from other countries come here, the real limit \non that is how quickly we can assimilate them into our culture, how \nquickly they can become Americans. We want new legal immigrants, but we \ndo not want enclaves of people living here who have their allegiance to \nother countries and who permanently decide to speak another language \nand who don't pledge allegiance to our flag. That underlies our debate \non immigration as much as anything else.\n  So this is a very fundamental issue for me, and I believe it is so \nfor a great many Americans. It is important for the people of this \ncountry to know that 12 of us in the Senate have before this body a \nvery simple resolution, not about what we are made to do but about what \nwe ought to do, and what we ought to do--whether we are at our Boy \nScout or Cub Scout meeting or whether we are opening the day in the \nSenate, and we say the Pledge of Allegiance--we ought to say it in our \ncommon language. If we are singing the national anthem before a \nfootball game, it ought to be in our common language, English. If we \nare taking the oath of allegiance required for citizenship in the \nUnited States of America, which a half million to a million new \ncitizens do every year, we ought to do so in English.\n  We ought to say that as Senators. The mayor of Los Angeles said it. \nHe is offended by the idea, he says, that our national anthem should \nnot be sung in some other language. Governor Bill Richardson says it. \nHe agrees. He doesn't think it ought to be an issue.\n  This bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives. It has \nstrong Democratic support there. What is wrong with the Senate \nDemocrats? Why do they insist, day after day, that our national anthem, \nour Pledge of Allegiance, and our oath of citizenship ought to be said \nor sung in some other language than our common language, English?\n  I would like to get this cleared up.\n  Out of respect for my colleagues in the Senate and the fact they are \nnot here to object, but they do object, I will not ask unanimous \nconsent today. But I again wish to say to my friends that this floor is \nfor the debating of important issues. This is an important issue. We \nhave so little civics and U.S. history taught in America's schools \ntoday that perhaps we need a little civics lesson every single day on \nthe floor of the Senate. I intend to provide it every single day I am \nhere until this legislation is voted on. And when it is voted on, I \npredict it will pass by a wide margin with bipartisan support; it might \neven pass with unanimous support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4106-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4106-S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      THE RISING COST OF GASOLINE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on a matter that \nhas gotten a lot of attention lately, and for good reason. The rising \ncost of gasoline is hitting all Americans hard. Families, businesses, \nfarmers, and truckers are all hurting as the cost escalates out of \ncontrol.\n  With gas prices now hovering around $3 a gallon, everyone in Congress \nis looking for a solution or for someone to blame. Unfortunately, some \nhave chosen to pinpoint ethanol as the culprit. However, blaming \nethanol for the costs at the pump ignores the fact that crude is at \nnear record highs, and our country is still suffering from a strained \ndomestic refining industry.\n  Around the country, gasoline refiners are making a voluntary decision \nto remove MTBE, a gasoline additive, from the market. In its place, \nthey are using ethanol. So, ethanol is currently being blended for the \nfirst time in many parts of the East Coast and in Texas.\n  Because of the new demand for ethanol, some of my colleagues have \nbegun to argue that there is a shortage and that it is responsible for \nthe rising cost of gasoline. They look to increased imports of ethanol, \nand the lifting of the import tariff, as the solution. Let me be clear: \nthere is no shortage of ethanol. And, ethanol is a tiny fraction of \ncost of gasoline.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. Guy Caruso, Administrator of \nthe Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy, \nrecently stated that the 10 percent blend of ethanol is affecting \nprices by ``just a few pennies.'' Ethanol's role in gasoline prices is \na tiny fraction of the overall increase.\n  I would like to address the claim that there is a shortage of \nethanol. According to the Energy Information Administration, 130,000 \nbarrels per day of ethanol are needed to replace MTBE. Last month, \n302,000 barrels of ethanol were produced each day. That seems to me \nlike it is enough to meet the demand. There is also 25 days of ethanol \nsupply in storage.\n  Have there been some transportation issues surrounding the transition \nfrom MTBE to ethanol? The answer is yes, and they're being dealt with. \nSufficient supplies of ethanol are where they need to be. There is no \nshortage of ethanol.\n  If there is no shortage, what good does it do to eliminate the import \ntariff on imported ethanol? None. Domestic supplies are sufficient.\n  Lifting the tariff won't have an impact on gas prices because the \nonly other major producer of ethanol--Brazil--simply doesn't have \nenough ethanol to export at significant levels at this time. I know \nthis issue well. I was in Brazil just six weeks ago, and one thing I \nheard over and over was that Brazil is experiencing an ethanol \nshortage.\n  Shortages of ethanol in Brazil are being driven by strong demand for \nethanol in that country. Looking at the longer term, USDA analysts in \nBrazil are reporting that Brazil is anticipating even higher demand for \nethanol later this year and in 2007.\n  Given low supplies in Brazil, there has even been talk of importing \nethanol into Brazil.\n  I would like to point out something else. Brazil and other countries \ncan already ship duty-free ethanol to the United States. They don't \nhave to pay the U.S. tariff. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \nBrazilian ethanol that is merely dehydrated in a Caribbean country can \nenter the U.S. market duty-free up to 7 percent of the U.S. ethanol \nmarket. That's generous access, but Brazil has never even come close to \nhitting the 7 percent cap.\n  And it isn't that the Caribbean countries don't have the capacity to \ndehydrate more Brazilian ethanol. They do.\n  As we're already providing duty-free access for Brazilian ethanol \nshipped through Caribbean countries, and as Brazil isn't taking full \nadvantage of this duty-free treatment, I don't know why we should bend \nover backwards to provide even more duty-free access for Brazilian \nethanol.\n  I especially don't know why we should do this given Brazil's stance \nin the Doha Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization. Brazil \nis the leader of the G-20 negotiating group in the WTO negotiations, a \ngroup that is resisting our efforts to obtain improved market access \nfor U.S. products around the world.\n  In addition, the Brazilian government intervenes extensively in the \nprice and supply of ethanol in that\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\ncountry. But the U.S. tariff on ethanol operates as an offset to an \nexcise tax credit that applies to both domestically produced and \nimported ethanol. So by lifting the tariff, we would in effect be \ngiving the benefits of a U.S. tax credit to subsidized Brazilian \nethanol.\n  Providing yet more duty-free treatment for Brazilian ethanol would \nsend the wrong signal to those Americans who are devoting their careers \nto help America become more energy independent. The U.S. ethanol \nindustry is working every day to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. \nThis is a virtue that President Bush has touted again and again.\n  Just last week the President restated his goal to replace oil from \naround the world by expanding the use of U.S. ethanol.\n  The President stated:\n\n       The federal government has got a role to play to encourage \n     new industries that will help this nation diversify away from \n     oil. And so we're strongly committed to corn-based ethanol \n     produced in America.\n\n  The President clearly understands the need to assist our domestic \nethanol industry so that they can get a foothold and succeed. Why would \nthe United States want to send a signal that we're backing away from \nour efforts to seek energy independence by promoting renewable fuels in \nthe United States?\n  We're already dependent on foreign oil. Surely, President Bush \ndoesn't intend for our nation to go down the path of eventually \nbecoming dependent on foreign ethanol also. Providing yet more duty-\nfree treatment would be a step in the wrong direction. I don't think \nour country should take any action that would harm the farmers and \ninvestors in rural America that have worked so hard to develop this \nindustry. The efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil have only \njust begun.\n  Providing more duty-free treatment for ethanol won't increase \nsupplies or reduce prices at the pump. It's a bad solution in search of \na problem. It's a bad idea for our energy independence and our national \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4107-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n    LIMITING THE TERM OF THE PUBLIC TRUSTEES OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND \n                                MEDICARE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to comment on legislation \nthat Chairman Grassley and I introduced yesterday that would limit \npublic trustees for Social Security and Medicare to a single four-year \nterm of service. The bill, S. 2752, will also codify that the President \nshould consult with Congress on the nominations of public trustees for \nthese important programs. This legislation was prompted by recent \nevents.\n  Upon learning last November that the White House intended to \nrenominate John L. Palmer and Thomas R. Saving as pubic trustees, \nChairman Grassley and I both responded immediately that the White House \nshould find two new individuals to nominate as public trustees. Both \nindividuals had already served one term as Social Security and Medicare \npublic trustees, and their terms ended in March 2005. Dr. Palmer and \nDr. Saving served admirably as public trustees during their term and \nthe Chairman and I thank them for their service, but I did not want to \nsee an important tradition abandoned. Never in the history of the \npublic trustees have individuals served more than one term, and that's \nfor good reason. Fresh thinking and new ideas are critical to the \nproper assessment and administration of the Social Security and \nMedicare programs. If the executive branch will not voluntarily follow \nthis vital precedent, this principle must be written into law.\n  There was a second problem last year. The White House is supposed to \nconsult with the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nbefore sending the nominations to the Senate. Unfortunately, no such \nconsultation occurred last year prior to the nominations being \nforwarded to the Senate. Therefore, the blll a adds language to the \nSocial Security Act requiring the President to consult with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Committee on Finance before \nconsidering individuals to be nominated as public trustees.\n  Ignoring our views, on April 19 of this year, the White House \nannounced the recess appointments of Mr. Palmer and Mr. Saving as \npublic trustees of the Social Security and Medicare programs. I \nimmediately objected to this action by the White House because I \nbelieve the role of the public trustees is too important to be \ndiminished by the recess appointment process. It was this extreme \naction on the part of the White House--in combination with the other \ntwo problems I mentioned previously--that prompted the chairman and me \nto introduce this bill today.\n  I think some good has come out of this unfortunate episode regarding \nthe public trustees. Hopefully, everyone has a better understanding of \nthe role of the public trustees. The Greenspan Commission recommended \ncreating the positions of two public trustees to help ensure that the \nreports on the Social Security and Medicare trust funds were objective \nand not solely the work of administration officials. The Greenspan \nCommission envisioned experts from outside the executive branch who are \nconfirmed by the Senate. They are unlike most other Presidential \nappointments because they do not represent the administration, they \nrepresent the public. Because of that unique distinction, it is \ninappropriate to recess appoint the public trustees. Individuals who \nare nominated to be public trustees should be selected by a process of \nconsultation between the White House and Members of Congress. Once \nconfirmed by the Senate, they should only serve one term. To do \notherwise undermines the public trustees' role as an objective check on \nthe production of the trust fund reports.\n  Since this legislation should not spark any controversy, I hope both \nChambers will quickly consider and pass this bill and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4107-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4107-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4107-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Ms. COLLINS, from the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 2459.

A bill to authorize the President to utilize Federal \nequipment, supplies, facilities, personnel, and other non-monetary \nresources to assist utility companies that contribute to recovery \nefforts from the effects of a major disaster; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would make a change to the Stafford Act that, in some cases, could \nfacilitate recovery from natural disasters.\n  Governments on the local, State and Federal level have a primary and \ncritical responsibility when it comes to responding to natural \ndisasters. A wide variety of private organizations also play an \nimportant role in the recovery process that complements and facilitates \npublic response efforts. In the case of private utility companies, \ntheir work to restore normal telecommunications, power, and other \nservices in a disaster area can greatly speed the recovery process.\n  Our investigation into the response to Hurricane Katrina has shown \nthat a number of utility companies were hampered in their recovery \nefforts by shortages of fuel, transportation, equipment, and other \nresources in the afflicted areas. In some cases, we also found that \nFEMA had supplies of scarce resources, received requests to share those \nresources but lacked the legal authority to do so.\n  What this bill would do is provide FEMA authority to share its \nresources during a disaster--at FEMA's discretion and for full \ncompensation. This would allow FEMA--in those cases where it has \nsufficient resources to share--to advance the recovery process in the \nwake of a disaster at no expense to the Government.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this commonsense legislation because \nit will incrementally improve our capacity to respond to disasters \nwithout additional costs to the Government. I ask for my colleagues' \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4108-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

On Monday, the Senate will continue to debate issues that \nI spoke to earlier this morning, issues that are critically needed, \nvery important to slow down the incessant rise in the cost of health \ncare, that will improve the quality of health care, will improve access \nto health care, will keep my colleagues in medicine from having to \ndesert or leave a State that they want to practice in or leave a \nprofession, a specialty they want to continue, because of exorbitant, \nhigh medical premiums that result in frivolous lawsuits.\n  At 5:15 on Monday, we will have two cloture votes on motions to \nproceed to a comprehensive medical malpractice bill and a tailored bill \ndesigned to give women access to health care. I hope that cloture will \nbe invoked on the motions to proceed so the Senate could begin to \ndebate the merits of those bills. They are very important bills. We \nhave spoken to the substance of those bills today and will continue to \ndo so Monday. I encourage my colleagues to allow us to continue that \ndebate on those bills and bring them to resolution.\n  If we are unsuccessful, if cloture fails on both of those measures, \nthen we would vote on Tuesday morning on a cloture motion on the motion \nto proceed to the small business health plans bill. All three of these \nissues are very important pieces of legislation. We have set them up in \norder that we can deal with them one at a time. We are trying to get on \nthem to debate them, and so far there has been indication that there is \ngoing to be attempts to obstruct and stop and not let us get on those. \nWe hopefully will be successful in doing just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/05/senate-section/article/S4117-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 8, 2006, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
