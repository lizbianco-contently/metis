Mr. President, prior to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine leaving the floor, I want to express my appreciation to her, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Dodd, and Senator Lott for their work on \nlobbying reform. We are going to complete this legislation; it is just \na question of when we complete the legislation. It is something we need \nto do, and the American people want us to do it. Even though I am sure \neveryone's patience was tested yesterday--I have managed bills and I \nknow how difficult it is when you can see the light at the end of the \ntunnel and somebody throws up a light and you can no longer see the \nend--we will complete the legislation. I am hopeful and I am confident \nwe can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his \ncomments. This is an important piece of legislation. It has been \ncompletely bipartisan. The legislation reported by the Homeland \nSecurity Committee was reported with only one dissenting vote. The bill \nthat was reported by the Rules and Administration Committee was \nreported unanimously. We have worked very closely with our ranking \nmembers, and I appreciate the assurances of the Democratic leader that \nhis side of\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\nthe aisle recognizes the importance of enacting this bipartisan \nlegislation. There is no reason why with a good effort we can't \ncomplete the bill today.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his comments.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1926-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to suggest to Democratic Senators \nto oppose cloture today. I will say to all assembled that the vote \nunder the rules is to occur tomorrow. If the majority leader decides he \nwants to do it today, we would not oppose even having that vote today. \nWe are going to oppose cloture. The reason being, if you read \nnewspapers today, you will see the House of Representatives, by a 99-\npercent margin in the supplemental appropriations bill, put a provision \nin that basically bans the Dubai Ports situation. I agree with that.\n  I suggested to the majority leader that we could have a vote on that \nmatter right now after a very short time period to debate it. That \nwould take it off of this bill. The majority leader said he doesn't \nwant that. He suggested voting on it tomorrow.\n  To make a long story short, the majority leader at this point has not \nagreed to do that. As a result of that, any other thing we come up with \ntakes the second-degree amendment away. It doesn't allow that to be the \nmatter before the Senate.\n  I had a conversation with Senator Dodd last night, and he was telling \nme how disappointed he was that we weren't going to complete this bill \ntoday. But this is where the American people find the Senate today and \nthat is where we as Senators find ourselves today.\n  As I said yesterday--I say again today--I don't know if there is a \nchange of heart because of Congressman Boehner now having a leadership \nposition in the House or whether it is a matter of mere coincidence, \nbut I appreciate the House of Representatives being a legislative body, \na separate and equal branch of government.\n  We do not have to take orders from the White House. We don't have to \ndo what they tell us we should do, whether this is a Democratic Senate \nor Republican Senate. There has been no better spokesperson of that \nthan Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd for years has said--and he has a \nportfolio to substantiate what he said--that we serve separately from \nthe President. Whether it is Democrat or Republican down there, we have \nour responsibilities.\n  I admire what the House did. They said we know this President feels \nstrongly about this. We know he said he is going to veto it, but we are \ngoing to do it because we think we have an obligation to our \nconstituents. I am glad they did that. No rubberstamp. I think it is \nabout time. The issue is of critical importance to our national \nsecurity. Whether it is Iraq, Katrina, or protecting Americans from \nterrorist threats, we have seen this administration choose, I believe, \nthe wrong course.\n  We have had amendments here on the floor where we wanted to increase \nthe security at our ports, checking our cargo containers, our chemical \nplants, our nuclear plants. We could go down a long list. The White \nHouse said they don't want them. So we don't get them. By a straight \nparty-line vote we lose over here. I hope this is coming to an end.\n  That is why it has been so difficult to work on a bipartisan basis \nmost of the time. There have been no vetoes. There has been nothing to \nveto. Whatever the President wants, he has gotten. The losers have been \nthe American people, in my opinion.\n  That is where we found ourselves yesterday.\n  My friend from New York--no one can question his having been out \nfront on this issue from the very beginning. I appreciate his working \non a bipartisan basis to move this matter along. I told Senator Frist \nthis. I went to our special caucus yesterday, and we had Democratic \nSenators coming from every side of the room saying I am going to move \nto do what the House has done. As a result of that, Senator Schumer \ncame to the floor and offered an amendment which was going to be \noffered. His having been out in front--I am glad he proposed it. He is \nthe face of this amendment. He deserves it. He was the first one who \nnoticed this issue in the press or anywhere else. I admire the work he \nhas done on this issue.\n  We can't turn over control of these ports to a foreign country. That \nis what this is about. This isn't a foreign company, it is a foreign \ncountry.\n  I received a 1\\1/2\\-page memo from the Commissioner of Ports of New \nJersey and New York. He said in his memo that whoever got this contract \nwas going to be all powerful. They would control the perimeters of the \nports. They would control who worked in the port. They would do \nbackground checks of the people who work there. The American people \ncould sense this.\n  I think we overuse certain terms, but we want an up-or-down vote.\n  On the ``Lou Dobbs'' show last night when he was questioning one of \nthe guests--Lou Dobbs is on CNN--he said they are the same Republicans \nwho were demanding an up-or-down vote on judges such as Alito and they \nwon't give you a vote on this port thing. The only answer is, yes, it \nis true.\n  My friend, the distinguished majority leader, has decided it is not \nappropriate at this time to address this issue. That is a decision he \ncan make.\n  We stand ready to vote on this port matter after a very short debate. \nI am sure Senator Schumer would agree to a couple hours, evenly \ndivided, maybe even a shorter time than that, but at least a couple of \nhours would be appropriate at any time and move on.\n  I say through the Chair to anyone within the sound of my voice, \nlobbying reform will be completed, and it will be completed, I hope, \nsooner rather than later. This lobbying reform is important. We need to \ndo everything we can to help restore integrity to what we do in \nWashington.\n  Having said that, it was absolutely wrong for the Senate not to take \naction yesterday on the most important issue the American people see \ntoday, and that is port security. I listened to Public Radio this \nmorning. They had part of the debate that took place in the House of \nRepresentatives. I do not recall exactly what the vote was. I think it \nwas 62 to 2 or something like that. Marcy Kaptur, whom I came to the \nHouse of Representatives with, a Congresswoman from Ohio, said never in \nher long career in the House of Representatives has she received as \nmany phone calls and other communications from constituents about an \nissue as the port security issue. And she speaks for the entire \nCongress. That is the way it has been. My phones in my office in the \nHart Building of the Capitol area and in my Nevada offices are \noverwhelmed with people concerned about this issue.\n  I support what my friend from New York did. I hope in the near future \nthe Senate will be able to vote on this matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I express my disappointment at the words \nof the Democratic leader urging our colleagues to vote against cloture \non the lobbying reform measure. This is important legislation. This \nlegislation matters. This legislation is bipartisan legislation. It is \nin response to declining public confidence in the integrity of the \ndecisions made by Government officials.\n  It is extremely unfortunate and unfair for this much needed \nlegislation to be slowed down by an important but completely unrelated \nissue, regardless of one's views on the Dubai transaction. The \nPresiding Officer knows I have been outspoken in calling for a full \ninvestigation of the national security implications of this \ntransaction, but regardless of one's views on it, this issue should not \nbe tangled up in the debate on whether or not to strengthen our \nlobbying disclosure laws.\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n  We have worked hard to produce a bipartisan bill, two bipartisan \nbills, that have been married to strengthen our lobbying laws. It is \nextremely unfortunate to hear the Democrat leader say we should get it \ndone sometime but everyone should vote against cloture. That leads me \nto question whether there really is a commitment to strengthening our \nlobbying laws.\n  There is no reason we cannot proceed to the many amendments that have \nbeen filed, to debate them fully, let the Senate work its will on each \nof the amendments, and then clear this legislation so we can go to \nconference with the House and send the bill to the President's desk.\n  Public confidence in Congress is very low right now, maybe at record \nlow levels. This legislation helps to promote public confidence in the \nwork we do and the decisions we make. This should not be a partisan \nissue, and it has not been until the Democrat leader came to the Senate \nto urge his colleagues to oppose cloture.\n  Why can't we proceed with the measure before the Senate? It is a \nbipartisan measure.\n  My colleague, Senator Lieberman, has worked hand in hand with me on \nthe Committee on Homeland Security to produce this bill. Senator \nMcCain, Senator Santorum, Senator Dodd, Senator Feingold--all have been \ninvolved and have worked very hard. Indeed, yesterday we were on the \nverge of enacting a bipartisan amendment with the lead sponsor being a \nDemocratic Senator. I supported his amendment. It had to do with holds \nbeing placed on bills. I thought it was a good amendment that would \nhelp increase the transparency and accountability of what we are doing.\n  It is unfortunate the Democratic leader is urging delay, saying we \nshould not proceed to wrap up this bill and, in fact, we should not \nvote for cloture.\n  I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support cloture. \nIt is imperative we move ahead with this bill. If we do not act today \nto pass this legislation to strengthen public confidence in the \ndecisions we make, shame on us.\n  I am not saying the issue raised by the Senator from New York is not \nan important issue. As I said, I have spoken time and again in favor of \na full 45-day review, and we have gotten that. We need to find out the \nresults of that investigation, have the Committee on Foreign Investment \nreport not only to the President but to us, and then make our \ndecisions.\n  I am introducing legislation to reform the entire Committee on \nForeign Investment to give it a stronger homeland security and national \nsecurity role and to house it in the Department of Homeland Security. \nThat is an important issue. But it is not the issue before the Senate \ntoday. The issue before the Senate today is the lobbying reform \nmeasure, two bipartisan bills that have been put together that will \nhelp strengthen and promote public confidence in our decisions. Let's \nget on with the task before the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nvery eloquent remarks. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \nhard work on behalf of shaping legislation and bringing to the Senate \namendments that we can help bring about a restoration of confidence on \nthe part of the American people in the way we do business. I also \ncongratulate the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, who has \nworked so closely with Senator Collins, as Senator Dodd has worked \nclosely with Senator Lott.\n  There are a group of Senators from both sides of the aisle--Senator \nObama, myself, Senators Lieberman, Collins, Lott, Pryor, a number of \nother Senators--who, on an ad hoc basis, sat down for many hours to \ndiscuss the various measures we believe need to be taken.\n  Also, there is another group of Senators that is very concerned about \nthe whole earmarking process which, in the view of any objective \nobserver, has lurched completely out of control, and which is the \nsource of a lot of the problems we are facing with the need for \nlobbying reform because we have a system that makes it so vulnerable to \nthe exploitations of a few unscrupulous people--to wit, the Congressman \nCunningham case, as well as others.\n  I have never come to the Senate in the years I have been here to talk \nabout this institution. One, I didn't believe I had a need to, much \nless have a right to. I have only been here since 1987. There are a \nnumber of other Members who have been here a lot longer. But what I saw \nhappen yesterday and what I have seen transpire makes me very \nconcerned, and even to a degree saddened at the way the Senate has \ndegenerated and deteriorated from an atmosphere of a willingness to \naddress issues in the fashion that the Senate has to, which has to do \nwith sitting down, discussing, agreeing, and moving forward. We are not \nthe other body. Every Senator not only has individual rights, but, \nthank God, 40 or 41 of them can prevent action from being taken.\n  I see a degree of partisanship and bitterness and mistrust permeating \nthis place which is not good not only for the institution of the Senate \nbut for the United States of America. When I first arrived here, the \nleaders at that time, whether the other side was in the majority or \nminority, and various more senior Members would sit down and settle on \nan agenda that the Senate would pursue which, first and foremost, was \nin the interests of the American people and, secondarily, was in the \ninterests of the respective parties.\n  Now we cannot move forward in the simplest fashion on issues that we \nare all in agreement on, much less come to some agreement as to how we \ncan address an issue that is more contentious.\n  A lot of my colleagues say they love the institution of the Senate. I \ndon't love the institution of the Senate, but I respect it. I respect \nit more than any institution I have ever been associated with. When I \ntravel around the world, usually at taxpayer expense, I am even more \nproud of the institution of the Senate because it epitomizes what \nAmerica is all about: participatory democracy, the ability of one \nanother to fully debate and ventilate issues and come to consensus \nwithout taint of corruption or illegitimacy in any way.\n  Now I see this institution deteriorating and degenerating to a point \nwhere sometimes I am not only embarrassed but sometimes a little \nashamed.\n  Yesterday, we had a procedure going on to address a major concern of \nthe American people, and that is the lobbying practices and the ethics \nrules with which we conduct our business. This was a product of a \nbipartisan effort, both formal and informal, for many weeks. This was \nan agreement. Of course, there was a tinge of partisanship, as there \nalways is, but 95 percent of it involved Members sitting down, \nrecognizing that American people do not approve of what we are doing. A \nmajority of the American people believe we do not share their \npriorities. Only 25 percent of the American people approve of Congress; \n75 percent disapprove.\n  The major concerns the American people have is they fear there is \ncorruption in our institutions. When we see the conviction of a Member \nof Congress, when we see continued allegations concerning special \nfavors and the influence of special interests, there is at least smoke, \nif not fire, in those associated with those allegations.\n  Yesterday, thanks to a bipartisan effort, we were moving forward with \nan agenda. We had considered amendments. We had voted on one concerning \ngifts. There was another one coming up that was going to be \ncontentious, and that is the use of corporate jets by Members of \nCongress, for paying first-class fare instead of the charter rate which \nevery other citizen is required to do. Obviously, I will not get into \nthat debate. And then we had a schedule of some other amendments.\n  Then the Senator from New York came to the Senate and said just \nbefore the vote, ``Reserving the right to object . . . '' because he \nwas reserving the right to object to a unanimous consent agreement, as \nwe do business here by unanimous consent agreement, ``before we set it \naside, on this amendment.'' On this amendment, that was his statement. \nIt is part of the Record. Then when he was recognized, he reached into \nhis pocket and pulled out an amendment.\n  It is the right of every Senator under the rules to propose an \namendment. It is not the right of every Senator to mislead his \ncolleagues. It is not the right of every Senator. How can we do\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\nbusiness in this Senate if our colleagues mislead us?\n  The current Presiding Officer, who happened to be the Chair at the \ntime, was surprised, as were the rest of us.\n  Fortunately, we keep a transcript of our remarks, and I went back and \nI quoted from it again. I do not in any way criticize the right of any \nSenator to propose an amendment at any time that is under the \nparliamentary rules. But to stand up on the floor of this Senate and \nsay you are going to do one thing and then you do another is not only \ninappropriate, but it risks--it risks--a breakdown of the kind of \ncourtesy we have to extend to each other if we are going to function as \na body.\n  So now the larger issue. The Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nNew York are dead set on an amendment to negate the agreement \nconcerning the leasing of terminals in the United States by the United \nArab Emirates. I understand the passion they feel on that issue. I \nrespect their views on that. But do we have to--knowing full well it \nwould tie up the Senate--the Senator from Nevada has been around here \nas long as I have. Knowing full well it would tie up the Senate, bring \nto a halt any action we might take on ethics and lobbying reform, still \nwe are insistent upon that.\n  Now, the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Nevada will \nstand up: It is our right, it is our right to propose any amendment \nthat is in a parliamentary fashion acceptable. I agree with that. I do \nnot dispute their right. I do dispute stopping--which it has; now we \nare not going to move forward until after the cloture vote--stopping \nour progress on the issue which is more important to the American \npeople or as important in an orderly fashion.\n  The Senator from Nevada knows full well if we are going to act \nlegislatively in this body he is going to have an opportunity to \npropose this amendment. If we are going to act legislatively, we could \nstop, we could not do anything in the Senate for 45 days or a month or \nuntil the upcoming elections.\n  But my point is--and I want to, in fairness, say I see a lot of the \nsame thing on this side of the aisle quite occasionally, quite \nfrequently, that we will propose amendments to gain some kind of \npolitical advantage. That has always been part of the way we have done \nbusiness. But hasn't it gotten out of proportion to our first \nobligation, and that is to do the people's business? Isn't that the \nreason why only 25 percent of the American people approve of what we do \nand how we do it? Aren't we concerned? Aren't we concerned about how \nthe American people feel about us, the people we purport to represent?\n  What we need to do here is for the leaders on both sides, with \nothers, to sit down and map out an agenda we can all agree to. But to \nbring this process of ethics and lobbying reform and earmark reform to \na halt for the sake of an amendment that has nothing whatsoever to do \nwith the businesses at hand, which is highly contentious, I think is \nnot doing the people's business.\n  I want to emphasize again, I do not dispute the right of the other \nside of the aisle to act in a parliamentary fashion. There is nothing \nillegal they are doing. But I would hope that perhaps the greater good \nwould prevail here, and we could sit down and work these things out, \nwhich would require concessions made on both sides, which has been the \ncase of the way the Senate functions.\n  So I must say, I have only been here since 1987, but I have never \nseen anything like I saw yesterday in the years I have been here. But \nit is also symptomatic of the bitter partisanship that prevails here, \nwhich prevents us from doing anything meaningful or doing very much \nmeaningful for the American people.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle want to give this side \nof the aisle some of the blame for this partisanship we experience \nhere, I accept it. I accept it. I do not debate it. My point is, it is \ntime we sat down and mapped out an agenda we can all agree to, and \nstart doing the business of the people of this country first and our \nparties' business and political advantage second.\n  I do not mean to be contentious in these remarks. I do not mean to be \ntoo critical. But I did happen to be on the floor yesterday and see \nsomething, as I said, I have never seen before. We have to stop, take a \ndeep breath, sit down together, and start working together. That sounds \na bit utopian or Pollyannaish, but it is not. And in the many years I \nhave been here, I saw people able to sit down--even if they had \nstrongly held feelings--together and work things out. We are not able \nto do that today. It is time we changed course.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. I hope I was not in any way \ncondescending in my remarks concerning my concern about this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Madam President, let me, if I may, respond to some of the \nthings that have been said. I see my good friend from New York is here \nas well. I expect he may want to share some thoughts. I will not be \nlong. First, let me say to my good friends from Maine and Arizona, they \nare truly wonderful friends, and I have worked on countless occasions \nwith both of them. I regret we are in this situation as well. I say to \nmy friends, this is a matter that is extremely important. We have all \nworked very hard in a bipartisan fashion to bring up both this lobbying \nreform and ethics reform package. So I am still confident, despite the \ndifferences that occurred yesterday, that we are going to achieve that \ngoal.\n  I had hoped we would be able to finish it by this week so we would \nnot end up having an elongated debate about the subject matter. I do \nnot think it needs that much time. I am sorry that is not going to \noccur.\n  Let me also quickly say to my friend from Arizona, much of what he \nhas said I agree with. I am a product of this place in many ways. I \nhave been here a long time. I sat here on the floor as a page back--I \nthink Jefferson was President when I sat on the floor here, that is how \nlong ago it was--watching Lyndon Johnson sitting as Vice President of \nthe United States, and with the all-night civil rights debates, and so \nforth. So I am very much a product of this institution. My father \nserved here, and so I have great reverence for the Senate.\n  I too regret what has happened in many ways, that we do not spend the \ntime to work out matters, as we have done on this bill. I think this \nbill has been a good example of how the Senate ought to function in \nmany ways. That is not to say we are all going to agree on every \namendment offered, but we created a process by which this can be done. \nI am disappointed we come here on Tuesdays and leave on Thursdays. \nThere was a time when we used to come on Monday and stay until Friday, \nand there was ample time during the week for consideration of matters.\n  Part of the difficulty is, today, when you know you have to come in \non a Tuesday at about 5 and leave on Thursday at about 5, then in order \nto deal with all the matters in front of you, you start doing things or \noffering things in a fashion you might not otherwise were there more of \nan opportunity to deal with it.\n  I counted up last night. I suspect, if I am correct, that there are \nabout 60 legislative days left in this session. Assuming we will \nprobably adjourn sometime in September for the fall elections, we have \n60 days left to deal with a variety of issues.\n  My colleague from Arizona is right. Look, the numbers are there. The \nAmerican public is not happy with how they see their national \nlegislative body\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nfunctioning. There are many reasons for that, not the least of which is \nthere are issues out there which they confront every single day that \nare staggering to them--their health care problems, employment issues, \nthe education quality in our country. We all know what the issues are. \nWe do not have to do a survey. They want to know whether we are going \nto pay attention to the matters they grapple with every single day.\n  This is also an important issue because it has to do with how we are \nperceived as a body. So I am not going to minimize this at all. I am \nnot going to stand here and suggest we are all--at one time or another \nwe have done things that I suspect if we had the chance to do them \nagain, we would do them differently.\n  I will let my colleague from New York address and express what his \nintents were and what his purposes were, but he raised what, as my \ncolleague from Arizona said, is a very important issue. All of us know \nthat. We have had major hearings. My friend from Maine has had major \nhearings on this question already. The Banking Committee has had \nhearings. The other body has already passed, at least out of the \nAppropriations Committee--my good friend Congressman Jerry Lewis has \npassed--I think 60 to 2 was the vote, something like that yesterday, a \nsimilar proposal dealing with this question about our port security.\n  So none of us minimalize this issue. This is not some extraneous \nmatter that has marginal importance to people here. It is timely. It is \nimportant. It is critical. People are worried about it.\n\n  I would hope, because the hour of 2:15, or whatever the time for this \ncloture vote is to occur, has not arrived, that there might still be an \nopportunity for us to find some way to be able to say--next week, the \nweek after, whenever it is here--that we have a chance for an hour or \ntwo to raise an important issue, have a good debate in the Senate--in \nfact, the leader mentioned 2 hours; I think 3 or 4 or 5 hours--for us \nto discuss an issue of that importance, and with that agreement being \nreached, we then would agree there will be no other extraneous matters \nbrought up on this bill, and then we could move forward with it so we \ndo not end up tying ourselves in a knot with cloture motions and voting \nagainst or for and whatever we are going to do here, delaying the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  I will leave it to my colleague from New York to explain what his \nintentions are, what he would like to do. But having talked to him, I \nbelieve he is going to suggest we have something like that. I realize \nthat causes some heartburn for others. But nonetheless, my hope is that \nwe can get away from this, get back to where we were yesterday morning, \nmoving rather smoothly through a process that Senator Collins and my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Lott and I \nwere trying to create, with having one amendment going back and forth \nfrom either side, and getting down to a number where we actually had a \ngood possibility of concluding the consideration of this bill by this \nevening.\n  That may not happen now because of the delay here. But my appeal \nwould be to the Republican leader--I just heard the Democratic leader--\nto see if in the next hour or so we can't come to some agreement here \nto get back on this bill. Let's avoid the cloture votes and get through \nthis legislation. Let's keep it a clean bill, if we can, despite the \ntemptation to bring up other issues. Set aside some time for this \ndebate, and discuss it here on the floor, dealing with the port \nsecurity issues. That way I think we have satisfied our roles to deal \nwith timely questions, to deal with this important matter, and avoid \nthe kind of acrimony that can truly cause this place to crater again.\n  Again, I say I will let my friend from New York explain what he did. \nBut I understand his motives to at least bring up this very important \nmatter, and one that all of us care deeply about. We are hearing about \nit from our constituents.\n  Again, to my friend from Arizona, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect and admiration--I have loved working with him over the years on \nmany matters--I too worry. If more committees conducted themselves as \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee does--my \nCommittee on Banking, by the way--with oversight, looking at issues--I \nthink the Armed Services Committee is doing a pretty good job on a lot \nof these issues. That is the role of the Senate: to be engaged in the \ndebate, the discussion, to provide the time here on the floor, with \nthat Monday through Friday, so we have a good opportunity here to \ndiscuss the important issues of the day.\n  Again, the leadership has to work this out. A lot of us are at fault \nbecause we ask the leaders, we say: I can't be around on Friday. I \ncan't be here on Monday. Can you wait until 6 o'clock on Tuesday? All \nof a sudden, you are arriving on Tuesday and leaving on Thursday night. \nNo other job in America allows you to come for a couple days a week in \norder to do business.\n  So I am sorry in a way we are finding ourselves in this truncated \nsituation. I regret we are in this situation, but we can get out of it \nas well. My hope would be we would find an opportunity to provide a \nwindow to discuss port security, which is critical, and clean this bill \nup. Let's deal with the issues before us. My friend from Maine said it \nwell earlier: We need to get back on this question. I agree with her on \nthat point. That appeal is out there. I will leave it up to the leaders \nto decide how to proceed, but I hope that will be the case.\n  Madam President, I see my friend from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues, particularly my \ngood friend from Connecticut, as well as the minority leader, for \nlaying out our position. Before I begin, I do want to thank the Senator \nfrom Maine, the Senator from Connecticut, his colleague, the other \nSenator from Connecticut, as well as the Senator from Mississippi for \ntheir hard work on this issue. Nobody gainsays the importance of doing \nethics reform. I certainly have been a member of the Rules Committee \nand involved in it. The bottom line is very simple: Doing ethics reform \nand dealing with the Dubai issue are not mutually exclusive. We can do \nboth. We can do both this week. The motion made by the minority leader \nmakes that perfectly clear. The two are not mutually exclusive. Nothing \nwould make us happier on this side of the aisle than working out an \nagreement where we would be given time to debate this amendment, \nseparately or as part of the bill, whichever would be the majority's \npreference, and then move back to the very important, thoughtfully \nworked-out legislation on ethics reform.\n  We have to deal with the Dubai ports issue not in April or May but \nnow. That is not only what the American people want, it is important to \nevery one of us. I come from New York. We went through 9/11. Ever since \nthat day, ever since the next day, when I put on this flag which I wear \nevery day in memory of those who were lost, I have said: We have to do \neverything we can to make sure it doesn't happen again. That doesn't \nmean it should be No. 16 or No. 17 or even Nos. 3 or 4 on the list. It \nshould be No. 1.\n  When we heard that Dubai Ports World was going to take over our \nports, it naturally raised alarms, not because the country was an Arab \ncountry but because the country had had a long nexus with terrorism. \nThe more you look at the deal, the worse it gets. That is the problem.\n  First, we find out that the review done by the CFIUS committee was \ncursory, quick. They didn't even call the port authorities, such as New \nYork, New Jersey, and ask about it. The letter that my friend from \nSouth Carolina first procured, Senator Graham, given to Senator Reid \nand myself, lays out very clearly how an operator of a port can have a \ngreat deal to do with security. Then not only did we find out that the \nreview was cursory and casual, it seemed that the wheels were greased \nto let this deal go through. Everything was quick. Everything was \nsecret. Everything was quiet.\n  A group of us--myself, my colleague from North Dakota, both \ncolleagues from New Jersey, my colleague from New York, both colleagues \nfrom Connecticut, many others from the metropolitan areas--said: We \nhave to do something. We have to move because we can't wait. The \nbipartisan legislation that we introduced said: Put the deal on hold. \nDo the 45-day review.\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nMake sure the report goes to Congress. We get to see it; a \nnonclassified version goes to the American people. And then we get the \nright, if we choose, to disapprove.\n  The 45-day review was going forward, but none of the other conditions \nhave been met. Right now the law would be such that the 45-day review \nwould go forward. We wouldn't know how thorough it would be because it \nwould be secret. The Congress and the American people would never know \nthe results of the review, and the President would get to say ``yes'' \nor ``no.'' The President has already said ``yes.'' If the President had \nsaid: I am going to take a new look at this after the 45-day review, it \nmight give us some hope. But he didn't. It is Alice in Wonderlandlike--\nverdict first, trial second.\n  Then, this weekend, a few more things occurred. The head of Dubai \nPorts World was on national television in America on a CNN show. And \nwhen asked by Wolf Blitzer, chief correspondent in Dubai, how many \ncontainers do you inspect here in Dubai, he answered: I don't know.\n  When asked what kind of security guarantees do you have about the \nemployees who might work on the perimeter or with the cargo manifests, \nhe didn't even care. He simply said: We have to make our British \nshareholders happy. That has been the whole trouble with this process. \nThat has been the trouble with the CFIUS process. It seems that \neconomics and diplomacy trump security.\n  In fact, I have been around the CFIUS process for a while, being a \nmember of the House Banking Committee and now the Senate Banking \nCommittee. I have been on the Banking Committees for every one of my 26 \nyears in Congress. Basically, it was passed before I got here, but the \nCFIUS process was basically done to give national security cover and \nallow economic deals to go forward. Because in the 1980s and the 1990s, \nthe greatest concern we had was not security but economics. After 9/11, \nall that changed, but the CFIUS process did not.\n  Many of us have come to the same conclusion that Jerry Lewis in the \nHouse came to, and I guess 62 of the 64 Appropriations Committee \nmembers, bipartisan, in the House Appropriations Committee, that this \ndeal should be stopped.\n  We don't have the luxury of waiting. That appropriations bill may not \nget over here until April, the supplemental. It may not be voted on \nuntil May. The deal will be consummated and done. And then they will \nsay: You can't undo it. There will be constitutional and legal \nproblems.\n\n  We have to act now. There are a variety of ways to act. I have chosen \none. There is no monopoly on that. Maybe there is another. And \ncertainly there are a variety of procedures. We can vote, as Senator \nReid offered, as a separate standing bill today, tomorrow, early next \nweek. We can do it as part of this bill. We can make an arrangement and \nmake it somewhere else. But the voice of the Senate must be heard. \nLobbying reform is important, yes, but so is security. Lobbying reform \nhas some time urgency, given everything we have seen, yes, but not more \ntime urgency than this deal which might engender our security.\n  Let me be clear: We can do both. This Chamber can walk and chew gum \nat the same time. We can spend some time debating this, go back to \nlobbying reform and accomplish both our goals. But let me make one \nthing clear: We will use whatever parliamentary means we can to make \nsure there is a vote on this issue. In recent months and years, the \nSenate has changed. It is much harder to offer amendments. The tree is \nfilled up. There are agreements that amendments cannot be germane. \nCloture is filed. Our job, my job, as I represent 19 million New \nYorkers, is to see that they are secure, above all. Therefore, I \nbelieve that we must vote on this amendment soon, quickly, and move on \nto other business.\n  I tell my colleagues, certainly this Senator from New York and, I \nthink, many of my colleagues, will do everything we can to make sure \nthat there is a vote on Dubai Ports World, a meaningful vote that ends \nthe deal before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have listened to the thoughtful \ncomments this morning. I understand there is some controversy, some \npassion and anxiety about all of this. It is not partisan. There is \nnothing partisan about an amendment dealing with the Dubai Ports World \nissue. This is a significant issue. As my colleagues have said, the \nbill that is on the floor is also a significant issue. Both need to be \ndealt with. Both should be considered by this great deliberative body. \nBut this is not about partisanship at all.\n  I understand partisanship. I regret that there is too much of it in \nthis town. I left the House many years ago, decided I was going to \nleave the House. I did run for the Senate, but I was done with the \nHouse of Representatives. What did it for me was when they established, \nthrough then-Congressman Gingrich--I guess it is all right to say his \nname--something called GOPAC. And they word-tested through polls and \nthen sent out a missive to everyone in his political camp that said: \nHere is the way we deal with this. When you are describing your \nopponent in a political election, use the words ``sick,'' ``traitor,'' \n``pathetic,'' ``antifamily,'' ``antiflag.'' That was sent all over this \ncountry by an organization that said: This is the way you should engage \nin politics. Here are the words you should use to describe your \nopponents. And we poll tested them. They work. Describe your opponents \nas sick, pathetic, traitor, antiflag. That was sent around the country. \nThat is what polluted the House of Representatives. I had been there \nlong enough when I saw that sort of thing.\n  I love the Senate. I respect the Senate. I like being here. It is a \ngreat privilege to serve in the Senate. I regret there is probably too \nmuch partisanship here as well. I don't think we have had the kind of \npartisanship that infected the House beginning in the late 1980s, but I \nrealize that this body and the House and the President, for that \nmatter, are not in good standing with the American people these days. \nThat circumstance exists because the American people take a look at us \nand they say: Here is what we face in our daily lives, and you are not \naddressing it. You are doing nothing about it. Why aren't you sinking \nyour teeth into the significant issues of the day? The issue that faces \nme when I pull up to the gas pump, why aren't you sinking your teeth \ninto that issue?\n  Someone stood up in North Dakota recently from a human service \nnonprofit organization and said: I just had an 81-year-old woman come \nin looking for a job. She just lost her last job. Do you know what her \nlast job was at age 81? Cleaning office buildings starting at 1 a.m. \nThen they cut back that employment, so now she needs another job \nbecause her Social Security is $170 a month. So at age 81 she is \nlooking for a second job to clean buildings. Why aren't you doing \nsomething about that? Why isn't the Congress addressing that?\n  An hour ago, this Government announced that last month's trade \ndeficit was $68.5 billion in 1 month, the highest in the history of the \nhuman race. What does that mean? It is not just 68.5 billion dollars, \nit is jobs, massive numbers of jobs moving overseas, and it is the \nselling of this country piece by piece; at a rate of $2 billion a day \nwe are selling America. Why don't we sink our teeth into that? Stem \ncell research, reimportation of prescription drugs, why don't you sink \nyour teeth into that, they wonder.\n  At least part of the reason in the Senate that we can't sink our \nteeth into these issues is because we are prevented from offering \namendments to do so. My colleague has offered an amendment on a \ncontroversial issue, I understand. The issue of whether a United Arab \nEmirates company called Dubai Ports World should be managing America's \nseaports. Should they manage some of America's largest seaports? Is \nthis issue controversial? I suppose it is. Is it urgent that the \nCongress address this? Of course, it is urgent. The House \nAppropriations Committee, controlled by the President's own political \nparty, yesterday by a vote of 62 to 2 slapped an amendment on an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill designed to provide money \nfor the Department of Defense and for Hurricane Katrina recovery. They \nslapped an amendment on there to stop this ports deal. Good for them. \nSo there has been offered in\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nthe Senate an amendment to stop the ports deal. All of a sudden the \nSenate is stopped, dead cold in its tracks. Why is it that a proposal \nsuch as this becomes a set of brake pads for the Senate? Who decides it \nshould shut things down because someone offers an amendment to stop \nthis takeover of the management of U.S. ports by a company from the \nUnited Arab Emirates? Why wouldn't we vote on it? How about yesterday \nwhen it was offered, after people got over being upset that we had to \ndeal with it, how about voting on it and then moving ahead?\n  The underlying bill by Senator Collins and Senator Dodd is a bill we \nshould do.\n  I am enormously pleased with their leadership. That has not been easy \nto bring that bill to the floor. Senator Lieberman, Senator Lott, the \ntwo I have mentioned should be commended. Look, this is leadership. \nThey have brought a bill to the floor that is important. We need to do \nit. But there is nothing that suggests that just because an amendment \nwas offered dealing with Dubai Ports World, it ought to shut down the \nSenate. It didn't shut down the House yesterday when Congressman Lewis \noffered it to an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. They just \nvoted. Why have we not voted? Senator Frist, I guess, has decided we \nwon't vote on it. So we will stop the Senate cold in its tracks. We \nwill pull down on the side of the road and hang out for while.\n  Does that make any sense to anybody? This doesn't make sense to me. \nSeventy, seventy-five percent of the American people--polls tell us--\nthink that it is stark raving nuts to have a company owned by the \nUnited Arab Emirates manage our major ports. I know we have some people \nwho are the elitists in Washington and who think they know better than \nall of the American people. They think they have greater wisdom and the \nAmerican people just don't get it. These elitists think that the \nAmerican people are isolationist xenophobes and cannot see over the \nhorizon. So we have people in Washington who think this deal with Dubai \nPorts World is fine. It is not fine with me. It is not fine with 70, 75 \npercent of the American people.\n  If we get a vote on it in the Senate, it will not be fine with an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate. The question is, Will we be able \nto do in the Senate what the House did? That is, have an opportunity to \nvote on this proposition: Should a company owned by the United Arab \nEmirates be managing America's ports?\n  Well, it is interesting to read some of the things that have been \nwritten in recent days about this. United Arab Emirates, to the extent \nthey have cooperated with us since 9/11, good for them. We hope they \nwill continue. But there are questions about the extent to which they \nwere involved in 9/11--yes, two of the hijackers were from there; yes, \na substantial amount of evidence exists that the financing for the 9/11 \nplots went through financial institutions in the UAE. Dr. Khan from \nPakistan was moving nuclear materials that were being pirated and \nshipped around the world to North Korea and Iran and other countries, \nand that was accommodated by the UAE ports.\n  Interestingly enough, the 9/11 Commission report--I have cited the \npage in a previous discussion--talks about when we knew where Osama bin \nLaden was in 1999. We knew where he was, because our intelligence \npinpointed his location. They readied the cruise missiles to shoot at \nthis location. Overnight, they decided they had to withhold and would \nnot do it. Why? Because George Tenet later said we might have wiped out \nhalf of the royal family of the UAE, who were visiting Osama bin Laden \nat the time.\n  The 9/11 Commission report puts it a bit differently. It says UAE \nroyal family members were there. But it is written and spoken by the \nhead of the CIA. The reason the attack wasn't launched when we knew \nwhere Osama bin Laden was that he was being visited by the royal family \nof the UAE.\n  My point is this: That country has had some ties to terrorism. It was \none of three countries to recognize the Taliban government, which \naccommodated Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. It has ties to terrorism. \nWhen the American people learned about CFIUS and all these goofy \nacronyms and the work these folks have done in secret that says it is \nOK for a company such as this, owned by UAE, to manage our ports, the \npeople of this country ask: Why is it that a country such as the United \nStates cannot manage its own seaports? If we are so concerned about \nnational security--and we are--and if we are threatened by terrorists \nconsistently--and we are--and if seaports and airports are two of the \nimportant elements of national security--and they are--and if you go to \nthe airport and try to board a plane, they will have you take off your \nshoes and belt, and as you go through the metal detector you will see a \n6-year-old kid spread-eagle and being wanded because we are concerned \nabout security, and if that is the case, why then would we turn to \nseaport security and decide this? With 5.7 million to 5.9 million \ncontainers coming in every year to our seaports, we have decided it is \nOK for a Middle Eastern country--the UAE--with its history, to manage \nour seaports through a company owned by that government. Does that make \nsense?\n  My former colleague, Fritz Hollings, who used to sit at this desk, \nused to talk about seaport security a lot. We don't have any seaports \nin North Dakota. But we went back and checked the Record: I came to the \nfloor 13 times from 2001 until the end of 2005 to talk about seaport \nsecurity--13 times. Almost every time I was here, Senator Fritz \nHollings was also here talking about seaport security. We offered and \noffered and offered amendments to heighten and increase inspections and \nseaport security. Now we inspect only 4 to 5 percent of the containers \nthat come in; 96 percent are not inspected. Does that make any sense?\n  This administration has not been willing to support the substantial \nenhancement that is necessary for real security at our seaports. One \nday, God forbid, there may be a terrorist attack that comes from \nAmerica's seaports. We are spending somewhere close to $10 billion a \nyear now on the issue of antiballistic missile protection, thinking \nthat a rogue nation or a terrorist will acquire an intercontinental \nballistic missile, put a nuclear weapon on the tip of it and shoot it \nat us at 15,000 miles an hour. That is the least likely threat America \nfaces. A much more likely threat is a ship pulling up to a port at 2 to \n4 miles an hour, up to the dock in a major American city, full of \ncontainers, one of which might have a nuclear weapon in it. Then we are \nnot talking about 3,000 casualties; we are talking about 100,000 or \neven 300,000 casualties.\n\n  So is seaport security important? It is critical. We need to deal \nwith it. We need to send a message to this administration and to all \nthose involved in what is called CFIUS the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States--that we don't improve security at our \nseaports by deciding we should have the UAE wholly owned company manage \nour seaports. Mr. Chertoff said it will actually improve security to \nhave the UAE company managing America's seaports. That is so \nunbelievable that it is almost laughable. But you should not laugh when \nyou are talking about national security issues.\n  This proposal is going to improve security at our seaports? Hardly. \nThe reason the American people are concerned about it, the reason the \nCongress is concerned is that we understand this will diminish \nsecurity. This will erode security at our seaports. Security is already \ntoo weak, and it must be dramatically strengthened.\n  Now, we are here in the Senate chambers with virtually nothing \nhappening. The same thing happened yesterday afternoon. The bill is on \nthe floor of the Senate and the Senate rules are such that you can \noffer amendments to that bill and they don't have to be germane prior \nto any cloture motion; they don't have to be relevant to the bill.\n  I will give you some examples of the problems of the Senate, the way \nthe Senate works these days. I was promised--and others were as well--\nthat we would have a vote on the issue of reimportation of prescription \ndrugs. Reimportation would drive down the price of prescription drugs \nin the United States because we pay the highest prices in the world, \nand the same drug, made by the same company, put in the same bottle, \nmade in the same manufacturing plant, is sent to Canada and is sold for \none-tenth of the price. I recently sat on a hay bale talking with an \nold codger who is about 85-years-old.\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nHe said: My wife has been fighting breast cancer for 3 years, and we \nhave driven to Canada for 3 straight years, every 3 months, to get her \nmedicine, and we have saved 80 percent on her medicine bill; the same \npill I could have gotten on the North Dakota side of the border, but it \nis priced much higher in the United States.\n  So for several years now, we have had proposals that are bipartisan \nto allow for reimportation, but we have been prevented from having an \nopportunity to vote on it on the floor of the Senate, despite the fact \nthat the majority leader at midnight one night made a commitment to do \nit. He thinks he didn't. It is written in the Congressional Record and \nsomebody can look at it and see whether or not the commitment was made. \nBut we didn't get a vote on it. So it is frustrating.\n  The Senate is a place where you ought to get a vote. The complaint \nnow, I guess, is that the amendment was offered. It wasn't offered in \nviolation of the rules. The rules allow it to be offered. Perhaps if \nsomebody says let's not vote on it this afternoon but tomorrow, or \nlet's vote on it next Tuesday, my guess is they can make an arrangement \nto have that happen. But this is a voluntary rest for the Senate. \nDeciding not to move forward with the bill is a decision by the \nmajority leader. He has decided that he doesn't want to vote on an \namendment offered under the rules and which deals with a very relevant \nissue that was voted on yesterday in a House Committee by the majority \nparty on a piece of legislation that had nothing to do with the \namendment. It was OK in the House to do that.\n  But the majority party in the Senate, even though it was offered \nunder the rules of the Senate, said: No, no, if you are going to force \nus to talk about and vote on this issue of whether a UAE company should \nbe managing America's ports, we are going to stop the process, stop \nprogress of the Senate, and we are going to sit around and look at each \nother. That doesn't make any sense. Let's run the Senate the way it \nought to be run. If you have amendments, let's debate the amendments \nand vote on the amendments. This isn't rocket science. If somebody \noffers an amendment, you have a debate. If you think the people are \ntalking too long, get an agreement on restricting the debate, or get a \ntime agreement and, at the end of the debate, you vote and count them. \nYou don't weigh them; you just count them. It is very simple.\n  Apparently the majority leader wants to run this body like the House \nRules Committee. They would have kind of a Rules Committee on the floor \nof the Senate that says you can offer this amendment, but you cannot \noffer that one. They have been doing that for a long while now. This \nbody is run by people who want to emulate the House Rules Committee and \nprevent people from offering amendments that are perfectly allowable \nunder the rules of the Senate. We are told, if you offer an amendment \nunder the rules, we are going to shut the place down. We are going to \nstop and complain. So now that the majority party has decided that it \ndoesn't want to move, it complains that we are not moving. A very \nstrange complaint. They can fix this in 5 minutes.\n  I said the other day it doesn't take me 45 days to figure out the UAE \nports issue. We have a 45-day review period--paradoxically requested by \nthe company rather than our country. Our country should insist on that \nbecause it is our security. But the company asked our country to do a \n45-day review. My point is I don't need 45 days, or even 45 minutes, to \nfigure this out. Nor do most Americans. This deal erodes America's \nsecurity. It should not take us 5 minutes to get this place back on \ntrack.\n  The underlying bill is important. It is brought to us by four pretty \ndistinguished legislators. Let's proceed with that bill. How do you do \nthat? Let's vote on this amendment in the next half hour or so and then \nmove ahead. If you say there is a scheduling issue, then let's not vote \non this amendment today and give us time on Tuesday. That would be all \nright.\n  I want to make one other point. I don't know how this is going to \nturn out, but I am on the Appropriations Committee, and on the \nemergency supplemental bill, when we mark that up, I intend to offer \nthe identical amendment that a Congressman offered in the House \nAppropriations Committee so that we can have a vote on it and go to \nconference with the House on the emergency supplement with identical \namendments. I think the Senate should pass an identical amendment in \nthe emergency supplemental, no matter how this comes out, as a \nbackstop. I intend to offer that in the future when we mark up the \nemergency supplemental bill.\n  Madam President, I wish to take an additional minute to talk about \nthe news this morning about the $68.5 billion trade deficit, and then I \nwill yield to my colleague from Connecticut, or whoever wishes to \nspeak. The news is once again devastating: our trade deficit last month \nwas $68.5 billion, which is the highest in our history. This relates to \na trade policy that is fundamentally bankrupt and a Congress and a \nPresident that are not only asleep at the switch but have their heads \nburied deeper in the sand every month. And the trade deficit widened \nsubstantially with China again. I will not go through all the stories \nabout unfair trade. But if this Congress and the President continue to \nignore this issue, at some point, this country's currency will suffer a \nfate that I don't want to see. It will have enormous economic \nconsequences.\n  This is a strategy that is unsustainable. It is hurting Americans and \nis shifting Americans' jobs overseas and selling part of America. By \nthe way, this is related to the Dubai Ports World deal because all of \nthis offshoring and outsourcing and globalization and the decision that \nanybody could do anything, anywhere, and there really are no rules. And \nthe minute somebody says maybe there ought to be rules, they are \nxenophobes and isolationists. And I will talk about that at another \ntime.\n  If this $68.5 billion is not a wake-up call, if this doesn't wake up \nthe Congress and the President--and it likely won't--then I suggest \nthis coma is probably irreversible, and I worry about the future of \nthis country.\n  This country needs to stand up for its own economic interests. \nWhether it is trade with Japan or trade with China, trade with Europe, \ntrade with Canada, trade with Mexico--we have very large deficits with \nall of them--and if we don't find a way to address this issue, this \ncountry's economy will not remain a vibrant world-class economy in the \nlong term.\n  Again, we are in this deep sleep, or probably a coma, wanting to \neither deny or ignore the central facts of a trade policy that is \nawful. It is trading away American workers, trading away the middle \nclass. We are hollowing out the center of this country. We are saying \nto this country's workers: If you can't compete with Chinese wages, if \nyou can't compete with Indonesia, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka wages, shame \non you; your job is gone.\n  I have gone on at length talking about Huffy bikes, Radio Flyer, \nlittle red wagons--a whole host of products and companies that have \nmoved offshore.\n  By the way, the thank-you for moving offshore from this Congress is \nto give them a big tax break. We voted to end this tax break four \ntimes, four amendments I have offered. All four have lost. I will \ncontinue to offer those amendments because I still believe that the \nlast thing we ought to do is offer tax breaks to those who shut their \nAmerican plants and move their jobs overseas. It is pretty unbelievable \nwe do that, but it is part of the willingness to both ignore the \ncircumstances of our trade deficit and the willingness to believe that \na completely bankrupt strategy remains workable.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, I have been watching the developments on \nthe Senate floor with, let's say, much surprise. It is very hard for me \nto understand why this Senate would not want to go on record in \nopposition to the Dubai ports deal when we have an opportunity to do \nthat, to dispose of that amendment by Senator Schumer and go right back \nto the ethics reform bill that is before the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Schumer for his courage because I know how it is \naround here sometimes. You need courage to say: Look, this is so \nimportant I am not going to back down. Senator Schumer explained that \nhe and his colleagues from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut \nsuffered the biggest blow on 9/11, although, believe me, the whole \ncountry suffered a blow--certainly in Pennsylvania directly and in my \nhome State of California, where all those planes were going. We lost \nmany people on that day.\n  But Senator Schumer explains that when you tell the people at home: I \nam going to do everything in my power so that we never have another 9/\n11, you better mean it. You better mean it. That means you have to step \nup to the plate. If you believe this deal presents a danger to our \nsecurity, you have to step up to the plate, you have to use every \nlegislative prerogative at your disposal, and you have to say to your \ncolleagues: I am sorry, we are going to take 5 minutes out, we are \ngoing to take 10 minutes out, we are going to take 15 minutes out of \nthis bill, and we are going to vote on this.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, God bless them--I know \nthey must have a reason for this--they have stopped us from voting. \nThey have stopped us from voting to stop this Dubai ports deal. Why is \nit important? There are so many reasons. This deal involves a port \noperator that is fully owned and controlled by a foreign country. Do \nwe, in a post-9/11 world, want to have our very important \ninfrastructure controlled by another country? I say no. Pre-9/11 we \ndidn't think this way so much.\n\n  We had a situation, Senator Feinstein and I, in Long Beach, the Los \nAngeles port, where China took over the running of a terminal. We were \nvery concerned. This was in about 1997, well before 9/11. We were \nconcerned then, and we asked for a special report from then-Secretary \nof Defense Cohen and Sandy Berger--he was our National Security \nAdviser. We asked them to do a written report to us before we let that \ngo through. I believe now it ought to be looked at again. Not only \nthat, but for all of the other ports that are being operated by foreign \ncountries, we ought to have a look back. We ought to see if that is the \nright thing to do.\n  But one thing I know for sure, today, this deal has to stop. We have \na chance here, thanks to Senator Schumer, who took a lot of abuse--\nmaybe not publicly but privately--for having the courage to do this. We \nhave to have a vote. It is amazing to me that those on the other side \nwould stop us.\n  This is the same group who said to the Democrats: You better step \nback and let us have a vote on every judge we want, you better step \nback and let us have votes on all these things, and they will not let \nus have a vote on the most sacred responsibility we have, which is to \nkeep our country safe.\n  Let the American people understand what this is about. It is not as \nif we have done so much for port security in this Congress. We have \ngotten failing grades for what we have failed to do on port security. \nIt is not for lack of trying.\n  I want to show you how many amendments we voted on, to try to \nincrease port security, and what happened. In the 107th Congress, $585 \nmillion increase for port security in the fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations; another vote, $500 million increase for port security; \nanother vote, $200 million increase for the Coast Guard; $1 billion for \nport security. Guess what happened in the 107th Congress. Every one of \nthose amendments went down. Every one of those amendments went down \nbecause my colleagues on the other side pretty much voted party line, \nvoted down.\n  What happened in the 108th Congress? An amendment for a $460 million \nincrease for port security plus a $70 million increase for the Coast \nGuard for homeland security was voted down; $450 million increase for \nport security, voted down; $100 million increase--we went at it again \nand again--voted down; $324 million increase for the Coast Guard, voted \ndown; $80 million increase for the Coast Guard, voted down; $150 \nmillion increase for port security grants, voted down.\n  My colleagues on the other side voted down every one of these while \nthey voted for tax breaks for the most wealthy Americans who already \nearn $1 million a year.\n  I hope the American people are catching on to what is going on. Had \nwe done some of these things and you had the country, the United Arab \nEmirates, that had connections to 9/11--two of the hijackers were from \nthere. We know that money was laundered for the operation through \nDubai. We know that Dr. Khan, the Pakistani scientist who turned on the \ncivilized world and smuggled nuclear components to Iran, to North \nKorea, and to Libya--how did he smuggle those? Through the port of \nDubai. And what we are going to do is reward these people, is give them \nthe right to operate a terminal.\n  Then you hear from my colleagues: Oh, the terminal operator has \nnothing to do with security.\n  Wrong. We have a letter from the No. 2 man at the Port Authority in \nNew Jersey and New York. Do you know what he said? The terminal \noperator is one of the major players in port security. They are the \nones who decide who gets hired. They are the ones who do the background \nchecks.\n  I have that letter. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: Honorable Lindsey Graham U.S. Senator.\n     From: James P. Fox, Deputy Executive Director, Port Authority \n         of NY/NJ.\n     Date: March 1, 2006.\n     Re: port security-terminal operators.\n\n Port Security: Federal Agendas vs. Terminal Operators Responsibilities\n\n       The main players in port security consist of Customs and \n     Border Patrol, U.S. Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement and the marine terminal operators.\n       Due to the recent DP World Ports acquisition of P Ports, \n     reports have debated the level of responsibility that marine \n     terminal facilities operators have for security at their \n     facilities. Too clarify, marine terminal operators schedule \n     the ship traffic in and out of their terminals and they are \n     also responsible for handling the loading and unloading of \n     the vessels cargo. In 2004 alone, the Port Authority of New \n     York and New Jersey's terminal operators combined handled \n     4,478,480 (twenty-foot equivalent units) or TEUs.\n       Marine terminal operators, such as P, are a1so \n     responsible for the perimeter security of their leasehold. \n     They hire the security guards and purchase the technology \n     that will protect the terminals property, therefore having \n     control over who can enter and exit a facility. Currently, \n     each port, and each operator within the port, has its own\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n     system for checking and identifying workers. It is important \n     that Congress and the administration understand the \n     importance of funding the Transportation Worker's \n     Identification Card in order to bring national uniformity to \n     port worker identification. At this time, there are no \n     required minimum standard security measures that the marine \n     terminal operators must adhere too. Voluntary security is not \n     security,\n       It is important to note that marine terminal operators must \n     also act as an interface with the vessel and the federal \n     agencies. For example, if Customs and Border Patrol wants to \n     inspect a certain container they work through the terminal \n     operator to make that container available. As a terminal \n     operator, the management team and personnel are an intricate \n     part of the overall security apparatus at the terminal. It is \n     these personnel that will have an intimate role in the \n     movement and scheduling of cargo.\n       To make a statement that the terminals do not play a role \n     in the security checks and balances at the terminal is off-\n     base. Therefore any change of management at a terminal \n     facility brings with it the need to ensure that those \n     directing and controlling the flow of cargo do not pose any \n     risk to national security.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here is the letter. They hired two \nsecurity guards--that would be the Dubai people--and purchased the \ntechnology that will protect the terminal properties. They have control \nover who can enter and exit a facility. They have their own systems for \nchecking and identifying workers.\n  Let me tell you that the terminal operators, according to the people \nwho know best, are very much into the loop of security. As a matter of \nfact, they are deemed one of the main players. That is what they are \ncalled--main players in port security consisting of Customs, Border \nPatrol, Coast Guard, Immigration, Customs enforcement, and the terminal \noperators.\n  If anyone says to you it doesn't matter who loses the terminal, you \njust relate to them that we know better. When Senator Stevens had the \nCCO of Dubai Ports World before our committee, I said to him: What do \nyou think about the fact that this Dr. Kahn got all of these smuggled \nnuclear components through Port of Dubai?\n  Do you know what he said? This is the chief corporate officer of \nDubai Ports World. He said, ``We don't know anything about it. We never \nlook at containers.''\n  Can you imagine? So here it is. We have a chance to stop this Dubai \nPorts deal in its tracks. To do so is in the best interests of the \npeople of this country. To do so would be reflective of what the House \nof Representatives did yesterday in their Appropriations Committee. To \ndo so is our highest responsibility to the people of this country. To \ndo so is common sense. To do so is to stand for the security of this \ncountry.\n  This deal is greased. The underlying bill that Senator Schumer \nattached this to, you and I, Mr. President, could live by the rules of \nthis bill. And I intend to do it whether it is passed today, tomorrow, \nor next week. But we have to stop this deal from going forward. Listen, \nthat deal was greased. That deal was greased. The President is all for \nit. He said: I didn't know anything about it. But 50 seconds later he \nwas all for it.\n  This is our only chance today, unless there is an agreement to have a \nstand-alone bill. I hope colleagues will fight for the right to vote \nfor this important amendment. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1934-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit about Iran \nand about the outrageous comments by the Iranians threatening the \nUnited States of America and continuing their perilous path to try to \nobtain nuclear weapons. But before I do that, I have to respond as I \nlistened to the discussion about port security.\n  I am chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation. For 2 \nyears we have been looking at the issue of port security. We have \nlooked at the possibility of someone bringing a nuclear bomb into this \ncountry, or weapons in one of the over 11 million cargo containers that \ncome in from the seas.\n  We have before us a situation and the prospect of UAE Dubai Ports \nWorld taking over a number of American ports on the east coast. It has \nraised a lot of concern, as it should. But some of the rhetoric is a \nlittle aboveboard.\n  When I say that, we need to do everything in our power to make sure \nthat we are safe and secure. Ports are points of entry, and there are \nareas of vulnerability. This deal has raised very legitimate concerns.\n  First and foremost was the process. The process, while we look at \nforeign investment in the United States, as I would describe it, a pre-\n9/11 process and a post-9/11 world, about 1,500 of these have been done \non a 30-day expedited basis.\n  When folks at the sub-Cabinet level looked at this--folks in \nTreasury, Homeland Security, other agencies of the administration \nlooked at this--they saw that we were talking about taking control of \nports, and, yes, by the UAE. It raises security issues. Under the law \nthat calls for a 45-day review. It didn't happen. That was a mistake. \nThat was the wrong thing. It was a violation of the law. It was a bad \nprocess and the process needs to be changed. But we have to tone down \nthe rhetoric a little bit.\n  It is interesting. I have been, again, a major critic of the process. \nI signed a bipartisan letter with my colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer, with Senator Clinton from New York, and with both Senators \nfrom New Jersey. We signed a bipartisan letter that said we demand that \nthis go back to the 45-day process; we demand that we take a close and \nserious look at it and we make sure we have looked at all the security \nconcerns. Then, at the end of that 45-day process, we demanded that \nCongress have the right to review the conclusion. If the conclusion \nfrom our perspective did not appear to be in the best interests of our \nnational security, we would then note our disapproval and the deal \nwouldn't go through. We had a bipartisan agreement to do that.\n  Today, clearly the American public is deeply concerned, as they \nshould be. But instead of going through the process--by the way, we \npride ourselves as being the greatest deliberative body in the world--\ninstead of allowing the process to go through with Congress then being \nbriefed, having the hearings--we have had to some degree, and we need \nmore. We heard from the folks who made the decision in front of the \nHomeland Security Committee. They explained what happened. Then we went \ninto private session. We went into the secure room in this building and \nhad classified material. We had a review. We listened. We understand \nthe review is ongoing. Nothing is going to change. There is no change \nin the status quo. Dubai is not going to be taking over any American \nport until the CFIUS process is done, not until the President has \nexercised his authority under law and until we in Congress have a \nreview.\n\n  My colleagues are talking about this is our only chance to stop this \ndeal, and we have to act now. This is policymaking by poll taking. \nClearly, the American public has been concerned, as they should be.\n  We have put in place a process by which there is a 45-day time to \nreview. We have called for and demanded congressional oversight of that \nand the opportunity to be heard, and we will get that. We need to be \nassured that we are going to get that.\n  But to somehow communicate to the American public that this is our \nonly chance and terrible things are going to happen if we do not stand \nup and stop this today is really more about pandering to the fears of \nthe moment than doing what we are supposed to do in this bill; that is, \nbe deliberative and thoughtful.\n  I have some deep concerns about the history regarding UAE--deep \nconcerns about the trafficking of nuclear materials by Dr. Kahn from \nPakistan. I have concerns about the UAE when they recognized the \nTaliban, as they did, by the way, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.\n  One of our strongest allies today in the war on terror is Pakistan. \nAre my colleagues presuming that somehow we\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nshould be cutting off relations with Pakistan? I don't think so. They \nsay there were concerns about what they did, but now they work with us.\n  I believe we have about 500 to 700 naval ships that are docked in the \nUAE on a regular basis. Our ability to fight the war on terror is \ndependent in part on the partnership we have with the UAE. They support \nus in the war in Afghanistan. We have a changed situation in the post-\n9/11 world. We have an ally whose policy I don't like when it comes to \nboycotting Israel. That is something that deeply troubles me, and it \nshould be a factor that we look into. But the bottom line is you can't \npick out all the negatives and not recognize in this post-9/11 world \nthat we have a country that has been an ally, that does billions in \ntrade with us. We put the safety of our sailors in their hands at their \nports.\n  I think we have to look at the whole picture and allow the review to \ngo forward with an understanding that nothing is going to happen within \n45-days--no change of ownership and no increase in security problems.\n  Let me briefly try to address the overall issue of port security and \ncontainer security. Some of us have been working on that before the \nissue became the issue de jour, the issue of the day. I have been to \nHong Kong and looked at the operation. I have been at the Port of L.A. \nI have looked at the radiation portals, the radiation portal monitors \nthat we have in various places throughout this country.\n  The reality is that today there are 11 million cargo containers \ncoming into this country, and we actually closely look at perhaps 1 in \n20--5 percent. That is what we look at. We have a system. It is not a \nrandom system. It is a targeted system. These are things that are based \non the manufacturer, where the cargo came from, and a range of things--\nwho the shipper is and who the receiving company is. We are looking at \n1 in 20. We need to do better.\n  One of the things we should be doing--and I had a chance to review \nthis when I was in Hong Kong. They have part of their operation in \nwhich they have put in place American technology. They are actually \nable to literally, almost like a moving CAT scan--as the trucks come \nfrom mainland China with the goods being sent to the United States, \nthey don't stop. They just keep coming in. They go through two portals. \nYou get a screening. You can see what is inside the vehicle. At the \nsame time, right at the very end, there is a radiation portal monitor \nwhich gives us an indication of whether there is any nuclear material \nin that cargo.\n  At the same time, the operators--the folks who are watching this--\nhave a manifest of what is in it. If the manifest says X-thousand DVDs \nand all of a sudden you see a big, solid kind of cylindrical object, \nyou have a problem. You stop it and do further inspection. You take a \nlook at it. They have an opportunity to screen 100 percent of that. \nThat should be the standard we set.\n  I am introducing this morning a bill that will require the Department \nof Homeland Security to put in place a system to screen each and every \none of the cargo containers that come into this country. That is the \nkind of security we need. In addition to that--and I believe the UAE \ndeal represents a concern, even though security is being done, \ncertainly, at home by the Coast Guard and Homeland Security, even \nthough the reality is that cargo security starts at overseas ports, it \nis not when it comes into our waters--we have, I believe, 41 agreements \ncalled the ``Container Security Initiative.'' We have the Department of \nHomeland Security sitting side by side in foreign countries with \npersonnel who run their ports looking at every manifest that comes in, \nmaking some judgments about what is inspected and not inspected. At the \nsame time, we have an agreement with private security, CT-PAT, \nPartnership Against Terrorism. We work, then, on the private side to \nhave measures in place that will increase the measure of safety and \nsecurity that we have regarding these containers coming in.\n\n  The bottom line is, I am concerned if we have a foreign entity that \nis owning or operating an American port, that they would have access, \nthen, to our security procedures. That raises concerns.\n  The other reality is that 80 percent of the terminals in the United \nStates are foreign owned--either foreign companies, or in some cases--\nby the way, I say to my colleague from California, there are four port \noperations on the west coast that are foreign owned by foreign \ncountries--three by Singapore and one by China.\n  Do we feel any safer that China owns a major American port operation? \nThe reality is there hasn't been a problem, by the way, until this \ndeal. Now we hear there is a crisis. Now we have to hear we have to act \ntoday.\n  What is happening today is it is about politics. That is what is \nhappening today. We had an understanding that we should have a 45-day \nreview, that we should have access to then participate in that and look \nat the information as it comes in. And we should have a clear \nopportunity to make a judgment about that 45-day review.\n  We have something else today. But the bottom line, again, is that \npart of the bill that I will introduce today will require a separation \nof ownership, and we can't unravel 80 percent of the terminals that are \nforeign owned, foreign operations. Each of these operations should have \nan American company, folks who are operating these ports who understand \nthe security procedures. They should be vetted. They should be cleared. \nWe should know who they are.\n  If we can separate operations from ownership, if we can make sure we \nhave in place a system whereby each and every piece of cargo in a \ncontainer that is coming into this country--the 11 million that come in \nby ship, and then if we can reform the CFIUS process so it is more \ntransparent, so Congress has a chance to review these things before \nthey happen, we will be much better served. That is the way this \ndeliberative body should act rather than playing with the politics, to \ndemand that we have to do something today when, in fact, we have a \nprocess, a review process. We should let it go forward and not allow \nanything to change until our will has been heard, then do the things \nthat we have to do to check out each and every piece of material coming \ninto this country, require Homeland Security do that, and, as I said \nbefore, separate the operation of ports, where we have folks we can \nvet, who we can check out, those who own it.\n  By the way, we have, I believe, about $100 billion of foreign \ninvestment in this country. That is a good thing. It is called jobs for \nAmericans, economic security, national security. Let us strengthen our \nnational security when it comes to cargo container security, but let us \nnot act on politics at the moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1935-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1935-S1936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to move on to what I intended to \ntalk about today, and that is Iran.\n  I will not speak that long.\n  I think it is important to respond to the outrageous comments made by \nthe Government of Iran this week and this latest stunt by the despotic \nIranian regime that said: The United States may have the power to cause \nharm and pain, but it is also susceptible to harm and pain. If the \nUnited States wishes to choose that path, let the ball roll.\n  First, there is a method to this madness. There is a method to this, \nwith what this regime needs and is seeking to do. It needs crisis. It \nneeds to raise the level of tension to justify its own increased \nmilitarization in the harsh security measures at home. That is what it \nis intending to do.\n  On the other hand, we have to take them at their threat, at their \nword. If they are threatening the United States, take them at their \nword. Hitler told us in ``Mien Kampf'' what he was going to do. We did \nnot listen, and there was a terrible price to be paid.\n  The Iranian mullahs and the President are telling us they intend to \ndestroy Israel. They are very clear that they are on a path to obtain \nnuclear weapons. We know it. Let's take them at their word. Let's say: \nYes, this is what you want to do, we know it, and we will not let you \ndo it.\n  When the President of Iran issued the first threat about the \ndestruction of Israel, behind him was a huge banner, with good \ngraphics. It was a big hourglass. The hourglass ball is dropping. That \nglass ball, which is very fragile, is Israel, about to be destroyed. \nBut if\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nyou look very closely on the floor, already destroyed is the USA. That \nis their intention, what they intend to do. We have to understand we \ntake them at their word, and we have to make sure they do not have the \nopportunity to develop a nuclear weapon. It is time for the \ninternational community to act stronger than it has acted, maybe call \ntheir bluff. Strong words from the Iranians require a strong response \nfrom the Security Council. Iran has threatened the United States with \nharm because we are looking to hold them accountable for their actions \nor to endorse their international commitments.\n  In light of this situation, no sound-minded diplomat can claim the \npurpose of the Iranian program is benign or that it can be trusted to \nuphold any part of a compromise agreement. They do not want agreement. \nWe talk about continuing the discussions with the Russian plan they \nlaid out. We have to presume that the other side really wants an end to \nthe crisis, but there is no rational basis to presume they want an end \nto the crisis. They want the crisis. They want to push it forward. They \nwant to engage in dialog as they continue their efforts to obtain \nnuclear materials. So there is no incentive for us to engage in the \nnegotiation.\n  If you look at proposals--some unacceptable, to flatout dangerous--\nall require enormous concessions to the Iranians to get their buy-in. \nAgain, we have to say, does the other side want an end to the crisis? \nDo they want to do a deal? The answer is ``no.''\n  The Iranians already rejected a Russian proposal to jointly enrich \nuranium on Russian soil. There has also been talk of a deal where Iran \nwill be allowed to conduct small-scale research enrichment in exchange \nfor postponing industrial-scale research. This is ludicrous to be \ntalking about.\n  Our friends on the Security Council must recognize compromise with \nIran is not an end to itself but only used when it is seeking to reach \nan objective, to prevent them from producing nuclear weapons. Any deal \nthat allows Iran to retain uranium does not serve this objective.\n  This week, the IAEA must refer--and I use the word ``refer''--Iran to \nthe Security Council with a strongly worded IAEA resolution that will \nlead to robust Security Council action, not to rest on what was a weak \nIAEA resolution passed last month which reported Iran to the Council. \nUnder the chart of the U.N., the Security Council is granted \njurisdiction over ``threats to international peace and security.'' \nThere is no more evident, obvious threat to international peace and \nsecurity than the attempt of Iran to obtain nuclear materials and to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon.\n  The Security Council action was absolutely necessary in dealing with \nIran. I am aware that several of our partners on the Council--namely, \nRussia and China--have yet to come to understand the urgency of the \ncrisis we face with Iranian's nuclear program. For this reason, I \nsupport the administration's efforts to build a coalition of allies who \nare willing to impose meaningful sanctions on Iran, should certain \nmembers of the Security Council fail to act responsibly by withholding \nsupport for sanctions. Action needs to be taken immediately. Sanctions \nneed to be taken immediately. The international community cannot be \nconstrained from action against imminent threat to peace and security \nby a few self-interested actors. We cannot be cowed and bowed by the \nthreats of the Iranians.\n  We must move forward. This is a threat to peace and security of the \nentire world. We have to act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1936-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1936-S1941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DUBAI\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the focus today, as we look at \nreforming lobbyist activities, is trying to show that there is an \nhonest face within the Senate and within the Congress. We must continue \nwith those activities.\n  However, at the same time, we are looking at a situation that worries \nmore than 70 percent of the American people today. There is no doubt \nabout it, this deal is done. Today, Dubai Ports World owns shipping \nterminals throughout the United States and in my home State of New \nJersey.\n  Frankly, it is an outcome we are all trying to prevent, and we need \nto do whatever we can to reverse it. I am not sure it is possible, \ndespite the positive words from colleagues across the room. That is why \nI am a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I know the port area very well in my State of New Jersey. It is \ncalled the Port of New York and New Jersey. It is the second busiest \ncontainer port on the east coast. Millions of tons of cargo pass \nthrough it. It is strictly located to be near markets. It is less than \n2 miles from the Newark Airport, one of the busiest in the country, and \nstretches almost to the shores of New York, 2 miles of land that the \nFBI says is the most dangerous 2 miles of territory in America for a \nterrorist attack.\n  The reason goes beyond the confluence of all kinds of activities. It \nalso is an area where there is lots of chemical manufacturing, chemical \ntransportation, and warehousing of chemical materials. And it is said \nthat if an attack were successful in that area, we could be looking at \nmillions of deaths. And we want to transfer the operation of that \nterminal container, the second biggest in the harbor, to Dubai? People \nare saying it is good business and something that we have to do in the \ninterests of foreign trade and international economies.\n  The Dubai Ports deal has been mishandled by the administration from \nthe beginning. President Bush gave the deal a casual ``thumbs up'' when \nit deserved the highest scrutiny. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even \nbrought to the attention of senior Cabinet officials. Or if it was \nbrought to their attention, they forgot it; they did not remember it.\n  Instead of a real investigation, the administration issued a document \ncalled a Statement of No Objection. We have heard the President's \ndetermination to have this go through, even suggesting that he would \nveto it if there were any attempt to block the transaction. It is a \nsimple statement, the Statement of No Objection, issued by the Treasury \nDepartment that said: No problem, go ahead and take over these \nterminals in our country. Frankly, it was an irresponsible move.\n  On September 11, longshoremen, people employed on the docks at Port \nNewark, could see the smoke rising from the World Trade Center across \nthe river. Indeed, throughout New Jersey, people looked to the sky in \ndisbelief. And now, the President is telling these people, my \nconstituents, not to worry? That is not good enough.\n  The Bush administration has been playing a shell game on this issue \nfrom the very beginning. First, they said no thorough investigation was \nnecessary and approved the deal. What they were saying, basically, is \n``mission accomplished.'' ``All done.'' We have heard that before, and \nwe know the consequences that came after that. There was a public \noutcry.\n  Now the administration is supposedly conducting a thorough \ninvestigation. Frankly, it is a meaningless gesture. The deal is done. \nThe deal is closed. Its final moments are today. So now the Ports World \nCompany from Dubai owns those terminals. Before this new investigation \neven began, President Bush announced he had made up his mind. Last week \nhe said: My position hasn't changed. That throws out the possibility of \na truly objective investigation.\n  This is not simply a 45-day investigation. It is a 45-day stall while \nthe administration hopes the American people will forget about the \nproblem and they can go ahead with the business they plan. But we will \nnot forget what happened on September 11 and we will not forget how \nmuch energy, resources, and prayers we devoted to keeping that kind of \nan incident from ever happening again in America, an attack that \nwounded us forever. We will not forget how the administration tried to \nrubberstamp this deal. Our constituents are alarmed. They should be.\n  I don't think Dubai is a terrible place or the people are awful \npeople. But they consort with people with whom we do not agree. They \nhave a terrible record in Dubai of controlling their own ports. Dubai \nwas a key transfer point for illegal shipments of nuclear weapon \ncomponents that were sent to Iran, North Korea, and Libya. The \nrelationship with Iran and Dubai is one that is unholy. Iran's stated \npurpose,\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nwe heard our distinguished Senator from Minnesota state, the President \nof Iran says he will not be happy until Israel is blown off the map.\n  There is a constant support stream from Iran to terrorist \norganizations Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad. They all get support \nthere. Dubai does over $1 billion a year's worth of business with Iran \nand now has a trade mission there. What does that do? That helps Iran \nearn money, helps them to supply terrorist insurgent groups to Iraq \nwhere they are out to kill our kids, our soldiers, and the Iraqi \npeople. Those are their friends. And we say, according to the \nadministration, come on, these are good people, they bring money, why \nshouldn't we let them take over a sensitive part of our functioning?\n  We are saying ``no,'' and we are going to fight it in whatever ways \nwe can. It may take a public demonstration of support that is \noverwhelming to keep it from happening. But right now, the presumed \nopportunity for negotiation over the next 45 days is not there.\n  There is no opportunity, there is no compulsion to bring the truth \nout. I want to see the administration offer to us, in whatever \nprotected area is necessary, what CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign \nInvestments in the United States--I want to see what they had in front \nof them. And I am putting in a formal request. I want to see what they \nhad in front of them to let them make the decision that, again, did not \nget the attention of Secretary Snow of the Department of Treasury, to \nwhom the CFIUS people should have reported. It did not seem to disturb \nSecretary Rumsfeld. It did not seem to bother the President, certainly.\n  These links are there also between Dubai and Osama bin Laden and 9/\n11. The FBI has determined that money used for the 9/11 attacks was \ntransferred to the hijackers primarily through the UAE's--United Arab \nEmirates'--banking system. Further, after the 9/11 attacks, the \nTreasury Department complained of a lack of cooperation by the UAE as \nthe United States was trying to track down Osama bin Laden's bank \naccounts.\n  Now, we all remember when the Taliban was harboring and protecting \nOsama bin Laden within its borders in Afghanistan. Civilized nations of \nthe world were working to isolate this repressive regime. However, the \nUAE--the United Arab Emirates--was one of only three countries in the \nworld that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate Government of \nAfghanistan.\n  Then there is another disturbing revelation about the UAE and Osama \nbin Laden. This seems impossible to conceive. The 9/11 Commission--a \nrespected body that did a lot of hard work in trying to understand what \ntook place on 9/11, what led up to it, and what we should do about \npreventing that kind of an occurrence again--the 9/11 Commission \nrevealed, on pages 137 and 138 of its report, that members of the UAE \nRoyal Family were secretly meeting with Osama bin Laden--this goes back \nto 1999--near his camp in Afghanistan. He had already done or led \nterrible actions against Americans. The UAE meetings with bin Laden \ncame after bin Laden's 1998 bombing of United States Embassies in \nAfrica, killing over 220 people, including 12 Americans. It was also \nafter bin Laden issued something called a fatwa, stating that all \nMuslims have a religious duty to ``kill Americans and their allies, \nboth civilian and military'' worldwide.\n  The UAE may also be responsible for undoing our best chance of \ngetting rid of bin Laden himself. Former CIA Director George Tenet told \nthe 9/11 Commission that the United States military was prepared to \nlaunch a missile strike against bin Laden in February of 1999, but it \nwas called off. It was called off because United States officials \ndiscovered the presence of UAE officials near the bin Laden camp. Mr. \nTenet, head of the CIA, testified to the 9/11 Commission that the \nattack was called off when the United States realized that we--and I \nquote here--``might have wiped out half the royal family in the UAE in \nthe process.'' Kept them alive. We have heard stories here: Oh, we know \nwhere bin Laden is. We know what is going on. Well, if we know, why \ndon't we get him?\n  And this government wants to be able to control terminals in our \nports? I do not think so. And more than 70 percent of Americans do not \nthink so.\n  So it is time--it is time--for the Senate to stand up and say no--no, \nno, no, no--to this takeover. We see how politically sensitive it is \nbecause the American people are often smarter in their thinking than \nsometimes we are here or in the House of Representatives.\n  The Republican-led House, the Republican Appropriations Committee, \nyesterday said this deal with Dubai should not go through. Imagine, \nRepublicans challenging the President, the present leader of the \ncountry, the Commander in Chief, challenging the President, their \nparty's President, where they have a majority in the House and here in \nthe Senate. They say to President Bush, with all respect: Say no. We do \nnot want this deal to go through. Say no to the giant international \ncorporations that want this deal to go through at any cost. And say yes \nto this amendment. Do not let this contract go any further than it is.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have sat and listened to a lot of what \nwe have heard today. I will tell you that myself and Senator Lautenberg \nand Senator Schumer raised this issue some 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago at a press \nconference, in which we agreed there ought to be a timeout on this. \nFrom that day forward, there has been significant increased knowledge \nby the American people. There has been significant uproar.\n  During all the time of that, the intention was--and I was led to \nbelieve by the Senator from New York--that the purpose was to find out \nwhat is best for the country, to find out what needs to be done, and to \ndo it. That is not what we are doing today. That is not what this \namendment does today.\n  I used to serve in the House, starting in 1994. The House Members do \ntend to reflect the current situations in the country. But a higher \nstandard is required of us as a body. And one is to know the facts \nbefore we act. I would contend that the Senator from New York and the \nSenator from New Jersey do not know the facts on this deal. Several \nstatements have been made about this being a done deal; it is a closed \nfinancial deal. It is not a closed deal that Dubai Ports will, in fact, \noperate these ports. As a matter of fact, the company has been very \nstraightforward with information with my office, the communications we \nhave had.\n  I do not believe we have the answer to the problem as of yet, and I \ndo not think we have clearly identified it. What it has done is give us \na wonderful chance to look at two things. The first thing we need to \nlook at is overall port security, which we know on the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, for which myself and the Senator from New Jersey \nare members, we have a lot of work to do still in terms of port \nsecurity, especially container inspection overseas and limiting the \nrisk of those things that come into this country.\n\n  But it also raises another opportunity, and it is something I have \nbeen calling for since I have been in this body. It is for us to start \nthinking long term and not about the politics. The tendency that we see \nnegates that which my favorite hero of the 20th century espoused, \nMartin Luther King. He said: Vanity asks, is it popular? And cowardice \nasks, is it expedient? But conscience asks, is it right?\n  The right thing to do right now is not to vote on this amendment. The \nright thing to do is to fill ourselves with the knowledge we need to \nhave and to exert our privilege in this body to do something once we \nhave that knowledge. I would portend to you the amendment that is \nattempting to be offered is a political stunt. It is not based on \nknowledgeable information about what are and are not the facts. It is \nbased on what is most politically expedient. I think that is harmful to \nour country, and I know it is harmful to the body.\n  If you go to the root cause of every problem we have in this country, \nit is because we are looking for political expediency rather than to \nmake the hard choices about the long-term consequences of what is best \nfor our country. Usually, when it gets into these things, since I am \nnot an attorney and not a lawyer, but I am on the Judiciary Committee, \nI use a little book. It is called the Constitution of the United\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\nStates. There are some pretty interesting things in the Constitution \nabout where we are today on this issue.\n  Article I, section 10 of the U.S. Constitution provides:\n\n       No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, . . . \n     enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or \n     with a foreign Power. . . .\n\n  It is called the Compact Clause. It has been upheld multiple times.\n  Article II, section 2, provides:\n\n       [The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice . \n     . . of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of \n     the Senators present concur. . . .\n\n  In other words, for a State or a port authority to enter into a \ncontract with a foreign government or a company wholly owned by a \nforeign government, they must receive permission from the Congress. \nThat is what the Constitution says.\n  There is no question there needs to be CFIUS reform. But one of the \nways out of this--to recognize the value of the ally we do have in \nDubai, regardless of the negatives that may be associated with it, and \nto recognize other allies that also have negatives in terms of what we \nbelieve as parameters for faith and justice and liberty--is to do what \nthe Constitution says, and that is recognize the Compact Clause and the \ntreaty clause in the Constitution and to convince all those involved to \ntake a timeout.\n  The Senator from New Jersey rightly states that the financial \nclosings of DP Ports International did take over the assets of the \nprevious owner, the British company, as of 1 o'clock yesterday or 2 \no'clock yesterday. But that company has put forward that nothing has \nchanged within the American ports. They have graciously, in the \nsituation they find themselves, extended that period for 45 days, and \nprobably will extend it for a longer period of time should we so \ndesire.\n  But I think one of the most important points I want to make in this \ndebate is, let's do what is right in the long run, not what is \npolitically expedient in the short run.\n  For the American people to know, the real reason they want a vote is \nbecause they want to say, Who is going to vote against this so they can \nrun a campaign commercial against you because you voted against them--\nnot because you did not take the time to do what is right and to think \nand to, on the basis of knowledge and information and informed \nintellect, make a decision about what is best for this country. But \nhurry up and run a vote so we can create a politically intriguing \nmoment.\n  That is not what the Senate was intended to be. It is not what we \nshould be about. And it is not what we should be doing today.\n  I must express I am extremely disappointed with the Senator from New \nYork in terms of the assurances he gave me that this stunt would not be \npulled. But, in fact, he has done that. I do not know if that is \nbecause the Appropriations Committee in the House decided to run real \nquick and get it done and getting beat in terms of the headlines or he \nhas some new information none of the rest of us knows that requires the \nimmediate passing of this today. It does not. This is a political \nstunt.\n  Our obligation to the people of this country is to secure this \ncountry and to make sure we do it in a way that creates the best \ninterests for us, both domestically and internationally. This amendment \nis not going to do that. What it is going to do is slap the country of \nDubai, which may or may not need to be. But we do not know that \ninformation. It is going to insult them, somebody who is very critical \nto us in terms of what we are doing right now in the Middle East.\n  It is going to set us backwards. It is going to make this a more \npartisan body. I would remind the Senator that what goes around comes \naround. I can play hardball on this. I choose not to. The Senate was \nnot designed for that. The Senate was designed to be a collegial body \nthrough thinking, knowledge, and informed consent, and coming together; \nthat we, in fact, try to solve the problems of this country.\n  This is not trying to do this. This is trying to create division in \nthe answer of political expediency, in the answer of vanity, not in \nresponse to conscience and courage. The courageous thing now is to take \nthe timeout and find out what is going on and what needs to be changed, \nboth in the process of how this came about, but also in the facts of \nthis particular case. If that is the case--what the Senators from New \nYork and New Jersey want to do--then why do we have COSCO running the \nPort of Los Angeles?\n  Why do we have foreign governments running other ports? If this was a \nsincere amendment, it would be reversing all of those. It is not a \nsincere amendment. It is an amendment about politics.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to finish my point, if I may. Federalist No. 44 \ncommented on the compact clause saying that it was so clearly needed, \nthat the particulars of the clause fall within reasonings which are \neither so obvious or have been so fully developed that they may be \npassed over without remark.\n  Our forefathers had this figured out. All we have to do is follow the \nConstitution. Senator Shelby in the Banking Committee is looking at \nCFIUS reform. We have plenty of time to do what we need to do. But to \nrun off in response to a motion without the facts is a dangerous \nprecedent for this body. This is a reasoned body. The more partisanship \nwe have, the less reason will prevail.\n  In several cases, courts have said the application of the compact \nclause is limited to agreements that are directed to the formation of \nany combination tending to increase a political power in States which \nmay encroach on or interfere with the just supremacy of the United \nStates. So we already have the power to fix this under the compact \nclause and the treaty clause, both under article I and article II of \nthe Constitution. That is what we ought to be doing. We have plenty of \ntime to address that, while the appropriate committees within Congress \naddress the actual facts of this case.\n  The United States has no national port authority. Jurisdiction is \nshared by Federal, State, and local governments, but it does not lessen \nthe power of the U.S. Congress to have control over this. We do need to \nmake some changes. The CFIUS program is wrong. My fellow colleague from \nOklahoma has a wonderful bill in terms of reforming that. Senator \nShelby is changing some things. The fact is, not a good job in looking \nat some of these things has been done, and we have shirked our \nresponsibility as the Senate in looking at it. But to run now to an \namendment on the basis of pure political expediency does a disservice \nto this country in the long run. We ought not to do it. We can do it, \nand lots of Americans would be happy, but the consequences that will \nfollow are grave, not only the consequences with this act but the \nconsequences of the behavior of this body in the future, if we so act \nthat way.\n  I call on my colleagues to refrain from doing anything other than \ngathering the appropriate knowledge, the details, look at the workings \nof the committees that are going on. Homeland Security is looking at \nthis. Banking is. There will be several opportunities for us to fix \nthis so that we appropriately can take a look at it. When the time \ncomes, if this is not appropriate for the United States, it won't go \nthrough. But it will be done on the basis of a reasoned analysis of \nwhat is both good for us domestically in terms of our security, our \neconomic security, as well as our foreign policy. We can have all sorts \nof speeches that beat up the President. The fact is, he is operating \nunder the law. He has operated under the law. There is a law that this \nbody created and gave him. We may need to change that law, but to \ncavalierly criticize what has been done is inappropriate.\n  We have already said we want an extra 45 days. We have that. If we \nneed additional time, we will get it. This company is more than willing \nto work to make sure that we assure ourselves of absolute security. If \nit is so that we should not have this go through, then this body will \nnot allow it. But it will be on the basis of facts, not emotion and not \npolitical expediency and trickery.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we just heard from the Senator from \nOklahoma, someone with whom I have been working since he has been here. \nWe have significant differences of view on issues, but there is a \nmutual respect. He did join Senator Schumer from New York and me when \nwe announced our opposition at first to this Dubai transaction. There \nwas also a gesture of good faith. We were not expecting to have the \npolitical difference become so sharp and so angry over these next days, \nbut information came out about how casually the disapproval took place \nfrom CFIUS, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States. \nIt is supposed to get a review and had a 30-day review.\n  We listened to the recall by the Senator from Oklahoma about the \ncompact section of the first amendment and reminding us that the Senate \nshould advise and consent on matters like treaties, other things \nrelated to international relationships. But nobody knew anything about \nthis. That was the interesting part. Here this thing suddenly pops up \non the screen. There is a deal. The Emir of Dubai, a part of the United \nArab Emirates, is going to buy this facility in a very sensitive part \nof the New York-New Jersey Harbor, one of the biggest harbors in the \ncountry and the world, all kinds of activities there. I mentioned them \nin my earlier remarks, a lot of industry, chemical manufacturing, \ngasoline distribution facilities, all kinds of things that are \npotentially subject to violent aftershocks if attacked, ignited. Deaths \ncould range in the millions.\n  It so happened that the World Trade Center, which is on the perimeter \nof this area--the FBI considers the 2-mile stretch between Newark \nAirport and the New York-New Jersey Harbor as the most dangerous target \nfor terrorism in the country; the most dangerous 2-mile stretch in the \ncountry, says the FBI. The port facility is right alongside this, as is \nNewark Liberty Airport.\n  Now we are hearing that Dubai has been friendly. They have helped us. \nThey have let us dock our ships in their harbor.\n  How do we ignore their association? If someone is a member of a gang, \na Mafia-type gang, and we know that they are a member, do we \nimmediately invite them to join the bank board, or do we immediately \ninvite them to one of the more important institutions in our country? \nDo we invite them to the Board of the Federal Reserve, the board of the \nstock exchange? Absolutely not. I ran a big company. I wouldn't have \ninvited them to join the board of my company.\n  Here we have Dubai in a cozy relationship with Iran. Iran pours money \ninto the Iraqi insurgent movement. Iran thusly kills some of our \ntroops. Yesterday we lost a couple more. It seems endless. And Iraqi \nfamilies are torn apart, children killed, mothers, fathers, brothers, \nsisters--all targets for attack by these insurgents supported by \ncashflow from Iran. Iran has plenty of cash; little moral principle--\nnone--but plenty of cash, determined to wipe Israel off the map. They \nsay so. That is the President of the country speaking officially to \n4,000 students gathered. He said: We want to wipe Israel off the map.\n  That is a pretty bold threat. I wouldn't take it lightly. The \nIsraelis shouldn't take it lightly, and America should never take it \nlightly.\n  Dubai helped them get nuclear components to build nuclear weapons. \nThat is what this is about. Dubai helped finance the 9/11 attack \nthrough their financial system. It took money as well as madness. Dubai \nhelped. What does that count for? Nothing?\n  The secret nature of the CFIUS meetings, we are to be consoled? As a \nmatter of fact, it was even said by some that it was a victory getting \nthis 45-day window for review. Victory? Like the devil it is a victory. \nThe ball game is over. The deal is made. Dubai Ports World now owns the \nterminal in Newark and several other ports around the country. They \npaid $6 billion for it. The Emir bought it out of his own cash. So the \ndeal is done. And the 45-day declaration of victory is a hollow \nresponse. There is nothing there. We can't do anything about it.\n  Yes, if the Republican majority in the House or the Senate say no, \nMr. President, we are not going along with this deal, as was indicated \nby the 60-some Members of the Appropriations Committee in the House who \nvoted against going through with this transaction with Dubai, that has \nto be a pretty significant revelation. If the President loses the \ntroops that support him so fully, he ought to hear this. This is an \nunacceptable transaction. It has little to do with advice and consent.\n  I don't think there is any way we can stop this. This transfer has \nbeen made. But why should we waste 45 days to find out? That is what I \ndon't get. We ought to simply take the vote up here. Let's vote in the \nSenate. Let us do it now, or next week, and decide do we approve of \nthis transfer--and let it be amended any way we want to--from a company \nthat has been operating there for a number of years, a British company. \nThe history was already in place, so we had nothing to worry about \nthere. But we only have 5 percent of the containers that come into the \ncountry that are thoroughly examined.\n  The committee on which I sit, the Governmental Affairs Committee, had \na review. Witnesses came from the maritime community, a representative \nof Dubai, the chief financial officer, and the fellow who heads the \nWorld Ports organization. Everybody was convinced there would be few, \nif any, problems, with nothing to worry about. Then, suddenly, we find \nout there are things to worry about--a lot of things to worry about. It \nis said that you judge a person by the company they keep. Well, the \ncompany Dubai keeps is not very encouraging, as far as I am concerned.\n  Our mission and responsibility here is the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. That is what this is all about. It is not hatred for \nDubai, but it raises a question about the company Dubai keeps, about \nthe actions they have taken, about the fact that they were the first to \nrecognize the Taliban as a legitimate government in Afghanistan. That \nis pretty errant behavior, as far as I am concerned. So, my friends, \nwhen you get it all talked about and people start getting on their high \nhorses, saying this can be an ad in a political election campaign, \nwould you rather have something go awry instead of taking the extra \nlayer of protection we have taken? Not I. If you think this transaction \nshould be allowed to go ahead and be completed, don't worry about it, \nmission accomplished, then vote for permitting the action to go \nthrough. If not, then join the logic, join the examination, join the \nview that says these people have things to prove.\n  I throw out a challenge here to the Emir of Dubai, to the United Arab \nEmirates: Why don't you say you will remove the boycott that stops \nIsraeli products from coming there, that wants to wipe Israel off the \nmap--get off of that boycott team and show good faith. Do you mean you \nwant to be a friend of ours? Then don't challenge the existence of one \nof our friends. Say that they are off the boycott and products can flow \nand passports can be honored.\n  I will never forget when I went to Saudi Arabia during the first gulf \nwar. I was the first legislator to be in that country. The reason was, \nthere was a big air base in New Jersey called McGuire Air Force Base, \nwhere troops and materiel are flown to the eastern theater very \npromptly. They were in Saudi Arabia and I went to visit them. When I \nwent there, there was a question of whether my passport would be \nvalid--a United States Senator, one of 100 in this country, an official \npart of the American Government--a question whether my passport would \nbe valid entry into Saudi Arabia because I had once visited Israel on \nthat passport, and it had a stamp that said Israel. They are so \nnarrowminded there that they said: If you have been to Israel, you are \nnot welcome in this country with that kind of a passport. That is how \nmad and crazed they are about that boycott business.\n  Right now, they have us by the barrels. Oil prices are going through \nthe roof. Wealth is pouring into these countries as never before \nbelieved possible. Look at Dubai. I understand from the pictures it is \nbeautiful--skyscrapers, and I think they even have an\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nindoor ski hill. They have all kinds of things from money that we send. \nThat money is used to buy ammunition for insurgents to continue to \npromote terrorism by supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and all the others \nthrough Iran. And Dubai says they are our pals.\n  What I conclude with is we ought to play showdown here--to use the \nexpression--and vote on whether we want this deal to go through. It is \nso simple. Let the American people hear those who agree say yes, and \nthose who disagree say no. It is not political, but let's do it.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise to speak \nabout the motion to invoke cloture, which will be voted on in about an \nhour and 20 minutes. I must say that as the ranking Democrat on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, from which a \nsignificant part of the lobbying reform legislation before the Senate \nnow came, I am deeply disappointed that we have reached this point in \nthe debate on that critically important legislation. We have a once-in-\na-generation opportunity to reform our lobbying laws and, in fact, \ntouch other parts of the ethical standards by which we govern ourselves \nin the Senate. The Abramoff scandal and others have created this \nmoment.\n  The Rules Committee has come forward with a constructive package of \nreforms. Our committee, on a bipartisan basis, brought out a \nsignificant series of amendments. The Lobbying Transparency and \nAccountability Act--this bill--is moving forward with a good, healthy \ndebate. I actually believe we would have been coming close to passing \nit tonight if the amendment of my colleague from New York had not been \noffered yesterday and we are now in the gridlock we are in, requiring \nthe cloture vote.\n  I am going to vote against cloture. I want to explain why. I assume \ncloture, from what I have heard, will not necessarily be achieved, and \nthen we are going to face a moment of decision, which will call on all \nof us, including particularly our leaders, to reason together so we can \nget back to the lobbying reform legislation and presumably find another \nopportunity for Senator Schumer and others who wish to have this \nChamber vote on the Dubai Ports World acquisition of terminals in this \ncountry.\n  I am going to vote against cloture for two reasons. First, this bill \nwas on the floor and open to amendment for less than a day before the \nmotion for cloture was filed. That simply is not enough time for the \nkind of debate and amendment for this bill, so critical to our \ninstitution's credibility with the American people, to be debated.\n  Second, there were several amendments which had not been introduced \nyet, awaiting discussion and debate and eventual vote, including some I \nwanted to offer or cosponsor that were relevant. But virtually all of \nthese, I believe, would be ruled nongermane if cloture is granted and, \nthus, could not be offered.\n  There is one particular amendment I am focused on, joining with some \ncolleagues to offer, that I have been informed by the Parliamentarian \nwould not be germane if cloture were to be invoked. That is the \namendment that Senators McCain, Collins, Obama, and I were going to \noffer to strengthen enforcement of the Senate ethics rules and \noversight of the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  We have some excellent provisions already in the legislation before \nus--disclosure, prohibitions--but there is a second step we have to \ntake to make sure these new standards we are setting become real, and \nthat is to provide for enforcement and oversight. These are critical \nelements of reform that require us to establish what we have called an \nindependent Office of Public Integrity.\n  This is a proposal that Senator Collins and I offered in committee \nmarkup. It did draw criticism from some of our colleagues and was \ndefeated in the committee. We said then that we would reoffer it or \noffer something similar to it on the floor. Senators McCain and Obama, \nwho have long been active in this particular area of enforcement of our \nlobbying disclosure and Senate ethics rules, have joined us. We are \nvery proud they have joined us.\n  Since the committee vote against the amendment, Senator Collins and I \nhave worked with our colleagues to address some of the concerns that \nwere expressed in the committee. We have altered the office's oversight \nand limited it to the Senate so it will not now serve both the House \nand the Senate. It will be limited to the Senate so there will be no \nquestion about whether the House might have some effect--we didn't \nthink so--but some effect on the right of the Senate under the \nConstitution to set its own rules and discipline its Members.\n  This proposal, we think, will increase the professionalism and \ncredibility of the Senate's self-policing. It is in no way meant as \ncriticism of the Senate Ethics Committee, which has served honorably \nand well.\n  We also believe, in the current situation, there is not adequate \nreview, monitoring, and enforcement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and \nnot enough personnel, not enough independence in the oversight. Since \nwe are increasing the requirements on lobbyists for disclosure, we \nthink we also would benefit from an independent office to carry out \nthose requirements. Again, if cloture is invoked, we won't get to offer \nthese particular amendments which are critical to this once-in-a-\ngeneration moment of opportunity for lobbying reform, and that alone is \nreason why I will vote against cloture.\n  There are other amendments. There is another amendment that may be \nruled nongermane that would require Members of Congress to pay fair \nmarket value for travel on private planes. That is an important \namendment. I intend to support it. It is quite possible that invoking \ncloture will make it not germane and, therefore, we will not able to \noffer it.\n  I want to say a final word about the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New York on the Dubai Ports deal. Apparently, there is such a \nstrong feeling among the American people about this, as reflected now \nin the overwhelming vote in the House Appropriations Committee and the \noffering of this amendment, that I fear we are rushing to respond to \nthat feeling rather than being leaders.\n  Here is the point I want to make. I would oppose this amendment as it \nhas been put before us today. The most fundamental reason is this: This \ndoes something that we are not supposed to do in America, where we \nbelieve in the rule of law. We appeal to other nations around the world \nto follow the rule of law as a condition of a modern society. It is the \nunderpinning of the kind of freedom and opportunity that we believe in \nour heart is right in this country.\n  I fear the rush of emotion and the anxiety, understandably, of the \nAmerican people as we are involved in this war against Islamic \nterrorism--not against Islam, not against the Arab world--that we are \nforgetting that in America, we don't convict people without a trial. We \ndon't convict people in America without a trial.\n  There has been a preliminary hearing in this case, if I may put it \nthat way, using a judicial, criminal enforcement metaphor. The \npreliminary hearing was before the so-called CFIUS, the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States. It reached a judgment that \nthere was no reason, based on security concerns, to stop this \nacquisition from going forward.\n  In our Homeland Security Committee and Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I serve, I had an opportunity to question people who were \ninvolved in this review. I think the review was inadequate, and I know \nwhat was grossly inadequate is the way in which this decision to allow \nthe acquisition of these terminals to go forward was explained to the \nAmerican people. It was not explained to the American people, it was \nnot explained to Members of Congress, and it apparently was not \nexplained to the President of the United States. That was a terrible \nerror. The Dubai Ports World company, after the initial furor, came \nback and submitted another application. There is an ongoing 45-day \nreview. After the tremendous\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\npublic uproar over this issue, this review will be thorough. I have \nspoken with people involved in the review. I said to the top people in \nthe departments: Put your hands on this one, this is critical.\n  To rush ahead and say, no way, before this Commission has an \nopportunity to reach a judgment and advise Members of Congress and the \nAmerican people about what their judgment, it seems to me, to be \nunfair. It is not the way we handle issues of this kind in America. It \nraises an awful question, which I ask everybody to think about because \nwe promised people in this country--this extraordinary, greatest \ncountry in the world--that here you can be sure you will be judged by \nyour merits, not by your race, or nationality, or religion, or gender, \nor sexual orientation, or age. I worry that in the midst of the war \nagainst Islamist terrorism, we are reaching a hasty judgment based on \nfactors that ought not to be considered in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I don't know how I will vote ultimately on this proposal about the \nacquisition by Dubai Ports World, a company controlled by the United \nArab Emirates. I don't know enough to reach a judgment on that. I am \nwaiting for that 45-day review.\n  I do know that the United Arab Emirates has been, since September 11, \nan extremely important, constructive ally of ours in the war against \nterrorism. I know they have put their own people on the line in very \ndangerous places to assist us in the war on terrorism. I know that the \nDubai Port, as I understand it, sees more visits by U.S. Navy ships \nthan any other port in the world. So obviously, the U.S. Navy has \nenough confidence in the security of their port to have done that.\n  That doesn't mean that the acquisition of these terminals by Dubai \nPorts World should receive a free pass, but it should mean, in addition \nto the basic qualities of fairness that generally characterize American \nlife, that this proposed acquisition does deserve a fair hearing, not a \nrush to judgment before all the facts are in, which I say respectfully \nis what the committee of the other body did yesterday and what the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from New York would have \nus do in this Chamber.\n  This is one of those moments where we are tested because the emotions \nare high, but we are leaders. We are elected leaders, and I hope we \nwill rise to the occasion and at least let this company and this \ncountry have a fair trial before any of us reach a judgment about \nwhether they are guilty or not guilty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the courtesy of my colleague. I \nbelieve what I am going to say, since the Senator is addressing the \nissue of the DP World port terminal transaction, might bear on his \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to work very closely with \nthe White House and the administration, with our distinguished leader, \nBill Frist, and several other Senators on this question.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet and work with representatives of \nthe DP World company who came to the United States for the purposes of \nsharing the importance of this contract and their perspective.\n  I shall not recount the events that have occurred here in the last \nfew days. But I have just been contacted by Edward Bilkie, chief \noperating officer, of DP World. And in an effort to get this message to \nall interested parties as quickly as possible, I indicated a \nwillingness to read a press release that is now being issued by DP \nWorld. It reads as follows:\n\n       Because of the strong relationship between the United Arab \n     Emirates and the United States and to preserve this \n     relationship, DP World has decided to transfer fully the U.S. \n     operations of P Ports North America, Inc. to a United \n     States entity. This decision is based on an understanding \n     that DP World will have time to effect the transfer in an \n     orderly fashion and that DP World will not suffer economic \n     loss. We look forward to working with the Department of the \n     Treasury to implement this decision.\n\n  His Highness Sheikh Muhammad al-Maktum, Prime Minister of UAE, has \ndirected the company, in the interest of the UAE and the United States, \nto take this action as the appropriate course to take in the future.\n  Mr. President, I would say that I started the day with the Secretary \nof Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and General Abizaid--\ndiscussing with them not the politics strictly--but potential security \nimplications. It is not just the security of the United States with \nwhich we are concerned, but that of the free world, for much of the \nworld is engaged in this war on terrorism.\n  It is absolutely essential that we, the United States, and our \ncoalition partners in the region of the Persian Gulf, who are doing our \nbest to secure the stated goals in Afghanistan and in Iraq, sustain a \nstrong working partnership. Indeed, the relationships among the \ncoalition of partners--most specifically the United States, the \nGovernment of UAE, the Government of Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar--must be \nmaintained as strong as possible because they are valued partners in \nthis war on terror.\n  This is not just a matter of importance regarding the current \noperations at the moment in Afghanistan and Iraq, but rather in looking \nto the indeterminate future as to how long our coalition partners will \nbe engaged in the war on terrorism to deter any attacks, and if \nnecessary, to use force of arms to prevent injury to life and limb of \ncitizens in the free nations of the world.\n  This has been a very interesting chapter in my 28 years of having the \nprivilege to be a Member of the Senate. But I believe both governments \nhave collaborated and acted in good faith, recognizing the \ncircumstances at hand and our shared objectives from this time forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters addressed to me from the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. \nArmy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\n\n\n                                                     of Staff,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2006.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your letter of 28 \n     February 2006, the loss of access rights for US forces to the \n     United Arab Emirates (UAE) would severely impact US \n     operations in the US Central Command area of responsibility. \n     These strategically located ports and airfields are crucial \n     to providing timely logistical support to our military \n     operating in the region. Beyond port and airfield access, \n     this loss would negatively affect bilateral exercises and \n     result in loss of support from a strong regional ally.\n       In particular, Jebel Ali is the premier naval refurbishment \n     port in the region and hosts more US Navy ships than any port \n     outside the United States. It provides a dedicated deepwater \n     berthing space for aircraft carriers, and is the only \n     carrier-capable port in the Arabian Gulf. Additionally, the \n     Port\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n     of Fujairah faces the Indian Ocean and provides critical \n     logistics support to US operations in the region. We assess \n     that losing access to UAE ports would have a severe impact on \n     US naval operations in support of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM \n     and IRAQI FREEDOM. Finally, the UAE provides basing for US \n     Air Force aircraft flying various missions in support of \n     operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Horn of Africa.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                       Peter Pace,\n       General, United States Marine Corps, Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    United States Central Command,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Commander,\n\n                                       Macdill Air Force Base, FL.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your letter of 8 March \n     2006, the United Arab Emirates is a strategically important \n     regional partner, and a supportive ally in the Global War on \n     Terror. UAE occupies a critically important position relative \n     to the Strait of Hormuz, and access to its naval and air \n     bases is essential for maintaining presence in the region. \n     The government of the UAE is a committed partner in support \n     of operations throughout the region, providing vital military \n     and humanitarian assistance as well as political support. For \n     example, UAE has contributed over $100 million toward Tsunami \n     relief operations, over $50 million in support of \n     humanitarian mine clearance efforts in Lebanon, and over $100 \n     million dollars in supplies, personnel, facilities, and \n     funding during Pakistan earthquake relief operations.\n       UAE's cooperation in the Global War on Terror has been \n     noteworthy. Less than 60 days after the 9/11 attacks, the \n     first UAE liaison officer arrived at USCENTCOM headquarters. \n     Since August 2003, UAE Special Forces have been deployed in \n     support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. Additionally, a field \n     hospital was deployed to Iraq from April 2003 to November \n     2005, providing critically important medical services and \n     supplies. US Air Force assets utilize UAE base support for \n     aerial refueling, intra-theater lift, and surveillance/\n     reconnaissance missions in support of Operation ENDURING \n     FREEDOM, Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, and Combined Joint Task \n     Force Horn of Africa. Finally, the significance of UAE's \n     support of the War on Terror is clearly evident in the $545 \n     million of direct and indirect cost sharing in FY04 and FY05.\n       Our strong partnership with the UAE is similar to the \n     support received from other moderate Arab nations. As you \n     have noted, other nations provide critically important \n     basing, overflight, financial, and in many cases, troop and \n     equipment contributions to operations in the region. The \n     cooperation of our moderate Arab partners is essential to the \n     success of the mission, and UAE is a strong example of \n     strategic partnership at work in the Middle East.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                  John P. Abizaid,\n                           General, United States Army, Commander.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nVirginia for his unfailing efforts to try to find a solution here that \nwould solve the many different goals and needs of the situation of the \npurchase by Dubai Ports World of British P\n  I believe the words that were mentioned in Mr. Bilkey's letter--I \ntried to write them down here--were that DP World will ``transfer \nfully'' to a U.S. entity.\n  Could I ask my colleague to yield for a question? Did I get the words \nexactly right? I would be happy to yield for a question. I just want to \nmake sure I got the words right in the letter which my friend from \nVirginia just read--that DP World will ``transfer fully.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am having it duplicated, and I will hand \nthe Senator a copy.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Obviously, this is a promising development, but of \ncourse the devil is in the details. I think those of us who feel \nstrongly about this issue believe that the U.S. part of the British \ncompany should have no connection to the United Arab Emirates or DP \nWorld, which is fully owned by the United Arab Emirates.\n  So therefore, we would have to examine their proposal.\n  The bottom line is, again, if U.S. operations are fully independent \nin every way, that could indeed be promising. If, on the other hand, \nthere is still ultimate control exercised by DP World, I don't think \nour goals will be accomplished. Obviously, we will need to study this \nagreement carefully.\n  I again thank my colleague from Virginia for his unstinting efforts, \nlike everything he does, to try to come up with a fair and reasonable \ncompromise.\n  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to join in voting against \ncloture at this point in time. Obviously, the vote occurs at 2 o'clock, \nand this brief statement by Mr. Edward Bilkey is something which has to \nbe studied.\n  At this point in time, the amendment I have offered, along with so \nmany of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, should remain in play.\n  I make a couple of points about that. First, I believe strongly in \nethics reform. I believe this Senate can do both at once, ethics reform \nand deal with the Dubai issue. They are not mutually exclusive.\n  The bottom line is we have offered to take a few hours off ethics \nreform, vote on my amendment as a freestanding bill, and then go back \nto ethics reform. It is truly the actions of the other side--invoking \ncloture, refusing to let this amendment come up--if cloture is not \ninvoked, which I believe it will not be, that will be slowing down \nethics reform. It is the intention of those on this side--and I know \nour minority leader will speak to this--to turn to ethics reform when \nwe can but not in exclusion, not in place of, getting a vote on this \nparticular issue.\n  The bottom line is very simple. There have been too many concerns \nraised about DP Ports World and its views of security, its actions in \nregard to security. We cannot any longer play roll-the-dice. We cannot \nroll the dice when it comes to the security of our Nation. The way this \ndeal was approved initially, the secret nature by which this \ninvestigation occurred--casual, cursory--is simply not good enough. We \nhave to examine the whole issue of port security.\n  I have been pushing that issue for many years, ever since September \n11. Hopefully, out of this sorry mess, we will look at that. In the \nmeantime, this deal should not go through. This deal creates too many \nunanswered questions. To simply allow the President, who has already \nsaid he is for the deal even before the investigation is completed, to \nhave the only and final say is wrong.\n  I urge a vote against cloture.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to state that I \nwill be voting against the motion to invoke cloture on the lobbying \nreform bill. Typically, I vote for cloture motions because they are \nusually intended to facilitate an up-or-down vote on a piece of \nlegislation or a nomination that is being stalled. Today, that is not \nthe case. Yesterday, cloture was filed on the lobbying reform bill to \nprevent an up-or-down vote on an amendment. In this case, it is an \namendment on port security, an issue of critical importance to this \ncountry right now. As a result, I will vote against cloture today to \nensure that up-or-down votes are allowed to occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a lot going on as to whether the \nport deal is there or not there. We have to wait and see what really is \ngoing to happen.\n  I want everyone to understand how we got to where we are today, how \nwe got to this cloture vote. It is fair to say the minority, the \nDemocrats, forced the debate on ethics reform with the legislation we \nintroduced, the Honest Leadership Act. We did that in January. If it \nwere not for us, I don't believe the Senate would be even talking about \nGovernment reform this week--maybe sometime in the future. We pushed \nthis and pushed it hard. Regardless of what happens today, Democrats \nare committed to seeing this legislation through. We are going to \ncomplete lobbying reform legislation, and on my side I am committed to \nensuring we do that.\n  The Senate has to be able to do two things at one time. We can handle \nthe vote on the Dubai port situation and we can vote on honest \nleadership amendments. Historically, this body has been able to do \nboth; that is, conduct its day-to-day business and address critical \nnational security issues when they arise. That is all we are asking we \ndo now.\n  Democrats believe it is important that we clean up what is in \nWashington with the lobbying, and we have heard the floor managers \nagree with me, but we also understand it is just as important that we \nstop a foreign government with connections to terrorism, which I will \ntalk about in a minute, and even nuclear proliferation, from taking \ncontrol of our ports.\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\n  The Senate must not look the other way, as this administration's \ndangerous, I believe, incompetence once again threatens our country. I \nunderstand the majority has in the past rubberstamped this \nadministration's actions and activities; however, we on this side of \nthe aisle are going to continue to call attention to this issue. We \nneed tough and smart national security policies, not more of the same \nas we saw with Katrina and in Iraq.\n  It is a vision of the Democrats that the Senate can and should \ncomplete action on lobbying reform and also protect Americans by \naddressing port security.\n  Do we Senate Democrats want a country, not a company, running our \nseaports? No, especially a country that was one of only three countries \nin the entire world to recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan. \nDo we want a country that has a trade boycott against Israel running \nour ports, a country that has not even recognized the State of Israel, \nwhich was formed in 1948? Do we want a country that was a staging \nground for the September 11 terrorists running our ports? Do we want a \ncountry owning one of our seaports that was instrumental in allowing \nnuclear devices to make nuclear weapons go through its seaports to \nother parts of the world? The answer is no, we do not want that.\n  Just a year or so ago, it was exposed that Dubai was the center of \nthe world's largest nuclear proliferation as the AQ Khan network used \nDubai to traffic nuclear weapons technology to the highest bidders. \nOsama bin Laden's operatives are said to have used Dubai as a local hub \nafter September 11. Terrorism money has been laundered through the \nUnited Arab Emirates. Several of the hijackers flew from Dubai to the \nUnited States in preparation for the attacks. The 9/11 Commission found \nthat the United Arab Emirates represented a persistent counterterrorism \nproblem for the United States.\n  We do not want such a country running our ports.\n  We believe there should be a vote today. There won't be one today on \nthis issue, I understand that. The reason the leaders in the House and \nthe Senate have done what they could in the last 24 hours to say there \nwill not be a vote is because it is the hope of President Bush that \nthis issue will go away some way.\n  That is why I will vote against cloture. The Senate needs to speak \nout against the seaport deal. We have heard the American people speak \nout against it. We heard the House of Representatives in their \nCommittee on Appropriations speak out against it. It is now time for \nthe Senate to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1943-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1943-S1944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ETHICS REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Americans finish what they start, and they \nexpect the Senate to do the same.\n  I open with that because we find ourselves once again in an \nunfortunate situation in that until yesterday afternoon, we were making \nsteady progress, working together, all four managers on this important \nbill on lobbying reform, ethics review reform. We had the opportunity \nto have it finished by today or possibly tomorrow morning.\n  This is an important bill. We have come to a general consensus that \nit had to be one of the first bills we took to the Senate because it is \nso important to restore trust in this institution. It is a bill about \nmaking our Government more accountable, making it more transparent. It \nis a bill that strengthens our ethics rules to ensure we uphold the \nvery highest standards of integrity. And it is a bill that will help \nrestore America's confidence in this institution, in our Congress, in \nour Government.\n  It is also an issue that my friend, the Democratic leader, proposed \nas his top priority in this Congress. And we agreed. Unfortunately, \nsome of my Democratic colleagues have chosen to hold this bill hostage \nfor a totally unrelated issue. As we have seen even over the last 30 or \n40 minutes, things are moving along aggressively toward a resolution. \nWe do not know exactly what the resolution is going to be but toward a \nresolution.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader said just 48 hours ago to the \neffect of insisting that Democrats would not try to stall this lobbying \nreform bill by offering unrelated amendments, saying that:\n\n       I have told the distinguished majority leader this is no \n     attempt to stall this legislation. I have told the majority \n     leader that unless there are issues outside of what the two \n     committees did that are within their jurisdiction, we have no \n     intention of offering a myriad of issues. We have Members \n     clamoring to offer--issues on the port security deal . . . we \n     are not going to do it on this legislation.\n\n  That was 48 hours ago, and then in the last 24 hours directly \ncontradicted the assurances he made on Tuesday when he said:\n\n       I believe that this lobbying reform is important. I believe \n     that we need to do everything we can to help restore \n     integrity to what we do here in Washington. But having said \n     that, Mr. President, I think it would have been absolutely \n     wrong for the Senate not to take action yesterday on the most \n     important issue the American people see today, and that is \n     port security.\n\n  That is from the statement on March 9.\n  I mention this because if we didn't have this what we call nongermane \nand totally not relevant amendment to an important issue on which we \nare making great bipartisan progress, working together--if that \namendment had not come up, we would have been able to complete this \nbill. I have been in discussions with the Democratic leader, and we \nboth understand we have the opportunity to finish this bill in the near \nfuture because the amendments are not that tough and there is general \nconsensus around them, but we have to be allowed to finish what we \nstart and not be pulled off with essentially the Senate shutting down \nlast night and over the course of the morning on something that is \ntotally unrelated to the bill itself.\n  Although I don't want to keep overstating it, there seems to be this \npattern of obstruction and delay and pushing things off--Judge Alito, \nthe PATRIOT Act, which, by the way, will be signed in an hour or so, \nand now on lobbying reform.\n  Yes, we have a cloture vote here in a few minutes so that we can \ncontinue to make progress on this bill. It is not an attempt in any way \nto foreclose the opportunity to offer lobbying-related amendments. As \nthe Democratic leader knows and we have talked about, we are perfectly \nwilling to agree on a list of amendments related to lobbying and ethics \nreform. We can set time agreements, debate the amendments, and vote. \nBut what we are opposed to is considering amendments that are totally \noutside of the scope of the bill that is at hand. We are opposed to \namendments designed to score partisan political points in one way or \nanother.\n\n  The port security issue, I do not minimize it as an issue. I was one \nof the very early people who said we need a pause, we need to examine \nit in detail, and we need to get the information. That process is \nunderway. We have our Commerce Committee looking at overall port \nsecurity. The PATRIOT Act, signed in 45 minutes, has a whole 13 points \non port security. And on what is called the CFIUS review, or the review \nof the process that created this problem in many ways, I believe, right \nnow our Banking Committee is looking at that aggressively.\n  The Dubai Ports deal needs to be addressed in a thorough way. That is \nwhy we have called for--really, initiated by the Senate--this 45-day \nperiod, to collect all the information and consider that information as \nit comes forward.\n  We saw, 45 minutes ago, some real positive news that has been brought \nforward. It shows the importance of sitting back and getting the \ninformation. There is a system underway to address the port issue \nwithout injecting it into a lobbying reform bill, a bipartisan bill, \nthat in essence brings it to a halt. The administration is moving \ntoward this 45-day review of the deal. Let's get this review. Let's get \ninformation as it is underway.\n  The Senator from New York, I know, has been to the floor several \ntimes. In a letter to me this week, he had said--and I quote in the \nletter--he ``decided not to press for a vote on [his] bill at this time \nin the hope that this new investigation will be thorough, fair, and \nindependent.''\n  So, Mr. President, we are about to vote. I do want to encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture because I\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\nwant to stay focused on the lobbying bill, which we can finish if we \nget cloture.\n  Mr. President, I see the time has come for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider is entered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I filed an amendment to the bill on Tuesday \nand look forward to an opportunity to offer that amendment and have it \nconsidered by the Senate. My amendment is the honest services \namendment, No. 2924.\n  The purpose of my amendment is to articulate more clearly the line \nthat cannot be crossed without incurring criminal liability. If we are \nserious about lobbying reform, the Senate will adopt this amendment. It \nwas only with the indictments of Jack Abramoff, Michael Scanlon, and \nformer Representative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham that Congress took note \nof the scandal that has grown over the last years. If we are to restore \npublic confidence, we need to provide better tools for Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government.\n  This amendment creates a better legal framework for combating public \ncorruption than currently exists under our criminal laws. It specifies \nthe crime of honest services fraud involving Members of Congress and \nprohibits defrauding or depriving the American people of the honest \nservices of their elected representatives.\n  Under this amendment, lobbyists who improperly seek to influence \nlegislation and other official matters by giving expensive gifts, \nlavish entertainment and travel, and inside advice on investments to \nMembers of Congress and their staff would be held criminally liable for \ntheir actions.\n  The law also prohibits Members of Congress and their staff from \naccepting these types of gifts and favors, or holding hidden financial \ninterests, in return for being influenced in carrying out their \nofficial duties. Violators are subject to a criminal fine and up to 20 \nyears' imprisonment, or both.\n  This legislation strengthens the tools available to Federal \nprosecutors to combat public corruption in our Government. The \namendment makes it possible for Federal prosecutors to bring public \ncorruption cases without all of the hurdles of having to prove bribery \nor of working with the limited and nonspecific honest services fraud \nlanguage in current Federal law.\n  The amendment also provides lobbyists, Members of Congress, and other \nindividuals with much-needed notice and clarification as to what kind \nof conduct triggers this criminal offense.\n  In addition, my amendment authorizes $25 million in additional \nFederal funds over each of the next 4 years, to give Federal \nprosecutors needed resources to investigate corruption and to hold \nlobbyists and other individuals accountable for improperly seeking to \ninfluence legislation and other official matters.\n  The unfolding public corruption investigations involving lobbyist \nJack Abramoff and MZM demonstrate that unethical conduct by public \nofficials has broad ranging impact. These scandals undermine the \npublic's confidence in our Government. Just last week, the Washington \nPost reported that, as an outgrowth of the Cunningham investigation, \nFederal investigators are now looking into contracts awarded by the \nPentagon's new intelligence agency--the Counterintelligence Field \nActivity--to MZM, Inc., a company run by Mitchell J. Wade who recently \npleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cunningham.\n  The American people expect--and deserve--to be confident that their \nrepresentatives in Congress perform their legislative duties in a \nmanner that is beyond reproach and that is in the public interest.\n  Because I strongly believe that public service is a public trust, I \nurge all Senators to support this amendment. If we are serious about \nreform and cleaning up this scandal, we will do so.\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make it illegal for anyone to defraud and deprive the \n  American people of the right to the honest services of a Member of \nCongress and to instill greater public confidence in the United States \n                               Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I switched my vote from an ``aye'' to a \n``no'' vote for procedural reasons so that I would have the opportunity \nas leader to bring the cloture vote back at some time in the future. I \ndid support cloture, but for procedural reasons I switched that vote to \na ``no.''\n  What that means is that over the next several days, after talking to \nthe four managers who are working together in a cooperative, bipartisan \nway, once we can put together a group of amendments and packages of \namendments, I, in all likelihood, will bring that cloture vote back, \nand we will be on the glidepath to completing this very important bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Very quickly, and then I have a statement to make.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader might give \nus an idea because we would like to get back to the bill. As one of the \nmanagers, my hope would be that we can get back to it right away. I \nwould like to see us clean up this bill and get it done as soon as \npossible.\n  Could you give us some sense of when you think we might do that? I \nknow there are a lot of matters to deal with, but this is very \nimportant.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would bring it back right now if I had the votes. We \nneed to have the managers working together and stressing the importance \nthat when we start our business, we need to finish it. This is no fault \nof the managers. They have done a superb job. We had a totally \nunrelated amendment injected, I believe, for partisan purposes. I say \nthat and put it aside.\n  We need to get back to the bill as soon as possible. I encourage the \nmanagers to get the list of amendments, continue working, and at the \nfirst available time when we are allowed to proceed, we will be on that \nbill and we will finish it. I think we can finish it in less than a \nday.\n  Mr. DODD. Would it be possible, since this issue is one that many \nMembers care about--in fact, the vote of the House Appropriations \nCommittee yesterday was 62 to 2 on a similar provision, and I know \nthere is talk of a resolution of this matter without ever going to the \nbill. But if we can agree that next week or so we might allocate an \nhour or two to do that, my view is we can move forward today and clean \nup this lobbying reform issue quickly--by agreeing to an hour or so \nnext week to deal with this issue, if necessary, and we can move \nthrough this bill, I think, by tonight.\n  Mr. FRIST. What we have seen in the last hour is that there is a \npress announcement from DP World, and the Senator from Virginia, I \nbelieve, read that press announcement that ``DP World decided to \ntransfer fully the U.S. operations of P Ports North America to a \nUnited States entity.'' I am reading from the press release.\n  This should make the issue go away. On the other hand, that was an \nhour ago. It brings me back to the point that the DP World issue and \nport security and the CFIUS reform is underway. The process is moving \nquickly. We don't have to have votes on the floor of the Senate and \ndisrupt your bill, our bill, which is another very important issue that \nthe Democratic leadership and ours agree should be early. This body \nwanted to have working groups and, under your leadership, hold hearings \nand come to the floor, so we are committed to finishing it. We don't \nneed to be dealing with something which is being dealt with, as we see \nthrough press releases, through meetings with the company, and a port \nsecurity bill that we are addressing in the Commerce Committee and the \nCFIUS process reform being addressed in Banking Committee. That is \nunderway.\n  We don't need to disrupt the bill. I think the distinguished manager \nand I are on the exact same page. Within several days, I think we will \nbe able to work this out. I encourage the managers to work together so \nthat when we bring it back, we can finish expeditiously. Next week, we \nhave the budget and the debt ceiling and lobbying reform.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the leader. I was suggesting that, if necessary, if \nwe could agree to an hour or two after this bill is considered--and you \nmay be right that we would not have to--then we might get to this \nreform bill today. That is all it would take to do so. We have taken \nthe position that extraneous matters should not be on the bill.\n  My fear is--and I say this having been around here a quarter of a \ncentury--once you bump this off, the budget issue next week, \nimmigration, and a recess for a week or two, we will not get back to \nthis. If we don't stick to this, other matters can take over--another \nexplosion somewhere in the world--and this institution finds \nitself dealing with a issue that would not be the lobbying reform \nissue. I have seen it happen so many times. Here is an opportunity, I \nsay with all due respect, to\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\ngive us that assurance, if necessary, and let us get back to the bill.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. With all due respect, there is no reason to give that \nassurance now. This is on a glidepath, based on what we have heard in \nthe last 2 hours, to take care of itself. Again, it is through no fault \nof the managers of lobbying reform--on either side of the aisle--that \nwe are where we are today. It is because we have had this extraneous \nissue injected into the system, which gummed up the works, and it is \nbeing resolved as we speak.\n  I just wish that amendment had not come to the floor. We were the \nfirst to put lobbying reform on the Congress's agenda. We were first to \nhold hearings, under the leadership of the distinguished chairmen. We \nwere the first to mark up and the first to act, all as a result of the \nmajority deciding that this is an important issue. The issue of \nGovernment reform is a key agenda item to help restore trust and faith \nin our Government.\n  I have to say that yesterday was a spectacular display, with the \nSenator from New York taking advantage of the goodwill that had been \ngenerated as we were moving forward together, which has led us to the \npoint that we have had the cloture vote today.\n  I have been crystal clear throughout that when it comes to the port \ndeal, Congress needs all of the facts. We don't have all of the facts. \nWe are learning about them through press releases as we speak. But we \nare getting the facts by having this 45-day intensive review period, \nfocused on the security issue. I think Congress is, at the appropriate \ntime, going to need to make an independent judgment. Obviously, I don't \nbelieve it is today because we don't have the facts today. To take \npeople in this body and say let's vote on something, let's kill the \ndeal, or let's grandstand on it is just not appropriate for this body. \nLet's get the information into the system, and that strategy is \nunderway.\n  Mr. President, we will keep working. We have a lot to do, and I look \nforward to staying above the issues of gumming up the system and let's \nmove forward as we address these important issues that focus on \nrestoring trust in this Government--lobbying reform, the bill at hand, \nand the budget of the country, which we will do next week, and facing \nthe debt ceiling limit and taking appropriate action both in discussing \nand passing a statute that will raise that ceiling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the leader for responding to several \nquestions. I appreciate that very much. I don't disagree. In fact, this \nmay be very good news that we have heard in the last hour or so about \nthe port security issue. Like all of us, I think the leader said it \nwell. The devil can be in the details here. We are going to want to \nexamine what was included there.\n  As I understood, my colleague from New York and the Democratic leader \nwere willing to forgo offering this amendment that Senator Schumer has \nproposed on this bill for the simple assurance that, if necessary, they \nwould like the opportunity to bring this up at a later time.\n  Many of us applauded that decision. In fact, the Democratic leader \noffered a unanimous consent request that would have done that, it would \nallow us to get back to the reform bill.\n  I see a number of my colleagues here. My colleague from Maine knows \nas well as I do these things can slip, and once they start to slip, \nother matters can overtake us, and we don't get back to the matter. We \nhave seen it on asbestos and other matters. I am worried that will \nhappen if we allow too much time to pass before we get back to the \nlegislation.\n  I made the appeal earlier today to reach some accommodation among the \nleaders so we will be allowed to go forward with this bill that the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee worked so hard on \nand the Rules Committee worked so hard on. We did our job.\n  I think we can get this done in fairly short order. My colleague from \nGeorgia was involved, as well, in the Rules Committee trying to put \nthis together.\n  Again, I make the plea, I don't think there is any necessity at this \njuncture for the Schumer amendment to come up on this bill, but I think \nmy colleagues can understand why the Senator from New York would like \nsome assurance down the road, if necessary, that we can get to this \nparticular proposal. It is not an extraordinary request. We do this all \nthe time. That would allow us to move forward on this bill and try to \nkeep extraneous matters off until we have completed the bill.\n  I thank the majority leader for responding to my questions. I am \ndisappointed, to put it mildly, that we are not going to get to this \nbill. I raise the concern, having been here for some time and having \nwatched the process work, that if we don't proceed quickly on this \nmeasure, then my fear is that we will not get back to it, and the \nwindow of opportunity to have done something on these critical issues \nwill have been lost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut, \nthe ranking member on the Rules Committee on which I serve, and Senator \nLott, as well as Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, for their \nleadership on this issue. It has not been easy to get to the point \nwhere we are today. I am very disappointed we are not going to be able \nto finish this bill tonight, even though I am fixing to talk on it. I \nam not particularly happy with what is in this bill, but at least \ngetting through the process, having the debate is extremely important.\n  I am very hopeful we can get this issue relative to Dubai resolved, \nand quickly return to lobby reform legislation and complete it in short \norder.\n  I do think we have seen strong, very positive leadership out of the \nRules Committee chairman and ranking member, as well as the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee chairman and ranking \nmember.\n  In thinking about this bill, I am concerned we are losing sight of \nsomething I think is very important. And which is putting in place \ntoday, a system which deals with both Members of Congress and outside \nlobbyists and how they interact.\n  How lobbyist treat Members of Congress and how we react to lobbyists \nfrom the standpoint of whether you call it favors or being receptive to \ndemands or requests of lobbyists. The system we have in place today is \nworking.\n  What generated this concern that we have seen on the floor this week \nand the dialog we have seen over the past few months on this particular \nissue? It was triggered by one particular man who was very egregious in \nthe way he operated his lobbying shop. He appears to have been \nmotivated by greed, not just operating outside the spirit of the law, \nbut outside the letter of the law, even to the point of committing some \ncriminal activity. In fact, he has pled guilty, and he is undoubtedly \ngoing to jail. I don't know that for certain, but I think it is a safe \nassumption.\n  The system, as it pertained to lobbyist, worked. But what about \nMembers of Congress? Another incident that sparked debate was the \nactivity of some other Members of Congress, particularly Members on the \nHouse side.\n  I don't think anybody on this side has even been implicated in this \nat this point. But there has been some activity on the other side that \nindicates that maybe some favors were given to lobbyists for \nconsideration. In fact, there has been a guilty plea to that effect.\n  What has happened to that Member of Congress? That Member of Congress \nis going to jail--for a long time. That is the way the system is \ndesigned to work. That is the way it is working and, unfortunately, all \nof that casts a real shadow on the institution that those of us who \nhave been privileged to serve here know and for which we have such \ngreat respect.\n  There is a situation, I think, where we have a solution that is \nlooking for a problem. I will give a classic example of that.\n  Some have said: We think lobbyists who are former Members who utilize \nthe gym are having an undue influence or the potential to have undue \ninfluence. Therefore, we are going to ban former Members who are \nlobbyists from using the gym. We also are going to ban former Members \nwho become lobbyist from coming on the floor.\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\n  What is ironic is there are two former Members of the House of \nRepresentatives today who are in jail for different reasons. But when \nthey are released from prison, those two individuals will have the \nright to use the House gym and to have access to the House floor. Yet \nformer Members of the House who served with great distinction on both \nsides of the aisle who have the opportunity to go outside and make some \nmoney in whatever chosen field they want--and they happen to have \nchosen lobbying--they can't come on the floor of the House and can't be \nMembers of the House gym. This proposal is a solution without a \nproblem, irrespective of how one looks at it.\n\n  I have a personal situation. As the Senator from Connecticut said, I \nserve on the Rules Committee. I talked about this a little bit as we \nwere going through the markup and debating this bill. There are a \nnumber of Members of this body who have either spouses or children who \nare lobbyists. My son happens to be a lawyer who does lobbying, and I \nam very proud of him. He works hard and does very well. I was a Member \nof the Senate before he made the decision to become a lobbyist.\n  At the time he made that decision, I went to Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I said: Here's my deal. I have to figure this out \nsomehow. It was recommended to me by folks on both sides of the aisle \nthat I needed to go to the Ethics Committee and detail the facts of the \nsituation and have it tell me what we could and could not do relative \nto my son being a lobbyist and having the potential of lobbying me or \nhaving contacts with me or my staff.\n  Before he accepted the job, I asked for and received a letter from \nthe Ethics Committee defining what contact was permissible. We have \nstrictly adhered to the terms of the letter. There is no discussion \nbetween the two of us relative to issues. He does not lobby me. He does \nnot lobby my staff. While it gets very ticklish at times when people he \nworks with come to my office to lobby me, if he accompanies them, he \nhas to either stand out in the hall or go down the hall to the \nbathroom. I am not sure what he does, but he doesn't come in to lobby \nme, it is a little bit awkward from their standpoint. But that's the \nway it has to work, and that is the way it is going to continue to \nwork.\n  With the passage of this bill, what changes? What changes is that we \nare taking the Ethics Committee letter that I have, that Senator Reid \nhas, whose sons are lobbyists, that Senator Lott has, whose son is a \nlobbyist, and at least a dozen or 15 other Members of this body have, \nand it codifies the terms of the letters. All of a sudden, it makes it \nsubject not only to a potential $200,000 fine, but criminal sanctions \nas well.\n  Figure this: We are in a very partisan political time in this \ncountry. Because of partisanship, often without merit, ethics charges \ncan often--and it happens more on the House side, than it does over \nhere--fly back and forth. For example, if I am at dinner with my son \nand somebody happens to be at a table next to me and think they hear \nconversation which they believe to be improper, but which was in fact \nnot improper at all.\n  All of a sudden I am thrown in a situation where I have to defend \nmyself, not before the Ethics Committee but from a civil sanction, as \nwell as a potential criminal sanction. To say that can't happen in \ntoday's climate, I think we are kidding ourselves.\n  The same thing could happen to every other Member here. And I don't \nknow of any Member who has ever violated the ethical rule relative to \nlobbying on the part of spouses or children.\n  To those folks who say this can't happen, let me tell you what \nhappened to me this week, and it is a pretty good example of what can \nhappen in these very difficult, these very complex, and these very \npartisan political times.\n  There is a lot of current discussion about Members taking trips on \ncorporate aircraft. All of us--I assume all of us--at one time or \nanother have used private aircraft. Congress has rules governing this \npractice which we must abide by.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, live in a rural area. I don't have \ncommercial service to many areas of my state including my hometown. I \nalso happen to represent the largest State east of the Mississippi \nRiver. If I want to go from point A to point B, whether it is on \nofficial business or on campaign business, it is often necessary to use \nprivate or chartered aircraft and I have to pay for it. The rules \nrequire it, and we pay for it.\n  The important point about it is, we disclose every bit of that \ninformation. We have a form we are required to file every year \nregarding every trip--where it was, where you went, what it was for, \nand how much you were required to pay for it, and how much you did pay \nfor it. All of that is on our public disclosure forms.\n  This week, a group called Political Money Line issued a statement in \nwhich they said--of course, it was generated by the debate on the floor \nthis week; otherwise it probably never would have come up. Political \nMoney Line is, according to its statement, a company that provides \ncomprehensive campaign finance and lobbying data to more than 500 \nclients, ranging from trade groups to the national political parties. \nSo it has over 500 folks to whom they sent out not only a notice but \nalso did some sort of press release or a release that at least got to \nthe press which indicated that this Member of the Senate was the No. 1 \nuser of corporate aircraft of all active Senators; that from the period \n2001 through the 2005, I had flown over 60 times in corporate aircraft, \naccording to the disclosure that I had filed, and that I had to pay in \nexcess of $100,000. To make it exact, they said $101,795 for \nutilization of corporate aircraft.\n  I knew there was something wrong with that because that would have \nmeant that during the 5-year period, I would have had to have flown on \na corporate aircraft once a month, every month, for 5 years. And I knew \nI had not done that. So we made inquiry of Political Money Line as to \nwhere it got its information and what information did it use in \ncalculating these numbers.\n  First of all, they told us: We will be glad to give you that \ninformation provided you pay a $2,000 subscription fee. I didn't think \nthat was exactly right.\n  At the end of the day, they were cooperative, and they did provide us \nthe information. As it turns out, just like I thought, the information \nwas wrong.\n  The fact of the matter is that they said, according to their \ncalculations, I had reported 60 reimbursements for use of corporate \naircraft. In fact, they now have agreed that only 17 of those trips \nshould have been credited to me. The other 43 reimbursements should \nhave been credited to another or other Members of the Senate. And of \nthose 17, on one occasion--I used corporate aircraft for a fundraiser \nin Florida--I sent three Members of the Senate down there and paid \ntheir way. That is a customary thing that happens. I flew commercial, \nbut I paid their way.\n  The numbers were so out of line and so egregious that I don't mind \ntelling you I got infuriated, and the more I think about it right now, \nI get even more infuriated about it because what happened was, once \nthey put this information out, it was picked up by the New York Times. \nThey did a story yesterday in which I was quoted as saying the solution \nto this problem is disclosure. And then they said, according to the \nPolitical Money Line, that I am the No. 1 abuser of utilization of \ncorporate aircraft that is active in the Senate, and they were dead \nwrong.\n  Now the genie is out of the bottle, and the New York Times story has \ngone all over the country. It is in U.S. News & World Report. How do \nyou get the genie back in the bottle? Well, you don't, and that is the \nunfortunate part about this. There was some irresponsible activity on \nthe part of this group that, frankly, will be a political problem \nbecause the 527 operated by former Democratic National Committee \nindividuals has already taken a shot at me as a result of this. We are \nall big boys in the Senate. We have been through political wars, and I \nalways am prepared for criticism that may arise. But when the criticism \nis absolutely false, then it does infuriate you because there is no way \nyou can accurately get information out once it has gotten out in the \nway this did.\n\n  When we talked to them about it yesterday and talked to them about it \nagain today, they are agreeing to come back now and to correct their \nfigures and to do a release. They have already done that. They have \ncalled the New York Times, according to the reporter\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nI saw today. In spite of the fact that they will do another article \nnow, the Political Money Line folks have admitted to making mistakes.\n  In any event, instead of being the No. 1 active Member of the Senate \nrelative to utilization of corporate aircraft, according to their \ncalculations, I would be No. 28. Under their calculations, instead of \n$101,000, it should have been $18,000. That is how egregious this \nsituation has become.\n  Now what happens in the case of this sort of thing relative to what \nwe have on the floor today? Well, here is the way I look at this, and I \nhave talked with people all across my State about this. Are folks \nconcerned about Members of Congress and ethics? You bet. Is there \nanybody in this Senate who campaigned on the fact that, You send me to \nWashington, you send me to the Senate, and, boy, I will get lobbyist \nreform? I think the answer to that question is absolutely not. That is \nnot a typical campaign platform. Does everybody in this Senate go home \nand talk about what is going on in Iraq? Have any of us campaigned on \nwhat is happening in Iraq? You bet. People care about that. Are people \nupset about what is going on relative to the ports issue and the \npotential for Dubai to purchase the managerial contract for the six \nports in the United States? You bet. People care about that.\n  People expect us, as Members of the Senate, to act in an ethical way. \nAnd those of us who have this unique problem, whether it is relative to \na spouse or a child, in my opinion, must have acted in an ethical way \nbecause I don't know of any situation where what has happened as an \nethical complaint has been brought forward. People do expect us to be \nethical, and those of us who have this situation work very hard to make \nsure we are.\n  So I would hope since we are not going to be voting on this matter \ntoday, we may not be voting on it next week--I don't know when it will \ncome up again--but I am very hopeful that the Members of this body will \nthink through this and that we will look at legislation that \nencompasses issues such as Senator McCain has talked about on earmarks. \nI think if you are going to reform Congress, which is what I think is \nmost necessary, then reforming the earmark process is necessary. \nSenator McCain talks about this every year during the appropriations \nprocess, and this year I think he is getting everybody's attention. \nThat should be reformed. There are other issues in this congressional \nreform we ought to pay attention to. But I will have to tell you that \nif we are going to have irresponsible acts by folks who are taking \ninformation we disclose under the congressional reform action, whatever \nultimate legislation may come out of this body, and they are going to \nutilize it in a wrong way, then it may be time we looked at taking some \naction against folks who do that as well as having the potential to \ntake action against Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield back, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, in a few weeks in my home county of Cobb \nCounty, GA, a pretty normal occurrence is going to take place for \nsomeone who is anything other than a normal person. It is going to be \nthe 65th birthday of a man named Robert Moultrie. Now, 65th birthdays \nare becoming pretty common. I am pretty happy they are, because I am \nabout to have one in a couple of years. But Robert is an extraordinary \nindividual. I hope he is not watching C-SPAN right now because they are \ngoing to give a big surprise party for him, and if he is watching I am \ngoing to be in big trouble, but I doubt he is because he is a busy \nentrepreneur of unbelievable accomplishment.\n  He started a company in 1986 known as The Facility Group, and it was \nsix individuals. Their revenues were about $10 million. Last year, \nRobert Moultrie's company, The Facility Group, employed 300 people and \ntheir revenues were $250 million.\n  He is an extraordinary individual, a graduate of Georgia Tech. He is \na good engineer, as someone running a design/build firm should \nobviously be, but also a great benefactor to that institution, as well \nas Erskine College, where he led the $30 million capital campaign a few \nyears ago.\n  What makes Robert extraordinary is not just those accomplishments in \nbusiness, which are great, but the fact that he and his wife are a \nlittle bit like the title of Bob and Elizabeth Dole's famous book, \n``Unlimited Partners,'' because they are equal partners in their \njourney both in business as well as community service. When Robert \nchaired the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce, the second largest chamber \nin the State in 2002, everybody thought Cheryl was kind of cochairman \nbecause she was as involved as he was. When they chaired the Heart Ball \nfor the community, they set an all-time record in our State, raising \n$600,000 in 1 night to benefit those who were fighting heart disease.\n  Girls Club, Boys Club, United Way, or simply a helping hand, Robert \nand Cheryl Moultrie have always been there. As I said, 65th birthdays \nare very common but Robert Moultries are not. Our community is very \nfortunate to have had him there, and I am very fortunate to have the \nopportunity today in the Senate to commend him on his achievements for \nour community and commend him on this milestone in his life.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1948-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1948-S1952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PETROLEUM INDUSTRY ANTITRUST ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, \nhas from time to time examined the implications of mergers, \nacquisitions, and joint ventures among companies affecting various \nfields in the American economy.\n  Just a few days ago, a major proposal reached public view in the \ntelephone industry. There have been major acquisitions and mergers in \nmany lines of commerce, and there is special concern at the present \ntime about the impact of acquisitions and mergers of major oil \ncompanies on the price of gasoline, which has soared for American \nconsumers. I have been concerned about the actions of OPEC over the \nyears in limiting production and undertaking joint actions which really \nviolate the spirit of competition and increase the cost of oil.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my comments, \nletters that I sent to the President as far back as the Clinton \nadministration, and that I sent to President Bush, outlining the judge-\nmade laws which have given OPEC immunity under our antitrust laws be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2000.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the very serious problems \n     caused by the recent increase in oil prices, we know you will \n     share our view that we should explore every possible \n     alternative to stop OPEC and other oil-producing states from \n     entering into agreements to restrict oil production in order \n     to drive up the price of oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some considerable research, we suggest that serious \n     consideration be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC \n     and the nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based, perhaps, upon an advisory opinion under ``the \n     general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,'' \n     which includes prohibiting oil cartels from conspiring to \n     limit production and raise prices.\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       A case can be made that your Administration can sue OPEC in \n     Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC is \n     clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' in \n     violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration should consider suing OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a major \n     consumer of petroleum products and must now pay higher prices \n     for these products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, (42 U.S. 330 \n     (1979), the Supreme Court held that the consumers who were \n     direct purchasers of certain hearing aides who alleged that \n     collusion among manufacturers had led to an increase in \n     prices had standing to sue those manufacturers under the \n     Clayton Act since ``a consumer deprived of money by reason of \n     allegedly anticompetitive conduct is injured in `property' \n     within the meaning of [the Clayton Act].'' Indirect \n     purchasers would appear to be precluded from suit, even in a \n     class action, under Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 \n     (1977), but this would not bar the United States Government, \n     as a direct purchaser, from having the requisite standing.\n       One potential obstacle to such a suit is whether the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides OPEC, a \n     group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity from suit \n     in U.S. courts. To date, there has been a ruling on this \n     issue in only one case. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the District \n     Court for the Central District of California held that the \n     nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in the \n     United States under the FSIA. We believe that this opinion \n     was wrongly decided and that other district courts, including \n     the D.C. District, can and should revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964):\n       It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decisions regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive task of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990s have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international \n     courts and tribunals. In addition, there is strong \n     evidence of an emerging consensus in international law \n     that price fixing by cartels violates such international \n     norms. Accordingly, a court choosing to apply the act of \n     state doctrine to a dispute with OPEC today may very well \n     reach a different conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached \n     almost twenty years ago.\n       You should also examine whether the anticompetitive conduct \n     of the international oil cartel is being effectuated by \n     private companies who are subject to the enforcement of U.S. \n     antitrust laws (for example, former state oil companies that \n     have now been privatized) rather than sovereign foreign \n     states. If such private oil companies are determined to in \n     fact be participating in the anticompetitive conduct of the \n     oil cartel, then we would urge that these companies be named \n     as defendants in an antitrust lawsuit in addition to the OPEC \n     members.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations,'' which includes prohibiting oil \n     cartels from conspiring to limit production and raise prices.\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights. For example, \n     as of December 1, 1999, the Yugoslavia tribunal alone had \n     handed down 91 public indictments.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. Recently, the exiled former dictator of Chad, \n     Hissene Habre, was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture \n     and barbarity stemming from his reign, where he allegedly \n     killed and tortured thousands. This case is similar to the \n     case brought against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet \n     by Spain on the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At \n     the request of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained \n     in London for months until an English court determined that \n     he was too ill to stand trial.\n       The emerging scope of international law was demonstrated in \n     an advisory opinion sought by the UN General Assembly in 1996 \n     to declare illegal the use or threat to use nuclear weapons. \n     Such an issue would ordinarily be thought beyond the scope of \n     a judicial determination given the doctrines of national \n     sovereignty and the importance of nuclear weapons to the \n     defense of many nations. The ICJ ultimately ruled eight to \n     seven, however, that the use or threat to use nuclear weapons \n     ``would generally be contrary to the rules of international \n     law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the \n     principles and rules of humanitarian law.'' The fact that \n     this issue was subject to a decision by the ICJ, shows the \n     rapidly expanding horizons of international law.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine member nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all 11 participants \n     issued a joint communique in which they express their \n     intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.'' One of the countries \n     participating in this communique, Venezuela, is a member of \n     OPEC.\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. Consideration of such legal \n     action could provide an inducement to OPEC and other oil-\n     producing countries to raise production to head off such \n     litigation.\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Mike DeWine.\n     Strom Thurmond.\n     Joe Biden.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2000.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: We are writing to urge your \n     Administration to take immediate and reasonable action in \n     response to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \n     Countries' (OPEC) continued stranglehold on the global oil \n     market. As you know, OPEC's agreement last March to \n     automatically increase oil supply if global prices topped $28 \n     per barrel for more than 20 days has been violated--the price \n     of crude oil has closed over $28 since May 8, and is \n     currently trading over $33--meaning sky-high oil and gasoline \n     prices will increasingly, and indefinitely, take a toll on \n     our economy. We strongly urge you to immediately counteract \n     OPEC's dangerous intransigence through the use of oil from \n     our nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in order to \n     increase supply, moderate prices, and significantly reduce \n     our nation's dependence on OPEC decisions for our economic \n     well-being.\n       OPEC's continued manipulation of the global oil market has \n     translated into record high, and rising, gasoline prices in \n     the United States, and the prospect of severe shortages in \n     home heating oil next winter. Worst of all with global and \n     American oil inventories approaching levels not seen since \n     the mid-1970s, OPEC's continued price gouging will prevent \n     refiners and distributors of petroleum products from stocking \n     sufficient supply, meaning OPEC will continue to maintain its \n     inordinate power over the global and American economies \n     indefinitely.\n       Since last September, many of us have been calling on you \n     and Secretary Richardson to use America's well-stocked SPR as \n     leverage to counter OPEC's risky profiteering. With global \n     supply, demand, and inventories remaining out of sync with \n     each other, and OPEC ministers unwilling to play by the rules \n     which they themselves created, the United States has every \n     right to act decisively in the interest of its economic \n     security. The immediate commencement of a ``swaps'' policy \n     using SPR oil would moderate the global oil market, and \n     generally buffer against foreign supply manipulations. And \n     under current market conditions, a swaps policy provides the \n     best way to increase the SPR from its current level of 570 \n     million barrels, at no cost to the taxpayer.\n       OPEC has been emboldened by its highly successful quota \n     policy over the past two years which has caused oil prices to \n     effectively triple. OPEC ministers seem to now believe the \n     United States and the world will accept, and call \n     economically sustain, oil prices at $30 per barrel and above. \n     Mr. President, it is simply unacceptable for us to allow our \n     economy, and the world's economy, to be placed in jeopardy by \n     a foreign oil cartel. With razor thin oil inventories and \n     soaring gas prices coupled with new reports of a looming \n     shortage of natural gas, we may be at the beginning of a \n     serious and prolonged energy crisis that could send a chill \n     through every economic sector of our country. The time to act \n     is now.\n           Sincerely,\n         Charles E. Schumer; Carl Levin; Joseph I. Lieberman; Jack \n           Reed; Patrick J. Leahy; Robert G.

OPEC \n     is clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' \n     in violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration has the power to sue OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a consumer of \n     petroleum products and must now pay higher prices for these \n     products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, 442 U.S. 330 (1979), \n     the Supreme Court held that the consumers of certain hearing \n     aides who alleged that collusion among manufacturers had led \n     to an increase in prices had standing to sue those \n     manufacturers under the Clayton Act since ``a consumer \n     deprived of money by reason of allegedly anticompetitive \n     conduct is injured in `property' within the meaning of [the \n     Clayton Act].''\n       One issue that would be raised by such a suit is whether \n     the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides \n     OPEC, a group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity \n     from suit in U.S. courts. To date, only one Federal court, \n     the District Court for the Central District of California, \n     has reviewed this issue. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the Court held \n     that the nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit in \n     the United States under the FSIA. We believe that this \n     opinion was wrongly decided and that other district courts, \n     including the D.C. District, can and should revisit the \n     issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964):\n       It should be apparent that the greater the degree of \n     codification or consensus concerning a particular area of \n     international law, the more appropriate it is for the \n     judiciary to render decisions regarding it, since the courts \n     can then focus on the application of an agreed principle to \n     circumstances of fact rather than on the sensitive task of \n     establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national \n     interest or with international justice.\n       Since the 9th Circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990s have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international courts \n     and tribunals. In addition, there is strong evidence of an \n     emerging consensus in international law that price fixing by \n     cartels violates such international norms. Accordingly, a \n     court choosing to apply the act of state doctrine to a \n     dispute with OPEC today may very well reach a different \n     conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached almost 20 years \n     ago.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     UN Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n     of these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. The exiled former dictator of Chad, Hissene Habre, \n     was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture and barbarity \n     stemming from his reign, where he allegedly killed and \n     tortured thousands. This case is similar to the case brought \n     against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet by Spain on \n     the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At the request \n     of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained in London \n     for months until an English court determined that he was too \n     ill to stand trial.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus more on human rights than on economic \n     principles, there is one economic issue on which an \n     international consensus has emerged in recent years--the \n     illegitimacy of price fixing by cartels. For example, on \n     April 27, 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \n     Development issued an official ``Recommendation'' that all \n     twenty-nine member nations ``ensure that their competition \n     laws effectively halt and deter hard core cartels.'' The \n     recommendation defines ``hard core cartels'' as those which, \n     among other things, fix prices or establish output \n     restriction quotas. The Recommendation further instructs \n     member countries ``to cooperate with each other in enforcing \n     their laws against such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, 11 Western Hemisphere countries held \n     the first ``Antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they express \n     their intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.''\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. We hope you will seriously \n     consider judicial action to put an end to such behavior.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Strom Thurmond.\n     Mike DeWine.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I am not introducing the bill today, but \nI am putting it forward so that my colleagues may consider it and it \nmay be considered by the witnesses who are\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\ngoing to be testifying before the Judiciary Committee on March 14. I am \nputting it in the public view to solicit comments and to solicit \nresponses and ideas as to the effectiveness or propriety or \ndesirability of such legislation. I do so tentatively because it is a \nvery complicated subject, and there have been relatively few \nmodifications of the antitrust laws in the United States.\n  The basic antitrust law under which we operate is more than a century \nold. The Sherman Act, enacted in 1890, made it unlawful to enter into a \ncontract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade and \nprohibited monopolization. Then, 24 years later, we enacted the Clayton \nAct, which prohibits unlawful tying, corporate mergers and acquisitions \nthat reduce competition and interlocking directorates, which lead \nprincipally to substantial restraint on trade. Those are the two \nprincipal statutes that mold the antitrust laws in the United States.\n  There have been some additions: in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission \nAct prohibiting unfair methods of competition affecting commerce; in \n1936, the Robinson-Patman Act prohibiting sales that discriminate in \nthe price or sale of goods to equally situated distributors where the \neffect of such sales is to reduce competition; in 1945, the McCarron-\nFerguson Act applying antitrust laws to the insurance industry only \n``to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law;'' and \nthen the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which amended the Clayton Act and \nrequired companies to give notice to the antitrust enforcement agencies \nprior to consummating a merger.\n  But in this long history, the principal acts have been the Clayton \nAct and the Sherman Act.\n  There has been from time to time other legislation touching the \nantitrust issues--the Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act in 1980 \npermitting the owners of trademark soft drinks to grant exclusive \nterritorial franchises to bottlers or distributors; the local \ngovernment antitrust laws of 1984; the International Antitrust \nEnforcement Assistance Act of 1994; the Standards Development \nOrganization Advancement Act of 2004 protecting organizations that \ndevelop industry standards from certain types of antitrust liability; \nand in 2004 the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement Reform Act.\n  There have been some modifications of the antitrust laws allowing the \nNational Football League, for example, to have revenue sharing. From \ntime to time, proposals have been made to limit the exemption that \nbaseball enjoys from the antitrust laws as a result of decisions of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  It is my concern that there ought to be some close analysis of the \nexisting antitrust laws with what is happening in the marketplace. The \noutline of proposed legislation which I have denominated the \n``Petroleum Industry Antitrust Act of 2006'' is an outline for analysis \nand for further thought. Again I will say that I am not introducing it \nas a bill today, but I will use it as a basis for discussion and \nquestioning in the Judiciary Committee hearing that will be held on \nMarch 14.\n  This bill would eliminate the judge-made doctrines that prevent OPEC \nmembers from being sued for violation of the antitrust laws by \nconspiring to fix the price of crude oil. Section 1 of the bill amends \nthe Sherman Act prohibiting oil and gas companies from diverting, \nexporting, or refusing to sell existing supplies of crude oil, refined \nproducts, or natural gas, with the primary intent of raising prices or \ncreating a shortage in the market where the existing supplies are \nlocated or intended to be shipped.\n  Section 2 amends the Clayton act prohibiting the acquisition of an \noil or gas company or, any assets of such a company, when the \nacquisition would lessen competition. Current law allows the antitrust \nagencies to challenge any acquisition that may ``substantially'' lessen \ncompetition. This change would significantly increase the level of \nscrutiny received by any large merger between competitors in the oil \nand gas industry.\n  Section 3 requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate \nwhether divestitures required by the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') \nor the Department of Department (``DOJ'') with regard to oil and gas \nindustry mergers have been effective in restoring competition. Once the \nstudy is completed, the FTC and the DOJ must consider whether any \nadditional steps are necessary to restore competition, including \nfurther divestiture or the unraveling of some mergers.\n  Section 4 requires that the FTC and the DOJ establish a joint \nfederal-state task force to examine information sharing and other \nanticompetitive results of recent consolidation in the oil and gas \nindustry.\n  These provisions might well be extended in a final legislative \nproposal to go beyond oil and gas, but that is the thrust of what we \nare considering as we prepare for the Judiciary Committee hearing on \nMarch 14.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize that this is an outline of proposed \nmodifications to the antitrust laws. I approach it with an eye toward \nthe spirit of the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, both of which have \nexisted for so long, but also with a sense that what is happening in \nthe marketplace today requires some further analysis by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  We are finding that the prices of heating oil are extremely high, the \nprice of natural gas is extremely high, the price of gasoline at the \npump is extremely high, and the American consumers and consumers beyond \nAmerica deserve some attention, they deserve to have this situation \nanalyzed and considered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will express some anxiety about the fact \nwe are not moving forward with legislation we need to be considering. \nInterestingly enough, I came from a briefing upstairs by the Secretary \nof Defense and the general from Central Command. It reminds Members of \nthe things out there that we need to deal with.\n  Members go home to their States and people talk about issues that are \nof interest to them--whether it is the economy, energy, budgets--and \nyet we find ourselves going day after day without being able to move \nforward to the topics that are of prime importance. Certainly, we \nshould have the opportunity to talk about whatever people want to talk \nabout. We should have the opportunity to discuss and debate issues, to \ncome to conclusions on issues, but we need to come to a conclusion.\n  It is embarrassing to see what has happened today. We had an \nopportunity to move toward to resolve one of the issues we had before \nthe Senate, the lobbying issue, which needs to be resolved. I don't \nhappen to think it is the biggest issue in the world, but we were in \nthe process of finding ways to get to it in a bipartisan effort that \ncollapsed because of one effort to derail what we are doing.\n  I think we need to take a long look at ourselves. It would be good if \nwe had a little time to lay out on a list those issues that are most \nimportant, the top-quality issues, and then really focus on those \nissues.\n  I think to bring up something here that is totally unrelated to the \nlobbying reform issue, which simply caused us to be stalled on an issue \nthat is being resolved--whether it is the 45-day period, whether it is \nthe agreement that has come forth since--there was no real reason to \nbring this up on the floor at this time except to obstruct moving \nforward.\n  I guess I am becoming sort of upset with the fact that we are not \nable to move forward. I think some of these things are pretty partisan \nissues, simply wanting to get this group out because there is something \ngoing on in the House to resolve that hard issue, and they do not want \nto be left behind. It is political. I am sorry, but that really is not \nwhat it is about to be on the Senate floor.\n  So I will not take any more time, except, I guess, to express my \nfrustration when we do have important issues to deal with. There are a \nlot of issues out there that are so important. We are\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\ntalking about energy and how we get some issues resolved so we can \ndeal, in the long term, with energy, which is a big issue for us not \nonly because it is energy but because it affects everyone every day. It \naffects jobs. It affects the economy.\n  I think one of the issues we need to be doing and continuously \nworking on is health care so it is available for everyone and is \naffordable. We can make some changes there, there is no question.\n  We need to make sure we are doing all we can in taking a long look at \nwhat is happening in the Middle East, and that we can get our job \ncompleted in Iraq, and make sure we do not end up being singularly \ninvolved with Iran. Those are some of the issues.\n  I am, of course, very impressed with the way this system works and \nvery impressed with the way this Senate works, but I do find sometimes \nthat I think we get it all jammed up for reasons that are not really \npart of what we are here designated to do.\n  So I just wanted to share my frustration with that and hope we can \nwork with the leaders on both sides of the aisle to find some ways for \nus to address those issues that are before us for the American people, \nto do the job we are assigned to do and have the responsibility to do, \nand to move forward.\n  It is frustrating to be here but once a day, for example, when there \nare lots of issues out there. Let's decide them, let's vote on them, \nlet's get on with it, instead of--look at this place, empty, empty most \nof the day because we have an obstruction in the system.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we can find some ways to remedy the \nsituation. And I certainly would like to be a part of finding those \nremedies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1053) to authorize the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the products of Ukraine.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I further ask consent that S. 632, the Senate companion measure, be \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1053) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, last November, the Senate passed a bill I \nintroduced, S. 632, authorizing the extension of permanent normal trade \nrelations with Ukraine. During the post-Cold War era, Ukraine has \ncontinued to be subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure \nto comply with freedom of emigration requirements. My bill repeals \npermanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Ukraine.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1053, the House \ncompanion to my bill. I am extremely pleased that the Senate has passed \nthis legislation today.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment \nto meet freedom of emigration requirements, and to abide by free market \nprinciples and good governance. Improving trade will strengthen the \ngrowing relationship between our two nations. The United States will \ncontinue its strong support of Ukraine and its commitment to democracy \nand free markets.\n  I encourage President Yushchenko to continue his no-tolerance policy \nfor antisemitism in Ukraine. I look forward to President Bush signing \nthis bill into law as a further signal of United States support for \ndemocracy and free enterprise in Ukraine. This is especially important \nbefore the parliamentary elections in Ukraine on March 26.\n  Extraordinary events have occurred in Ukraine. A free press has \nrevolted against intimidation and reasserted itself. An emerging middle \nclass has found its political footing. A new generation has embraced \ndemocracy and openness. A society has rebelled against the illegal \nactivities of the previous government. It is in our interest to \nrecognize and to protect these advances in Ukraine.\n  The United States has a long record of cooperation with Ukraine \nthrough the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act. Ukraine \ninherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world with the fall \nof the Soviet Union.\n  Through the Nunn-Lugar program, the United States has assisted \nUkraine in eliminating this deadly arsenal and joining the \nNonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. The United States can \nand should do more to eliminate conventional weapons stockpiles and \nassist other nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass \ndestruction. These functions are underfunded, fragmented, and in need \nof high-level support.\n  This was pointed out to me during a visit Senator Barack Obama and I \nenjoyed in Ukraine in early September of last year.\n  The Government's current response to threats from vulnerable \nconventional weapons stockpiles is dispersed between several programs \nat the Department of State. We believe the planning, coordination, and \nimplementation of this function should be consolidated into one office \nat the State Department with a budget that is commensurate with the \nthreat posed by these weapons.\n  We look forward to continuing to address these issues and making \nprogress on all fronts in Ukraine. The permanent waiver of Jackson-\nVanik and the establishment of permanent normal relations will be the \nfoundation on which a burgeoning partnership between our nations can \nfurther grow and prosper.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to mention that on this auspicious day of \nour relations with Ukraine, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine is in \nWashington. We have had opportunities to visit, to share views, and to \nassert, once again, the solidarity of our friendship.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to support H.R. 1053, \nlegislation to extend permanent normal trade relations with Ukraine. \nThis is the House companion to the bill, S. 632, that Senator Lugar and \nI introduced and shepherded through the Senate last year.\n  Senator Lugar just forcefully outlined the issues in only the way \nthat the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee can. I agree with \nwhat he said and cannot say it any better. So, I will be brief.\n  As the chairman mentioned, this bill comes at a critical time for \nUkraine--on the heels of dramatic presidential elections and shortly \nbefore important elections in the Rada. This legislation grew out of \nour trip to Ukraine last August, as we saw firsthand the key role that \nthe United States must play in consolidating prodemocracy, pro-free \nmarket reforms. I believe it is critical that we continue to send a \nclear message to the Ukrainian people that there are tangible benefits \nto continuing down this path. This bipartisan legislation does just \nthat.\n  It is my honor to be the lead cosponsor of the Senate companion bill \nand I look forward to this legislation enhancing the U.S.-Ukraine \nrelationship. I look forward to the President signing this bill into \nlaw.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1954-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n                  GRIZZLY BIG SKY CONFERENCE CHAMPION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in Montana, we are as proud of Montana as \nTexans are of being from Texas; we just aren't as loud about it. Until \ntoday.\n  I rise today to congratulate the University of Montana Grizzlies \nmen's basketball team.\n  For my colleagues who didn't stay awake last night, Montana's own \nGrizzlies, led by tournament MVP Virgil Matthews, upset the top-seeded \nNorthern Arizona Lumberjacks 73 to 60 to win the Big Sky Conference \ntournament and earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\n  This marks the second straight year that the Griz will join the ``big \ndance'' and could be the start of a dynasty for our very own Coach K.\n  In only his second year, Coach Larry Krystkowiak has led his teams to \nconference titles in both years, and this marks the first time that the \nGriz have had back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances since 1991-1992.\n  Coach K's achievements both on the court and off are phenomenal. As a \nplayer, he is the University of Montana's all-time leader in scoring \nand rebounding. He went on to a long and successful career in the NBA. \nHe is a true Montana legend.\n  And then the legend came home to lead his alma mater. And all the \nvictories have been great.\n  But the class and leadership of Coach K stands out much more. One \nexample that sticks out in my mind happened just recently, when Coach \nK, along with several members of the Griz athletic department, all \nshaved their heads to both raise money for ``Coaches vs. Cancer'' and \nto show support for a friend who had recently been diagnosed with the \ndisease.\n  I can't say that Coach K looked very good, but his actions set an \nexample throughout our State.\n  Coach K is a class act, a great example of a dedicated Montanan, and \nI just wanted to take a moment to congratulate him and his team and \nwish them success with their upcoming March Madness.\n  (The remarks of Mr. BAUCUS pertaining to the introduction of S. 2398 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, yesterday, I filed the Online Freedom of \nSpeech Act as an amendment to the lobbying reform bill.\n  This morning, the House Administration Committee will mark up \nidentical legislation. We expect the House to act as early as next week \nto pass this vital protection of free speech.\n  Thomas Jefferson once quipped that, ``Advertisements contain the only \ntruths to be relied on in a newspaper.''\n  But despite his low opinion of the press, he also observed that, \n``Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government \nwithout newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not \nhesitate a moment to prefer the latter.''\n  From the earliest days of our Republic, freedom of speech and freedom \nof the press--be they anonymous pamphlets, celebrated essays, or local \nnewspapers--were understood to be fundamental to the practice and \ndefense of liberty.\n  Without the ability to convey ideas, debate, dispute, and persuade, \nwe may never have fought for and achieved our independence.\n  Ordinary citizens--farmers, ministers, local shop owners--published \nand circulated their views, often anonymously, to challenge the \nconventional order and call their fellow citizens to action.\n  Indeed, as Boston University journalism professor Chris Daly points \nout, ``What we think of as reporting--the pursuit, on a full time basis \nof verifiable facts and verbatim quotations--was not a significant part \nof journalism in the time of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine. . . . \nIn historical terms, today's bloggers are much closer in spirit to the \nRevolutionary-era pamphleteers.''\n  And today, it is bloggers whom we now have to protect.\n  There are some who, out of fear or shortsightedness, wish to restrict \nthe ability of our modern-day Thomas Paines to express political views \non the World Wide Web.\n  They seek to monitor and regulate political speech under the guise of \n``campaign finance reform.'' They argue that unfettered political \nexpression on the Internet is dangerous, especially during the highly \ncharged election season.\n  Needless to say, I stand firmly against these efforts to hamstring \nthe Internet and squarely with the champions of free speech--whether \nthat expression takes place in the actual or virtual town square.\n  Free speech is the core of our first amendment. And the Internet \nrepresents the most participatory form of mass speech in human history.\n  It is no accident that this technology was invented here in America. \nFreedom of speech is encoded in our DNA. It is what allows us to be \nuniquely curious, daring and innovative.\n  And it is no coincidence that Americans, steeped in the tradition of \ninquiry and rebellion, would give flight to yet another revolution on \nbehalf of the principle we value most.\n  In an era where technology has made instant, unfiltered communication \npossible, I believe that the Congress has a fundamental responsibility \nto allow this new medium to flourish.\n  As an amateur blogger myself, and soon-to-be private citizen, I am \ncommitted to ensuring that the extraordinary explosion of political \ndebate in the blogosphere is protected from meddling bureaucrats and \nregulators in Washington, DC.\n  I commented on this very issue on my own blog last week. Free \npolitical expression is not a narrow privilege but a fundamental right.\n  Back in April of 1999, when observers and commentators were only \nbeginning to glimpse the rich potential of the Internet, Rick Levine, \nChristopher Locke, Doc Searls and David Weinberger posted the \n``Cluetrain Manifesto.''\n  In it they said that, ``A powerful global conversation has begun. \nThrough the Internet, people are discovering and inventing new ways to \nshare relevant knowledge with blinding speed.''\n  Since then, the conversation has only grown.\n  While authoritarian regimes like Communist China struggle to control \nthe information crossing their borders, millions of private citizens, \ntyping away on their home computers, are engaged in millions of \ndiscreet and overlapping conversations, exchanging information, and \ncirculating ideas.\n  As Americans, we should be on the side of this dazzling development. \nAs citizens of the 21st century, we should recognize we have no power \nto stop it.\n  Brian Anderson of the Manhattan Institute points out that the Supreme \nCourt has extended free speech to include nude dancing, online \npornography, and cross burning.\n  It seems only reasonable that free speech should include the humble \nact of posting a blog.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1954-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1954-S1955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE SMALL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a man who has \ndedicated himself to serving our country and has made the sacrifices \nnecessary to protecting our Nation's freedom during one of our most \ntrying times.\n  Mr. George Small was born in Montreal, Canada, in 1908 and then moved \nwith his family to New York City as a child. Upon graduating from the \nPolytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1935, he began to look for work. \nThe country was deep in the throws of the Great Depression however, and \nthere was none to be found. This sparked a move to California, where he \nfound a job with a chemical plant near Death Valley. When the employees \nof the plant went on strike, George went on Active Duty in the Army; \nwhere he was already a 2nd lieutenant in the Army Reserves.\n  George's active service began on April 25, 1941, and he began \ntraining at the Army Chemical Warfare School. In\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nOctober of the same year, he was transferred to the Philippines. This \nproved to be a fateful event. He arrived 6 weeks before the attack on \nPearl Harbor and America's involvement in World War II. He was ordered \nto Bataan on Christmas Eve of 1941. He fought bravely alongside the \nother men of the 31st Infantry against overwhelming odds until the \nsurrender of Bataan on April 9, 1942.\n  Upon capture by the Japanese, George and the other 76,000 POWs set \nout on the infamous 55-mile Bataan death march to prison camps. Along \nthe way, the prisoners endured intensely cruel and inhumane treatment. \nGeorge watched as many of his friends were beaten and killed. It was \nduring this agonizing journey that George promised himself he would \nsurvive the nightmare he was living.\n  After 3\\1/2\\ years in captivity, George was liberated on September \n10, 1945. Even though he was severely malnourished, weighing only 98 \npounds, and suffered from malaria, he was still alive. George was \nawarded the American Defense Service Medal with one Bronze Star, \nAmerican Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal with two Bronze \nStars, Distinguished Unit Badge with Two Oak Leaf Clusters, Combat \nInfantry Badge, Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one Bronze Star, WWII \nVictory Medal, and the POW Medal.\n  Following discharge from the Army on November 26, 1946, George \nremained in the Army Reserves until he retired at the rank of major in \n1968. He worked as a civil engineer for the State of California during \nthe post-war years, and in 1954 he married his wife, Hadassa. They \nraised two daughters together.\n  George recently celebrated his 98th birthday in Reno, making him the \noldest former POW living in Nevada. He is truly an American hero, and \nhas earned my admiration and the respect of all those who have known \nhim. I offer him my gratitude and wish him all the best in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1955-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NEW U.N. INITIATIVE FOR CYPRIOT REUNIFICATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the President of \nCyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, for promoting a new U.N.-sponsored \ninitiative to resolve the division of the island of Cyprus. Cyprus has \nbeen divided for more than 30 years, following a 1974 invasion by \nTurkey. The time is ripe for resolving this longstanding split, and I \napplaud President Papadopoulos for taking the initiative to end the \ndivision.\n  On February 28, 2006, President Papadopoulos met with U.N. Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan and proposed that the U.N. appoint a special envoy \nfor Cyprus to lay the groundwork for negotiations to end the division \nof Cyprus. President Papadopoulos also proposed a number of cross-\ncommunity confidence-building measures to strengthen the foundation for \nreunification. After the meeting, Secretary-General Annan and President \nPapadopoulos issued a joint statement agreeing on the resumption of \nbicommunal discussions on the technical aspects necessary to prepare \nthe ground for full peace negotiations.\n  There have been significant developments in Cyprus over the past 2 \nyears that make this the right time for reunification. Nearly 2 years \nago, Cyprus joined the European Union, and in that time, the Government \nof Cyprus has promoted the opening up of several crossing points \nthrough the U.N.-patrolled cease-fire line. As a result, the Government \nof Cyprus has transformed the everyday realities on Cyprus to that \nunlike any other divided nation.\n  Unlike other divisions with which my colleagues may be familiar, such \nas East and West Berlin, the people of Cyprus are able to cross the \ndividing line to visit their ancestral lands, work, and shop. Indeed, \nsince the opening of crossing points, there have been more than 9 \nmillion incident-free crossings. Every day, more than 10,000 Turkish \nCypriots cross from the occupied territory to the government-controlled \narea to work. This increased economic activity and trade across the \ndividing line has contributed in more than doubling the per-capita \nincome of the Turkish-Cypriots in the past 2 short years.\n  As confidence building measures, President Papadopoulos has proposed \nto take additional steps to build on the gains of the past 2 years. The \nGovernment of Cyprus has already proposed the reopening of the occupied \nPort of Famagusta and the return of the adjacent city of Varosha to its \noriginal inhabitants; a ``ghost'' city that has been abandoned since \nthe 1974 Turkish invasion. Famagusta would operate under the joint \nadministration of the two communities, bringing the two communities \ncloser together, and also under the EU's regulatory auspices, enhancing \ntrade opportunities. President Papadopoulos has also proposed to open \nadditional crossing points to make travel and trade between the two \ncommunities easier.\n  Last week, the European Union announced economic aid to the Turkish \nCypriots of 139 million eurodollars--approximately $165 million. The \nGovernment of Cyprus had pushed strongly for this aid, despite \nunfortunate attempts by others to attach preconditions and political \nstipulations to its release. This aid from the EU further demonstrates \nthe positive effect of Cyprus's EU membership on the prospects for \nreunification.\n  I applaud the steps that the Government of Cyprus and President \nPapadopoulos have taken to encourage a just and lasting solution to the \nCyprus division. His meeting with Secretary-General Annan is a positive \nfirst step toward the resumption of reunification negotiations. On \nCyprus today, the two communities are closer together than at any time \nsince the invasion. Although prior reunification efforts have failed, \nthe developments of the past 2 years offer the greatest prospect for a \npeaceful and lasting solution to the division.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1955-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1955-S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF DANA REEVE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nwoman, Dana Reeve, who died on Monday, March 6 at the age of 44. Dana's \ncourage, grace and love in dealing with the tragic paralysis of her \nlate husband, actor Christopher Reeve, were an inspiration to millions \nof Americans. Dana and Christopher's tireless advocacy on behalf of \nindividuals and families living with spinal cord injury made them \nAmerican heroes.\n  Dana Morosini was born in 1961 to Dr. Charles Morosini and Helen \nMorosini. She grew up in Scarsdale, New York, graduated cum laude from \nMiddlebury College in Vermont and studied acting at the California \nInstitute of the Arts.\n  Dana was an accomplished actress and singer. She appeared on \nBroadway, off Broadway and in regional theatre, on television and in \nHBO films, and performed as a singer on national television and in \nvenues around New York. Reeve co-hosted ``Lifetime Live,'' a daily \nwomen's information program on the Lifetime network.\n  It was while Dana performed in a late-night cabaret at the \nWilliamstown Theatre Festival in 1987 that she met actor Christopher \nReeve, who was in the audience. They married on April 11, 1992. Their \nson Will was born in 1992. She was also stepmother to Christopher's \nchildren Matthew and Alexandra Exton Reeve. She was a devoted and \nloving mother, deeply committed to her family.\n  In 1995, America watched in disbelief as an equestrian accident left \nChristopher Reeve, perhaps best known for his film role as Superman, \nparalyzed. America was inspired as Dana Reeve courageously and publicly \nsupported Christopher with humor and grace. Dana and Christopher helped \npropel spinal cord injury into the national spotlight, working to \nincrease funding and find a cure. They became actively involved in \nfighting for the rights of the disabled and helping families live with \nspinal cord injury. Our hearts went out to Dana and her family when \nChristopher Reeve passed away on October 10, 2004.\n  Dana was a founding board member of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, \nwhich became the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation after its \nmerger with the American Paralysis Association. Dana took over as chair \nafter her husband's death. Dana was deeply involved with the \nChristopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center, PRC, which \npromotes the health and well-being of people and families living with \nparalysis.\n  Dana was also committed to the Reeve-Irvine Center for Spinal Cord\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\nResearch at the University of California, Irvine. The Reeve-Irvine \nResearch Center is the premier research and education center working to \nfind innovative new treatments for spinal cord injury. I was proud to \nwork with Christopher and Dana to support therapeutic stem cell \nresearch, which holds the promise to treat a vast array of diseases, \nincluding juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, \nand cancer as well as spinal cord injuries.\n  Dana received numerous awards in recognition of her strength, courage \nand positive attitude: the American Cancer Society's Mother of the Year \nAward in 2005; the Visiting Nurses Association's Caregiver's Courage \nAward; and she was named one of America's Outstanding Women of 1995 by \n``CBS This Morning.''\n  In August, 2005, America was upset to learn that Dana Reeve had lung \ncancer. Dana and Christopher were both nonsmokers. As always, Dana \nremained an inspiration. In a May 2005 interview, she said ``Now, more \nthan ever, I feel Chris with me as I face this challenge,'' she said. \n``As always, I look to him as the ultimate example of defying the odds \nwith strength, courage, and hope in the face of life's adversities.'' \nShe also said ``There's a formula Chris and I used all the time. When \nyou least feel like it, do something for someone else. You forget about \nyour own situation. It gives you a purpose, as opposed being sorrowful \nand lonely. It makes me feel better when things are too hard for me.''\n  Dana and Christopher showed a deep love for each other, their family \nand for humanity. They will always be remembered. We must renew our \nefforts to find cures for spinal cord injuries and cancer and to \nadvance stem cell research on their behalf.\n  Dana Reeve is survived by her son Will; father, Dr. Charles Morosini; \nsisters Deborah Morosini and Adrienne Morosini Heilman; and two \nstepchildren, Matthew and Alexandra Exton Reeve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1956-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF KIRBY PUCKETT\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to \nhonor the life of Kirby Puckett, whose exuberant love of the game made \nhim one of the best-loved players in baseball history. For many \nbaseball fans, young and old alike, Kirby Puckett was the reason they \npicked up a baseball bat and kicked up their foot as the pitch \napproached. Kirby Puckett is Minnesota baseball.\n  Amazingly, Kirby was not the strongest, fastest, tallest, or most \ngifted baseball player ever. All you had to do was watch Kirby swing at \na pitch three feet outside of the strike zone to understand that he did \nnot succeed because of his mechanics. It was his gravity-defying leaps \nin center field, his hustling out an infield single, and his ability to \nhit the pitch three feet outside the strike zone that made him one of \nthe greatest baseball players to grace the game. This honor was quickly \nrewarded in 2001, when at the age of 37 he was inducted into the Hall \nof Fame and became the third youngest living inductee, behind Sandy \nKoufax and Lou Gehrig.\n  Kirby Puckett's history-making career with the Twins began May 8, \n1984. In his first game he became one of nine players in the history of \nbaseball to collect four hits in their first game. For the next twelve \nseasons Kirby Puckett and his now retired No. 34 carried the Minnesota \nTwins out from obscurity to two World Series Titles in 1987 and 1991. \nHe made ten straight all-star appearances from 1986 until 1995, and won \nsix gold gloves over his career. Perhaps the defining moment in Kirby \nPuckett's legendary career came during Game Six of the 1991 World \nSeries. Puckett hit a walk off home run in the eleventh inning, \nbecoming the ninth player in history to hit a walk off home run in a \nWorld Series game. As Kirby rounded second base and pumped his fist \ninto the air, he transcended the game itself and took his seat among \nthe greatest players to swing the bat.\n  Tragically, Kirby was forced to retire from baseball on July 12, \n1996, due to complications with glaucoma. In his retirement Puckett \ncontinued the charitable work he began as a player, raising money for \nglaucoma prevention and children's charities, perhaps most famously \nthrough his sponsoring of celebrity billiards tournaments to benefit \nthe Children's Heart Fund. He won both the Branch Rickey Award, 1993, \nand the Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award, 1996, for his community \nservice.\n  Kirby's accomplishments were not predestined. Kirby willed his \nsuccess from sheer attitude and hard work. He was born March 14, 1961, \nin Chicago, IL. Kirby grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green \nHousing Projects, ``the place where hope died.'' Despite the daily \nbarrage of drugs and gangs that surrounded him, Kirby went on to become \nan All-American at Calumet High School. While playing in a college \nbaseball league in Illinois, Puckett caught the eye of some pro scouts, \nalthough he surely caught the ears of the scouts as well with his \ncolorful clubhouse humor. Soon thereafter in 1982, Kirby Puckett was a \nfirst round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins.\n  As I said before, Kirby Puckett was not gifted with the greatest \nbaseball talent. He did not physically dominate the game, but he did \ndominate it mentally. Ever since Kirby, little league coaches have \nalways had to tell their kids that they could only swing like Kirby if \nthey made the major leagues. The problem is that in order to make the \nMajors, those same coaches had to tell the kids they had to work and \nplay as hard as Kirby did and have fun doing it. That is his legacy to \nbaseball; he put the fun into baseball. It is now all of our \nresponsibility to carry on that legacy.\n  If Kirby were alive he would want all of us to honor him with his \ntrademark sign-of-the cross and promise to make the most out of life as \nhe did. As Kirby remarked with his typical modesty after his baseball \ncareer ended prematurely:\n\n       Kirby Puckett's going to be all right. Don't worry about \n     me. I'll show up, and I'll have a smile on my face. The only \n     thing I won't have is this uniform on. But you guys can have \n     the memories of what I did when I did have it on.\n\n  Kirby, we know you are all right in heaven right now, but we are not \nall right. We loved you as a player, but most of all we loved how you \nalways had a smile on your face. You made us believe in ourselves. On \nbehalf of Minnesota and baseball fans everywhere, thank you for the \nmemories. You will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1956-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1956-S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RAILROAD COMPETITION ACT 2005\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nfair and competitive rail system. Our agricultural economy cannot \noperate the way it should. We cannot receive the materials we need at a \ndecent price and we cannot distribute our products at a fair price.\n  We need to work on Federal rail policy that encourages competition. \nFarmers, businesses and consumers would all benefit from this policy.\n  Montana's rail infrastructure is controlled by a single rail carrier \ncontrolling over 96 percent of all rail miles, over 95 percent all \ngrain elevator and terminal sites, and moving more than 95 percent all \nwheat from the State.\n  There is more control by a single railroad in Montana than any other \nState. The rail carrier controls and dictates the rail rates in all \nmovements from Montana eastbound or westbound.\n  As a result, agricultural shippers in some parts of the United States \nare paying the highest rail freight rates in exchange for sporadic and \nunreliable service. It's unacceptable. And it's not right that our \nMontana producers are expected to do business under these conditions.\n  Our shippers need a clearly defined means for securing reliable \nservice at a reasonable rate. It's fair. And it's the right thing to \ndo.\n  Agricultural shippers are unique because the party that bears the \ncost of rail transportation--the farmer--is not the party that \nnegotiates the rate for that transportation--the grain elevator.\n  Further, the farmer has no ability to pass on the costs associated \nwith transportation to the customer.\n  To ship a 26 car shipment of wheat from Medicine Lake, MT, to \nPortland is $3.42 per mile. To ship a 26 car shipment of wheat from \nCommerce City, CO, to Portland is $2.61 per mile and Atchison, KS, to \nPortland is $2.34 per mile.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\n  Montana rates are 31 percent higher than more distant points going to \nthe same market because of lack of competition.\n  Consider this example: A bushel of spring wheat sells for \napproximately $4.10. More than $1.00 of that amount, or up to one-third \nof the price a farmer receives, goes to pay for rail transportation.\n  Stated another way, the average wheat farmer is working for the \nrailroads up to four months out of the year.\n  We need to establish a national rail policy that encourages \ncompetition that helps both producers and consumers alike.\n  I'm committed to doing all I can to promote competition and to help \nour Montana producers.\n  On Captive Rail Day, I urge my Senate colleagues to join together and \nwork on legislation that will create a more fair and competitive \nfreight rail system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1957-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about International \nWomen's Day, which was yesterday, March 8. The theme this year is \n``women in decisionmaking.'' As I contemplated the meaning of this, I \nthought about how important it is for women to be involved in the \ndecisionmaking about their own bodies.\n  And in this vein I would like to talk about the global gag rule.\n  When President Bush took office in 2001, he signed an Executive order \nknown as the global gag rule. It denies U.S. funds to any overseas \nhealth clinic unless it agrees not to participate in any activities \nrelated to abortion services. Those activities include: providing legal \nabortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the woman's life is \nendangered; and offering advice and information regarding the \navailability and benefits of abortion and providing referrals for \nabortion services.\n  The global gag rule denies U.S. funds even if the overseas health \nclinic is using its own privately raised funds for these services. What \nthat means is that if you are a medical professional living in an \nimpoverished country trying to help people and save their lives, you \nare gagged from even talking about certain reproductive health \nservices. The gag rule places limits on women and doctors that we have \ndeemed unacceptable here in the United States.\n  Last year, the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Affairs \nAuthorization Act to reverse the President's policy and ensure that \nhealth care clinics for women and families receive this much needed \nfunding. Unfortunately, this legislation has not been passed by the \nfull Senate. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill last year \ncontained $34 million for the United Nations Population Fund, UNPA, for \nthis purpose. But in order to ensure that this money goes toward \nfunding health care clinics for women and families in poor countries, \nwe must overturn this global gag rule.\n  In many poor countries around the world, nongovernmental \norganizations and medical professionals are working to make things \nbetter. They have set up clinics and reached out to the women and \nfamilies in poor communities. They are doing great work. But their \nhands are tied, because the Bush administration has imposed a political \nideology on the world.\n  Overturning the global gag rule is about safe access to health care \nfor women. Hundreds of thousands of women are dying each year from \ncomplications from pregnancy. These women do not have access to the \nhealth care that they need, especially reproductive health care. I will \ncontinue to speak out about the importance of providing safe access to \nhealth care for women all over the globe until this dangerous policy is \nlifted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1957-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              GORDON PARKS\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the great \nlife and many artistic contributions of Kansas native Gordon Parks who \ndied Tuesday at the age of 93.\n  Through his poetry, books, music and photography, Mr. Parks showed \nAmerica a truth about its society and challenged all of us to make the \ncountry a better place.\n  Born in Fort Scott, KS, in 1912, Mr. Parks's family faced both \npoverty and discrimination. Yet in spite of these challenges--and \ninspired by these challenges--Mr. Parks rose to the heights of success \nthrough his largely self-taught artistic ability. He found his life \nexperiences helped shape his art as he chronicled the African-American \nexperience.\n  In 1937, Mr. Parks bought his first camera. By 1948, he was hired at \nLife Magazine. There, he earned his reputation as a humanitarian \nphotojournalist capturing images of the civil rights movement and of \nthe poverty in America and abroad. Through his photographs he reminded \nAmericans of the harsh realities present in our culture.\n  In 1968, he directed the movie version of his childhood memoir, ``The \nLearning Tree.'' His direction of ``The Learning Tree'' also marked the \nfirst time an African American directed a major Hollywood production. \nHe won an Emmy for his documentary ``Diary of a Harlem Family,'' and in \n1971 directed the critically acclaimed movie ``Shaft.'' He is also \nknown for composing the musical score for ``Martin,'' a ballet \ndocumenting the life of civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King, Jr. In \n1970, he helped found Essence magazine.\n  Kansas is forever grateful for his talents. In 1986, he was named \nKansan of the Year. In 1999, Kansas City opened the Gordon Parks \nElementary School. And most recently, in February, the University of \nKansas's William Allen White Foundation honored Mr. Parks with its \nNational Citation for journalistic merit.\n  Mr. Parks showed unrelenting spirit in his work. His civil rights \ncontributions, as told through his art will go unmatched. Today, we \nproudly honor a remarkable artist and pioneer for all he did for Kansas \nand the Nation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1957-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER GREGORY JOHN BAILEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and share \nwith my colleagues the memory of a remarkable man, Officer Gregory \n``John'' Bailey of the California Highway Patrol. Officer Bailey spent \nalmost 10 years with the California Highway Patrol, serving the \ncitizens of California. On February 25, 2006, while on motor patrol \nnear the City of Hesperia, Officer Bailey was struck and killed by a \ndriver suspected to be under the influence of a controlled substance.\n  Wearing a uniform came naturally to Officer Bailey after spending 8 \nyears in the Army as a helicopter mechanic. Even after joining the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol, Officer Bailey chose to serve in the \nCalifornia National Guard, and just returned from a 14-month tour in \nIraq last fall. Officer Bailey dutifully served the citizens and \ncommunities of the Inland Empire with great dedication and integrity. \nHe combined his love of excitement and his passion for the uniform he \nwore to become a very successful motorcycle officer. Officer Bailey's \ncolleagues in the California Highway Patrol and the National Guard \nshall always remember his upbeat attitude, ability to motivate others, \nand commitment to his job.\n  Officer Bailey was a devoted family man. He is survived by his wife \nTeresa, and children, Megan, Jared, Hannah and Dylan. When he was not \non duty, Officer Bailey was a ``true cowboy from head to toe,'' who \nenjoyed spending time with his family and listening to country music \nwith his friends. Officer Gregory ``John'' Bailey served the State of \nCalifornia and the United States honorably and conscientiously, and \nfulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. Officer Bailey gave his \nlife while protecting the safety of those he served. His contributions \nand dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will \nserve as his legacy.\n  Officer Gregory ``John'' Bailey gave his life doing what he loved to \ndo--providing protection for the people he loved. We shall always be \ngrateful for Officer Bailey's heroic service to the California Highway \nPatrol and the community that he so bravely served.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1958-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n                     2006 U.S. WINTER OLYMPICS TEAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \naccomplishments of the incredibly hard-working and dedicated members of \nthe 2006 U.S. Winter Olympics team. This year, our team won 25 \nindividual and team medals, including 9 gold medals.\n  Olympic athletes commit years of time and effort to earning the honor \nof representing the United States at the Olympic Games. Upon reaching \nthe games, their determination stayed constant, even when faced with \ninjury and adversity. Their spirit and willingness to strive for \nexcellence no matter what the situation serves as an example for all \nAmericans.\n  I would especially like to recognize the 27 Californians who competed \nin Turin. While California is widely known for our wonderful weather \nand beautiful beaches, we also boast some of our Nation's finest winter \nathletes. The following seven California athletes won medals as well:\n\n       Chanda Gunn of Huntington Beach won bronze as a member of \n     the U.S. Women's Hockey team.\n       Rusty Smith from Long Beach won a bronze medal as a member \n     of the Short Track Speedskating 5,000-meter relay team.\n       Sasha Cohen of Corona del Mar won the silver medal in \n     Figure Skating.\n       Valerie Fleming from Foster City won silver as a part of \n     the two-member Bobsled Team.\n       Danny Kass of Mammoth Lakes won the silver medal in the \n     Snowboarding Half-Pipe event.\n       Julia Mancuso from Olympic Valley won gold in the Alpine \n     Skiing Giant Slalom.\n       Finally, Shaun White of Carlsbad brought home the gold \n     medal in the Snowboarding Half-pipe event.\n\n  The spirit of adventure and determination displayed by these athletes \nis a wonderful example of our country's potential to achieve. I hope \nyou are heartened, as I am, to learn of Americans striving for personal \nexcellence. I extend my sincere congratulations to California Olympians \nand all of our country's athletes, and I thank them for their great \nteam spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1958-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GULF OF THE FARALLONES NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the 25th \nAnniversary of one of my State's great natural treasures, the Gulf of \nthe Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.\n  The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary was designated \nin 1981 and was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter the day \nbefore he left office. I served on the Marin County Board of \nSupervisors at the time, and I remember how hard the community worked \nto establish this designation.\n  The year this sanctuary was established was a critical time in our \ncountry's debate about offshore oil drilling.\n  Californians overwhelmingly rejected the idea of ocean drilling and \nthe creation of a national marine sanctuary near the Farallones Islands \nwas seen as an important way of advancing ocean conservation.\n  The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary encompasses \n1,200 square miles of one of the richest marine ecosystems in the \nworld. This sanctuary includes vital feeding and spawning grounds for \none of the world's largest populations of the Great White Shark, a \nlarge variety of fish and shellfish, and over 36 marine mammals, \nincluding the endangered Humpback and Blue whales. The sanctuary also \nincludes the Farallon Islands--the largest seabird nesting area in the \ncontiguous United States.\n  In our efforts to protect ocean life and the marine environment, the \nGulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary plays a crucial role. \nScientists from all over the world come to study this dynamic \necosystem.\n  Yet offshore oil drilling and exploration continue to threaten this \nsanctuary and the California coast. Earlier this year, I introduced the \nCalifornia Ocean and Coastal Protection Act with Senator Dianne \nFeinstein and Congresswoman Lois Capps. This bill would provide \npermanent protection for California's coast from future offshore oil \ndrilling.\n  Last year, Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey and I introduced legislation to \nexpand the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones sanctuary and its \nneighboring Cordell Bank sanctuary, to protect the entire coast of \nSonoma County from future oil and gas exploration. Californians have \nbeen demanding this type of protection for a generation.\n  The California coast is enjoyed by Californians and visitors from \naround the world, and the natural resources of the Pacific Ocean are \npriceless and vital to a healthy, growing California economy. My goal \nhas always been permanent protection for the California coast, and I \nwill continue fighting for this protection as long as I am in the \nUnited States Senate. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to \nprotect the ocean, one of our greatest natural resources. The National \nMarine Sanctuary Program, established in 1972, plays a critical role in \npreserving our precious marine resources and protecting our coasts from \noffshore oil and gas development.\n  I applaud everyone who has worked to protect the marine ecosystem of \nthe Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. I wish sanctuary \nstaff and volunteers many years of ongoing success in protecting the \nCalifornia coastal environment. Please join me in celebrating the 25th \nAnniversary of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine \nSanctuary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1958-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE LIFE OF MARTIN F. STEIN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today people across my State of \nWisconsin are deeply saddened by the loss of a man who dedicated so \nmuch of his time, and so much of himself, to strengthening our \ncommunities: Marty Stein.\n  I want to share what some other people have said about Marty's \npassing because I think it will give my colleagues a sense of who he \nwas and the kind of contributions he made. Tommy Thompson, our former \nGovernor, and the recent Secretary of Health and Human Services, said \nsimply, ``What will we do without him?''\n  The executive director of Hunger Task Force, a Milwaukee-based \nnonprofit, said, ``We always referred to Marty as our angel. He solved \nthe problems, opened the doors, fixed things that seemed like they \nwould never get fixed. And he did it because he cared.''\n  Those words tell you what a force Marty was in the Milwaukee area and \nthroughout the State. His dedication to serving his community was \nunparalleled. We will miss not only what he did but the energy he \nbrought to his efforts and the example he set for everyone he knew.\n  Marty was a skilled businessman who built not one but two thriving \nbusinesses--first the successful chain of Stein drug stores, and later \nStein Health Services, which included the Stein Optical stores so well \nknown in Wisconsin.\n  He took those same skills he used in business, that rare drive and \ndedication, and used them to help community organizations to thrive. An \noutstanding fundraiser, he was determined to engage others in his \ncharitable work by asking for their contributions of money or time for \na good cause.\n  It is impossible to talk about Marty's many good works without \ntalking about the strength of his faith. Faith fueled his humanitarian \nefforts, as he worked to support local organizations like the Milwaukee \nJewish Home and Care Center, and as he worked on international issues \nlike chairing an effort to bring thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel.\n  His work will live on and act as a challenge to everyone who knew \nhim--to ask what more each of us can do to serve our communities and to \ndedicate ourselves to those causes as he did, with unmatched energy and \nwith the utmost integrity.\n  Today my thoughts and sympathies are with the Stein family. Marty's \nlife and work created a lasting legacy that I am proud to honor today \nand that will be remembered and celebrated for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/09/senate-section/article/S1958-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1958-S1959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1190.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to using \n     funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the \n     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for modular \n     homes as alternative housing for those affected by hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, it is estimated that the two hurricanes rendered \n     at least two hundred thousand to two hundred fifty thousand \n     homes permanently uninhabitable, leaving those families \n     without a home to return to; and\n       Whereas, in an effort to move people out of shelters and \n     into longer term housing and to foster an environment that \n     would allow families the privacy needed to re-establish some \n     sense of normalcy, FEMA ordered one hundred twenty thousand \n     travel trailers and announced a plan to establish FEMA \n     trailer parks for evacuees; and\n       Whereas, while travel trailers may be adequate as a short-\n     term housing solution, trailers are not adequate for the \n     years it may require to rebuild the Gulf Coast cities, towns, \n     and communities destroyed by the hurricanes, and evacuees and \n     their families need a more appropriate housing solution \n     during the long rebuilding period; and\n       Whereas, state and local leaders continue to try to find \n     appropriate housing for hundreds of thousands of families \n     still without adequate temporary housing; and\n       Whereas, approximately twenty-seven thousand families in \n     FEMA-funded hotel rooms continue to face looming deadlines of \n     forced eviction; and\n       Whereas, modular homes that are engineered and built in a \n     factory-controlled environment and are constructed in \n     sections and put together by a builder on a building site \n     would provide more appropriate housing for the long \n     rebuilding period ahead; and\n       Whereas, our goal should be to build new and better \n     neighborhoods that support a better quality of life for \n     displaced residents: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana urge and \n     request the Congress of the United States and the governor to \n     consider using funds from the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development for modular homes as alternative housing; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress and to the governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-265. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to ensuring enactment of legislation to require the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide the same level \n     of assistance to the residents of certain parishes who were \n     affected by Hurricane Rita as the residents of Louisiana \n     affected by Hurricane Katrina, including funding assistance \n     with demolition and removal of damaged housing; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina struck many parishes in \n     Louisiana on August 29, 2005, causing devastating damage to \n     life and property in a wide area including the parishes of \n     Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and other \n     parishes; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Rita struck several parishes in \n     Louisiana on September 24, 2005, heavily affecting portions \n     of Iberia Parish and other parishes and also causing \n     devastating damage to property; and\n       Whereas, both hurricanes caused devastating damage to the \n     affected areas and dramatically affected the lives and \n     livelihoods of thousands of persons, in addition to adversely \n     affecting the budgets of local, state, and federal \n     governments; and\n       Whereas, the costs for demolition and removal of damaged \n     housing and hurricane-related debris as a result of these \n     hurricanes will be astronomical; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n     provides assistance to persons affected by disasters such as \n     hurricanes based on percentages determined from populations \n     and areas affected; and\n       Whereas, assistance to all persons affected by these \n     disasters should be impartially distributed by the state and \n     federal governments, as all persons affected by hurricane \n     damages have suffered similar losses, such as flooded houses, \n     loss of homes, and loss of jobs and businesses, and are all \n     affected in the same manner, whether their residences or \n     businesses are located in heavily populated areas or are \n     included in larger areas of their respective parishes that \n     were affected by such storm damage, and they should be \n     compensated in the same manner; and\n       Whereas, FEMA assistance to those so severely affected by \n     hurricane damage, no matter which parish their property is \n     located in, should also include funding assistance for the \n     demolition and removal of damaged buildings: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request President George W. Bush, Governor Kathleen \n     Babineaux Blanco, and the Louisiana congressional delegation \n     to ensure enactment of legislation to require the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency to provide the same level of \n     assistance to the residents of Iberia, Beauregard, Allen, \n     Evangeline, Calcasieu, Jefferson Davis, Acadia, St. Landry, \n     St. Martin, Lafayette, Cameron, Vermilion, and St. Mary \n     parishes who were affected by Hurricane Rita as the residents \n     of Louisiana affected by Hurricane Katrina, including funding \n     assistance with demolition and removal of damaged housing; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     Governor of Louisiana, the members of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation, and the governing authority of each \n     parish within the declared disaster area following Hurricane \n     Rita.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-266. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to \n     immediately close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and \n     return the area to essential coastal wetlands and marshes; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 24\n\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO), a \n     seventy-six-mile, manmade navigational channel which connects \n     the Gulf of Mexico to the Port of New Orleans along the \n     Mississippi River, was authorized by the United States \n     Congress under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1956 as a \n     channel with a surface width of six hundred fifty feet, a \n     bottom width of five hundred feet, and a depth of thirty-six \n     feet, and it opened in 1965; and\n       Whereas, since MRGO was completed, the Army Corps of \n     Engineers estimates that the area has lost nearly three \n     thousand two hundred acres of fresh and intermediate marsh, \n     more than ten thousand three hundred acres of brackish marsh, \n     four thousand two hundred acres of saline marsh, and one \n     thousand five hundred acres of cypress swamps and levee \n     forests in addition to major habitat alterations due to \n     saltwater intrusion from the loss of the marshes, which has \n     resulted in dramatic declines in waterfowl and quadruped use \n     of the marshes; and;\n       Whereas, the costs of maintaining MRGO rise each year, with \n     the cost of dredging now over twenty-five million dollars \n     annual1y, or more than thirteen thousand dollars for each \n     vessel-passage, in addition to the expenditure of millions \n     for shoreline stabilization and marsh protection projects, \n     with an anticipated cost increase of fifty-two percent \n     between 1995 and 2005; and\n       Whereas, concerns about the environmental impact have \n     increased through the years as evidenced by the fact that in \n     1998 the ``Coast 2050 Report'' contained closure of MRGO \n     among the consensus recommendations, and the technical \n     committee of the Coastal Wetland Planning, Preservation and \n     Restoration Act Task Force listed closure as one of the \n     highest-ranked strategies for coastal restoration; and\n       Whereas, with the waterway increasing from its original \n     authorized dimensions to a surface width of twenty-two \n     hundred feet and a depth of over forty feet, in 1998 the St. \n     Bernard Police Jury voted unanimously to request closure of \n     the waterway because of fears that the dramatic loss of \n     coastal wetlands and marshes caused by MRGO exposed the \n     parish and the communities in the parish to much more severe \n     impacts from the hurricanes and tropical storms that \n     regularly occur in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, those concerns were echoed and amplified by \n     scientists, engineers, and citizens throughout the region as \n     reflected in requests from the Louisiana Legislature to \n     congress in 1999 (SCR No. 266) and again in 2004 (HCR No. 35 \n     and HCR No. 68) to close the waterway, and indeed, those \n     concerns proved true in an extremely dramatic fashion on \n     August 29,2005, when Hurricane Katrina washed ashore on \n     Louisiana's coast with a tidal surge well in excess of twenty \n     feet; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing consensus that the flooding \n     that occurred in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward \n     of New Orleans was a result of storm surge that flowed up \n     MRGO to the point where it converges with the Intracoastal \n     Waterway and that the confluence created a funnel that \n     directed the storm surges into the New Orleans Industrial \n     Canal, where it overtopped the levees along MRGO and the \n     Industrial Canal and eventually breached the levees and \n     flooded into the neighborhoods that lie close to those three \n     waterways, resulting in more than eleven hundred deaths in \n     the Greater New Orleans area, destroying over twenty-four \n     thousand homes, and rendering more than sixty-seven thousand \n     residents of St. Bernard Parish and uncounted numbers in the \n     Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans homeless, without \n     possessions, and unemployed; and\n       Whereas, only three weeks later, on September 24, 2005, \n     storm waters from Hurricane Rita surged up MRGO and caused \n     additional flooding in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth \n     Ward of New Orleans, exacerbating the traumatic losses in \n     that area; and\n       Whereas, since the two hurricanes caused such widespread \n     damage in St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans, congress has \n     declined to appropriate further funds for dredging MRGO; and\n       Whereas, some engineers have opined that the current base \n     along MRGO was damaged to the point where it will not support \n     a Category 3 levee in the future; and\n       Whereas, the cessation of dredging is not enough, the \n     coastal wetlands and marshes which protect St. Bernard Parish \n     and New Orleans must also be reestablished; and\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River is continually dredged to \n     ensure safe passage for large\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n     ocean-going vessels and that dredge material from the \n     Mississippi River could be piped into the marshes of St. \n     Bernard Parish to encourage and allow the regrowth of coastal \n     wetlands and marshes which in turn would protect the citizens \n     returning to St. Bernard Parish, the Lower Ninth Ward, and \n     New Orleans East; and\n       Whereas, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has \n     stated that it has no authorization from congress to close \n     the waterway or to make any attempt to return the coastal \n     wetlands and marshes to their pre-waterway status or even to \n     fill the waterway to allow for the development of marshes and \n     wetlands; and\n       Whereas, as the only entity which can authorize the \n     waterway to be closed and which can enable the \n     reestablishment of our essential coastal wetlands, the United \n     States Congress must come to the aid of the citizens of \n     Louisiana, particularly those of St. Bernard Parish and New \n     Orleans by authorizing the immediate closure of MRGO and the \n     reestablishment of coastal wetlands and marshes in the area \n     around Lake Borgne and throughout St. Bernard Parish and New \n     Orleans East; and\n       Whereas, it is the responsibility of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation to file the necessary legislation to \n     accomplish the immediate closure of MRGO and the return of \n     the essential coastal wetlands and marshes to St. Bernard \n     Parish: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to immediately close MRGO and return the \n     area to essential coastal wetlands and marshes and to \n     memorialize the Louisiana congressional delegation to file \n     the necessary legislation to accomplish this closure; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-267. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to close the \n     Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 32\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana is losing its valuable coastal wetlands \n     at an alarming rate; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has initiated an aggressive program to \n     reduce the rate of wetlands loss; and\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet was six hundred \n     feet wide and thirty-six feet deep when it first opened for \n     operation in 1968, but it now exceeds two thousand feet in \n     width in some areas due to severe bank line erosion; and\n       Whereas, the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet has caused \n     enormous wetland losses since its construction, including the \n     loss of over eighteen thousand acres of wetlands since 1968; \n     and\n       Whereas, the dredging of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet \n     and the failure of the United States Army Corps of Engineers \n     to construct tidal surge barriers or to repair previous \n     environmental damage caused by the Mississippi River Gulf \n     Outlet is inconsistent with the intent of the Breaux Act and \n     the Coastal 2050 plan; and\n       Whereas, over the last five years the number of vessels \n     that use the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet has decreased from \n     six hundred fifty-seven vessels to three hundred four vessels \n     per year; and\n       Whereas, the cost of the annual dredging of the Mississippi \n     River Gulf Outlet continues to rise and currently the yearly \n     cost is twenty-two million dollars; and\n       Whereas, fears about the impact of the loss of coastal \n     wetlands and coastal marsh proved true in an extremely \n     dramatic fashion on August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina \n     washed ashore on Louisiana's coast with a tidal surge well in \n     excess of twenty feet; and\n       Whereas, there is a growing consensus that the flooding \n     that occurred in St. Bernard Parish, New Orleans East, and \n     the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans was a result of storm \n     surge that flowed up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet to the \n     point where it converges with the Intracoastal Waterway and \n     that the confluence created a funnel that directed the storm \n     surges into the New Orleans Industrial Canal, where it \n     overtopped the levees along the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet \n     and the Industrial Canal and eventually breached the levees \n     and flooded into the neighborhoods that lie close to those \n     three waterways, resulting in a yet uncounted number of \n     deaths and rendering sixty-seven thousand residents of St. \n     Bernard Parish and uncounted numbers in New Orleans East and \n     the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans homeless, without \n     possessions, and unemployed; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of Hurricane Katrina, the United \n     States Congress has delayed the approval of funding for \n     dredging the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet to the depth \n     maintained prior to the passage of the storm, and there \n     appears to be no movement in the congress to provide further \n     funds for such dredging: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to close the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-268. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to taking \n     immediate action to provide federal financial assistance to \n     aid Louisiana's recovery following the devastation caused by \n     hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to expeditiously complete the \n     needed repair to the levee system in the greater New Orleans \n     area, to provide for the prompt construction of hurricane and \n     tidal water protection for south Louisiana, and to provide \n     assistance with coastal restoration and marsh management; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, in August and September 2005, Louisiana was \n     decimated by multiple hurricanes striking the state--\n     hurricanes Katrina and Rita--a combination of natural \n     disasters of unprecedented proportions in American history, a \n     burden no state has ever had to bear, including but not \n     limited to loss of life, livelihoods, and homes, a negative \n     impact on the state's economy and the earning power of the \n     state's citizens and businesses in countless ways, \n     destruction and damage to public buildings and other public \n     works, damage to its levee system and the coastal wetlands \n     and coastline; and\n       Whereas, during the devastation wreaked by hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, certain forces of the Louisiana National \n     Guard were not available to provide assistance at home due to \n     their deployment to Iraq, in which call to arms Louisiana has \n     suffered one of the highest casualty rates in the nation \n     while its troops proudly serve their state and their country; \n     and\n       Whereas, the citizens, businesses, communities, schools, \n     and governments of Louisiana have suffered tremendous loss, \n     as reflected in an economic downturn which has affected the \n     state fisc such that the state was faced with nearly a one \n     billion dollar operating deficit; and\n       Whereas, the ramifications of these events continue to \n     affect every citizen of the state as the destruction and \n     continuing interruption of business, industry, and \n     infrastructure in these areas has severely reduced the \n     state's revenue stream by over one-third; and\n       Whereas, the interruption of essential public services, \n     particularly in the areas of health care, education, and \n     infrastructure, has profoundly affected the quality of life \n     in the state; and\n       Whereas, the state's Revenue Estimating Conference has \n     projected next fiscal year's revenue forecast to show a \n     deficit of nine hundred seventy million dollars, requiring \n     massive budget reductions to comply with the state \n     constitution that requires a balanced budget; and\n       Whereas, the coastal zone of Louisiana is of vital \n     importance to the nation in oil and gas production and \n     fisheries production; and\n       Whereas, prior to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the state of \n     Louisiana accounted for thirty percent of the commercial \n     fisheries production of the lower forty-eight states, and \n     ranked second in the nation for recreational harvest of \n     saltwater fish; and\n       Whereas, prior to hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana \n     produced more than 80% of the nation's offshore oil and gas \n     supply and provided billions of dollars each year to the \n     federal treasury, while subjecting the Louisiana coastline to \n     damaging and long-term impacts from these activities; and\n       Whereas, the communities in south Louisiana that support \n     these industries are subject to potential flooding from \n     tropical storms and hurricanes; and\n       Whereas, the destruction of communities and industries in \n     south Louisiana by hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated \n     the critical need for prompt action to provide tidal \n     protection in south Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, through executive order and legislative action, \n     Louisiana has made a coordinated effort to balance its budget \n     by reductions in the amount of approximately six hundred \n     million dollars; by withdrawing one hundred fifty-four \n     million dollars from the state's ``Rainy Day'' fund; and by \n     depositing the 2004 Fiscal Year surplus of two hundred fifty \n     million dollars into the ``Rainy Day'' fund, thereby enabling \n     the movement of one hundred eighty-nine million dollars to \n     the State General Fund for budget reduction purposes; and\n       Whereas, the governor has issued an executive order \n     directing a spending freeze in the executive branch of state \n     government, which remains in effect; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Recovery Authority has been \n     established as the state entity to recommend policy, \n     planning, and resource allocation affecting programs and \n     services for the recovery; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority \n     has been created as the single state agency to provide \n     aggressive state leadership, direction, and consonance in the \n     development and implementation of policies, plans, and \n     programs to achieve comprehensive coastal protection, \n     including the encouragement of multiple uses of the coastal \n     zone and to achieve a proper balance between development and \n     conservation, the restoration, creation, and nourishment of \n     renewable coastal resources, including but not limited to \n     coastal wetlands and barrier\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n     shorelines or reefs, through the construction and management \n     of coastal wetlands enhancement projects, marsh management \n     projects or plans, and to provide direction and development \n     of the state's comprehensive master coastal protection plan, \n     working in conjunction with state agencies, political \n     subdivisions, including levee districts, and federal \n     agencies; representing the state's position in policy \n     implementation relative to the protection, conservation, and \n     restoration of the coastal area of the state; and providing \n     oversight of coastal restoration and hurricane protection \n     projects and programs; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, \n     in response to communications from the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation and in accordance with the \n     requirements of the Department of Defense, Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf \n     of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act of2006, has been \n     authorized and empowered to carry out any and all functions \n     necessary to serve as the single entity responsible to act as \n     the local sponsor for construction, operation and maintenance \n     of all of the hurricane, storm damage reduction and flood \n     control projects in areas under its jurisdiction, including \n     the greater New Orleans and southeast Louisiana area; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority \n     is empowered to enter into contracts with the federal \n     government or any federal agency or any political subdivision \n     of the state or private individual for the construction, \n     operation, or maintenance of any coastal restoration, \n     hurricane, storm damage reduction, or flood control project \n     and to this end, may contract for the acceptance of any grant \n     of money upon the terms and conditions, including any \n     requirement of matching the grants in whole or part, which \n     may be necessary; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana has enacted \n     legislation which, upon approval by the voters of this state, \n     will consolidate certain levee districts and parishes into \n     regional flood protection authorities to govern levee \n     districts included in the authority and to establish on its \n     own behalf or for the areas or the levee districts under its \n     authority adequate drainage, flood control, and water \n     resources development, including but not limited to the \n     planning, maintenance, operation, and construction of \n     reservoirs, diversion canals, gravity and pump drainage \n     systems, erosion control measures, marsh management, coastal \n     restoration, and other flood control works as such \n     activities, facilities, and improvements relate to tidewater \n     flooding, hurricane protection, and saltwater intrusion; and\n       Whereas, the state, with its limited and severely impacted \n     resources, has taken these, and numerous other, proactive \n     steps toward recovery and addressing the needs of the state's \n     citizens and communities; however, additional, immediate, and \n     continuing federal assistance is needed; and\n       Whereas, in a time of great and unprecedented tragedy, a \n     state that has given so much to the rest of our country is in \n     dire need of the continuing and focused assistance and \n     support of our nation, through its federal government, for \n     the full recovery of Louisiana's citizens and infrastructure: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take immediate action to \n     provide federal financial assistance to aid Louisiana's \n     recovery following the devastation caused by hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, to expeditiously complete the needed repair \n     to the levee system in the greater New Orleans area, to \n     provide for the prompt construction of hurricane and tidal \n     water protection for south Louisiana, and to provide \n     assistance with coastal restoration and marsh management; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-269.

Under the \n     McCarran Ferguson Act of 1945, state legislatures are the \n     proper governmental entity to determine public policy on \n     insurance issues. State legislatures are more responsive to \n     the needs of their constituents and are more knowledgeable \n     regarding the market conditions that exist in their states \n     and regarding the need for unique insurance products and \n     regulation to meet their specific market demands; and\n       Whereas, State legislatures and such organizations as the \n     National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL), the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), and the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) \n     recognize that in certain states marketplace difficulties \n     have created regulatory hurdles or delayed speed-to-market \n     processing of insurance products. To solve these problems, \n     state legislatures, NCOIL, NCSL, and NAlC continue to address \n     uniformity issues among states through the adoption of model \n     laws that address market conduct, product approval, agent \n     licensing, and rate deregulation; and\n       Whereas, Many state governments derive general revenue \n     dollars from the regulation of the insurance industry. In \n     Michigan, the insurance industry paid more than $241 million \n     in state premium taxes in 2004; and\n       Whereas, The federal State Modernization and Regulatory \n     Transparency (SMART) Act would create mandatory federal \n     insurance standards preempting state law and undermining \n     state sovereignty. By federalizing insurance regulation, this \n     legislation would threaten the power of state legislatures, \n     governors, insurance commissioners, and attorneys general to \n     oversee, regulate, and investigate the insurance industry, \n     impairing, eroding, and/or limiting their ability to protect \n     the interests of their constituents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to oppose the State \n     Modernization and Regulatory Transparency (SMART) Act; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial \n     Services, the members of the United States Senate Committee \n     on Finance, and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-275.

Bush, in an address before the \n     United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 2004, \n     stated, ``At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible \n     suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, \n     crimes my government has concluded are genocide''; and\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\n       Whereas, As a stabilizing force, the United States has an \n     obligation to promote peace in the region and to work with \n     other foreign governments to end the genocide in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 126th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, wish to focus attention on the \n     killing of tens of thousands of civilians at the hands of the \n     armed belligerents; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 126th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, encourage the President of the \n     United States and the Congress of the United States to \n     continue supporting the humanitarian efforts of international \n     aid groups to relieve the suffering of those who have been \n     affected by the genocide occurring in the Darfur region of \n     Sudan, to protect the workers of those aid groups, to \n     encourage foreign governments to provide water, food, \n     shelter, and medical care to those suffering in Darfur, and \n     to lead multilateral efforts to bring those responsible for \n     the egregious human rights violations to justice; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 126th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, encourage Ohio companies and \n     institutions, multinational corporations operating in Ohio, \n     and agencies and political subdivisions of the state to \n     divest themselves of interests in any companies that conduct \n     business in Sudan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the United States Secretary \n     of State, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of \n     the United States Senate, the members of the Ohio \n     Congressional delegation, and the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-276. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to amending the No Child Left Behind Act; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires that \n     paraprofessionals who are employed in Title I schools meet \n     high standards of qualification and requires that students \n     who need the most help receive instructional support only \n     from qualified paraprofessionals; and\n       Whereas, for the purposes of No Child Left Behind, a \n     paraprofessional is defined as a school employee who provides \n     instructional support in a program supported with federal \n     funds pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act; and\n       Whereas, this definition includes a paraprofessional who \n     provides instructional support in any manner as follows:\n       (1) Provides one-on-one tutoring if such tutoring is \n     scheduled at a time when a student would not otherwise \n     receive instruction from a teacher;\n       (2) Assists with classroom management such as organizing \n     instructional and other materials;\n       (3) Provides instructional assistance in a computer \n     laboratory;\n       (4) Conducts parental involvement activities;\n       (5) Provides support in a library or media center;\n       (6) Acts as a translator; and\n       (7) Provides instructional support services under the \n     direct supervision of a teacher; and\n       Whereas, in compliance with the requirements of No Child \n     Left Behind, Louisiana has developed different pathways for \n     paraprofessionals who are employed in Title I schools to \n     choose from in order to meet the definition of ``highly \n     qualified''; and\n       Whereas, these choices include taking forty-eight semester \n     hours of relevant course work or taking and passing a \n     paraprofessional academic assessment instrument; and\n       Whereas, these choices and the requirements of No Child \n     Left Behind do not take into consideration the fact that some \n     of these paraprofessionals were employed in public school \n     systems prior to the enactment of No Child Left Behind and \n     have many years of experience serving in such capacity; and\n       Whereas, there are concerns among many about the financial \n     burden that the requirements of No Child Left Behind place \n     upon paraprofessionals who receive minimal salaries and \n     cannot afford the college courses, test preparation, or test \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, although many local school systems in Louisiana \n     are assisting paraprofessionals in paying these costs, there \n     are other issues involved that make these requirements \n     extremely difficult, if not impossible, for some \n     paraprofessionals to meet--especially those who work in rural \n     areas of the state and may not have access to postsecondary \n     education; and\n       Whereas, these burdens have resulted in the loss of many \n     paraprofessionals from the public schools in this state who \n     have been forced to seek other types of employment; and\n       Whereas, paraprofessionals employed in Title I schools play \n     a very important role in improving student achievement and \n     many of them have been employed in such schools for a number \n     of years and their experience and expertise in their jobs is \n     a tremendous asset to public education; and\n       Whereas, because the legislature values these employees for \n     the crucial role they play in public education and wants to \n     keep them in our public schools where they can continue to \n     make a difference in students' lives, it is imperative that \n     all steps necessary be taken to remove these burdens which \n     are forcing many of the more experienced and qualified \n     paraprofessionals to leave the public education system: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to amend the No Child Left Behind Act to \n     provide that paraprofessionals who were employed in Title I \n     schools prior to the enactment of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act shall be deemed to have met the definition of ``highly \n     qualified'' for purposes of such legislation due to such \n     employment and the experience gained as a result of such \n     employment; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-277. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to enacting legislation reauthorizing the \n     Ryan White Care Act to provide comprehensive care for the \n     neediest victims of HIV/AIDS; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 95\n\n       Whereas, The numbers of children, youth, and particularly \n     young women who are infected with HIV or have developed AIDS \n     are increasing. In the United States, more than 9,000 \n     children under the age of thirteen are living with HIV/AIDS. \n     Of the nearly 40,000 Americans infected every year with HIV, \n     nearly fifteen percent are under twenty-five years of age. \n     Among the newly infected in the age group of thirteen to \n     nineteen, fifty-eight percent are women; and\n       Whereas, Children and young people infected with HIV and \n     living with AIDS have unique needs for specialized medical \n     services and psychosocial support. Programs funded under the \n     Ryan White CARE Act successfully deliver family-centered, \n     coordinated health care and support services for women, \n     children, youth and families. These programs have played a \n     significant role in reducing the number of mother-to-child \n     HIV infections from 2,000 to fewer than 200 per year; and\n       Whereas, Recent patterns in the United States show that \n     HIV/AIDS increasingly affects African Americans, Latinos, and \n     other racial and ethnic minorities. In 2004, minorities \n     accounted for almost three-fourths of new cases of AIDS in an \n     HIV/AIDS surveillance report by the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC). Of these newly identified AIDS \n     patients, 48 percent were African Americans and 21 percent \n     were Latinos. The rate also continued to rise among women, \n     who accounted for 27 percent of new AIDS cases in 2004. Of \n     these women newly diagnosed with AIDS, 67 percent were \n     African Americans and 15 percent were Latinas; and\n       Whereas, In his State of the Union address, President \n     George W. Bush supported reauthorization of the Ryan White \n     CARE Act to encourage prevention of HIV/AIDS and provide care \n     and treatment for the neediest HIV/AIDS victims. The \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services proposed five guiding \n     principles to reauthorize the Act. First, serve the neediest \n     victims of HIV/AIDS. Second, focus on delivering life-saving \n     and life-extending services. Third, increase prevention \n     efforts through more routine testing. Fourth, increase the \n     accountability of states and organizations receiving federal \n     funds. Fifth, give the federal government flexibility to \n     reallocate unspent funds. By following these principles, care \n     will be delivered to the neediest patients that will help \n     them live longer and healthier lives: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation reauthorizing the Ryan \n     White CARE Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-278.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to advance \nmedical research and treatments into pediatric cancers, ensure patients \nand families have access to the current treatments and information \nregarding pediatric cancers, establish a population-based national \nchildhood cancer database, and promote public awareness of pediatric \ncancers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nmy legislation, the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2006, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Conquer Childhood Cancer Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cancer kills more children than any other disease.\n       (2) Each year cancer kills more children between 1 and 20 \n     years of age than asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and \n     AIDS, combined.\n       (3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with \n     cancer.\n       (4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from \n     cancer.\n       (5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age \n     20.\n       (6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so \n     resistant that even in spite of the great research strides \n     made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the \n     children with cancer can now be cured.\n       (7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.\n       (8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood \n     cells (leukemia's), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and \n     tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of \n     these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an \n     uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.\n       (9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with \n     cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites \n     in the body.\n       (10) Ninety percent of children with a form of pediatric \n     cancer are treated at one of the more than 200 Children's \n     Oncology Group member institutions throughout the United \n     States\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to authorize appropriations \n     to--\n       (1) encourage and expand the support for biomedical \n     research programs of the existing National Cancer Institute-\n     designated multi-center national infrastructure for pediatric \n     cancer research;\n       (2) establish a population-based national childhood cancer \n     database (the Children's Cancer Research Network) to evaluate \n     incidence trends of childhood cancers and to enable the \n     investigations of genetic epidemiology in order to identify \n     causes to aid in development of prevention strategies;\n       (3) provide informational services to patients and families \n     affected by childhood cancer;\n       (4) support the development, construction and operation of \n     a comprehensive online public information system on childhood \n     cancers and services available to families; and\n       (5) establish a fellowship program in pediatric cancer \n     research to foster clinical and translational research career \n     development in pediatric oncologists in the early stages of \n     their career.\n\n     SEC. 4. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n       Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end thereof the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 417E. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH AND AWARENESS.\n\n       ``(a) Pediatric Cancer Research.--\n       ``(1) Special programs of research excellence in pediatric \n     cancers.--The Director of NIH, acting through the National \n     Cancer Institute, shall establish special programs of \n     research excellence in the area of pediatric cancers.

Funds \n     appropriated under this section shall remain available until \n     expended.''.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Coleman, in \nintroducing the Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. I would also like to \nrecognize Senators Talent, Isakson, Cochran, Bunning, Murkowski, \nLieberman, Carper, Landrieu, and Lautenberg who have all joined as \noriginal cosponsors of the bill.\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to achieve several important goals \nin our battle against childhood cancer. Specifically, it will expand \nsupport for pediatric cancer research, foster the career development of \nmore pediatric oncologists, and provide essential information and \nsupport to help families deal with this devastating disease. Childhood \ncancer impacts thousands of children and their families each year. \nWhile we have made great steps in treating cancer, we have made \nrelatively little progress in advancing our understanding of the most \ncommon forms of pediatric cancer. This legislation will help to provide \nresources to hopefully one day find a cure.\n  Each year, more than 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer, and \nmore than 2,000 of them lose their courageous battle with the disease. \nPediatric cancer not only takes a toll on the child, it affects the \nentire family--the parents, siblings, friends, and extended family all \nsuffer when a child has cancer. I have had the honor of meeting one \nsuch family from Warwick, Rhode Island who has taken the pain and \ndevastation of losing their young son to neuroblastoma, a very \naggressive childhood cancer, and turned their tragedy into a message of \nhope. The Haight family is committed, in memory of their nine year old \nson Ben, to education, advocacy, and lending support to other families \ngoing through a similar struggle with pediatric cancer. I never had a \nchance to meet Ben Haight but his mother Nancy has told me of his \ntremendous strength and courage. Ben fought every day during his four \nand a half year battle with this disease and his tragic story \nhighlights the importance of this legislation.\n  It is my hope that the bill we are introducing today will help to \nstep up our efforts with regard to childhood cancer so that one day \nBen's story, and thousands of other children like him, will be one of \nsurvival. In Rhode Island alone, a dozen children each year succumb to \nvarious forms of childhood cancer. Each of these children had hopes, \ndreams, and desires that will never be fulfilled and one cannot \nquantify the impact each of these children could have had on their \ncommunities and on society as a whole. We need to be doing more to give \nthese children a chance to grow up and reach their full potential.\n  The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act will enhance federal efforts in the \nfight against childhood cancer and will also complement the incredible \nwork of private organizations dedicated to the prevention and cure of \npediatric cancer. I would like to commend the CureSearch National \nChildhood Cancer Foundation for its work in this area. CureSearch \nbrings together academic and research institutions, medical \nprofessionals with expertise in pediatric cancer, and children and \nfamilies afflicted with the disease, to form a national network \ncommitted to research, treatment, and cures for childhood cancer.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues toward swift passage of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2395. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to require \nthat air carriers accept as mail shipments certain live animals; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould address the concerns related to the shipping of live birds \nthrough the United States Postal Service. I introduced a similar bill \nduring the 107th Congress with bi-partisan support. It was included in \nPublic Law 107-67.\n  This bill should close some loopholes that some of the airlines are \nusing to avoid the timely shipping of day-old baby chicks.\n  Some members of the airline industry stated that they commonly and \nregularly refuse to transport shipments of some species of live animals \nfor its regularly scheduled cargo service and, therefore, can refuse to \ncarry any live animals by mail under existing law. My bill will make \nthe law apply to ``any air carrier that commonly and regularly carries \nany live animals as cargo,'' thus making sure that if the air carrier \ndoes ship any live animals as cargo, it will be required to ship \nanimals as mail.\n  There have been accusations that the shipping of day-old poultry \ncould spread avian influenza. I have received information from Avian \nHealth Veterinarians and they have informed me that avian influenza is \nnot an egg transmitted disease. There are no reports of day-old poultry \nfrom infected breeders being infected with avian influenza when they \nhatch.\n  Poultry health specialists have been examining the vertical \ntransmission, or parents-to-chicks via the egg of avian influenza, for \nmore than 30 years. Studies looking at the avian influenza have \nconsistently failed to reveal evidence of avian influenza virus \ninfections in newly hatched chicks from infected parent flocks.\n  This clearly shows that day-old poultry are not likely to be \nnaturally infected. So the risk of transmitting avian influenza through \nshipment of day-old poultry is not an issue.\n  This bill would also address two other problems that have caused an \nadverse economic impact to bird shippers. First, the bill requires air \ncarriers that take poultry as mail, to transfer such shipments so that \nthe shipper is guaranteed that the shipment will reach its ultimate \ndestination.\n  Second, it requires an air carrier to take shipments of poultry as \nair mail when the outside temperature is between 0 degrees Fahrenheit \n-17 degrees Celsius and 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.77 degrees Celsius \nfrom point of origin of the shipment through the point of destination. \nThese temperature parameters are accepted by avian veterinarians as \nsafe and humane.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONTRACTS FOR TRANSPORTATION OF MAIL BY AIR.\n\n       Section 5402(e)(2)(A) of title 39, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence--\n       (A) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(2)(A)''; and\n       (B) in clause (i) (as designated by subparagraph (A)), by \n     striking ``may'' and inserting ``shall''; and\n       (2) by striking the second sentence and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(ii) A shipment described in clause (i) shall include the \n     transfer of any cargo described in that clause from the point \n     of origin of the shipment to the point of destination.\n       ``(iii) An air carrier shall accept and carry cargo \n     described in clause (i) when the outside temperature is \n     between 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17.77 degrees Celsius) and 100 \n     degrees Fahrenheit (37.77 degrees Celsius) from point of \n     origin through the point of destination.\n       ``(iv) The authority of the Postal Service under this \n     subparagraph shall apply to any air carrier that commonly and \n     regularly carries any live animals as cargo.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2397. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish long-term care trust accounts and allow a refundable tax \ncredit for contributions to such accounts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare Trust Account Act of 2006. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln.\n  In the past few years the notion of estate planning has taken on a \nnegative connotation. I am here to introduce a bill that will focus on \nthe positive side of planning for one's future.\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am \ncommitted to improving the financing and delivery of long-term care. \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that national \nspending for long-term care was almost $160 billion in 2002, \nrepresenting about 12 percent of all personal health care expenditures. \nWhile those numbers are already staggering we also know that the need \nfor long-term care is expected to grow significantly in coming decades. \nAlmost two-thirds of people receiving long-term care are over age 65, \nwith this number expected to double by 2030.\n  For many individuals it will be necessary to find a way to either \nsave for the care needed or purchase long-term care insurance. Long-\nterm care insurance protects assets and income from the devastating \nfinancial consequences of long-term health care costs. Today's \ncomprehensive long-term care insurance policies allow consumers to \nchoose from a variety of benefits and offer a wide range of coverage \nchoices. They allow individuals to receive care in a variety of \nsettings including nursing homes, home care, assisted living facilities \nand adult day care. Some of the most recent policies also provide a \ncash benefit that a consumer can spend in the manner he or she chooses. \nLastly, long-term care insurance allows individuals to take personal \nresponsibility for their long-term health care needs and reduces the \nstrain on state Medicaid budgets. Unfortunately, for many the struggle \nto pay the immediate costs of long-term care insurance sometimes \noutweighs the security these products provide.\n  With our national savings rate in steady decline I fear the American \nmiddle class is woefully unprepared to meet the coming challenges of \ntheir long-term care needs. As we move forward in our effort to help \nindividuals stay financially stable in their later years, we must \nencourage them to purchase long-term care insurance and save for long-\nterm care services. The Long-Term Care Trust Account Act of 2006 \nachieves both goals. My legislation will create a new type of savings \nvehicle for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated with \nlong-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. An \nindividual who establishes a long-term care trust account can \ncontribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a \nrefundable ten percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest \naccrued on these accounts will be tax free, and funds can be withdrawn \nfor the purchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term \ncare services. The bill will also allow an individual to make \ncontributions to another person's Long-Term Care Trust Account. This \nwill help many relatives in our country that want to help their parents \nor a loved one prepare for their health care needs.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for \ntheir long-term care needs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to support this important bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 2398. A bill to establish an Advanced Research Projects \nAdministration-Energy to initiate high risk, innovative energy research \nto improve the energy security of the United States, to extend certain \nenergy tax incentives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the years when I first began to serve \nin Congress, America faced severe problems with supplies of oil. For \nyears, long gas lines, frustration, and questions about the security of \nour oil supply drove the public debate.\n  Thirty years have passed. And, frankly, things have not changed all \nthat much. We still use gasoline and coal at staggering rates. And we \nare still concerned about the security of our oil supply. We do not \nhave lines at gas stations. But last year, prices rose to levels \nunimaginable just a few years ago.\n  Prices for gasoline, heating oil, electricity, and natural gas have \nsoared in recent years, hitting working families hard. In the past few \nweeks, we have seen a terrorist attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.\n  We have seen oil workers kidnapped in Nigeria. We have seen \nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez threaten that he would cut off our \nsupply of oil from his country. And we have seen some question whether \nIran's role as an oil supplier keeps other countries from properly \naddressing Iran's threat to nuclear proliferation.\n  Energy provides one of America's greatest challenges for the 21st \ncentury. Our economy has been dependent on oil and coal for about 100 \nyears. And since World War II, natural gas has become part of the \nequation. Will we continue this dependency for the next 100 years?\n  The cost of energy will profoundly affect the future competitiveness \nof the American economy. As the Chinese and Indian economies grow, so \nwill their demand for energy. And that will add further upward pressure \nto energy prices.\n  To respond to the challenges of the new world economy, I am \nintroducing legislation in seven key areas to build a foundation for a \nmore competitive America. We must improve education, health care, trade \nlaw enforcement, the tax code, and savings. And we must bring a greater \nfocus to energy research and development. Today, I introduce the Energy \nCompetitiveness Act of 2006.\n  We are trapped in an energy box. It is a box characterized by high \nimports, ever-increasing prices for oil and natural gas, and \nenvironmental danger. We must experiment with ways to break out of that \nbox. To break out, we need an energy research effort modeled after the \nManhattan Project, or the Apollo mission to the moon.\n  America has a brilliant record of gathering the best minds. We meet \nchallenges that may at first seem to be impossible. During World War \nII, the Manhattan Project brought together brilliant physicists and \nengineers to build an atomic bomb in 3 short years. And after President\n  Kennedy described his vision to a joint session of Congress in May of \n1961, the Apollo space program put a man on the moon in just 8 years.\n  Looking back, these achievements were stunning. Both projects started \nout with no guarantee of success. Each could have ended in utter \nfailure. Yet because of the talent, ingenuity, and focus of creative \nminds, they both succeeded.\n  Breaking out of the energy box poses a similar challenge. Success is \nnot guaranteed. But we have got to give it our best shot.\n  Today I am introducing the Energy Competitiveness Act of 2006. My \nlegislation would create a new energy research agency. It would extend \nkey alternative energy tax relief. It would help our Nation face the \nchallenges of a newly competitive global economy. It would help to move \nus into a new energy future.\n  We have the greatest research scientists on the planet. We have the \nmost technically talented workforce in the world. But we do not have \nthe vigor that we need in energy research. Energy research is a \nbackwater, compared to other research efforts in biotechnology, \nmedicine, computers, and defense-oriented projects.\n  With the Manhattan Project and the Apollo space program, America \nproved that we can gather the best talent for a focused mission and \nsucceed. It is time that we begin a similar effort on energy.\n  We need to create a new agency to initiate cutting-edge, innovative \nenergy research and development aimed at taking us to a new energy \nfuture. Doing so is essential to our effort to improve our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  The new agency is modeled on DARPA--the Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency--in the Department of Defense. Among the revolutionary \ntechnologies that DARPA has developed are the internet and stealth \ntechnology for aircraft. DARPA has been a tremendous success.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of \nEngineering, and the Institute of Medicine joined to form the Committee \non Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century. Norm Augustine \nchaired the Committee. Based on DARPA's achievements, last fall, the \nCommittee recommended the creation of an ARPA-E: Advanced Research \nProjects Agency--Energy.\n  This was one of a number of recommendations that the Committee made \nin its impressive report on the future competitive challenges that \nAmerica faces. The Committee recommended that ARPA-E be designed to\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nconduct transformative, out-of-the-box energy research.\n  My bill proposes that ARPA-E be a small agency with a total of 250 \npeople. A minimum of 180 of them would be technical staff.\n  A director of the agency and four deputies would lead ARPA-E. I \npropose that ARPA-E be funded at $300 million in fiscal year 2007, $600 \nmillion in 2008, $1.1 billion in 2009, $1.5 billion in 2010, and $2.0 \nbillion in 2011.\n  We would require that the staff have a technical background. The \nagency would use the Experimental Personnel Authority designed for \nDARPA. That authority authorizes higher salaries than for typical \nFederal employees, and faster hiring, so that the agency could get to \nwork quickly.\n  To keep the intense, innovative focus that we want, technical staff \nwould be limited to 3 to 4 years at the agency. Managers would be \nlimited to 4 to 6 years. The director could give both groups extended \nterms of employment if the director so chose.\n  For contracts, the agency would use the DARPA procedure. That \nprocedure allows more flexible contracting arrangements than are \nnormally possible under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. To ensure \nthat ARPA-E would conduct innovative research, 75 percent of research \nprojects initiated by ARPA-E would not be peer reviewed.\n  The ARPA-E would be authorized to award cash prizes to encourage and \naccelerate energy research accomplishments.\n  Finally, the bill would require a report by the end of fiscal year \n2007 on whether ARPA-E would need its own energy research lab.\n  The Energy Competitiveness Act would also increase our commitment to \ndevelop promising energy technologies. In the Energy Policy Act of \n2005, last year's Energy bill, we established several important \nincentives to foster new forms of energy production and to encourage \nconservation.\n  America's investment in alternative energy and conservation lags well \nbehind that of other developed countries. The 2005 Energy bill put us \non the right track by expanding the tax credit for electricity from \nrenewable resources. It created incentives for coal gasification \ntechnologies. It encouraged investment in refineries that can handle \nNorth American feedstocks. And it established tax credits for energy-\nefficient buildings and equipment.\n  Unfortunately, these provisions are either short-term or capped at \ninsufficient levels. The Energy Competitiveness Act that I introduce \ntoday would bolster the first steps made in 2005. The bill that I \nintroduce today would extend these important provisions and increase \nthe amount of tax incentives available.\n  The bill would extend through 2010 the tax credit for electricity \nproduced from wind, biomass, geothermal, and other renewable sources. \nIt would also increase the volume caps on Clean Renewable Energy Bonds \nand coal gasification tax credits.\n  The bill would make permanent enhanced depreciation for new refining \ncapacity that is capable of refining non-conventional feedstocks.\n  North America has abundant energy resources that could ease our \ndemand for oil from the Mideast. But today, many of our refineries are \nincapable of processing heavier feedstocks, such as oil from shale or \ntar sands. Making this provision permanent would provide the needed \ncertainty for long-term investments in capital intensive refining \nprojects.\n  The Energy Competitiveness Act that I introduce today would encourage \nbusinesses to purchase alternative fuel and electric vehicles. And it \nwould extend through 2010 many of the incentives from the 2005 bill \nthat promote investment in energy-efficient buildings and equipment.\n  We are seeing exciting new efforts in America to strengthen our \nenergy competitiveness.\n  We need to build on this foundation by creating an aggressive energy \nresearch agency that will push the limits of new technology and \ndiscover alternative energy sources.\n  America has massive coal reserves. So coal gasification is receiving \ngreater attention. Gasification involves breaking down coal under heat \nand pressure to create synthetic natural gas. We must address the \nenvironmental issues. But if this technology can be improved, then \nAmerica will be able to take a huge step toward energy independence.\n  There are exciting developments in wind energy. In Montana, the \nJudith Gap Wind Farm has been generating power at full capacity for \nseveral weeks. The farm includes 90 wind turbines. Each turbine can \nproduce enough electricity for roughly 400 homes.\n  The entire farm can produce the electricity needed to supply 300,000 \ncustomers. Montana was one of nine States that put in place more than \n100 megawatts of wind power generation in 2005. And my State ranks in \nthe top 15 States in the Nation for wind power capacity.\n  Fusion is another possible area where aggressive research could lead \nto huge payoffs. Continuing research will help us to determine whether \nenergy production through fusion is a practical option.\n  Ethanol is also gaining as an alternative energy option. In 2005, \nAmericans invested more than $850 million in ethanol plants. Ford Motor \nCompany has plans for producing 250,000 vehicles in 2006 that will be \nable to use several different types of fuel, including ethanol.\n  Brazil, with the help of ethanol, expects to become energy \nindependent this year. Ethanol accounts for 20 percent of Brazil's fuel \ntransport market. Seven out of every 10 cars in Brazil can run on \nethanol, gasoline, or a mixture of both.\n  In Iceland, all electricity generation is from renewable sources. \nIceland is now taking the next step, and has started an initiative to \nreplace the use of fossil fuels with hydrogen by 2050.\n  To achieve this, in 1999, Icelanders founded a public-private \npartnership called Icelandic New Energy. This partnership is the main \ndriver in hydrogen energy research and implementation in Iceland. \nPublic hydrogen-fueled buses began service in December of last year.\n  And experiments continue with hydrogen-driven consumer motorcycles, \nsmall cars, and fishing boats.\n  We live in a much larger and more complex nation than Iceland or \nBrazil. But we can share their vision of a future fueled by alternative \nenergy and improved conservation.\n  There are also exciting developments in nanotechnology, solar power, \nenergy-efficient materials, biomass, and green buildings.\n  All of these are examples of possible directions for our Nation's \nenergy future. But we need a more aggressive and focused research and \ndevelopment effort to push these alternatives. And we need an effort to \ncreate scientific breakthroughs to supplement existing technologies.\n  We have got to give it our best shot. As President Franklin Roosevelt \nsaid, we must conduct ``bold, persistent experimentation.''\n  Our economic security is at stake. Our ability to compete in the new \nworld economy is at stake.\n  ARPA-E will help us move forward on existing technologies. It will \nhelp us to find new technologies that are not even imaginable today. \nAnd the tax incentives will keep us on the right track until more \ndramatic breakthroughs occur.\n  I urge my colleagues to look closely at this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 395\n\n       Whereas the economy and future of the United States depend \n     on maintaining a highly skilled and educated workforce with \n     the ability to compete in an increasingly high-tech global \n     economy;\n       Whereas millions of hard-working middle-class families now \n     struggle to afford the rising cost of higher education, which \n     averages $12,127 per year at a public 4-year college and \n     $29,026 per year at a private 4-year college for the 2005-\n     2006 school year;\n       Whereas between 2000 and 2005, the cost of tuition and fees \n     increased 57 percent at public 4-year colleges and 32 percent \n     at private 4-year colleges;\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\n       Whereas during the 1985-1986 school year, the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant covered 55 percent of the cost of tuition, \n     fees, room and board at a public 4-year college, but during \n     the 2005-2006 school year the maximum Federal Pell Grant \n     covers only 33 percent of such cost, leaving today's students \n     burdened with more debt or unable to afford a college \n     education at all;\n       Whereas at the same time that college costs are rising \n     substantially, President Bush recently signed into law the \n     largest cut in student loan programs in the history of the \n     Nation and now proposes a budget for fiscal year 2007 that \n     would eliminate new funding for Federal Perkins Loans and \n     freeze the maximum Federal Pell Grant award at $4,050, where \n     the maximum Federal Pell Grant has been since 2003, reducing \n     the real value of the maximum Federal Pell Grant to the \n     families who depend upon it;\n       Whereas the President's budget also breaks promises to our \n     children, their parents, and their schools;\n       Whereas school districts must meet tough new standards \n     under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-\n     110; 115 Stat. 1425), but the President's budget underfunds \n     this effort by $15,400,000,000;\n       Whereas all children deserve an education that will prepare \n     them for the 21st century global economy, but the President \n     is proposing to leave 3,700,000 children behind by failing to \n     fully fund title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) at the level promised in \n     the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001;\n       Whereas in 1975 Congress committed to fully funding the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n     et seq.), in order to provide an appropriate education to \n     students with special needs, yet for the second year in a row \n     the President's budget retreats on that commitment by \n     reducing the Federal Government's share of the cost for \n     educating students with special needs, placing a greater \n     financial burden on States and local school districts;\n       Whereas research shows that every dollar invested in high-\n     quality early childhood education yields $13 in benefits to \n     the public, but the President's budget would eliminate Head \n     Start services for 19,000 children;\n       Whereas despite the importance of education, the President \n     now is proposing a $2,100,000,000 cut to Federal education \n     funding, which would be the largest cut in the 26-year \n     history of the Department of Education;\n       Whereas the President's budget proposes to eliminate or \n     substantially reduce funding for 42 existing education \n     programs, including Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \n     Communities State Grants, Educational Technology State \n     Grants, Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Programs, \n     Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate \n     Programs (GEAR-UP), and Federal TRIO Programs;\n       Whereas every child deserves a safe, healthy, supervised \n     place to go after school, but the President's budget denies \n     these opportunities to 2,000,000 disadvantaged students by \n     funding 21st Century Community Learning Centers at less than \n     half the level promised in the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001; and\n       Whereas the education cuts in the President's budget would \n     eliminate the ability of many working families to ensure a \n     quality education for their children, deny many young people \n     the opportunities that flow from a college education, reduce \n     the competitiveness of the United States workforce, and harm \n     the Nation's economy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should act to make college more affordable \n     by--\n       (A) increasing tax benefits to offset college costs, such \n     as expanding the Hope Scholarship Credit and the \n     deductibility of college tuition;\n       (B) substantially increasing the size of Federal Pell \n     Grants to better reflect the increase in the cost of higher \n     education; and\n       (C) making student loans more affordable by reducing \n     interest rates and fees for students and families;\n       (2) Congress should keep its promises to the children of \n     the United States, particularly by fully funding the No Child \n     Left Behind Act of 2001, the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, and the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et \n     seq.); and\n       (3) Congress should reject the cuts in the President's \n     education budget for fiscal year 2007.\n\n     SEC. 2.
