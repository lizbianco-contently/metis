The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will begin the final \nremarks regarding the nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as \nChief Justice of the United States. Beginning at 10:30 this morning, \nthe time until the vote has been allocated for closing comments by the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The vote on the \nconfirmation of Judge Roberts will begin at 11:30.\n  I remind all Senators to be at their desks at the outset of this \nhistoric vote. Senators should come to the Chamber around 11:20 for the \n11:30 vote.\n  Following the confirmation vote on Judge Roberts, the Senate will \ntake up the Defense appropriations bill. Senators should expect \nadditional votes on the Defense bill, as well as votes on Friday.\n  The vote we cast today is one of the most consequential of our \ncareers. With the confirmation of John Roberts, the Supreme Court will \nembark upon a new era in its history--the Roberts era. For many years \nto come, long after many of us will have left public service, the \nRoberts Court will be deliberating on some of the most difficult and \nfundamental questions of U.S. law. As all Supreme Courts that have come \nbefore, their decisions will affect the lives of all Americans.\n  When the President announced his nomination of Judge Roberts in July, \nwe pledged to conduct a full, thorough, and fair review of Judge \nRoberts' credentials and qualifications. We also pledged we would \nconduct those deliberations in a timely and expeditious manner so the \nSupreme Court could begin its term on October 3 at full strength. We \nhave delivered on both promises.\n  I thank Chairman Arlen Specter for his leadership and handling of the \nhearings process, and I also want to thank my colleagues for moving \nforward so the Supreme Court can do its important work for the American \npeople.\n  I expect a strong bipartisan vote in support for Judge Roberts later \nthis morning. As has been said by Members on both sides of the aisle, \nJudge Roberts is an exceptional candidate who possesses the keen \nintelligence, the exemplary character, and sterling credentials to \nserve as Chief Justice of the highest Court in the land. I look forward \nto confirming him to lead the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nNew York, is here. He wants to speak briefly. I know the time is \ndivided for the next hour. I ask unanimous consent that he follow my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is equally divided.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nSenator Lott has been scheduled to speak. When he comes, we will be \nalternating back and forth.\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator seek recognition now?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will probably speak 8 or 9 minutes. My \ncolleague wanted to speak for about 4 or 5 minutes. That would not \ninterfere with the previous agreement. I ask unanimous consent that he \nbe recognized following me.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That would take an amendment to the \npreviously agreed-to order.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court of the United States is the ultimate \narbiter of our Constitution and, as such, it is the final protector of \nindividual rights and liberties in this great Nation. So when we vote \nto confirm a justice for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, \nwe have an awesome responsibility to get it right. And when we vote to \nconfirm the Chief Justice of the United States, we have an even greater \nresponsibility, because the stakes are even higher.\n  The Chief Justice sets the tone for the Court and, through \nleadership, influences Court decisions in ways both subtle and direct. \nIndeed, during the course of his confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts \nexpressly acknowledged the important role that a Chief Justice can play \nin persuading his fellow justices to come along to his way of thinking \nabout a particular case. During my discussion with him of the Supreme \nCourt's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, I mentioned \nthat the decision was a unanimous one. Judge Roberts responded:\n\n       Yes. That represented a lot of work by Chief Justice Earl \n     Warren because my understanding of the history is that it \n     initially was not. And he spent--it was re-argued. He spent a \n     considerable amount of time talking to his colleagues and \n     bringing around to the point where they ended up with \n     unanimous court. . .\n\n  On another day, when I again mentioned Brown and the indispensable \nrole played by Chief Justice Warren, Judge Roberts said:\n\n       Well, Senator, my point with respect to Chief Justice \n     Warren was that he appreciated the impact that the decision \n     in Brown would have. And he appreciated that the impact would \n     be far more beneficial and favorable and far more effectively \n     implemented with the unanimous court, the court speaking with \n     one voice, than a splintered court.\n       The issue was significant enough that he spent the extra \n     time in the reargument of the case to devote his energies to \n     convincing the other justices--and, obviously, there's no \n     arm-twisting or anything of that; it's the type of collegial \n     discussion that judges and justices have to engage in--of the \n     importance of what the court was doing and an appreciation of \n     its impact on real people and real lives.\n\n  I have thought long and hard about the exchanges I had with Judge \nRoberts, and I have read and re-read the transcript and the record. And \ntry as I might, I cannot find the evidence to conclude that John \nRoberts understands the real world impact of court decisions on civil \nrights and equal rights in this country. And I cannot find the evidence \nto conclude that a Chief Justice John Roberts would be the kind of \ninspirational leader who would use his powers of persuasion to bring \nall the Court along on America's continued march toward progress.\n  Therefore, I do not believe that John Roberts has met the burden of \nproof necessary to be confirmed by the Senate as Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. Sadly, there is ample evidence in John Roberts' record \nto indicate that he would turn the clock back on this country's great \nmarch of progress toward equal opportunity for all. The White House has \nrefused to release documents and information from his years in the \nReagan administration and in the first Bush administration that might \nindicate otherwise, but without those records we have no way of \nknowing.\n  Both in committee and on the floor, some have argued that those of us \nwho oppose John Roberts' nomination are trying to force a nominee to \nadopt our ``partisan'' positions, to support our ``causes,'' to yield \nto our ``special interest'' agendas.\n  But progress toward a freer, fairer Nation where ``justice for all'' \nis a reality--not just a pledge in the Constitution--is not a personal \n``cause'' or a ``special interest'' or a ``partisan'' philosophy or \nideology or agenda.\n  For more than half a century, our Nation's progress toward a just \nsociety has been a shared goal of both Democrats and Republicans. Since \nRepublican Senate Leader Everett Dirksen led his party in supporting \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, equal rights for all has been a consensus \ncause, not a ``partisan cause.'' Since Congress adopted the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 and began the process of spreading true democracy to \nall Americans, it has been a national goal, not a ``special interest'' \ngoal. Fulfilling the Founders' ideals of equality and justice for all \nis not just a personal ideology, it is America's ideology. Surely, in \nthe 21st century, anyone who leaves the slightest doubt as to whether \nhe shares it fully, openly and enthusiastically should not be confirmed \nto any office, let alone the highest judicial office in the land.\n  Our doubts about John Roberts' commitment to continuing our national \nprogress toward justice was, quite appropriately, a major issue in the \ncommittee hearings. The fundamental question was whether his record and \nhis answers suggested that he would be an obstacle to that progress, by \ntreating cases before the Supreme Court in a narrow legalistic way that \nresists and undermines the extraordinary gains of the past.\n  For all his brilliance and polish, he gave us insufficient evidence \nto demonstrate that the John Roberts of today is not the ideological \nactivist he clearly was before. The strong evidence from his own hand \nand mind, the crucial 3-year gap in evidence because of the \nAdministration's refusal to release his papers as Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral, and his grudging and ambiguous answers at the hearing left too \nmany fundamental doubts, and could put the entire Nation at risk for \ndecades to come.\n  Some argue that John Roberts was just doing his job and carrying out \nthe policies of the Reagan administration in the early 1980s. But his \nown writings refute that argument--these were clearly his own views, \nand were enthusiastically offered as his views. If he didn't agree with \nthose policies as a lawyer in the Justice Department in 1981 and 1982, \nhe would not have applied for the more political and more sensitive job \nin the White House Counsel's office when he left the Justice \nDepartment. He knowingly chose to be a voice for their policies, and \noften advocated even more extreme versions of those policies.\n  He certainly knew what was expected of him when he chose to become \nDeputy Solicitor General in 1989. That position was explicitly created \nto be the political monitor over all Department of Justice litigation. \nHe was eager to advance the ideological views that his earlier \nmemoranda show he personally supported. He obviously wasn't just \n``following orders''--he was an eager recruit for those causes. That \nwas the evidence he needed to overcome in the hearings, and his effort \nto do so is unconvincing.\n  I hope I am proven wrong about John Roberts. I have been proven wrong \nbefore on my confirmation votes. I regret my vote to confirm Justice \nScalia even though he, too, like John Roberts, was a nice person and a \nvery smart Harvard lawyer. I regret my vote against Justice Souter, \nalthough at the time, his record did not persuade me he was in tune \nwith the Nation's goals and progress.\n  But as the example of Justice Scalia shows, and contrary to the \nassertions of my colleagues across the aisle, I have never hesitated to \nvote for a Republican President's nominee to the Supreme Court whose \ncommitment to core national goals and values appeared clear at the \ntime. In fact, I have voted for seven of them, more than the number of \nnominees of Democratic Presidents I have voted for.\n  Our Senate responsibility to provide advice and consent on the \nSupreme Court Justices and other nominations is one of our most \nimportant functions. The future and the quality of life in this Nation \nmay literally depend on how we exercise it. If we are merely a \nrubberstamp for the President's nominees, if we put party over \nprinciple, then we have failed in this vital responsibility. Even more \nimportant, if we go along to get along with the White House, we will be \nundermining the trust the Founders placed in us, and we will diminish \nthe great institution entrusted to our care. Every thoughtful and \nreasonable ``no'' vote is a vote for the balance of powers and for\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\nthe Constitution, so we must never hesitate to cast it when our \nindependent consciences tell us to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his leadership on these issues through the decades.\n  Mr. President, today John Roberts will be confirmed as the 17th Chief \nJustice of the United States, so it is a historic day. Not everyone in \nthis Senate will vote for him, and our opinions differ on many things: \nHow much we were consulted, how many documents we received, how fair \nJohn Roberts will be, how ideological he will be.\n  In the end, I decided that while there was a very good chance that \nJudge Roberts would be a very conservative but mainstream Justice \nwithout an ideological agenda, he was not convincing enough. And the \ndown side, even a minority downside that he would be a Justice in the \nmold of Scalia and Thomas, was too great to risk, so I will vote no.\n  But no matter how we vote, today we all share a fervent hope that \nJustice Roberts becomes a great jurist and serves our Nation well. In \nthe end, I cannot vote for Judge Roberts, but I hope he proves me wrong \nin my vote and that he takes the goodwill of this body and the American \npeople with him onto the bench; that he rules fairly; that he looks out \nfor the little guy if the law is on the little guy's side; that he will \nbe the lawyer's lawyer, without an ideological agenda; that he sees \njustice done in the many areas of the law that he will profoundly \naffect over the next several decades.\n  However, as the curtain falls on this vote, the curtain is about to \nrise on the nomination of a replacement for Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor. If ever there was a time that cried out for consensus, the \ntime is now. If the President nominates a consensus nominee, he will be \nembraced, the President will be embraced, and the nominee will be \nembraced with open arms by people on this side of the aisle. Not only \nwe on this side of the aisle, but the American people hope and pray in \nthese difficult times for a consensus nominee. The ball is in your \ncourt, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Mississippi \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am delighted this morning to rise to \nspeak on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to become Chief Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. Before I proceed on my discussion of Judge \nRoberts, I want to take a moment to commend the President of the United \nStates for his brilliant selection of this outstanding human being, \nlawyer, judge, and public servant. I had thought there would be \npressures to move in some other direction, that some other person might \nbe selected for a variety of reasons--good reasons. But the most \nimportant thing was for him to select the best man or woman for the \njob, regardless of anything else. That is what the President did.\n  When I had an opportunity to comment to White House representatives \nwhen they asked my recommendations, I said, frankly, I didn't have a \nparticular person I recommend. I have faith in this President and I \nbelieve he will make the right choice. But second, I urged that he pick \nthe best person, regardless of sex, religion, race, religious \nbackground, region of the country, or philosophy. And then I had one or \ntwo that I thought, well, maybe you do not want to suggest these \npeople.\n  I was, frankly, delightfully surprised when the President selected \nJudge Roberts. I am very pleased with this selection.\n  I also want to thank Senator Specter of Pennsylvania for conducting \nthese confirmation hearings in such a fair, dignified, and respectful \nmanner. We can only hope that the nature of these hearings will carry \nover to the next Supreme Court nomination. Every Senator had ample \nopportunity to make statements and ask what were supposed to be \nquestions that quite often became just another speech, but I thought \nthat the overall tenor and tone of the committee hearings was very \ngood.\n  Maybe this nomination and the conduct of these hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee and the vote today in the Senate will be \noverwhelming and will bring to a final close a dark and ugly chapter in \nthe history of Federal judicial nominations and confirmations. What we \nhave done to men, women, and minorities over the past 4 years, until \nMay of this year, was one of the nastiest things I have ever witnessed. \nGood people's remarks were misinterpreted. I will not even describe how \nstrongly I feel about some of the things that were said and done.\n\n  We found a way to change the atmosphere, to move some of these \nnominees, and now to vote on this nomination. Thank goodness. This is a \ngood opportunity. Let's continue these future hearings and these \nnomination considerations in this vein.\n  We are set to vote later this morning on the nomination of Judge \nRoberts to be the 17th Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nyoungest nominee in probably over 150 years. The vote will place Judge \nRoberts at the head of the judiciary branch, a job that comes with an \nimmense amount of responsibility and a position for which Judge Roberts \nis eminently qualified.\n  Before I met Judge Roberts, I knew him by his reputation. I had some \nmutual friends who had worked with him at the Supreme Court, who had \nserved with him in previous administrations, who had known him in a \nvariety of roles, and to a man or woman they gave glowing reports on \nhis quality and his credentials.\n  By Supreme Court standards he is still a young man, just 50 years \nold, but he has compiled an outstanding resume, graduating sum cum \nlaude from Harvard, taking only 3 years. He graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Harvard Law School and served as managing editor of the Harvard \nLaw Review, with clerkships for Judge Henry Friendly and then Associate \nJustice William Rehnquist.\n  When I met with him I said, You have an outstanding resume and we \nwill overlook the Harvard thing--which always gets a laugh. And I am \nonly jesting--in half.\n  Judge Roberts embarked upon a distinguished career in public service \nand served as Associate White House Counsel in the Reagan \nadministration and the Principal Deputy Solicitor General in the George \nH.W. Bush administration. In all, Judge Roberts argued 39 cases before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, winning more than half. That is a pretty \nsterling record of appearances, let alone the victories. The American \nBar Association gave him its highest rating, a unanimous ``well-\nqualified,'' both for the Supreme Court and DC Circuit nominations.\n  After visiting with Judge Roberts and watching how he has conducted \nhimself during his nomination process, I continue to be extremely \nimpressed. He is brilliant, eminently qualified, and fair man who \nclearly has a passion for the law. If confirmed, I believe he will \nserve the United States with honor and distinction for a long time.\n  Before Hurricane Katrina hit my home area and shifted the focus of us \nall, as we try to do all we can in a responsible way to help the people \nwho have been so devastated by this natural disaster, I consistently \nheard concerns from Mississippians about the direction of our judicial \nsystem. My constituents realized that judicial activism is a serious \nproblem that threatens their rights and ignores the constitutional \nobligations of the judiciary. With recent decisions such as Kelo v. \nCity of New London that allows local governments to take private \nproperty and give it to someone else for private development, and the \nPledge of Allegiance cases out of the Ninth Circuit, it should be clear \nto everyone what the dangers of judicial activism are and how it causes \nserious concerns.\n  I have a friend who serves in the Federal Judiciary, a very close \nfriend. Recently, we were together in my home and after breakfast on \nSunday morning we were talking about things in general. He said: I am \nconcerned about the attitude toward the Federal judiciary. We actually \nhave to worry about security in our courthouses. Why is this?\n  And I said: Your Honor, my friend, look at your decisions. You \nFederal judicial members are out of control. And until you get back in \nthe box and stay as judges, not as legislators, and quit rendering \nthese ridiculous decisions, there will be no respect.\n  However, I have learned, also, in so many ways in recent years, that \none of the sayings of the Jaycees when I was\n\n[[Page S10634]]\n\na young man in a young businessman's organization was that this is a \ngovernment of laws, not of men. It is just not so. You can have the \nbest laws in the world, you can have the best system in the world, \nwhich we do, but if you have the wrong men and women in place, it does \nnot work.\n  So we have a little changing of the judiciary that is called for. And \nthese recent decisions I refer to just magnify why this is needed. \nJudicial activism is a threat to all Americans, regardless of political \nalliances. The use of judicial activism to advance conservative or \nliberal political goals is simply wrong.\n  Judge Roberts' own testimony illustrates his understanding of the \nconstitutional role of the judiciary and shows his understanding of the \nissue. He said:\n\n       Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules, they \n     apply them. . . . They make sure everybody plays by the \n     rules, but it is a limited role.\n\n  While Judge Roberts acknowledged this analysis might be an \noversimplification, but it shows a welcome respect for the \nconstitutional role of the Judiciary.\n  When he was asked what type of judge he would like to be known as, \nJudge Roberts responded ``a modest judge,'' meaning he has an \n``appreciation that the role of the judge is limited, that a judge is \nto decide the cases before them, they are not to legislate, they are \nnot to execute the laws.''\n  Judge Roberts vowed to decide each case in a fair-minded, \nindependent, and unbiased fashion and has stated repeatedly that \npersonal ideology has no place in the decision making process of a \njudge.\n  Simply put, this is a rock solid judicial philosophy. This is what \nseparates judges from legislators. We as legislators are free to use \nour personal ideology and make decisions, and boy do we. We are elected \nand accountable to our constituents for those decisions if we go too \nfar, in their opinion, one way or the other.\n\n  Judge Roberts addressed the role of personal ideology in the \njudiciary during his hearings by saying:\n\n       [Judges] are not individuals promoting their own particular \n     views, but they are supposed to be doing their best to \n     interpret the law, to interpret the Constitution, according \n     to the rule of law, not their own preferences, not their own \n     personal beliefs.\n\n  During his hearings, Judge Roberts was asked to answer several \nquestions on issues that potentially could come before him if confirmed \nto the Supreme Court. He handled those questions exactly as he should \nhave. It is a well-established standard that nominees should not answer \nquestions that might bias them on future cases. I commend Judge Roberts \nfor his handling of that sometimes difficult situation with \nsteadfastness, with intelligent responses, and even sometimes with a \nsense of humor.\n  This nomination has served as a fantastic example of how the Ginsburg \nstandard should be applied. Judicial nominees should have a fair and \nrespectful hearing. They should not be expected to prejudge issues or \ncases. Judges must remain impartial and should not be asked to commit \nto rule a certain way in order to win confirmation votes. Judge \nRoberts, like Justice Ginsburg and all the other sitting judges, \nrightly refused to prejudge cases or issues likely to come before the \nSupreme Court.\n  During this process, Judge Roberts' record was scrutinized more \nclosely than any other person in the history of judicial nominees. \nSenators had access to unprecedented 76,000 pages of documents from his \ntime spent in public service and 327 cases decided by him on the DC \nCircuit. In addition, he was questioned for nearly 20 hours by the \nJudiciary Committee before receiving bipartisan support and a vote of \n13 to 5. Through all of this intense scrutiny Judge Roberts and his \nrecord remain consistent and impressive.\n  Being placed under the microscope like this is not for the \nfainthearted. I admire how he handled this entire process with grace \nand poise.\n  Nobody should be surprised that when faced with a Supreme Court \nvacancy President Bush nominated a judicial conservative for that \nposition. He said he would, I expected him to, and so he did. I expect \nhim to do it again. In fact, you are talking about a consensus nominee. \nThere won't be a consensus if he nominates somebody like Justice \nGinsburg.\n  But I voted for her. I knew she was going to be way out of the \nmainstream, extremely liberal, but President Clinton won the election. \nHe selected her. She was qualified by education, by experience, by \ndemeanor. I voted for her. I did not expect her then to go on the \nSupreme Court and vote the way I would vote. She was a liberal. She is \ntoday. And probably--I have every reason to believe--a wonderful lady \nand a very thoughtful judge. She just comes to wrong conclusions, in my \nopinion.\n  The President was elected twice to the Presidency, telling anyone who \nwould listen he would fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court with a \njudicial conservative. So why are we surprised? Why would you expect \nanything else? That is the way it is going to be; and that is the way \nit should be. He has followed through on that promise with John \nRoberts. He will likely do so again in the next nomination. And the \nnext nominee, whoever it might be, deserves to be treated with the same \nfairness, respect, and dignity given to Judge Roberts.\n  There is clear and convincing evidence here that Judge Roberts is the \nright choice to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I look \nforward to voting in favor of his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in reluctant opposition to the \nconfirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States. \nWhile Judge Roberts is a talented lawyer and Constitutional scholar, I \ndo not believe that these qualities alone are sufficient for leading \nthe highest court in the land.\n  I approached this nomination as I do any nomination: with an open \nmind. I take my role of advice and consent on nominations seriously. \nThat is why I joined a group of my colleagues in the Senate to \nrespectfully ask the President to make available documents from \nRoberts' time in the Solicitor General's office. These documents could \nhave provided valuable insight into how Roberts views important \nConstitutional questions, and I am disappointed that the White House \ndid not fulfill this request. The White House owes not only the Senate, \nbut also the American people, access to this information.\n  And so I am left to wonder about Judge Roberts' positions on critical \nquestions regarding our Constitution and our way of life. I continue to \nhope that Judge Roberts shares my understanding that the Constitution \nprovides robust protections guaranteeing the equality of all Americans. \nI hope that Judge Roberts' view of the Constitution is not as narrow as \nI have been led to believe.\n  However, neither the White House nor Judge Roberts has convinced me. \nOn the contrary, they have given me reasons for alarm. Because the \nWhite House failed to respond to requests for Roberts' more recent work \nat the Solicitor General's office, the memoranda Judge Roberts wrote as \na young lawyer in government service are all I have to go on. These \nmemos raise serious concerns for me about Judge Roberts' commitment to \nprotecting fundamental rights. Judge Roberts expressed views on civil \nrights, the Voting Rights Act, and the right to privacy convey a view \nof the Constitution that I simply do not agree with.\n  I recognize that these memos were written a long time ago, which is \nwhy I reserved judgement until Judge Roberts had the opportunity to \nclarify his position on these issues at the hearings. I listened \ncarefully for Judge Roberts to dispel concerns about these memoranda, \nhoping that Judge Roberts would clarify the values that would guide his \ndeliberations as Chief Justice. While Judge Roberts would occasionally \ndistance himself from his old memos, stating that he was simply an \nemployee doing what his boss had asked of him, he never fully explained \nwhere he stands on these important issues now.\n  Consequently, I am left with the memos to piece together Judge \nRoberts' judicial philosophy. These memos concerned me not only for the \nideas they conveyed, but also the language that Judge Roberts chose to \nexpress his ideas. To me, phrases such as ``illegal amigo,'' ``Indian \ngiveaway,'' and ``supposed right to privacy'' convey an unacceptable \nlack of respect for the people whose rights and freedoms Judge\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\nRoberts would be entrusted to protect. It disappointed me that, when \nasked whether he regretted his flippant tone, Judge Roberts not only \ndeflected responsibility but also failed to articulate any semblance of \nregret for these hostile words.\n  For these reasons, I cannot vote for this nominee. This was not an \neasy decision for me. I have great respect for my many friends--both \ninside and outside this body--who have come to a different conclusion. \nI hope the President will use his next nomination to appoint a justice \nwhom all Senators can agree upon, and if doubts arise the White House \nwill choose to resolve rather than exacerbate them.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, among the great responsibilities and \nprivileges of being a Member of the U.S. Senate is assessing the \nqualifications and voting on the confirmation of members of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Reflecting upon this vote, one gets a sense of the \nweight of the responsibility--we will be voting on a replacement for \nonly the 17th Chief Justice in the history of our great country.\n  But this vote is not unique because of its infrequency but because of \nits place in our system of government. The Supreme Court is the final \nvoice in the land on the meaning of the words of the Constitution as \nthey apply to the extent of the rights guaranteed to individuals by the \ndocument. It is the final word on the demarcation of power between the \nlegislative and executive branch of government and it is the voice on \ndefining the power reserved for the Federal Government and the \ngovernments of the individual States.\n  As a member of the legislative branch of our national government who \nwas in a former life a State Governor, I am acutely aware of the \nimportance of these lines and the consequences when they are breached. \nAs a Member of the Senate, I do not welcome decisions overturning \nlegislative acts that I support but I frequently work with my \ncolleagues to reject efforts to meddle in state affairs. As a Governor \nattempting to guide my State, I had to labor through the burdens placed \nin my way by an intrusive Federal Government.\n  The judicial branch of our government, most notably the Supreme \nCourt, has been designated by the Constitution as the branch to \nmaintain these divisions of power and law making.\n  So it is a great privilege and responsibility to have a role in \nconfirming people who will occupy a place on the court. In this case, \nconfirming the person that will lead that court.\n  After observing Judge Roberts during 3 days of hearing before the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, I am convinced the power that comes with \nthe vote of a Supreme Court Justice will be in wise and capable hands. \nFirst, throughout this strenuous session, Judge Roberts' intelligence, \npatience and temperament were on full display and were nothing short of \nextraordinary.\n  But it was that which he had to say that satisfies me and secures my \nvote for his confirmation.\n  He made a convincing case through his words and his demeanor that he \nwill approach his responsibility with modesty and humility, which means \napproaching cases with an open mind and carefully studying the words of \nCongress or the precedents of the Court on constitutional questions. As \nJudge Roberts said and I agree, ``a certain humility should \ncharacterize the judicial role. Judges . . . are servants of the law, \nnot the other way around.''\n  Also, as Judge Roberts repeatedly reminded his inquisitors, he is not \na politician. In that statement, I am comforted. I commend him on his \nwillingness to remind my colleagues that he was not before Congress to \ncompromise or give hints on how he might vote on a hypothetical case in \nexchange for confirmation votes. Rather, he confirmed repeatedly that \nthe constitution and the rule of law will be his guide.\n  Judge Roberts made the case that he recognizes that the authority on \nthe division of power between the branches of government and the \nauthority on the division of power in our federalist system of \ngovernment are contained in the Constitution.\n  It is a positive thing that we are going to confirm a decent person \nfor the Court, but that should not be our guiding principle. Our vote \nshould not rest on whether a future judge will approach cases as a \nfather or a son, on the side of the weak or the strong or with the \nintent to expand rights or protections. That subjects judicial decision \nmaking to subjective standards, compromises impartiality and removes \nthe blinders from justice. Some have argued that this is to dodge a \nquestion. Rather, it is an indication that one recognizes that the \nobligation of the judge is to follow the Constitution rather than his \nown interests.\n  At one point during the proceedings, the Judge was prodded to comment \non a case in which he participated to decide the extent of benefits \navailable under a health plan. To limit or expand the benefits provided \nunder a statute is the job of a legislature, not a judge. Judge Roberts \nagrees with this important principal. As he stated. ``As far as a Judge \nis concerned, they have to decide questions according to the rule of \nlaw, not their own social preferences, not their policy views, not \ntheir personal preferences, but according to the rule of law.''\n  If the support of a majority of a State or national legislature can \nbe won, a statute can be changed and this concern addressed. I suspect \nthat many of my colleagues, particularly those who will vote against \nthis nomination, have come to rely on the judiciary to advance changes \nthat have no support in legislatures. Hence, their frustration with \nJudge Roberts. He has clearly defined views of the role of the \njudiciary and the role of the legislature and they do not appear to be \nblurred. He has not shown a willingness to approach case guided by a \npoint of view or a subjective standard--that is what is to motivate \nlegislators as they debate on the campaign trail and the floors of \ncongress and statehouses across the country.\n  But as Judge Roberts again put it so well, ``If the people who framed \nour Constitution were jealous of their freedom and liberty, they would \nnot have sat around and said, `Let's take all the hard issues and give \nthem over to the judges.' That would have been the farthest thing from \ntheir mind.''\n  As did the Founders, I do not believe State and national legislative \nbodies are incapable of settling tough and contious issues. I do not \nbelieve it is benevolent or admirable for judges to remove questions \nfrom the public realm because they are divisive. Roberts has shown the \nmodesty and respect for the role of the court and an legislature to \nrefrain from that path.\n  Judge Roberts has also made it clear that he finds no place for \nreflection on the public attitudes and legal documents of foreign lands \nin the consideration of constitutional questions. They do not offer any \nguidance as to the words of our constitution.\n  During his testimony, Judge Roberts displayed a respect for \nConstitution and the rule of law as the principles that should guide \nhim when ruling on a case. His view of the role of the judiciary is \nvery consistent with that of my own.\n  Finally, I believe President Bush has executed his duties in a \nresponsible manner that will serve our Nation well. He interviewed many \ndistinguished and qualified attorneys an judges in the country to serve \non our Nation's highest court. After responsible consultation with \nmembers of the Senate and careful and thoughtful deliberation, \nPresident Bush returned to the Senate the name of John Roberts. As we \nhave learned, his qualifications to lead the Supreme Court and Federal \njudiciary are as unquestioned as they are impressive.\n  President Bush was reelected with over 62 million votes, the highest \nreceived by a presidential candidate. He is the first candidate in 16 \nyears to win a majority of the popular vote, something not achieved by \nhis predecessor, who incidentally won easy confirmation of both of his \nappointments to the high court.\n  President Bush resoundingly won the right to nominate someone who he \nviews as fit to serve on the Supreme Court and he won the right to have \nthat nominee considered fairly and impartially. The President also \nasked for the thoughts and advice of Members of this body as to the \npending nomination. When it came time to exercise his responsibility as \nPresident, he did so by nominating someone with an impeccable record \nand extraordinary qualifications. In the execution of his duties, \nPresident Bush exceeded any standard to which he should be held.\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\n  Nonetheless, I suspect that this nomination and the subsequent \nnomination will not be treated in the manner that President Clinton's \nnominees were treated, when they received 96 votes. But it should as \nshould the next nominee.\n  Judge Roberts is an outstanding nomination. He will get my support \nand he deserves the overwhelming support of this body.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of John \nRoberts' nomination for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The debate \nthat the Senate will have this week is truly historic. In our Nation's \nhistory there have only been 16 previous Chief Justices. The \nopportunity to vote on a nomination for Chief Justice is a once-in-a-\nlifetime opportunity and should be undertaken with recognition of its \nimportance. The importance of this vote simply cannot be overstated.\n  I believe that our Nation is best served when we confirm individuals \nwho appreciate that the role of a judge is not to make laws but to \nuphold the Constitution. We need judges who understand that their oath \nrequires them to follow the Constitution and to apply the law in a \nmodest fashion. Judges do not serve in the legislative branch. They \nshould not make the law. As Senators, that is our job.\n  Under our Constitution, judges are appointed to interpret the law. \nThey should apply the law without prejudice. Judges must be open to the \nlegal arguments presented by each of the parties before them. They must \nfully and fairly analyze the facts and faithfully apply the law.\n  I have carefully considered John Roberts' record and his \nqualifications. I believe that his record reflects a proper \nunderstanding of the role of judges. I met with him and discussed face-\nto-face his views on the role of Supreme Court Justices. Judge Roberts \npossesses the highest intellect and integrity. He has also demonstrated \nthat he is fair-minded. He possesses the necessary experience, as an \nattorney for the government, in private practice and as a judge, to \nserve on the high court. By any objective measure, John Roberts is \nqualified to sit on the bench, and he deserves to be confirmed.\n  Judge Roberts, in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee and in \nhis writings throughout his career, has presented himself as a man with \na clear view of the role of a Supreme Court Justice: to interpret the \nlaw and to uphold the Constitution. His answers to specific questions \nhave been necessarily and appropriately limited so we must trust, as we \nhave with past nominees to the Court, that Judge Roberts is presenting \nhimself and his views honestly. I believe he has, and for the sake of \nour country, I hope so.\n  Today, throughout the judicial branch, judicial activism is impeding \nand restricting freedoms the American people should expect to enjoy as \nenvisioned by our Nation's founders. Recent and significant rulings \nhave established standards created not by elected Members of Congress \nbut by activist judges. These rulings have infringed on Americans' \nrights to exercise their religious beliefs; to recite the Pledge of \nAllegiance; and to own property without fear that the Government might \nseize that property for economic gain.\n  Now more than ever we need justices who will stand against this type \nof judicial activism, adhere to the proper role of upholding the \nConstitution, and leave the task of creating laws to the Congress. John \nRoberts is representing himself as someone who believes in a return to \nwhat our founders intended and we hope his portrayal of his views is \nhonest and true.\n  Historically, the Senate has confirmed a nominee when the nominee is \nfound to be well qualified. John Roberts certainly meets this \ncriterion. Historically, the Senate has based confirmation on a \nnominee's record, writings, and prior decisions. There is ample \ndocumentation on which my colleagues can make a decision with respect \nto John Roberts' nomination. And the documentation supports \nconfirmation.\n  John Roberts deserves to be confirmed, and America deserves a Chief \nJustice like John Roberts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the nomination \nof Judge John Roberts to be the Chief Justice of the United States. \nThis has not been an easy decision, but I believe it is the correct \none. Judge Roberts' impeccable legal credentials, his reputation and \nrecord as a fair-minded person, and his commitment to modesty and \nrespect for precedent have persuaded me that he will not bring an \nideological agenda to the position of Chief Justice of the United \nStates and that he should be confirmed.\n  I have often noted that the scrutiny that I will apply to a \nPresident's nominee to the Supreme Court is the highest of any \nnomination and that the scrutiny to be applied to the position of Chief \nJustice must be the very highest. I have voted for executive branch \nappointments, and even for court of appeals nominees, whom I would not \nnecessarily vote to put on the Supreme Court.\n  Furthermore, because the Supreme Court, alone among our courts, has \nthe power to revisit and reverse its precedents, I believe that anyone \nwho sits on that Court must not have a pre-set agenda to reverse \nprecedents with which he or she disagrees and must recognize and \nappreciate the awesome power and responsibility of the Court to do \njustice when other branches of Government infringe on or ignore the \nfreedoms and rights of all citizens.\n  Judge Roberts came to his hearing with a record that few can top. His \nlong record of excellence as a lawyer practicing before the Supreme \nCourt, and his reputation as a lawyer's lawyer who has no ideological \nagenda, carry substantial weight. I wanted to see, however, how that \nrecord and reputation would stand up against a searching inquiry into \nhis past statements and current views. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I was proud to play a role in that inquiry. I believe the \nhearing was fair and thorough and I congratulate the chairman and \nranking member, and all of the members of the committee, for the \nseriousness with which they undertook this task.\n  One important question I had was about Judge Roberts' views on the \nrole of precedent and stare decisis in our legal system. A lot of the \nconcern about this nomination stems from the fact that many important \nprecedents seem to be hanging by a thread. In both our private meeting \nand in his hearing, Judge Roberts demonstrated a great respect for \nprecedent and for the importance of stability and settled expectations. \nHis themes of modesty and humility showed appropriate respect for the \nwork of the Justices who have come before him. He convinced me that he \nwill take these issues very seriously, with respect to both the \nconstitutional right to privacy and many other issues of settled law.\n  As I am sure every Member of the Senate noticed and expected, Judge \nRoberts did not expressly say how he would rule if asked to overturn \nRoe v. Wade. But if Judge Roberts abides by what he said about how he \nwould approach the question of stare decisis, I think he should vote to \nuphold Roe. He certainly left some wiggle room, and he said he would \napproach the possibility of overturning a case differently if the \nunderlying precedents themselves came into question. But it will be \ndifficult to overrule Roe or other important precedents while remaining \ntrue to his testimony about stability and settled law, including his \nstatement that he agrees with the outcome in Griswold v. Connecticut. I \nknow the American people will be watching him very closely on that \nquestion, and I personally will consider it a reversal of huge \nproportions, and a grave disappointment, if he ultimately does attempt \nto go down that road.\n  I was also impressed that Judge Roberts does not seem inclined to try \nto rein in Congress's power under the commerce clause. He repeatedly \ncalled attention to the Court's recent decision in Gonzales v. Raich as \nindicating that the Court is not headed inexorably in the direction it \nturned in the Lopez and Morrison cases limiting Congress's power. His \napproving references to Raich suggests to me that he will take a more \nmoderate stance on these issues than his mentor, Chief Justice \nRehnquist. His attitude seems to be if Congress does its job right, he \nwill not stand in the way as a judge. That is, of course, cold comfort \nif the Court creates new hoops for Congress to jump through and applies \nthem retroactively. I hope that Judge Roberts will recognize that \nCongress can pay attention to what the Court says is\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nneeded to justify legislation only if the Court gives clear advance \nnotice of those requirements.\n  Judge Roberts also seemed to reject a return to the Lochner era, when \na majority of the Court invoked the due process and contracts clauses \nof the Constitution to strike down child labor and other laws it \ndisagreed with, and the courts openly acted as a superlegislature, \nrejecting congressional enactments based on their own political and \neconomic judgments. Judge Roberts disparaged the Lochner decision, \nsaying, ``[y]ou can read that opinion today and it's quite clear that \nthey're not interpreting the law, they're making the law.'' That is a \nmarked contrast to many in the so-called ``Constitution in Exile'' \nmovement, including recently confirmed DC Circuit Judge Janice Rogers \nBrown.\n  Judge Roberts' determination to be a humble and modest judge should \nlead him to reject efforts to undermine Congress's power to address \nsocial and economic problems through national legislation. I view that \nas a significant commitment he has made to the Congress and to the \ncountry.\n  Another important issue involves not so much respect for settled \nprecedent, but rather questions that will arise in the future with \nrespect to the application of the Bill of Rights in a time of war. The \nSupreme Court has already dealt with a series of cases arising from the \nBush administration's conduct of the fight against terrorism, and will \nundoubtedly face many more during the next Chief Justice's term. \nIndeed, how the new Justices address these issues may well define them \nand the Court in history.\n\n  For me, Judge Roberts' discussion of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, which has been such an issue in the Patriot Act \ndebate, was a defining moment in the hearing. His answers showed a gut-\nlevel understanding of the potential dangers of a court that operates \nentirely in secret, with no adversary process. His instincts as a \nlawyer, one who trusts our judicial system and its protections to yield \nthe correct result under the rule of law, seemed to take over, and he \nseemed genuinely disturbed by the idea of a court without the usual \nprotections of an open, adversary process. Here is what he said about \nthe FISA Court to Senator DeWine:\n\n       I'll be very candid. When I first learned about the FISA \n     Court, I was surprised. It's not what we usually think of \n     when we think of a court. We think of a place where we can \n     go, we can watch the lawyers argue and it's subject to the \n     glare of publicity and the judges explain their decision to \n     the public and they can examine them. That's what we think of \n     as a court.\n       This is a very different and unusual institution. That was \n     my first reaction. I appreciate the reasons that it operates \n     the way it does, but it does seem to me that the departures \n     from the normal judicial model that are involved there put a \n     premium on the individuals involved.\n\n  Judge Roberts' comments, and that he went out of his way to express \nsurprise at the fact that this secret court even exists, suggests to me \nthat he would address issues related to FISA, such as government \nsecrecy and challenges to civil liberties, with an appropriately \nskeptical mindset.\n  I was troubled when Judge Roberts refused to give a fuller answer \nabout his view of the Supreme Court's decision in the Hamdi case, and I \nhave concerns about his decision as an appeals court judge in the \nHamdan case regarding military commissions. But Judge Roberts did tell \nme that he believes: ``The Bill of Rights doesn't change during times \nof war. The Bill of Rights doesn't change in times of crisis.'' I was \npleased to hear him recognize this fundamental principle.\n  I do not want to minimize the concerns that have been expressed by \nthose who oppose the nomination. I share some of them. Many of my \nmisgivings about this nomination stem from Judge Roberts' refusal to \nanswer many of our reasonable questions. Not only that, he refused to \nacknowledge that many of the positions he took as a member of the \nReagan administration team were misguided or in some cases even flat-\nout wrong.\n  I do not understand why the one person who cannot express an opinion \non virtually anything the Supreme Court has done is the person whom the \nAmerican public most needs to hear from. No one on the committee asked \nhim for a commitment on a given case or set of issues. We certainly \nrecognize that it is possible his views might change once he is on the \nCourt and hears the arguments and discusses the issues with his \ncolleagues. All of those caveats would have been perfectly appropriate. \nBut why shouldn't the committee and the public have some idea of where \nhe stands, or at least what his instincts are, on recent controversial \ndecisions?\n  Although in some areas he was more forthcoming than others, Judge \nRoberts did not answer questions that he could and should have--\nunfortunately with the full support of committee members who want to \nsmooth his confirmation--and I think that is disrespectful of the \nSenate's constitutional role. In addition, the administration's refusal \nto respond to a reasonable, limited request for documents from the time \nJudge Roberts served in the Solicitor General's office did a real \ndisservice to the country and to the nominee. My voting in favor of \nJudge Roberts does not endorse this refusal. In fact, if not for Judge \nRoberts' singular qualifications, I may have felt compelled to oppose \nhis nomination on these grounds alone. Future nominees who refuse to \nanswer reasonable questions or whose documents the administration--any \nadministration--refuses to provide should not count on my approval.\n  Also troubling was Judge Roberts' approach to the memos he wrote as a \nyoung Reagan administration lawyer. His writings from his early service \nin government were those of a very smart man who was at times a little \ntoo sure of himself and too dismissive of other viewpoints. I wanted to \nsee if the Judge Roberts of 2005 had grown from the John Roberts of \n1985, whose strong views often suggested a rigid ideological agenda. I \nwanted to see the possibility of a seasoned, wise, and just John \nRoberts on the Supreme Court, not just a more polished, shrewder \nversion of his younger self.\n  Unfortunately, he refused to disavow any of those memos, many of \nwhich laid out disturbing opinions on a variety of issues, from voting \nrights, to habeas corpus, to affirmative action. He refused to \nacknowledge that some of his tone and word choice in that era \ndemonstrated a lack of sensitivity to minorities and women, and to the \nchallenges they face. Instead, he took refuge in the argument that he \nwas simply doing his job, so we are not now supposed to infer anything \nabout his beliefs or motivations based on the memos he wrote in the \n1980s.\n  I found these arguments unpersuasive, particularly since several of \nthese memos indicate that those were, in fact, his own personal views. \nAnd I do not understand why he felt he had to defend these 20-year-old \nmemos. Maybe it was pride. Maybe it was a political strategy dictated \nby a White House that so rarely admits error. But take voting rights--\nit should have been easy for Judge Roberts to say that in retrospect he \nwas wrong about the dangers of the effects test, and that the 1982 \namendments to the Voting Rights Act that he opposed have been good for \nthe country. Instead, he said he wasn't an expert on the Voting Rights \nAct and insisted on the correctness of his position. That troubles me.\n  The John Roberts of 2005 did not have to embrace the John Roberts of \n1985, but in some cases he did, all too readily. On the other hand, I \nam not sure that the John Roberts of 1985 would have told Senator \nFeinstein with respect to affirmative action that: ``A measured effort \nthat can withstand strict scrutiny is . . . a very positive approach.'' \nHis answers to questions on affirmative action, seemed to me, on \nbalance, to be an encouraging sign that he will not undo the Court's \ncurrent approach.\n  Finally, I was unhappy with Judge Roberts' failure to recuse himself \nin the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case, once he realized he was being seriously \nconsidered for a Supreme Court nomination. It is also hard to believe, \nas Judge Roberts testified, that he does not remember precisely when \nthe possibility of an ethics violation first came to his attention. \nJudge Roberts sat on a court of appeals panel that heard the appeal of \na district court ruling that, if upheld, would have been a huge setback \nfor the administration's position on military commissions and the \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay. And he heard oral argument just 6 days \nafter interviewing for a Supreme Court appointment with the Attorney \nGeneral of the\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nUnited States, who also was a major participant in the underlying legal \njudgment of the administration that was challenged in the case. I am \ntroubled that Judge Roberts apparently didn't recognize at the time \nthat there was an ethical issue.\n  I give great weight to ethical considerations in judicial \nnominations. For example, when Judge Charles Pickering solicited \nletters of recommendation for his court of appeals nomination from \nlawyers practicing before him in the district court, I found that very \nsignificant, especially in combination with his actions in a cross \nburning case where improper ex parte contacts were alleged. But while \nthe issue raised about Judge Roberts is serious, I do not see such a \npattern with Judge Roberts, who has a long record and reputation for \nethical behavior. Nor is there evidence of the egregious, almost \naggressive unethical behavior that was present in the nomination of \nJudge Pickering.\n  I hope that Judge Roberts now understands the concerns that I and a \nnumber of respected legal ethicists have about his participation in the \nHamdan case. It is not too late for him to recuse himself and allow a \nnew panel to hear the case.\n  At the end of the day, I had to ask myself: What kind of Justice does \nthis man aspire to be? An ideologue? A lawyer's lawyer? A great Supreme \nCourt Justice like Justice Jackson, who moved comfortably from the top \nlegal positions in the Department of Justice to a judicial position in \nwhich he was more than willing to challenge executive power? A Chief \nJustice who will go down in history as the leader of a sharp \nideological turn to the right, or a consensus builder who is committed \nto the Court and its role as guarantor of basic freedoms?\n  I have talked to a number of people who know John Roberts or to \npeople who know people who know John Roberts. Those I have heard from \ndirectly or indirectly have seen him develop since 1985 into one of the \nforemost Supreme Court advocates in the Nation, whose skills and \njudgment are respected by lawyers from across the ideological spectrum. \nThey don't see him as a champion of one cause, as a narrow ideologue \nwho wants to impose his views on the country. They see him as \nopenminded, respectful, thoughtful, devoted to the law, and truly one \nof the great legal minds of his time. That carries a great deal of \nweight with me. And it helps to overcome my frustration with Judge \nRoberts for not distancing himself from what he wrote in his Reagan-era \nmemos and with the White House for refusing to release relevant \ndocuments to the committee.\n  History has shown that control of the White House, and with it the \npower to shape the courts, never stays for too long with one party. \nWhen my party retakes the White House, there may very well be a \nDemocratic John Roberts nominated to the Court, a man or woman with \noutstanding qualifications, highly respected by virtually everyone in \nthe legal community, and perhaps with a paper trail of political \nexperience or service on the progressive side of the ideological \nspectrum. When that day comes, and it will, that will be the test for \nthe Senate. And, in the end, it is one of the central reasons I will \nvote to confirm Judge John Roberts to be perhaps the last Chief Justice \nof the United States in my lifetime. This is not a matter of deference \nto the President's choice. It is instead a recognition that the Supreme \nCourt should be open to the very brightest of legal minds on either \nside of the political spectrum.\n  The position of Chief Justice demands the very highest scrutiny from \nthe Senate, and the qualifications and abilities of the nominee for \nthis position must shine through. Judge Roberts has the legal skills, \nthe intellect, and the character to be a good Chief Justice, and I hope \nhe fulfills that promise. I wish him well. May his service be a credit \nnot only to the rule of law, but also to the principles of equality and \nfreedom and justice that make this country so great.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I believe that the U.S. Constitution is \nabout protecting the rights of Americans, not about restricting those \nrights. And that is why I will vote against Judge John Roberts' \nnomination to be Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Judge Roberts and I appear to hold different views of the role that \nthe Federal Government should play in our country. I believe that \nGovernment is here to preserve rights, to protect and support our \ncitizens, and to offer opportunity to those less fortunate. Based on \nthe limited record before us, I am not convinced that John Roberts \nshares these views.\n  Though he is clearly intelligent, articulate, and accomplished, I am \ndeeply concerned that Judge Roberts' narrow and cramped view of the \nConstitution will lead inevitably to the restriction of our most scared \nrights and protections. I fear that Judge Roberts will interpret the \nConstitution so narrowly that he will reach results that are \ninconsistent with decades of well-established Supreme Court precedent.\n  From civil liberties to the ability of courts to protect minorities, \nfrom voting rights to school desegregation, from privacy to \nenvironmental protections, Judge Roberts has consistently adopted \npositions intended to limit the role of Government in a way that would \nharm all Americans.\n  I simply cannot vote to confirm a nominee who may vote to roll back \ndecades of progress and protections for our most fundamental rights. \nOur most basic rights hang in the balance and I am not prepared to \ngamble with these rights.\n  Before the hearings on Judge Roberts began, I stated that we needed \nto learn his positions on all of the important issues that face \nAmericans today, including the right to privacy, a woman's right to \nchoose, civil rights, the rights of consumers, federalism, the scope of \nexecutive power, and the Government's ability to help those who need it \nmost. I asserted that it was essential to learn Judge Roberts' position \non first amendment protections and the authority of Congress to enact \nlaws protecting the environment.\n  I also requested that the White House and Judge Roberts release \ndocuments relating to 16 cases in which he was involved from 1989 to \n1993 as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice \nDepartment. I wanted to review these documents to learn all we needed \nto know about a man selected for a lifetime appointment to the highest \nCourt in the Nation.\n  I sought this information and asked for these documents because I \nstrongly believe that Senators have both a right and a duty to evaluate \nthoroughly Supreme Court nominees. We have a right to request that the \nnominee answer relevant questions about legal philosophy and we have a \ncorresponding duty to look carefully into all aspects of the nominee's \nrecord, including his or her prior statements, memoranda, and judicial \nopinions. When faced with a nominee who has an extremely sparse record, \nas Judge Roberts does, the level of scrutiny required in evaluating \nanswers and reviewing documents must necessarily be higher.\n  Unfortunately, during 3 days of testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Roberts raised more questions than he answered. And we \nhave never been given the opportunity to review the documents requested \nfrom the Solicitor General's Office. This lack of information, when \ncoupled with Judge Roberts' early writings in which he advanced an \nexceedingly restrictive view of the civil rights laws as a lawyer in \nthe administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, \nraises serious concerns.\n  During his testimony, Judge Roberts failed to answer the most basic \nquestions about his constitutional and legal philosophy--in total, he \nrefused to answer almost 100 questions during the hearings. Judge \nRoberts also refused to distance himself from the vast majority of his \nprior, controversial writings. In failing to state his position on many \ncritical issues, Judge Roberts left us with little to go on beyond his \nprior writings and limited judicial record.\n  I have been struck, in listening to the statements of many of my \ncolleagues who have struggled with how to vote on this nomination, by \nthe simple fact that we are all guessing--guessing if Judge Roberts \nwill uphold the right to privacy, guessing if he will restrict the \nright of a woman to choose, guessing if he will uphold Federal laws \nregulating the environment, guessing if he will greatly expand \nExecutive power, and guessing if he will support the gains we have made \nin the area of civil rights during the past 40\n\n[[Page S10639]]\n\nyears. I cannot in good conscience cast a vote for the position of \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court based on conjecture.\n  My concerns about Judge Roberts' legal philosophy run deepest in the \nareas of privacy, civil rights, and federalism.\n  One of our most important liberties is the right of individuals to \nprivacy, which includes a woman's right to choose. During his hearings, \nJudge Roberts acknowledged that the due process clause of the \nConstitution encompasses the right to privacy. He also stated that he \nbelieved that the right to privacy encompasses the right of married \ncouples to access contraception as established by the Court in Griswold \nv. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965). However, beyond these broad, \ngeneralized statements supporting the constitutional underpinnings of \nthe right to privacy and the holding in Griswold, Judge Roberts failed \nto explain his views on the right to privacy.\n  When pressed with questions on the landmark 1973 decision, Roe v. \nWade, 410 U.S. 113, which extended the right to privacy recognized in \nGriswold to encompass a woman's right to choose, Judge Roberts either \nrefused to answer the questions or responded with generalizations about \nprecedent. Judge Roberts made it clear that his analysis on this issue \nstarts with the holding in the 1992 Supreme Court case, Planned \nParenthood of Connecticut v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, which held that the \nright to choose may be restricted so long as State statutes do not have \nthe purpose or effect of imposing an ``undue burden'' on a woman's \nright. In using this as his starting point, Judge Roberts leaves open \nthe strong possibility that he may vote, perhaps as early as the \nupcoming Supreme Court term, to further restrict a woman's right to \nchoose.\n\n  I cannot overlook the similarity between Judge Roberts' responses to \nquestions about a woman's right to choose and the answers given by \nJustice Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings. Like Judge \nRoberts, Justice Thomas acknowledged a right to privacy in the \nConstitution. Justice Thomas also expressed support for the decision in \nGriswold. However, once he was confirmed to the Supreme Court, Justice \nThomas argued vehemently against the existence of a general right to \nprivacy and even called for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, describing the \ndecision as ``grievously wrong.''\n  We simply cannot allow this to happen again. And we should not have \nto. We should not be in a position today where we have to guess if \nJudge Roberts will attempt to overrule Roe v. Wade or to further \nrestrict the constitutional right of all women to choose.\n  In addition to my concerns about the right to privacy, I have serious \nconcerns about Judge Roberts' views on civil rights. His record is \nextremely limited, but what little evidence we have reveals Judge \nRoberts' repeated attempts to roll back legal protections afforded to \nminorities and to those less fortunate.\n  In the area of affirmative action, Roberts urged the Reagan and the \nfirst Bush administrations to oppose affirmative action programs. \nRoberts sought to overturn established precedent supporting affirmative \naction programs and, in 1981, he fought to abolish race-and gender-\nconscious remedies for discrimination. This position was contrary to \nthe Supreme Court's ruling in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, \n443 U.S. 193 (1979), which upheld affirmative action in employment. \nDuring his confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts refused to state his \npresent position on this issue.\n  Judge Roberts also has a detailed record of opposing a broad \ninterpretation of the Voting Rights Act, which is considered one of the \nmost powerful and effective civil rights laws ever enacted. While \nworking in the Justice Department during the Reagan administration, \nJudge Roberts urged the administration to oppose a bill that allowed \ndiscrimination under section 2 of the act to be proven through a \nshowing of the discriminatory effects, and not just the discriminatory \nintent, of State voting restrictions. Congress enacted the bill over \nthe administration's objections. Judge Roberts' approach, had it been \nadopted, would have made it tremendously difficult to overturn \ndiscriminatory voting laws. Again, during his confirmation hearings, \nJudge Roberts refused to state his present position on this issue.\n  Judge Roberts' record in the area of access to education is also \ntroubling. In prior writings, Judge Roberts expressed opposition to the \nSupreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), wherein \nthe Court ruled that the Constitution mandates that all children, \nincluding the children of undocumented immigrants, have the same access \nto education. Again, during his confirmation hearings, Judge Roberts \nrefused to state his present position on this issue.\n  Additionally, memoranda written by Judge Roberts during his tenure at \nthe Department of Justice raise concerns about his eagerness to deny \nthe Supreme Court the power to decide questions of constitutional \ninterpretation and subsequent remedies. In one writing, Judge Roberts \nargued that Congress had the power to strip courts of the power to \ndesegregate schools through busing in the wake of Brown v. Board of \nEducation, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). During his hearings, Judge Roberts \nneither stated his present view on this issue nor distanced himself \nfrom his prior writings.\n  Had Judge Roberts' views prevailed on these civil rights issues or on \nother similar issues during his tenure in the Reagan and George H.W. \nBush administrations, we would today live in a far different world. It \nwould be a world with fewer protections for minorities, women, and \npeople with disabilities.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Roberts' views on the power of the \nFederal Government to pass legislation under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. Although Judge Roberts' record is sparse, his dissent \nfrom a full court opinion denying a rehearing en banc in Rancho Viejo, \nLLC v. Norton, 334 F.3d 1158 (2003), causes concern. Judge Roberts was \none of only two judges on the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit to challenge the decision of the panel to uphold the \nconstitutionality of the Endangered Species Act. Although Judge Roberts \nallowed in a footnote that there could be alternative grounds on which \nthe full DC Circuit might uphold the constitutionality of the Act, his \nopinion demonstrates a narrow view of Congress's power to legislate \nunder the commerce clause.\n  I am concerned that, based upon this critical view of Federal power, \nJudge Roberts may vote to limit Congress's authority to enact laws that \nhelp all American citizens. In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nthe role of the Federal Government in protecting all Americans, and \nparticularly those less fortunate, has never been clearer. Congress \nmust have the power to assist those in need, and to help citizens \nduring times of natural and manmade disasters.\n  I am mindful of Judge Roberts' frequent statements that he would \napproach the law with modesty and restraint. However, we have never \nlearned the reference point for this modesty and restraint. The \nstarting point in this inquiry is as important as the ending point, for \neither can dictate the result. It is difficult to tell from Judge \nRoberts' testimony and writings whether, in exercising restraint, Judge \nRoberts would be deferring to the original intent of the Founders, \nSupreme Court precedent, the contemporary understanding of the \nConstitution, or something else entirely. Without this information, we \nare unable to meaningfully understand Judge Roberts' judicial \nphilosophy.\n  If he begins at the point where Justices Scalia and Thomas do, Judge \nRoberts would view judicial restraint and modesty as adherence to a \nstatic, narrow, antiquated, and inaccurate originalist view of the \nConstitution that fails to acknowledge the realities of modern America. \nThis form of ``modesty'' and ``restraint'', followed by Justices Scalia \nand Thomas, quite openly seeks to overrule the accomplishments of much \nof our Supreme Court jurisprudence during the past 200 years. Justices \nScalia and Thomas believe that they exercise judicial restraint when \nthey attempt to overturn Supreme Court precedent such as Roe v. Wade on \nthe ground that it is inconsistent with their own originalist \nunderstanding of the Constitution. Although they may call this modesty \nand restraint, this view of the Constitution is\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\nneither modest nor restrained; rather, it is a form of judicial \nactivism as aggressive as any the Court has ever seen.\n  I have carefully weighed my concerns in light of my constitutional \nduty as a U.S. Senator. And I have concluded that, fundamentally, I \ncannot vote yes without being confident that Judge Roberts will not \nvote to roll back the protections and rights our Nation fought so hard \nto attain.\n  I am deeply mindful that we must never become so cynical or political \nthat we fail to do what is best for the citizens of our Nation. And \nthat means that we must place the value of an independent judiciary \nabove the partisan politics of the day. That also means that we must \nnot be afraid to stand up to the President and vote against a nominee \nwho puts us in a position of guessing about his constitutional and \nlegal philosophy.\n  We must never forget that our Supreme Court depends, first and \nforemost, on the Justices who hear arguments and issue rulings each and \nevery day. As all Americans know, the Supreme Court is the highest \nCourt in the United States. This is the Court that issues final rulings \non many of the most important issues of our time, ones that touch the \nlives of all Americans. Therefore, it is essential that we know the \nviews of each and every person whom we approve for a lifetime \nappointment to the Supreme Court.\n  There is no question that Judge John Roberts will get an up-or-down \nvote in the full Senate. However, that does not mean that he will get \nmy vote. I will only vote to confirm Justices who will uphold \nestablished precedent and understand that the Constitution is about \nprotecting rights, not about restricting them.\n  The stakes are simply too high to guess about the future of our \nfundamental rights and protections.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nJudge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts is a man of integrity whose reputation is irrefutable. \nHe has been widely praised for his affable and humble personality as \nwell as his integrity and intellect. Judge Roberts is already greatly \nrespected by his colleagues and current Supreme Court Justices who know \nhim as a leading advocate before that Court.\n  I believe that Judge Roberts is eminently qualified for this \nposition. He earned both his bachelor's degree and his law degree from \nHarvard University. In fact, after earning his bachelor's degree summa \ncum laude, he managed to earn his law degree magna cum laude while \nserving as the editor of the Harvard Law Review. Following graduation, \nJudge Roberts earned a clerkship on the Supreme Court for the late \nChief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  Since that time, Judge Roberts has had a long and distinguished \ncareer of service to this country, including serving as an attorney in \nthe Office of the Solicitor General. Most recently, he served as a \njudge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, widely considered the second \nmost powerful court in the Nation. During his service on the court, he \nhas been consistent and fair.\n  Judge Roberts has also been a private practice attorney representing \nthe full range of clients before the Supreme Court. He has argued \nbefore the Supreme Court 39 times, an impressive record even if you do \nnot consider the fact that his client prevailed in 25 of those cases. \nIn fact, Judge Roberts is widely considered by his colleagues to be one \nof the most accomplished attorneys to argue before the Supreme Court.\n  For some time I have been concerned that our judiciary was being \noverwhelmed by activist judges who attempt to legislate from the bench. \nThey appear to make decisions based upon political philosophy and twist \nthe words of our Forefathers and of Congress to serve their ideological \ngoals.\n  We do not need judges who will make their own laws and interpret the \nConstitution based on one political philosophy or another. Rather, we \nmust insist on judges who maintain a fair and judicious tone--judges \nwho rule without the influence of ideology or personal opinion.\n  After 20 hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nbelieve the Nation learned a great deal about how Judge Roberts views \nthe judicial role and what kind of service he will provide the Nation \nas Chief Justice. Judge Roberts is a skilled lawyer who understands and \nrespects the Constitution. I believe he understands that the role of \nthe judiciary is to interpret the law--not make law. It is clear from \nhis testimony that his goal will be to fairly and effectively interpret \nthe Constitution and the law without prejudice and with the utmost \nrespect for the rule of law.\n  I commend President Bush for his continued efforts to put judges in \nplace who respect the rule of law. I believe that Judge Roberts is a \nshining example of this type of jurist, and there is no doubt in my \nmind that he should be confirmed as our country's 17th Chief Justice, \nand I am proud to support his nomination.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is a critical time in our Nation's \nhistory. For the first time in more than a decade, we have not just one \nbut two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court. Sandra Day \nO'Conner, the first woman justice and often the critical deciding vote, \nis retiring, and Chief Justice Rehnquist, who served on the Court for \nmore than 33 years, passed away after a courageous battle with cancer.\n  The two nominees who will receive these lifetime appointments will \ndramatically impact the direction of the Court for decades to come and \nwill shape decisions that will affect the rights and freedoms of all \nAmericans.\n  Furthermore, the new Chief Justice will play a unique and critical \nrole. He will lead the Court. The new Chief Justice will set the \ninitial agenda of what cases should be considered, and assign the \njustice who will write the majority opinion when he or she is a part of \nthe majority. He will be the most powerful judge in the country.\n  We all understand that the U.S. Senate has a constitutional \nobligation to ``advise and consent'' on all Federal judicial nominees. \nUnlike other nominations that come before the Senate, judicial \nnominations are lifetime appointments. These are not decisions that \nwill affect our courts for 3 or 4 years but for 30 or 40 years, making \nit even more important for the Senate to act carefully and responsibly.\n  I am one of the newer Members of this chamber. In fact, I rank 74th \nin seniority. I don't have the 20 year voting history on Supreme Court \nnominees that many of my colleagues do. I didn't vote on the \nnominations of Justices Scalia, Ginsburg, O'Connor or Thomas.\n  But I bring a different kind of history to this Chamber. I am the \nfirst woman U.S. Senator in history from the State of Michigan. My \noffice is next door to the Sewell Belmont house, where Alice Paul and \nLucy Burns planned their suffrage marches and fought to get women the \nright to vote.\n  I can see it from my window and every day I am reminded of what the \nwomen before me went through so that I could speak on the Senate floor \ntoday. I feel the same responsibility to fight against discrimination \nand for equal rights, for the women that will come after me.\n  I take this responsibility very seriously and have closely studied \nJudge Roberts' writings and testimony at the Judiciary Committee \nhearings. I commend Senators Specter and Leahy for conducting the \nhearings in a civil and bipartisan manner.\n  The Judiciary Committee hearings were the only opportunity for \nAmericans to hear directly from Judge Roberts on issues and concerns \nthat impact their daily lives, and to find out what a ``Roberts Court'' \nmight look like. Unfortunately, Judge Roberts refused to answer many of \nthe questions that are on the minds of most Americans.\n  However, the American people are being asked to hire Judge Roberts \nfor this lifetime job without knowing the answers to most of the \ninterview questions. This problem has been exacerbated by the White \nHouse's refusal to share even a limited number of documents from Judge \nRoberts' time as Deputy Solicitor General.\n  The Constitution grants all Americans the same rights, liberties and \nfreedoms under the law. These are the sacred, bedrock values upon which \nthe United States of America was founded. And we count on the Supreme \nCourt to protect these constitutional rights at all times, whether they \nare popular or not.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Roberts refused to answer most substantive \nquestions\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\nabout how he would protect our fundamental constitutional rights. \nBecause of his failure to answer questions on the major legal issues of \nour time in a forthright manner, I feel compelled to base my decision \non his writings and opinions.\n  When you closely examine these documents, you see a forceful and \ninstinctive opposition toward protecting the fundamental rights of all \nAmericans. In case after case, Judge Roberts argued that the \nConstitution did not protect workers, voters, women, minorities and \npeople with disabilities from discrimination. He also argued that the \nConstitution does not firmly establish the right of privacy for all \nAmericans.\n  In all of his memos, writings and briefs, Judge Roberts took the view \nthat the Constitution only protects Americans in the most narrow and \ntechnical ways, and does not convey to us fundamental rights, liberties \nand freedoms. Because of these views, after much deliberation, I have \nconcluded that Judge Roberts is the wrong choice for a lifetime \nappointment as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Roberts is certainly an intelligent man with a record of public \nservice. However, that alone does not qualify him to lead the entire \nthird branch of our government. I believe that his writings reveal a \nphilosophy that undermines our most cherished and fundamental rights, \nliberties and freedoms as Americans, and for that reason, I will be \nvoting no on his nomination.\n  The Supreme Court decides cases that have a broad impact on American \njobs and the economy. Manufacturing is the backbone of Michigan's \neconomy, and these court decisions will affect the livelihood of the \nfamilies, workers and businesses I represent. We in Michigan need to \nknow whether Judge Roberts will stand with us and with our families or \nbe on the side of major special interests who were his clients in the \nprivate sector.\n  Right now, we are feeling the full impact of price-gouging and oil \ncompany monopolies at the gas pumps. But Americans don't know what \nJudge Roberts' views are of antitrust and consumer protection laws that \npunish these illegal corporate practices. How will he rule on cases \ndealing with insider-trading, anti-competitive business behavior and \nother kinds of corporate fraud to prevent another Enron?\n  We don't know if he supports basic consumer protections like \npatients' rights to receive a second doctor's opinion if their HMO \ntries to deny them treatment. Judge Roberts fought against these \npatients' right when he represented HMOs in private practice and \nAmericans are entitled to know where he stands on this issue.\n\n  Americans need to know where Judge Roberts stands on worker \nprotections under the Family and Medical Leave Act. And will Judge \nRoberts rule to protect their pensions and retirement benefits? We \ndon't have the answers to these basic questions.\n  The foundation of our democracy is the belief that all people are \ncreated equal and that every American deserves an equal opportunity for \na good education, good job, and a good life. The Supreme Court will be \ndeciding cases that have an enormous impact on our civil rights \nprotections and this fundamental American notion of equality.\n  As a lawyer in the Reagan administration, Judge Roberts argued \nagainst some of the most basic civil rights protections such as \nworkplace discrimination laws and strengthening the Voting Rights Act. \nWhen he was asked if he disagreed with any of those positions today, \nJudge Roberts said he was just reflecting the administration's views, \nand refused to provide any clarity on his own personal views.\n  However these memos expressed more than just the administration's \nposition; they included Judge Roberts' own extreme views on everything \nfrom school desegregation to title IX.\n  When urging the Attorney General to step up efforts to oppose \nlegislation to strengthen the Voting Rights Act, Judge Roberts wrote, \n``My own view is that something must be done to educate the Senators on \nthe seriousness of this problem.'' This legislation ultimately passed \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  In memos, he referred to the ``purported gender gap'' and ``the \ncanard that women are discriminated against because they receive $0.59 \nto every $1.00 earned by men. . . .'' In response to an equal pay \nletter from three Republican congresswomen, Roberts wrote, ``I honestly \nfind it troubling that three Republican representatives are so quick to \nembrace such a radical redistributive concept. Their slogan may as well \nbe `from each according to his ability, to each according to her \ngender.' ''\n  As special assistant, Roberts criticized the Labor Department's \naffirmative action program and referred to the policies which required \n``employers who contract with the government to engage in race and sex \nconscious affirmative action as a condition of doing business with the \ngovernment'' as ``offensive.'' Roberts wrote: ``Under our view of the \nlaw it is not enough to say that blacks and women have been \nhistorically discriminated against as groups and are therefore entitled \nto special preferences.''\n  What is particularly troublesome is not just the content of these \nwritings but his tone toward these issues--one that is disrespectful. \nAnd one which Judge Roberts refused to disavow during the hearings.\n  As Senator Feinstein, the only woman on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee said, ``If Judge Roberts had provided different answers to \nthese questions, he could have easily demonstrated to us that wisdom \ncomes with age, and a sense of his own autonomy. But he did neither.''\n  These are opinions and attitudes that will have an impact on real \npeople's lives. And Judge Roberts' opinion matters.\n  They will affect whether or not we have admissions policies that \npromote diversity at our Nation's universities and policies that help \nminority-owned and women-owned businesses compete for government \ncontracts.\n  They will determine how well our antidiscrimination laws are enforced \nto protect all Americans from housing discrimination, abusive work \nenvironments, sexual harassment, discriminatory hiring policies, and \nsexism in education and collegiate sports under title IX.\n  And they will determine whether our most fundamental democratic \nright--the right to vote--is protected.\n  As Chief Justice, Judge Roberts would decide in case after case, \nwhether these principals of equal opportunity and equal protection \nshould be upheld and whether these laws should be enforced.\n  The constitutional right to privacy is one of the most fundamental \nrights we have as Americans. At its core, it is about the role of \ngovernment in the most personal of family decisions. It is about a \nwoman's right to make her own reproductive choices and a couple's right \nto use contraception.\n  But it is also about keeping medical records private to prevent them \nfrom being used against Americans in their jobs or when they are trying \nto get health insurance. It is about a parent's right to send their \nchild to the school of their choice. And it is about the role of \ngovernment in right-to-die cases, as the nation witnessed in the Terry \nSchiavo case.\n  Our constitutional right to privacy is a complicated and often \npolitically charged area of the law. It is extremely important that a \nSupreme Court nominee approach this issue as a fair and independent-\nminded jurist who will uphold settled law, and not approach it with a \npolitically motivated agenda.\n  While Judge Roberts acknowledged that a right to privacy exists, he \nrefused to explain what he believes that right actually encompasses. \nLike Justice Thomas in his testimony before the committee, Judge \nRoberts refused to say whether he believed the right to privacy \nextended beyond a married couple's right to contraception. Senator \nSchumer asked Judge Roberts whether he agreed that there is a \n``general'' right to privacy provided in the Constitution. Roberts' \nresponse was, ``I wouldn't use the phrase `general,' because I don't \nknow what that means.''\n  He repeatedly refused to answer whether the right to privacy protects \na woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, and like many \nwomen across the country, I was very disappointed that he was evasive \nin answering this important privacy question.\n  How Judge Roberts will approach and decide these questions of law \nwill have a profound impact on not just our lives but on the lives of \nour children and grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\n  I had hoped that the hearings would give us insight into his legal \nreasoning and judicial philosophy on all of these important issues. And \nI strongly believe that the American people deserve these answers. This \nisn't a decision that should be based on guesswork or a leap of faith.\n  So all we have to go on are Judge Roberts' own writings over the past \n25 years. Based on this record, I cannot in good conscience cast my \nvote for John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme \nCourt.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Judge Roberts came before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee earlier this month as a very well respected judge \nwith a sterling academic record and a remarkable legal career. He left \nthe Judiciary Committee with that reputation intact, if not enhanced. I \nhave enormous respect for Judge Roberts' legal talents. They are \nundeniable. As a result, I supported his nomination last week in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  It is for this reason, his distinguished career and his sterling \nreputation as a lawyer and a judge, that I will vote my hopes today and \nnot my fears and support Judge Roberts' nomination for Chief Justice of \nthe United States.\n  During a private meeting with him, as well as through four impressive \ndays of testimony, Judge Roberts made clear that he will be a modest \njudge. He assures us that he will address each case on its merits and \napproach each argument with an open mind. He recognized that judges \nshould not substitute their policy preferences for those of Congress, \nand I agree.\n  Judge Roberts sees a clear boundary to the judge's role. He told us \nrepeatedly that his personal views about issues did not matter. He \nassured us that he will not be an activist; and that he will rarely, if \never, look to overturn precedent. Rather, precedent, not his version of \nhow the law should be, will mark the beginning of his constitutional \nanalysis.\n  Judge Roberts recognizes a right to privacy in the Constitution, and \nhe understands that people have come to rely on it. He made clear his \nagreement with the cases on the right to privacy that led to the \nCourt's decisions in Roe and Casey.\n  Judge Roberts rejected ``originalist'' or a ``literalist'' \nphilosophies. He does not bind the Constitution to narrow \ninterpretations of the past. Too many judicial activists have used this \nphilosophy to limit our rights and freedoms. Judge Roberts believes \nthat as society evolves, our interpretation of the Constitution must \nevolve with it.\n  We choose to take Judge Roberts at his word, and believe that those \nwords will bind him throughout his tenure on the Court. Ultimately, \nJudge Roberts persuaded us that he will be the Chief Justice we saw \nduring his hearing, not the Chief Justice that his critics see in his \npast.\n  Nonetheless, the decision was not an easy one. While I support \nmoderation in judicial temperament, I do not support inaction in the \nface of injustice. I worry that a Court full of neutral umpires would \nnot have decided Brown v. Board of Education or other cases in which \nthe Court moved America forward. Modesty is to be respected to a point, \nbut not when it stands in the way of progress. Historically, the courts \nhave often succeeded when our democratically-elected branches could \nnot.\n  However, Judge Roberts testified, and I do not disagree, that his \nconfirmation to replace Chief Justice Rehnquist will not radically \nshift the balance of the Court. If he had been nominated, as he was \noriginally, to replace Justice O'Connor then his confirmation would \nhave moved the Court to the right. That would have been a much more \ndifficult decision. It is my hope that the White House recognizes this \nconcern when they choose their next nominee.\n  In considering my decision, I was troubled by parts of Judge Roberts' \nrecord, but I was impressed by the man himself. I will support him as a \nChief Justice who will keep an open mind and reject ideological \nextremism and simplistic approaches to interpreting the Constitution. I \nwill vote my hopes and not my fears.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., to be Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court.\n  In Judge Roberts the Nation is presented with a nominee who possesses \nan extraordinary intellect, a modest temperament, and a steady hand. I \nsee in him the will and the ability to seek common ground among the \nJustices of the Court on important national issues. And I believe he \npossesses sufficient humility, as a man and as a judge, to be mindful \nof the powerful impact of his actions on the lives of average \nAmericans.\n  Four days of intensive hearings allowed all of us, and much of \nAmerica, to come to know something of John Roberts and to observe and \nassess what we don't know.\n  None of us can fully fathom the matters that will be determined, and \nthe people who will be affected, by a judge with lifetime tenure on the \nhighest Court of the land. John Roberts today very likely becomes the \nChief Justice of a generation.\n  It is not surprising that this President would select a nominee with \nwhom I disagree on some important issues, particularly as articulated \nin his early policy work. But it is reassuring, and ultimately \ndeterminative, that the President has selected a nominee who asserts \nwith conviction, supported by the record, that he is not an ideologue, \nthat he takes precedent as established law and people and cases as they \ncome before him. I take him at his word, and trust that in interpreting \nand applying the law he will be his own man.\n  Yet once a nominee's high credentials and unimpeachable integrity \nhave been established, the selection of a Supreme Court justice further \ndemands of us a leap of faith. And it is in that leap of faith that we \nmust attempt to know more: Who is he as a person? What is his \nunderstanding of the human condition? Does he take seriously our \nfundamental responsibility to people as well as to legal concepts?\n  Judge Roberts and I had the opportunity to meet in recent days to \ndiscuss his nomination. We had a good, long talk about West Virginia \nand our country and the people who make America great.\n  In talking with Judge Roberts I looked for assurance that when he \ntackles the grave questions that will come before his Court, he will \nconsider fully the lives of average people, the lives of those in need \nand those whose voices often are not heard, the lives of working men \nand women, children, the elderly, our veterans.\n  Judge Roberts listened. He is a careful and attentive listener. And, \nI want my fellow West Virginians to know, Judge Roberts shared that his \ngrandfather was a coal miner and his father worked in the steel mills, \nand that he is, in fact, mindful of the awesome responsibility he faces \ntoward all Americans, from all walks of life, equally and unequivocally \ndeserving of the rights and protections of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Constitution grants the Senate the \npower and responsibility to advise and consent on the President's \njudicial nominations. And there is no more important judicial \nnomination than Chief Justice of the United States.\n  The President and Congress share responsibility for the makeup of the \nthird branch. The President nominates a candidate to be a Federal \njudge, and the Senate is required to give its advice and consent for \nthat nominee to be placed on the bench. It is a shared function; the \nSenate is not merely a rubber stamp for a President's nominee.\n  To evaluate a nominee, Congress must be informed about that nominee. \nWe are not supposed to consent first and be informed later.\n  In the case of Judge Roberts, we cannot make an informed judgment \nbecause he was so evasive at his hearing. During his confirmation \nhearing, Judge Roberts declined to answer questions more than 90 times. \nThe Senate and the American people deserve to know more about an \nindividual who will lead our Nation's judiciary for decades to come.\n  Despite numerous efforts by members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the Bush administration was not forthcoming. Not a single \ndocument from the years when Roberts was deputy Solicitor General was \nmade available.\n  To be deprived of important information left me unable to give \ninformed consent. The Constitution requires the\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\nSenate to advise and consent on these lifetime appointments, not to \nconsent first and advise later.\n  However, there are some things we do know about John Roberts. We know \nthat as an attorney for the Reagan and first Bush administrations, his \nwritings on many issues relating to women's rights were disturbing for \nthose concerned about such matters. In an official memo to the Attorney \nGeneral, Roberts wrote about the ``so-called right to privacy.'' In the \nSupreme Court case Rust v. Sullivan, Roberts co-authored a brief that \ndeclared Roe v. Wade was ``wrongly decided'' and should be overturned. \nAt his hearings, Mr. Roberts refused to clarify whether he still would \nvote to overturn Roe.\n  Roberts also wrote of a ``perceived'' gender bias in the workplace. A \n``perceived'' bias?\n  I know that Roberts admitted in his confirmation hearings that there \nhas been discrimination against women in the past. He had to say that. \nBut did he really once believe such a bias was merely ``perceived,'' \nand could he still believe that today?\n  Let me tell my colleague, about gender bias that was not perceived. \nWhen my father died at an early age, my mother was left a young widow. \nI watched her struggle to make her way in the workplace. She never got \nthe same opportunities for advancement as men. She was very successful \nas an insurance sales person, but she was told that after the war, the \ncompany she worked for would be unable to continue her employment. Her \nmanager told her, ``You know, we don't hire women for these jobs,'' and \nthus she was terminated.\n  The views of John Roberts portray a judge who could also undermine \nimportant protections for the environment and minorities. In his 2 \nyears as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, for \ninstance, Mr. Roberts did not support congressional powers to use the \ncommerce clause of our Constitution to pass clean air and clean water \nregulations.\n  While working for President Reagan, Roberts opposed a bill in \nCongress that would have strengthened the protections of the Voting \nRights Act. Memos from the 1980s also show that Roberts supported the \nReagan administration's opposition to measures initiated to redress \npast racial discrimination.\n  John Roberts has said that when writing many of these memos in \nRepublican administrations, he was merely a staff attorney, just doing \nhis job, advocating the position of his client. He claims that these \nmemos do not necessarily reflect his views.\n  Yet, when the Judiciary Committee gave him ample opportunities to \nclarify exactly which memos expressed his views and which ones did not, \nhe declined to answer.\n  So, even though Mr. Roberts had ample opportunity to answer the \nquestions of the Judiciary Committee, we are still uncertain what he \nreally believes.\n  I believe the risk is too great to support the confirmation of a \nChief Justice to the United States Supreme Court, the highest-ranking \nleader in the judicial branch of our Government.\n  The fact that he is an intelligent and experienced fellow isn't \nenough. That is not enough for me to be able to reassure the people of \nNew Jersey that he would preserve and protect their rights. I don't \nknow some things that I need to know and some of the things that I do \nknow are disconcerting. I will therefore oppose his confirmation.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, Judge John Roberts is indeed an outstanding \nchoice to be the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. He is one of \nour Nation's top legal minds, and as the American public has learned, \nhe is a man of great intelligence and skill who will serve our country \nwith the same integrity that has been the hallmark of his professional \ncareer.\n  In fact, it is hard to think of anyone who is more qualified to lead \nthis Nation's High Court. Soon after graduating magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law, where he was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review, \nRoberts clerked for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist--a man he learned \nmuch from and deeply admired for 25 years. He went on to work in \nvarious legal capacities in the Reagan administration and later went \ninto private practice. Just 2 ago, the Senate confirmed Roberts for a \nseat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  In his distinguished career, including his tenure as a government \nlawyer, Roberts has argued a remarkable 39 cases before the Supreme \nCourt. The issues at the heart of these cases have spanned the legal \nspectrum--from healthcare law to Indian law, environmental law to labor \nlaw, and many, many other areas of the law as well.\n  In his Senate confirmation hearings last week, John Roberts \nreinforced that he will be the kind of Chief Justice America needs and \ndeserves. Undergoing hours upon hours of questioning, Judge Roberts \nmaintained a steady, even temperament. He politely and respectfully \nanswered more than 500 questions--and amazingly without much of a \nglance at notes. Most importantly, Judge Roberts revealed a great deal \nabout how he views the judicial role. He emphasized that he is \ncommitted to the rule of law, not to his personal preferences or views. \nHe emphasized his belief that judges are not politicians or legislators \nand that the role of a judge is limited. I wholeheartedly agree with \nJudge Roberts' assessment of the appropriate role of judges, and I am \nconfident that he will strictly uphold the law and not attempt to \nlegislate his own personal views from the bench.\n  I can think of no vote more important, save a declaration of war, \nthan giving advice and consent to a nominee for Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. This has been a fair process, and the Judiciary \nCommittee held extensive and meaningful hearings. Over the course of \nthe last week, the Senate has conducted a spirited debate on the \nqualifications of John Roberts to be the next Chief Justice. And today, \nwe will give him an up or down vote.\n  I am very pleased that my colleagues have proceeded expeditiously on \nthe nomination of Judge Roberts, as it is of utmost importance that \nthis nation's High Court have a new Chief Justice before the start of \nthe Court's fall term.\n  For many in this Chamber, today's vote will be the only time in their \nentire Senate careers that they provide advice and consent on a nominee \nto be Chief Justice. I commend my colleagues who have risen above the \nnormal day-to-day politics of this institution. But still, there are \nsome of you who question how Judge Roberts will vote on specific cases \nin the future. Others of you may also be swayed by the passions of \npartisans.\n  But none have questioned Judge Robert's integrity. None have \nquestioned his temperament. None have questioned his intellectual \nability. And none have questioned his qualifications. These are the \ntraditional measures the Senate has looked to when evaluating a \njudicial nomination of this importance. I would ask that my fellow \nSenators look to these time-tested standards and vote to confirm John \nRoberts as Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will vote for the nomination of John \nRoberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States. He is \nintelligent with an impressive educational background; extensive \nexperience arguing before the Supreme Court; and distinguished public \nservice experience at the highest levels of government. Based on his \nresume, he has the qualifications to be Chief Justice.\n  But a nominee's resume alone is not automatic grounds for \nconfirmation to any office. The Senate has a duty to delve more deeply \nbeyond a nominee's paper record. So while Judge Roberts's credentials \nare clearly impressive, I still had concerns about his original \nnomination to the Court.\n  My concern lay in the fact that Judge Roberts was originally \nnominated to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who in her 24 years on \nthe court brought a voice of moderation and balance to an increasingly \npolarized body. She wrote opinions that surprised and outraged both the \nright and the left; proof positive that she was not grinding a \nparticular political ax or was beholden to one unbending judicial \nphilosophy. She judged and considered both sides of a case and the law \ncarefully and was more interested in getting the case right than \npushing a particular agenda.\n  Justice O'Connor understood, just as Potter Stewart did before her, \nthat power on the Court lay in the center, not at the extremes. Judge \nRoberts was about to replace that all-important center. I was not sure \nwhich way he would go. In the wake of William Rehnquist's death, my \nconcerns for this nominee deepened.\n  We had seen far right wing conservative ideologues nominated for \nthese life-long positions on the Federal bench. Democrats fought for \ngreater consultation with the President about them, only to be met with \nthe ``nuclear\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\noption.'' Fortunately, a group of my colleagues and I were able to \nreach agreement to avoid this outcome; we were called the Gang of 14. \nJudge Roberts's nomination was going to be the first major test of this \nagreement.\n  When I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Roberts, he was able to \nrelieve some of my concerns, enough that I knew we would not have to \nconsider a filibuster. He struck me in two ways. First, he described \nhis judicial philosophy as modest. Modesty is not a word that gets used \nto describe public figures in Washington, DC, that often. He saw the \nrole of a judge as being limited. As he said in his opening remarks \nbefore his hearing: ``I come before the committee with no agenda. I \nhave no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do \ncertain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda, but I do have a \ncommitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront every case with an open \nmind.'' He further said that the legitimacy of a judge's role is \nconfined to interpreting the law and not making it.\n  The second thing that impressed me in our meeting was his \nappreciation that for many in this country the Supreme Court is seen as \nthe last hope they have to ensure that their rights are not taken away. \nEarlier this year, as my colleagues will remember the Senate finally \nwent on record apologizing for lynching. James Allen's book ``Without \nSanctuary'' described in vivid black and white photos and prose the \nacts of barbarism that were used to terrorize African Americans in our \nNation's not too distant past.\n\n  I showed this book to Judge Roberts and he was visibly moved. He told \nme that he never wanted to forget that the courts were there to protect \nthe powerless. Lynching victims did not get due process of law, even \nthough many of the mobs had law enforcement officers in their midst, \nand often acted to avenge some perceived crime. Those victims did not \nget a jury trial with the right to face their accusers as called for \nunder the Constitution.\n  I came away from this meeting believing he will treat all people who \ncome before the Court with respect. That every argument would receive \nfair consideration because for the party making that argument a \ntremendous amount could be at stake.\n  I am well aware of the criticism of Judge Roberts's earlier writings \nboth those we have seen and several we have not. Some of the things he \nwrote while a young lawyer in the Reagan White House and Justice \nDepartments indicate that he was hostile to civil rights, women's \nrights, the Voting Rights Act, and the right of privacy. While he was \nin the Solicitor General's office he wrote a brief suggesting that Roe \nv. Wade be overruled.\n  In thinking about these writings and what they mean for who he is \nnow, I was reminded of something that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes \nonce said: ``The character of every act depends upon the circumstances \nin which it is done.'' I chose to look at Judge Roberts's earlier \nwritings in the same light. When Judge Roberts wrote those things he \nwas a young lawyer who came to the Reagan Administration fresh from a \nprestigious clerkship with then Associate Justice William Rehnquist. He \nwas a young conservative working at the highest levels of power in our \ncountry for a conservative icon, President Reagan. In those positions \nhe was an advocate for the administration and the President's agenda at \nthe time.\n  His most recent experience in private practice has changed his views \non the role of the court, the law, and the needs of individuals. He \npointed out to me that he has represented a wide range of clients in \nhis private practice: large and small businesses, indigent defendants, \nand State governments. Each one, he said, deserved a careful analysis \nof their position and how the law would apply to their case. He took \nthat approach to his current work on the Court of appeals.\n  I believe that Judge Roberts has taken to heart another observation \nby Oliver Wendell Holmes and that is, ``to have doubted one's own first \nprinciples is the mark of a civilized man.'' Judge Roberts, I am sure \nwould look back on his earlier writings and understand that he must \nrevisit them in light of the new responsibilities he is about to \nundertake.\n  In the weeks leading up to the confirmation hearings, there was a \ngreat deal of discussion and criticism of the administration for not \nturning over memoranda Judge Roberts wrote while he was Deputy \nSolicitor General at the Department of Justice. I was disappointed that \nthe administration was not more forthcoming with these documents. I \nhope in the future we can reach an accommodation of some kind so that \nSenators will have complete information on a nominee. But the fact that \nwe do not have these memos is not enough to keep this highly qualified \nnominee from becoming our next Chief Justice.\n  I want to congratulate Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for \nthe quality of the hearings they held for this nominee. The questioning \nwas tough, but fair, and the committee performed its work with dignity. \nThe hearing record gave us plenty of information to go on in making our \ndecisions about this nominee. The qualities that every member of the \nJudiciary Committee saw in Judge Roberts, I saw firsthand in our \nmeeting.\n  John Roberts is an excellent nominee who will be a fine Chief \nJustice. I encourage President Bush to send us a similarly qualified, \nmodest, fair nominee to replace Justice O'Connor. The White House \nreached out to many Senators before naming Judge Roberts and I hope the \nadministration will continue to build on that approach for this next \nnominee. I fully expect the President to nominate a conservative to \nfill Justice O'Connor's seat, but I also expect that nominee to be \nfair. Judge Roberts has set a very high bar. I hope the next nominee \nmeets that standard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Senators cast many important votes--\nvotes to strengthen our highway system, or to implement a comprehensive \nenergy strategy, for example--but it is not often we cast a vote that \nis both important and truly historic. We do so, however, when we vote \non whether to confirm a nominee to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  There have been 9,869 Members of the House of Representatives, 1,884 \nSenators, and 43 Presidents of the United States, but only 16 Chief \nJustices. On average, each Chief Justice serves for well over a decade. \nOur last Chief Justice served for 19 years, a little short of two \ndecades. The occupant of the ``center seat'' on the Court often has had \na profound impact on the shape and substance of our legal system. But \ndespite such profound effects, the position of Chief Justice actually \ngot off to a rather inauspicious start.\n  The Constitution of the United States mentions the position of Chief \nJustice only once. Interestingly, it does not do so in Article III, \nwhich establishes the judicial branch of our Government. Rather, the \nConstitution refers to the position of Chief Justice, almost in \npassing, only in Article I, which sets forth the powers of the \nlegislative branch.\n  There, in section 3, clause 6, it discusses the Senate's procedures \nfor a trial of an impeached President, stating that ``When the \nPresident of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall \npreside.'' That is the sum and substance of his constitutional \nauthority.\n  The Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the Federal court \nsystem, did not add much to the Chief Justice's responsibilities. It \nspecified merely that ``the supreme court of the United States shall \nconsist of a chief justice and five associate justices.''\n  It is not surprising, then, that the position of Chief Justice \ninitially was not viewed as particularly important. Indeed, the first \nChief Justice, John Jay, left completely disillusioned, believing that \nneither the Court nor the post would ever amount to very much.\n  It took George Washington four tries to find Jay's successor, as \nprominent people repeatedly turned him down. They were turning down \nGeorge Washington's offers to make them the Chief Justice of the United \nStates.\n  With such humble constitutional roots for the office, the power, \nprestige, and independence of the Supreme Court and the Federal court \nsystem in general often has been tied to the particular personal \nqualities of those who have served as Chief Justice.\n  John Marshall was our first great Chief Justice. His twin legacies \nwere to increase respect for the Court and, relatedly, its power as \nwell. He worked to\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\nestablish clear, unanimous opinions for the Court, and his opinion in \nMarbury v. Madison forever cemented the Court as a coequal branch of \nGovernment.\n  Marshall's successes were viewed, then as now, as a function of his \nformidable personal qualities. He is said to have had a ``first-class \nmind and a thoroughly engaging personality.'' Thomas Jefferson, for \nexample, tried, in vain, to break his influence on the Court. In \nwriting to James Madison, his successor, about Supreme Court \nappointments, Jefferson said:\n\n       [I]t will be difficult to find a character of firmness to \n     preserve his independence on the same bench with Marshall.\n\n  That is Thomas Jefferson speaking about Chief Justice Marshall.\n  I find myself agreeing with the columnist George Will, who wrote \nrecently in one of his columns:\n\n       Marshall is the most important American never to have been \n     President.\n\n  William Howard Taft and Charles Evans Hughes also used their \nindividual talents to become great Chief Justices. Taft, the only Chief \nJustice to serve also as President, which was prior to that, had a \nsingular determination to modernize the Federal courts. He used his \nenergy and his political acumen to convince Congress to establish what \nis now the Judicial Conference of the United States to administer the \nFederal courts; enact the Judiciary Act of 1925, which allowed the \nCourt to decide the cases it would hear; and, before he left office, to \ngive the Court its first, and current, permanent home--a stone's throw \nfrom where we stand today, across the East Lawn of the Capitol.\n  A fellow Justice called Charles Evans Hughes ``the greatest in a \ngreat line of Chief Justices.'' He was known for his leadership in \nrunning the Court and for constantly working to enhance the public's \nconfidence in the Court. His successes were at least partly due to his \nkeen appreciation of the limits of that office. This is what Charles \nEvans Hughes had to say:\n\n       The Chief Justice as the head of the Court has an \n     outstanding position, but in a small body of able men with \n     equal authority in the making of decisions, it is evident \n     that his actual influence will depend on the strength of his \n     character and the demonstration of his ability in the \n     intimate relations of the judges.\n\n  Hughes was famous for the efficient, skillful, and courteous way in \nwhich he presided at oral argument, ran the Court's conferences, and \nassigned opinions, calling the latter his ``most delicate task.'' But \nhis greatest service may have been in spearheading public opposition to \nFDR's court-packing plan.\n  Our last great Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, may be said to have \npossessed the best qualities of Marshall, Taft, and Hughes. He had an \nexceptional mind, an engaging personality, boundless energy, and a \ncourteous and professional manner. These qualities helped him \nrevolutionize Federal jurisprudence, administer the Supreme Court and \nthe court system very efficiently, and interact constructively with \nthose of us here in Congress.\n\n  Of course, we will soon vote on the nomination of his successor, \nJudge John Roberts, who, in one of life's bittersweet turns, served as \na young and able law clerk to then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. In \nmeeting with him, and watching his confirmation hearings, I believe \nJudge Roberts possesses many of the qualities of our great Chief \nJustices: an impressive legal acumen, a sterling reputation for \nintegrity, and an outstanding judicial temperament. But I want to focus \non one quality in particular; and that is, his devotion to the rule of \nlaw.\n  We use that term all the time, but the question is, what does it \nmean? I focus on the rule of law because of the positions my colleagues \nhave taken during his nomination. One distinguished Member of this body \nsaid on the floor that he needed to find out ``whose side'' John \nRoberts ``is on.'' Another asked Judge Roberts whether, as a general \nproposition, he will be on the side of the ``big guy'' or the ``little \nguy.'' Still another insisted that the position to which Judge Roberts \nis nominated is akin to an elected official; in other words, an elected \npolitician. Comments such as these are based on a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the role of a judge.\n  Many of the Founders were politicians, and they, of course, \nrecognized that politics may favor certain constituencies. Judges, \nhowever, are not supposed to be on any group's ``side.'' They are not \nsupposed to favor one party's ``little guy'' at the expense of another \npolitical party's ``big guy.'' In short, judges are anti-politicians; \nat least they are supposed to be.\n  In giving life tenure to Federal judges, the Founders did not want \nthem--did not want them--to exercise the powers of politicians, to whom \nthey had denied life tenure. None of us are given life tenure here, for \ngood reason. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78:\n\n       It can be of no weight to say that the courts . . . may \n     substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional \n     intentions of the legislature. . . . The Courts must declare \n     the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to \n     exercise will instead of judgment--\n\n  ``Will instead of judgment''--\n\n     the consequence would equally be the substitution of their \n     pleasure to that of the legislative body.\n\n  In other words, judges must only interpret the law, not write it in \norder to favor one group over another. Judge Roberts understands the \nrole of a judge is that, and he is committed to adhering to it. Here is \nwhat he had to say. This was Judge Roberts at his hearing:\n\n       Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain \n     things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda, but I do have \n     a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront every case \n     with an open mind. . . . and I will decide every case . . . \n     according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the \n     best of my ability.\n\n  ``Without fear or favor, to the best of my ability.''\n  To put it more simply, he knows if the law favors the ``little guy,'' \nthen the ``little guy'' will win. If the law favors the ``big guy,'' \nthen the ``big guy'' will win. It is as simple and principled as that.\n  I do not know--none of us do--the mark a Chief Justice Roberts will \nleave on the Court. With his many fine qualities, he may be a great \nadministrator. He may lead some great reform of our court system. He \nmay revolutionize some area of law. But he will be a successful leader. \nAnd I suspect that whatever else, with his total devotion to the rule \nof law, he will instill in our legal system a renewed appreciation for \nthe role of judges in our Republic and, thereby, keep the Court on the \npath the Founders intended.\n  So today, I, like my colleagues, am mindful of the gravity and the \nprivilege of this vote to confirm our 17th Chief Justice. I do so with \nthe absolute conviction that Judge John Roberts meets the measure of \nhis great predecessors, and will lead the Court with judgment, skill, \nand integrity as befits the third branch of Government--the branch that \nprotects our liberties by insisting that ours is a country of laws and \nnot of men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 10:30 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. will \nbe under the control of the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we come to the conclusion of these \nconfirmation proceedings, I commend Senators on both sides of the aisle \nfor taking the time and making the effort to actively participate in \nthis process. Few duties and few votes are as enduring and as \nconsequential as deciding on a nomination for the premier jurist of the \nUnited States in our Federal court system. We have had 43 Presidents in \nour Nation's history. We have only had 16 Chief Justices of the United \nStates. In fact, only slightly under two dozen Members of the Senate \nhave ever voted on the question of a Chief Justice.\n  We have had full and fair hearings. We have had a constructive \ndebate. This process has been a credit to the Senate and to the \nJudiciary Committee. I commend especially Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, our chairman, and all of the members of the committee on \nboth sides and their staffs for the detailed, sometimes grueling, \npreparation that evaluating a Supreme Court nomination requires.\n  I am sure people understand when I refer to the committee's \nDemocratic\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\nstaff. They worked for 2 months. They labored dutifully. They gave up \ntheir weekends and their evenings, and with professionalism they helped \nSenators in our review of this important nomination. I particularly \nthank Bruce Cohen, Edward Pagano, Andrew Mason, Chris Matthias, Daniel \nFine, Daniel Triggs, David Carle, Ed Barron, Elizabeth Martin, Erica \nChabot, Erica Santo Pietro, Helaine Greenfeld, Jennie Pasquarella, \nJeremy Paris, Jessica Bashford, Joe Sexton, Joshu Harris, Julia \nFranklin, Julie Katzman, Kathryn Neal, Katy Hutchison, Kristine Lucius, \nKyra Harris, Lisa Anderson, Margaret Gage, Marit DeLozier, Mary Kate \nMeyer, Matt Nelson, Matt Oresman, Matt Virkstis, Nate Burris, Noah \nBookbinder, Sam Schneider, Sripriya Narasimhan, Susan Davies, Tara \nMagner, Tracy Schmaler, Valerie Frias and William Bittinger. And their \nexperience was duplicated by the hard-working Republican staff.\n  As a member of the minority party, I speak about our vital role in \nour system that is often less visible, but is crucial just the same. \nThe minority sharpens the Senate's and the public's focus on issues \nthat come before the Senate or sometimes on unattended issues that \ndeserve the Senate's attention.\n  In these proceedings, we have helped sharpen the Senate's focus on \nissues that matter most in the decision before us, that of confirming a \nnew Chief Justice of the United States.\n  I especially commend my fellow Democrats for taking this \nresponsibility so dutifully. They waited to hear the evidence and to \nlearn the particulars about this nomination. They did not rush to \njudgment. They did not speak out until after the hearings. Individual \nSenators now have weighed the evidence, and they have come to their \nindividual conclusions.\n  On this side of the aisle, there will not be a lockstep vote. I \nappreciate the thoughtful remarks by those who decided to vote in favor \nof confirmation and by those who decide to vote against the nomination. \nI respect the decisions of Senators who have come to different \nconclusions on this nomination. I know for many, including myself, it \nwas a difficult decision. I have said that each Senator must carefully \nweigh this matter and decide for herself or himself.\n  We are, each of us, 1 vote out of 100, but those 100 votes are \nentrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million of our fellow \ncitizens. We stand in the shoes of 280 million Americans in this \nChamber. What a somber and humbling responsibility we have in casting \nthis vote.\n  I was glad to hear the Republican leader say earlier this week that a \njudge must jettison politics in order to be a fair jurist. He is right. \nI thought the remarks of the senior Senator from Maine were especially \nmeaningful, and I appreciated that she was careful to include judicial \nphilosophy among the criteria she considered on this nomination. And of \ncourse she is right.\n  As the Senate considers the nomination, it is important to have more \ninformation, rather than less, about a nominee's approach to the law \nand about his or her judicial philosophy.\n  For the American people whose lives will be directly and indirectly \naffected by the decisions of a nominee, it is equally important that \nthe Senate's review process be fair, that it be transparent, and that \nit be thorough. The hearings we conduct and the debates we hold are the \nbest and only opportunity for the American people to hear from and \nlearn about the persons who could have significant influence over their \nconstitutional protections and freedoms. We owe the people we represent \na vigorous and open review, including forthright answers to questions.\n  My Vermont roots, which go back three centuries, have always told me \nto go with my conscience, and that is what I have done in this \ndecision. Judge Roberts is a man of integrity. For me, a vote to \nconfirm requires faith that the words he spoke to the Judiciary \nCommittee in the hearings and to me in our meetings have meaning. I \nhave taken him at his word that he does not have an ideological agenda, \nthat he will be his own man as Chief Justice. I take him at his word \nthat he will steer the Court so it will serve as an appropriate check \non potential abuses of Presidential power, not just today but tomorrow. \nI hope that he will, and I trust that he will.\n  As we close the debate on this nomination and move to a vote, we do \nso knowing we will soon be considering another Supreme Court nominee in \nthe Senate. Last week, Chairman Specter and I, along with the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders of the Senate, met with the \nPresident. I urged him to follow through with meaningful consultation. \nI urged him to share with us his intentions and seek our advice on the \nnext nomination before he acts.\n\n  There could and should have been consultation with the Senate on the \nnomination of someone to serve as the 17th Chief Justice of the United \nStates. I am sorry there was not, but there could and should be \nmeaningful consultation on the person to be named to succeed Justice \nO'Connor, who has so often been the decisive vote of the Supreme Court.\n  The stakes for all Americans and for the Nation's well-being are high \nas the President contemplates his second pick for a Justice on the \nNation's highest Court, a choice that will fill a swing vote and could \nsteer the Court's direction long after the President is gone and long \nafter most of us are gone.\n  The President does have this opportunity to work with us to unite the \ncountry, to be a uniter, to unite us around a nominee to succeed \nJustice O'Connor. Now more than ever, with Americans fighting and dying \nin Iraq every day, with hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced by \ndisasters at home, it is a time to unite rather than divide. The \nSupreme Court belongs to all Americans, not to any faction. So for the \nsake of the Nation, I urge the President to live up to his original \npromise, to be a uniter and not a divider.\n  If I might speak just personally to Judge John Roberts who will soon \nbe Chief Justice John Roberts: Be there for all Americans. And whoever \ncomes before you as Chief Justice, it should make no difference if \ntheir name is Patrick Leahy or Patrick Jones, George Bush or George \nSmith. No matter what their issue is, be there for all of us because \nwhat you do will affect our children and our grandchildren. And, Judge \nRoberts, it will affect your two lovely children. It will affect all \nAmericans.\n  We are a great and a good country, but we are a diverse country. Any \nnation the size of ours, a nation built on immigrants--such as my \nItalian grandparents or my Irish great grandparents--has to be diverse. \nBut we are diverse in all ways. Protect that diversity. Protect that \ndiversity because it is that diversity that makes us strong as a \nnation, far more than our military might if we protect our diversity--a \ndiversity of thought, a diversity of religion, a diversity of race, a \ndiversity of politics.\n  Judge Roberts, soon to be Chief Justice Roberts, be there for all 280 \nmillion Americans. That is what I have tried to do in putting myself in \nthe shoes of those 280 million Americans. I will cast my vote with hope \nand faith, but you, Judge Roberts, show the same hope and faith for \nthis great country that you love and I love and all the other 99 \nMembers of the Senate love.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time from 10:45 \na.m. to 11 a.m. will be under the control of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, at the outset, I compliment and salute \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, for his appropriate, really \nelegant, remarks in support of the nomination of Judge Roberts to be \nChief Justice. I compliment him on his leadership in taking a difficult \nstand, being the first Democrat to announce support for Judge Roberts' \nconfirmation. It is difficult to step out against party leadership, \nagainst what may be a party position, but I believe it is precisely \nthat kind of leadership which is so important for the Senate to \ndischarge its constitutional responsibility in the confirmation \nprocess. I compliment as well the other committee members--Senator Kohl \nand Senator Feingold for stepping out in support of Judge Roberts. And \nat last count, I know that some 18 Democrats have stated their \nintention to vote for Judge Roberts.\n  As yet, there are some who are undeclared, so that number will grow\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nbeyond. I believe it is a matter of real urgency that when we come to \nthe designation of the Chief Justice of the United States, or any \nSupreme Court nominee, that politics stop. We say in foreign policy \nthat partisanship should stop at the water's edge, and I extend that \nmetaphor on the recognition that the pillars of the Senate immediately \noutside the Chamber are lined up directly with the pillars of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  In that intervening few blocks on the green, on the Capitol complex, \nthat partisanship should stop at the Senate pillars as they extend \nacross the way to the Supreme Court pillars.\n  In the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, there is a unique \nconfluence of the three branches of Government on our separation of \npowers, with the President exercising the executive authority to \nnominate, the Senate on the confirmation process, and then the seating \nof the new Justice in the Supreme Court. It is a matter of vital \nconcern that it be nonpartisan.\n  Twelve days ago, on September 17, at the Constitution Center in \nPhiladelphia, the 218th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution \nwas celebrated. Today is an historic day, with Judge Roberts, by all \nconventional wisdom, slated to become the 17th Chief Justice of the \nUnited States. On only 16 occasions in the past have we had a new Chief \nJustice of our Nation.\n  I believe Judge Roberts comes to this position uniquely qualified, \nwith an academic record of superior standing, magna cum laude, summa \ncum laude, Harvard College and Harvard Law School, a distinguished \ncareer clerking first with Circuit Judge Henry Friendly, a very \ndistinguished judge in the Court of Appeals; then clerked for then \nAssociate Justice Rehnquist; then as an assistant to Attorney General \nWilliam French Smith; later as associate White House counsel in the \nReagan administration; a distinguished practice in the law firm of \nHogan & Hartson; then 39 cases argued before the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. So he has a phenomenal record.\n  His answers to the questioning before the committee, which I think \nwas very intense, very directed, appropriately tough, was that he saw \nthe Constitution as a document for the ages responding to societal \nchanges; that he saw the phrases ``equal protection of the law'' and \n``due process of law'' as expansive phrases which can accommodate \nsocietal changes.\n  As he approaches the job of Chief Justice, he has a remarkable \nrunning start. He described his arguments before the Court as a dialog \namong equals, a phrase that I think is unique and in a sense \nremarkable; that as an advocate he had the confidence to consider \nhimself talking to equals when he addressed the nine members of the \nSupreme Court.\n  There have already been indications from the members of the Court \nabout their liking the fact that Judge Roberts is going to be the new \nChief Justice. It is not easy to come into a court at the age of 50, \nwhere Justice Stevens, the senior Justice, is 85 and others, Justice \nScalia, 68, the next youngest member, Justice Thomas, 57. When he has \nthe self-confidence to consider as an advocate a dialog among equals, \nthat is a good sign that he has the potential to bring consensus to the \nCourt.\n  There was an extended discussion during his confirmation proceeding \nabout what Chief Justice Earl Warren did in bringing the Court together \nfor a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education and how \nimportant it was. In a case involving deep-seated patterns of \nsegregation and the difficulty of implementing that decision and the \nyears it has taken--it is still a work in process to give quality to \nAfrican Americans, to Blacks in our society--let us make no mistake \nabout it, it has been, since 1954 when the decision came down, 51 \nyears, and there is still more work to be done, but it was an \noutstanding job by Chief Justice Warren to bring the Court together \nwith a unanimous decision to put desegregation on the best possible \nplane with unanimity among the nine Justices who decided the case.\n  As I emphasized during my questioning of Judge Roberts, there is much \nto be done to move away from the 5-to-4 decisions of the Court, some \ninexplicable this year. The Court upheld the displaying of the Ten \nCommandments on a tower in Texas 5 to 4, and rejected displaying the \nTen Commandments in Kentucky; within the past 5 years, inconsistent \ndecisions on the interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n5 to 4 upholding the access provisions, 5 to 4 rejecting the \nconstitutionality on the provisions relating to discrimination in \nemployment.\n  Judge Roberts as Chief Justice has the capacity to fully understand \nthe balance of power between the Congress and the Court and to move \naway from the denigrating comments that the Court made in Alabama v. \nGarrett that in declaring an act unconstitutional they had a superior \n``method of reasoning,'' or that in establishing the flabby test, \nflabby being the words of Justice Scalia, on invoking the test of \nproportionality and congruence in the 1997 case of Boerne, where \nJustice Scalia accurately noted in his dissent in Tennessee v. Lane \nthat it was a flabby test that allowed judicial legislation and that \nthe Court was setting itself up as the taskmaster of the Congress to \nsee that the Congress had done its homework.\n\n  So the new Chief Justice will have his work cut out in trying to \nbring a consensus on the reduction of the proliferation of opinions \nwith so many concurrences coming out of the Court.\n  Yesterday's Washington Post had a headline about a filibuster \nshowdown looms in the Senate and a recitation of frustration among so-\ncalled Democratic political activists who do not think their elected \nleaders put up a serious enough fight as to Judge Roberts.\n  Having been there for every minute of the Roberts proceeding in my \ncapacity as chairman to preside, it was a searching, probing inquiry \ninto Judge Roberts' background and his approach to the issue \nconfronting the Court. When they say there was not a sufficient fight, \nthere were very senior Senators, very experienced, leading the \nopposition. Who can challenge the tenacity of Senator Kennedy, Senator \nBiden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer, and Senator Durbin putting \nup that battle?\n  In the final analysis, we have had many experienced Senators who have \ncome forward to join Senators Leahy, Kohl, and Feingold on the \ncommittee, and Senators of standing and distinction--Senator Byrd, who \nhas been in this body since his election in 1958, Senator Levin, 27 \nyears in this body, Senator Dodd, 25 years, Senator Lieberman, and so \nmany among the 18 Senators--where there is the showing of that kind of \nbipartisanship.\n  It is my hope we will carry forward the spirit of bipartisanship \nwhich was demonstrated in the last two confirmation proceedings. \nJustice Breyer was confirmed in 1994 with an 87-to-9 vote, with 31 \nRepublicans joining 56 Democrats, so it did not make any difference to \n31 Republicans that Justice Breyer was nominated by President Clinton, \nwho was a Democrat.\n  The year before, Justice Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3, with 41 \nRepublicans voting for her nomination. Before that, Justice Souter was \nconfirmed 90 to 9, with 45 Democrats joining 45 Republicans. Nine \nDemocrats did vote ``no'' against Justice Souter, perhaps influenced by \nthe posters that he would wreck Roe v. Wade. We know he was in the \njoint opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood.\n  Before that, the votes were unanimous as to Justice John Paul Stevens \nand Justice Scalia, 98 to 0, and Justice O'Connor was confirmed 99 to \n0.\n  While the votes among the Democrats will not be as strong as the 41 \nRepublicans who voted for President Clinton's nomination of Justice \nGinsburg, we have a sufficient indication of a strong bipartisan vote \nso that I think it is not unduly optimistic to look for a future where \nwe will have partisanship stopping at the Senate columns.\n  We face another nomination imminently. There have been discussions as \nto what our sequence and timing will be. We have shown, with the \ncooperation of Senator Leahy and the Senate Democratic leader, Senator \nReid, as we negotiated this timetable--and we had some angst in the \nnegotiations but we worked in a cooperative way so that on September 29 \nwe have met the timetable which we anticipated, although nobody was \nbound to it. There could have been objections and there could have been \ndelaying tactics, but Senator Reid, Senator Leahy, and the Judiciary \nCommittee, with Democrats as\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\nwell as Republicans, supported that timetable.\n  It is my hope we will have a nominee who will come forward to replace \nJustice O'Connor who will be in the mold of Judge Roberts. In a sense, \nJudge Roberts replaces Chief Justice Rehnquist. Perhaps the ideology is \nnot so important with that replacement, but it is my hope we will have \nsomeone who in the mold of Judge Roberts will stand up to the job, \nlooking for the interpretations of due process and equal protection as \nJudge Roberts did in an expansive way, and looking for societal \ninterests in that broad interpretation.\n  I am pleased to be a participant in this historic occasion, and again \nI salute my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the dignified \nproceeding and meeting our timetable, in coming forward to this \nconfirmation vote at 11:30 this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Under the previous order, the \ntime from 11 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. will be under the control of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I announced on this floor last week, I \nintend to vote against the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief \nJustice of the United States. In my meetings with John Roberts, I found \nhim to be a very nice person. I like him. I respect his legal skills. I \nrespect much of the work he has done in his career. For example, his \nadvocacy on the environmental side of the Lake Tahoe takings case \nseveral years ago was remarkably good. He decided the law did not look \ntoo good to him, so he figured the way to win the case was to argue to \nthe Court the facts, and he did that and he won the case. So I admire \nhis legal skills, as I think everyone in this body does. But at the end \nof the day, I have had many unanswered questions about the nominee, and \nbecause of that, I cannot justify a vote confirming him to this \nlifetime position.\n\n  Each one of the 100 Senators applies his or her own standard in \ncarrying out the advice and consent clause of the Constitution. That is \na constitutional role that we have. I know that elections have \nconsequences, and I agree that Presidents are entitled to a measure of \ndeference in appointing judicial nominees. After all, the Senate has \nconfirmed well over 200 of President Bush's nominees, some of whom \npossess a judicial philosophy with which I disagree. But deference to \nthe President can only go so far. Our Founding Fathers gave the Senate \nthe central role in the nominations process, and that role is \nespecially important in placing someone on the Supreme Court.\n  If confirmed by the Senate, John Roberts will serve as Chief Justice \nof the United States and leader of the third branch of the Federal \nGovernment for decades to come. He will possess enormous legal \nauthority. In my view, we should only vote to confirm this nominee if \nhe has persuaded us he will protect the freedoms that all Americans \nhold dear. This is a close question for me, but I will resolve my \ndoubts in favor of the American people, whose rights would be in \njeopardy if John Roberts turns out to be the wrong person for the job.\n  As I have indicated, I was impressed with Judge Roberts the first \ntime I met him. This was a day or two after he was nominated. I knew \nthat he had been a thoughtful member of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the last 2 years. But several factors caused me to reassess my \ninitial view. Most notably, I was disturbed by memos that surfaced from \nJohn Roberts' years of service in the Reagan administration. These \ndocuments raised serious questions about the nominee's approach to the \nrights of women and civil rights.\n  In the statement that I gave last week, I gave some specific examples \nof the memos that concerned me. I also explained that I was prepared to \nlook past these memos if the nominee distanced himself from these views \nat his Judiciary Committee hearings. He did not. I was so disappointed \nwhen he took the disingenuous stance that the views expressed in these \nmemos were merely the views of his client, the Reagan administration. \nAnyone who has read the memos can see that their author was expressing \nhis own personal views.\n  When I saw Senator Schumer throw him the proverbial softball in these \nhearings, I waited with anticipation for the answer that I knew would \ncome. This brilliant man, John Roberts, certainly could see what \nSenator Schumer was attempting to do. He was attempting to have John \nRoberts say: Well, I was younger then. It was a poor choice of words. \nIf I offended anyone, I am sorry. I know it was insensitive. I could \nhave made the same point in a different manner.\n  But he didn't say that. For example, the softball that was thrown to \nhim by Senator Schumer was words to the effect: In a memo you wrote \nthat President Reagan was going to have a meeting in just a short \nperiod of time with some illegal amigos, Hispanics--that was \ninsensitive. It was unwise. And it was wrong. And he should have \nacknowledged that and he did not.\n  That affected me. It gave me an insight into who John Roberts is.\n  My concerns about these Reagan-era memos were heightened when the \nWhite House rejected a reasonable request by the committee Democrats \nfor documents written by the nominee when he served as Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral in the first Bush administration. The claim of attorney-client \nprivilege to shield these documents was unpersuasive. This was \nstonewalling, plain and simple.\n  In the absence of these documents, it was equally important for the \nnominee to answer fully questions from the committee members at his \nhearing. He didn't do that. Of course a judicial nominee should decline \nto answer questions regarding specific cases that will come before the \nCourt to which the witness has been nominated. We all know that. But \nJudge Roberts refused to answer many questions certainly more remote \nthan that, including questions seeking his views of long-settled \nprecedents.\n  Finally, I was swayed by the testimony of civil rights and women's \nrights leaders against this confirmation. As we proceed through our \npublic life, we have an opportunity to meet lots of people. That is one \nof the pluses of this wonderful job, the great honor that the people of \nthe State of Nevada have bestowed upon me. During my public service, I \nhave had the opportunity to serve in Congress with some people whom I \nconsider heroes. One of those is a man by the name of John Lewis. John \nLewis was part of the civil rights movement, and he has scars to show \nhis involvement in the civil rights movement. Any time they show films \nof the beatings that took place in the Southern part of the United \nStates of people trying to change America, John Lewis is one of those \npeople you will see on the ground being kicked and stomped on while \npunches are thrown. He still has those scars.\n\n  But those scars are on the outside, not the inside. This man is one \nof the most kind, gentle people I have ever met, someone who is very \nsensitive to the civil rights we all enjoy. Congressman John Lewis is \nan icon and, as I have said, a personal hero of mine. When John Lewis \nsays that John Roberts was on the wrong side of history and should not \nbe confirmed, his view carries great weight with me.\n  So I weigh John Roberts' fine resume and his 2 years of mainstream \njudicial service against the Reagan-era memos, the nominee's \nunsatisfactory testimony, and the administrations's failure to produce \nrelevant documents. I have to reluctantly conclude the scales tipped \nagainst confirmation.\n  Some have accused Democrats of treating this nominee unfairly. \nNothing could be further from the truth. There are volumes written \nabout the uncivil atmosphere in Washington, about how things could be \nbetter in the Senate. All those people who write that, let them take a \nlook at how this proceeding transpired in the Senate and I hope on the \nface of America. It was not easy to get to this point. In 20 minutes, \nwe will have a vote on the Chief Justice of the United States. But \npeople should understand that the Judiciary Committee conducted itself \nin an exemplary fashion, led by Arlen Specter and Pat Leahy. No better \nexample in Government could be shown than to look at how they conducted \nthe hearings and the full breadth of everything that took place with \nthis confirmation process. It is exemplary.\n  People have strong feelings, not only in that committee but in the \nSenate, and there were many opportunities for mischief. But because of \nthe strong leadership of two distinguished Senators--one from the tiny \nState of\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nVermont and one from the very heavily populated State of Pennsylvania--\nit all worked out. They trusted each other and the members of the \nJudiciary Committee trusted them, and after a few weeks of this \nprocess, which went on for months, by the way, every Member of the \nSenate saw that this was going to be a civil proceeding, and it was. It \nhas been. I commend and applaud the dignity of these hearings.\n  Each Democrat considered the nomination on the merits and approached \nthe vote as a matter of conscience. Democrats were not told how to \nvote, not by me, not by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, not by \nthe senior Member of the Senate, Senator Byrd. They will vote their \nconscience.\n  Democrats have not employed any procedural tactics that we might have \notherwise considered. As Senator Specter and Senator Leahy have said to \nthe President himself--I have been there when they said it--we want the \nnext nominee not to be extreme.\n  The fact that some Democrats will vote no on this nomination is \nhardly unfair. We are simply doing our duty under the Constitution that \nwe hold so dearly. The Constitution--that is what this is all about, \nthis little document. We have a role, a constitutional role, of giving \nadvice and consent to the President. The consent will come in a few \nminutes. The advice has been long in coming.\n  In the fullness of time, John Roberts may well prove to be a fine \nSupreme Court Justice. I hope that he is. If so, I will happily admit \nthat I was wrong in voting against his confirmation. But I have \nreluctantly concluded that this nominee has not satisfied the high \nburden that would justify my voting for his confirmation based on the \ncurrent record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the senior Senator from Nevada will yield to \nme. I wish to make a comment. I know he still has a couple of minutes \nleft.\n  Mr. REID. The time is yours.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to compliment the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada, the Democratic leader. I supported him for assistant \nleader, and I supported him for leader, and I have never regretted, nor \ndoubted, that support.\n  I have been here 31 years. He is a fine leader. I have been here for \n12 nominations to the Supreme Court, 2 of them for Chief Justice. I am \none of only a handful of Senators who can say that. I know, throughout \nall this process, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, dealt with us \nevenhandedly and fairly. Never at any time did he try to twist any arms \non this side of the aisle. Throughout it all he said: Keep your powder \ndry--his expression which I picked up--until the hearings were over. \nThat is the sort of thing we should do. Hear the evidence first. Hear \nthe evidence, and then reach a verdict. I am extremely proud of him.\n  We have reached different conclusions on this, but we remain friends \nand respectful to each other throughout. His praise of Senator Specter \nand of myself means so much to me. But I think, more importantly, what \nhe has done means so much to the Senate. Senator Reid has worked with \nboth sides of the aisle to make sure that we were going to have a \nhearing for the Chief Justice of the United States that reflected what \nwas best in this country.\n  When I finished my speech, I spoke directly to Judge John Roberts, \nand I will do so again: Please, remember there are 280 million \nAmericans. Be a Chief Justice for all of us.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the duty before us today to provide advice \nand consent on John Roberts' nomination as Chief Justice of the United \nStates is perhaps the most significant responsibility we will undertake \nas elected leaders. It is a duty decreed to us by the Constitution and \nan obligation the American people have entrusted us to fulfill.\n  In this Chamber today, we are seated at the drafting table of \nhistory. We are prepared to write a new chapter in the history of our \nNation. Our words and our actions will be judged not only by the \nAmerican people today but by the eyes of history forever.\n  As we prepare to pick up the pen to write these words that will shape \nthe course of our highest Court, I ask that we think hard about the \nwords we will write. I ask that we think hard about the question we \nmust answer: Is Judge Roberts qualified to lead the highest Court in \nthe land? I believe the answer to this question is yes.\n  Judge Roberts possesses the qualities Americans expect in the Chief \nJustice of its highest Court and the qualifications that America \ndeserves. Without a doubt, he is the brightest of the bright. His \nunderstanding of constitutional law is unquestionable. Judge Roberts \nhas proven through his tenure on the District of Columbia Circuit Court \nof Appeals and in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee that he \nis committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. He has \ndemonstrated that he won't let personal opinions sway his fairminded \napproach. He will check political views at the door to the Court, for \nhe respects the role of the judiciary and recognizes the importance of \nseparation of powers.\n  As he so eloquently stated before the committee: ``Judges are like \numpires. Umpires don't make the rules, they apply them . . . They make \nsure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role.''\n  Judge Roberts will be a great umpire on the High Court. He will be \nfair and openminded. He will stand on principle and lead by example. He \nwill be respectful of the judicial colleagues and litigants who come \nbefore the Court. And above all, he will be a faithful steward of the \nConstitution.\n\n  This is what we know about John Roberts: In the last few weeks, he \nhas provided us information and answered our questions. John Roberts \nhas fulfilled his obligation to the Senate.\n  Now it is time to fulfill our obligation to the American people. It \nis time for each Member to answer, Is John Roberts the right person for \nthe job of Chief Justice of the United States? It is my belief that the \nanswer is yes. It is my belief that the chapter we write should begin \nwith his name. It is my hope that today Members will join me in writing \nthe words; that Members will join me in writing ``yes'' for John \nRoberts' nomination as our Nation's 17th Chief Justice.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John G.

Mr. President, I rise once again today to comment on \nthe deeply disturbing consequences of the President's misguided \npolicies in Iraq. I have spoken before about my grave concern that the \nadministration's Iraq policies are actually strengthening the hand of \nour enemies, fueling the insurgency's recruitment of foreign fighters, \nand unifying elements of the insurgency that might otherwise turn on \neach other.\n  But today I want to focus on a different and equally alarming issue, \nwhich is that the Bush administration's policies in Iraq are making \nAmerica weaker. None of us should stand by and allow this to continue.\n  It is shocking to me this Senate has not found the time and the \nenergy to take up the Defense authorization bill and give that bill the \nfull debate and attention it deserves. Our men and women in uniform and \nour military families continue to make real sacrifices every day in \nservice to this country. They perform their duties with skill and \nhonor, sometimes in the most difficult of circumstances. But the Senate \nhas not performed its duties, and the state of the U.S. military \ndesperately needs our attention.\n  The administration's policies in Iraq are breaking the U.S. Army. As \nsoldiers confront the prospect of a third tour in the extremely \ndifficult theater of Iraq, it would be understandable if they began to \nwonder why all of the sacrifice undertaken by our country in wartime \nseems to be falling on their shoulders. It would be understandable if \nthey and their brothers and sisters in the Marine Corps began to feel \nsome skepticism about whether essential resources, such as adequately \narmored vehicles, will be there when they need them. It would be \nunderstandable if they came to greet information about deployment \nschedules with cynicism because reliable information has been hard to \ncome by for our military families in recent years. And it would be \nunderstandable if they asked themselves whether their numbers will be \ngreat enough--great enough--to hold hard-won territory, and whether \nproperly vetted translators will be available to help them distinguish \nfriend from foe.\n  At some point, the sense of solidarity and commitment that helps \nmaintain strong retention rates can give way to a sense of frustration \nwith the status quo. I fear we may be very close to that tipping point \ntoday. It is possible we may not see the men and women of the Army \ncontinue to volunteer for more of the same. It is not reasonable to \nexpect that current retention problems will improve rather than worsen. \nWe should not bet our national security on that kind of wishful \nthinking.\n  Make no mistake, our military readiness is already suffering. \nAccording to a recent RAND study, the Army has been stretched so thin \nthat active-duty soldiers are now spending 1 of every 2 years abroad, \nleaving little of the Army left in any appropriate condition to respond \nto crises that may emerge elsewhere in the world. In an era in which we \nconfront a globally networked enemy, and at a time when nuclear weapons \nproliferation is an urgent threat, continuing on our present course is \nirresponsible at best.\n  We are not just wearing out the troops; we are also wearing out \nequipment much faster than it is being replaced or refurbished. Days \nago, the chief of the National Guard, GEN H. Steven Blum, told a group \nof Senate staffers that the National Guard had approximately 75 percent \nof the equipment it needed on 9/11, 2001. Today, the National Guard has \nonly 34 percent of the equipment it needs. The response to Hurricane \nKatrina exposed some of the dangerous gaps in the Guard's \ncommunications systems.\n  What we are asking of the Army is not sustainable, and the burden and \nthe toll it is taking on our military families is unacceptable. This \ncannot go on.\n  Many of my colleagues, often led by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, \nhave taken stock of where we stand and have joined to support efforts \nto expand the size of our standing Army. But this effort, which I \nsupport, is a solution for the long term, because it depends on new \nrecruits to address our problems. We cannot suddenly increase the \nnumbers of experienced soldiers so essential to providing leadership in \nthe field. It takes years to grow a new crop of such leaders. But the \nannual resignation rate of Army lieutenants and captains rose last year \nto its highest rate since the attacks of September 11, 2001. We are \nheading toward crisis right now.\n  Growing the all-volunteer Army can only happen if qualified new \nrecruits sign up for duty. But all indications suggest that at the end \nof this month the Army will fall thousands short--thousands short--of \nits annual recruiting goal. Barring some sudden and dramatic change, \nthe Army National Guard and Army Reserve too will miss their annual \ntargets by about 20 percent, missing their targets this year by 20 \npercent in terms of recruitment. GEN Peter Schoomaker, the Army's Chief \nof Staff, told Congress recently that 2006 ``may be the toughest \nrecruiting environment ever.''\n\n  Too often, too many of us are reluctant to criticize the \nadministration's policies in Iraq for fear that anything other than \nstaying the course set by the President will somehow appear weak. But \nthe President's course is misguided, and it is doing grave damage to \nour extraordinarily professional and globally admired all-volunteer \nU.S. Army. To stand by--to stand by--while this damage is done is not \npatriotic. It is not supportive. It is not tough on terrorism, nor is \nit strong on national security. Because I am proud of our men and women \nin uniform, and because I am committed to working with all of my \ncolleagues to make this country more secure, I am convinced we must \nchange our course.\n  As some of my colleagues know, I have introduced a resolution calling \nfor the President to provide a public report clarifying the mission the \nUnited States military is being asked to accomplish in Iraq, and laying \nout a plan and a timeframe for accomplishing that mission and \nsubsequently bringing our troops home. It is in our interest to provide \nsome clarity about our intentions and restore confidence at home and \nabroad that U.S. troops will not be in Iraq indefinitely. I have tried \nto jump-start this discussion by proposing a date for U.S. troop \nwithdrawal: December 31, 2006.\n  We need to start working with a realistic set of plans and benchmarks \nif we are to gain control of our Iraq policy, instead of simply letting \nit dominate our security strategy and drain vital resources for an \nunlimited amount of time.\n  So this brings me to another facet of this administration's misguided \napproach to Iraq, another front on which our great country is growing \nweaker rather than stronger as a result of the administration's policy \nchoices, and that is the tremendously serious fiscal consequences of \nthe President's decision to put the entire Iraq war on our national \ntab. How much longer can the elected representatives of the American \npeople in this Congress allow the President to rack up over $1 billion \na week in new debts? This war is draining, by one estimate, $5.6 \nbillion every month from our economy--funds that might be used to help \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina recover, or to help\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\naddress the skyrocketing health care costs facing businesses and \nfamilies, or to help pay down the enormous debt this Government has \nalready piled up.\n  Not only are we weakening our economy today, this costly war is \nundermining our Nation's economic future because none of that \nconsiderable expenditure has been offset in the budget by cuts in \nspending elsewhere or by revenue increases. All of it--every penny--has \nbeen added to the already massive debt that will be paid by future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  For years now, this administration has refused to budget for the cost \nof our ongoing operations in Iraq that can be predicted, and has \nrefused to make the hard choices that would be required to cover those \ncosts. Instead--instead--the President apparently prefers to leave \nthose tough calls to our children.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick \nquestion?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Could I do that in 2 minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to finish my statement.\n  Mr. President, in effect, we are asking future generations to pay for \nthis war, and they will pay for it in the form of higher taxes or fewer \nGovernment benefits. They stand to inherit a weakened America, one so \ncompromised by debt and economic crisis that the promise of opportunity \nfor all has faded. And there is no end in sight.\n  In addition to that, the war will leave other costly legacies. Here \nagain, it is the members of the military and their families who will \nendure the most severe costs. But even if the war ended tomorrow, the \nNation will continue to pay the price for decades to come.\n  Linda Bilmes of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard estimates \nthat over the next 45 years, the health care, disability, and other \nbenefits due our Iraq war veterans will cost $315 billion. We owe our \nbrave troops the services and benefits they are due. We owe it to them \nand to their children and to their grandchildren to guide the course of \nthis country and this economy to ensure that we are in a position to \ndeliver for our veterans and for all Americans.\n  I cannot support an Iraq policy that makes our enemies stronger and \nour country weaker, and that is why I will not support staying the \ncourse the President has set. If Iraq were truly the solution to our \nnational security challenges, this gamble with the future of our \nmilitary and with our economy--who knows?--might make sense, if that \nwere the case. If Iraq, rather than such strategically more significant \ncountries as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, were at the heart of the global \nfight against violent Islamic terrorism, this might make some sense. If \nit were true that fighting insurgents in Baghdad meant we would not \nhave to fight them elsewhere, all the costs of this policy might well \nmake sense.\n  But these things are not true. Iraq is not--is not--the ``silver \nbullet'' in the fight against global terrorist networks. As I have \nargued in some detail, it is quite possible that the administration's \npolicies in Iraq are actually strengthening the terrorists by helping \nthem to recruit new fighters from around the world, giving those \njihadists on-the-ground training in terrorism, and building new, \ntransnational networks among our enemies. Meanwhile, the costs of \nstaying this course indefinitely, the consequences of weakening \nAmerica's military and America's economy, loom more ominously before us \nwith each passing week. There is no leadership in simply hoping for the \nbest. We must insist on an Iraq policy that makes sense.\n\n  I yield to the Senator from California for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold. I am very proud to be on his resolution which finally would \nhold this President and his administration accountable for the \ndisastrous situation we find ourselves in in Iraq, a situation that has \nled to now nearly 2,000 dead, countless wounded, young people and not \nso young without limbs, without their full brain capacity. It is a \nstunning failure.\n  Finally, in the Senate, we have a resolution that simply says to this \nadministration: Do tell us, what is your plan? When are we getting out? \nGive us the milestones. And, what is the mission?\n  I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask my friend. As my friend \nwas talking, I wrote down the various missions that we have heard from \nthe administration that we were supposed to have in Iraq. The first one \nwas weapons of mass destruction. Remember when Secretary Rumsfeld said: \nI know where they are; I could point to where they are. No, there \nweren't any. Then they said: We have to get Saddam. He is a tyrant. We \nall agreed, he is a tyrant. Saddam is gone for all intents and \npurposes. That was the second mission. Then they said: We are going to \nrebuild Iraq, a disastrous situation over which Secretary Rice is in \ncharge. I haven't seen much rebuilding. I have seen a lot of no-bid \ncontracts. Then they said: We have to have an election. That is the \nnext mission. They had an election. After that, everything fell apart. \nThen they said: We need to bring security. We are going to train the \nIraqi forces. The Senator from Wisconsin and I agree with that. We want \nto see them trained--it seems to be taking forever--especially when we \nhave the President saying: We will stay there as long as it takes. What \nkind of message is that to the Iraqis?\n  We had a briefing yesterday. We can't discuss the details of that \nbriefing, but it seemed to me there were yet other missions laid out.\n  I ask my friend, does he see the situation the way I do: An ever-\nchanging mission in Iraq, setting the bar higher and higher with no end \nin sight is where we are at the present time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from California. She accurately \ndescribed the way in which we got in this situation. I called it on the \nSenate floor, in October 2002, shifting justifications. The one we \nbegan with, the one that sold the American people, was that somehow \nthere was a connection between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Most \nof the American people apparently believed it because the President \ntold them so at the time of the invasion. That would have been the \nultimate justification because everybody assumed the Iraq invasion had \nsomething to do with that.\n  Ever since that myth has been exploded, the administration has been \ntrying any way, scampering any way they can to come up with other \njustifications--the obviously failed attempt to suggest the imminent \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein, and then 6 \nto 7 months later, a year later, the President suddenly announces what \nhe was really trying to do was to start a domino effect. We were going \nto fight a war that was going to create a domino effect of democracy \naround the world, which is a lovely ideal and notion, but nobody \nthought that was the justification when we voted here. I am guessing \nthat it wouldn't have gotten one single vote if Members thought we were \nbuying into that kind of project.\n  The Senator is right, not only with regard to how we got into the war \nbut also with regard to how this administration is conducting the war. \nIt is a mixture of so many inconsistent justifications that it doesn't \nmake sense.\n  I had 18 town meetings in northern and central Wisconsin, some of \nthem at very conservative areas, during the August recess. These were \nplaces where most of the people supported the Iraq war. They came to my \ntown meetings and said: Why is this happening? Why were we given false \npretenses to get into the war, and why is it that there isn't a serious \nplan to finish the war? Because of the failure of the administration to \nhandle this war in any sensible way, the very people who supported the \nwar are starting to say: Let's just leave.\n  So the President presents us with a false choice. He says: We have to \nstay the course. And if you don't believe in staying the course, then \nyou must be for cutting and running. He is causing the movement in \nAmerica to simply leave Iraq because of his failure of leadership.\n  What our resolution does--and I thank the Senator from California for \nher cosponsorship--is modest. It just says: Mr. President, within 30 \ndays, could you give us a written plan that lays out the best way you \nwant, without being bound to it, what is the plan, what is the mission, \nwhat are the benchmarks we have to achieve, by what time do you think \nwe can achieve those benchmarks, and at what point and through what \nstages do you think we can begin and then complete the withdrawal of \nour American troops.\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\n  I say to my friend through the Chair, I think her comments and her \nquestion are right on the point.\n  I yield for another question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague for \ncorrecting me on the point that I missed that, yes, out of the five or \nsix missions I named, I left out the very important one that he \ncorrected me on, which is that there was a link between Saddam and al-\nQaida and, in fact, there was al-Qaida all over Iraq.\n  The Senator and I sit on the Foreign Relations Committee. I think he \nremembers this document that I put into the Record, because I remember \nhe very much wanted it, which showed that about a month after September \n11 when we were so viciously attacked by bin Laden--who, by the way, we \nwere going to get dead or alive, and we need to do that--the fact is, \nthe State Department in its own document said there wasn't one al-Qaida \ncell, not one, in Iraq. There were more cells in America than in Iraq, \naccording to our own State Department. We have put that in the Record.\n\n  Now, of course, it is a haven for terrorism because of this failed \npolicy, this disastrous policy, this policy that is utter chaos with no \nend in sight, unless the Senate and the administration look at what my \nfriend put forward, which is finally saying to the President: You need \na mission, a mission that can be accomplished, and we need to end this \nin an orderly fashion.\n  I wanted to ask my friend one more point, and then I will leave the \nChamber. That is about the National Guard. Right now, there are fires \nraging in my home State, sadly. We have them every year at this time. \nIt is heartwrenching. We need all the help we can get. We always get \nall the help we ask for. We have never had a problem. The National \nGuard is called out when it gets really out of control.\n  Is my friend aware that the best equipment that the National Guard \nhad at its disposal is in Iraq, not here at home? And when the people \nwere crying out for help, not only were so many of the National Guard \nover in Iraq, my understanding is--and my friend can correct me--\napproximately 40 percent of our troops over there are National Guard. \nThat is my information. Not only that, the best equipment of the \nNational Guard is over in Iraq.\n  Don't our people deserve better than that so when they experience \ndisasters, our National Guard can respond?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. The \nSenator has very nicely returned to the main point of what I was trying \nto illustrate today. We certainly agree on the problems of how we got \ninto this war and our very troubled feelings about that and also the \nmyriad of problems with the way the war is being conducted. But what \nthe Senator from California has done is returned us to the main point I \nwanted to make today: This strategy is weakening America. I am not \ntalking about some general sense. We are talking specifically about our \nmilitary. We are talking specifically about our Army. We are talking \nspecifically about our National Guard.\n  Yes, we know about this in Wisconsin. We have some 10,000 Guard and \nReserve. The vast majority of them have been called up for action \noverseas. There are serious concerns that have been reported--which, by \nthe way, were beginning prior to 9/11--about equipment. It is to the \npoint where my National Guard people ask me to ask the Secretary of \nDefense, Are we going to replenish these things for our National Guard? \nWhat is the guarantee? I received a rather weak answer, as I recall. \nThe equipment needs are only at 34 percent for the National Guard--a \ndramatic decline in the last 4 years. Since 9/11, we have allowed the \nsituation to become much worse in terms of equipment for our National \nGuard, whether it be for use in a foreign conflict or whether it be \nused to handle a terrorist situation domestically or whether it be used \nto help deal with one of the natural disasters that obviously can and \ndo occur.\n  I appreciate the Senator heightening this point. This isn't about \nopposing a war. This is about mistakes being made by an administration \nin terms of forgetting the main point of fighting terrorism and \nforgetting about the need for our military to be strong both \ninternationally and to be able to help, as the National Guard must, \ndomestically.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor at this time to discuss a matter \nof grave national security. If recent Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita have taught us anything, it is that we have to do a dramatically \nbetter job of preparing for diseases before they strike so we are not \nleft picking up the pieces afterward.\n  I am very gravely concerned that the United States is totally \nunprepared for an outbreak--and a subsequent international pandemic--of \navian flu. We have had two disasters in the last 4 years--9/11 and \nKatrina followed by Rita. And the Federal Government was totally \nunprepared for both, despite clear warnings. Similarly, we have been \nwarned in no uncertain terms about avian flu, but our preparations so \nfar have been grossly inadequate.\n  I think I got my first briefing on this about a year ago from CDC in \nAtlanta. I have been following it closely in our Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee.\n  As it has unfolded over the last several months, it is clear that it \nis not a question of if avian flu is going to reach us, it is a \nquestion of when--not if, just when.\n  As many of my colleagues know, avian flu--or as it is called in the \ntechnical jargon, H5N1--has been known to pass first in bird species. \nIt was passed from bird to bird, chicken to chicken, and that type of \nthing. It has then gotten into migratory waterfowl, which has spread \nfrom countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. And \nthey have now found it as far away as Kazakhstan and as far north as \nthe northern regions of Russia. It is just a matter of time before it \ngets here.\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\n  We have known this passed from bird to bird. We now know it has \npassed from birds to mammals, certain types of cats, particular tigers. \nWe also know now it has passed from birds to humans. We have some \ncases. Now we have a few cases that have been reported of passing from \nhuman to human.\n  So the virus is mutating. It is getting smarter. It knows that it has \nnow gone from bird to bird, bird to mammal, and bird to human, and now \nfrom human to human.\n  Experts in virology at the Department of Health and Human Services \nand others tell us that it is only a matter of time until the virus \nmutates from human to human to human, and then it becomes widespread. \nWhen that happens, we are in deep trouble.\n  An outbreak in China, Vietnam or Cambodia could trigger, within a \ncouple of weeks' time, a worldwide outbreak, facilitated by air traffic \nand the mass movement of people across borders. And the data so far \nshows that of the 150 cases of the human avian flu--H5N1--that we know \nof, 54 have died. Almost 50 percent of the people infected have died.\n  This is a virulent form of the flu virus. It is a nightmare \nscenario--a kind of 21st century Black Death.\n  It is not hard to picture that could happen within a few months' \nperiod of time.\n  Again, as I say, many experts say it is not a matter of if, it is \nwhen. We have to ask tough questions.\n  Where do our preparedness efforts stand? What could we be doing \nbetter?\n  At some future time--I have it on charts, but I didn't have time to \nput it together--I will have charts to show what happened with the last \ngreat flu pandemic that hit the world in 1918 and 1919. Understand \nthis: 500 million people were infected worldwide. This was almost 100 \nyears ago--20 million to 40 million deaths worldwide. There were over \n500 deaths in the United States.\n  In one month alone, October 1918, 196 people died in the United \nStates from this influenza.\n  I have been told by experts that this H5N1 and how it manifests \nitself mirrors the influenza of 1918 and 1919.\n  Where do our efforts stand, and what can we be doing better?\n  First, where do we stand?\n  The Centers for Disease Control, under the great leadership of Dr. \nGerberding, is doing a fine job working in cooperation with the World \nHealth Organization and governments in affected regions to detect the \ndisease and to help to stop its spread. Surveillance can alert us to an \noutbreak and governments can then take measures to isolate the disease \nso that widespread infection does not occur.\n  Again, we know how to do this. The CDC knows how to do this. They had \ngreat success with surveillance, isolation, and quarantine during the \nSARS outbreak, and they managed to control its spread. We never got \nSARS in the United States because we were able to isolate it and \nquarantine it in other countries.\n  We also learned valuable lessons from this SARS episode. We need to \nbe doing a better job of surveillance. We have had some problems with \nsome countries which do not have a very good public health \ninfrastructure. They may not report illnesses and deaths as do we or \nsome other places.\n  But we have CDC personnel on the ground in these countries. They know \nwhat to do. But they are woefully inadequate in funds. They don't have \nthe funds needed to conduct adequate surveillance in these countries \nsuch as Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Russia, and places such as that. \nThey need some more support for surveillance. I will get into that in a \nlittle bit.\n\n  In order for us to get the necessary vaccines for this drug, it is \ngoing to take a few months.\n  The best thing we can be about in the initial stages is surveillance, \nfinding out where it is outbreaking, control it, isolate it, and \nquarantine it.\n  As I said, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention know how do \nthat. There are other things we can be doing better. The World Health \nOrganization is encouraging the purchase of antiviruses, medicines that \nhelp mitigate the infectious disease once you have already gotten it. \nUnfortunately, the United States only has enough antiviral medication \nfor 1 percent of our population. That is not enough. We need to invest \napproximately $3 billion to build an adequate stockpile of antiviral \nmedications. That would get us enough for about 50 percent of the \npopulation.\n  The experts tell us that we ought to be prepared for that kind of an \ninfectious rate in the United States; that it could be up to 50 percent \nor more of our people in the United States affected by this--140 \nmillion people.\n  If we stay where we are, and we only have 1 percent or 10 percent, \nthen you raise the question: Who gets it? How is it distributed?\n  We need to reassure our people that we have enough of these \nantivirals. These antivirals have a long shelf life--7 to 10 years, and \nmaybe even more.\n  It is not as if we are buying something that is going to disintegrate \nright away. These antivirals have a long shelf life.\n  In addition, the President's budget cut $120 million from State and \npublic health agencies. These are the agencies that will be on the \nfront lines of both surveillance and disease prevention should an \noutbreak occur. We have to restore this funding. But that is not \nadequate.\n  In the future, our public health infrastructure would be stretched to \nthe limits by an outbreak of avian influenza.\n  We need to invest in more public health professionals, \nepidemiologists, physicians, laboratory technicians, and others.\n  As I said, if we have an outbreak and it gets to the United States, \nthe first thing we want to do is have good surveillance, isolation, and \nquarantine. That costs money.\n  Lastly, we also must take measures to increase our Nation's vaccine \ncapacity. Currently, there is only one flu vaccine manufacturing \nfacility in the United States.\n  I have wondered about that. Why is that so?\n  In meetings with the drug industry and others, I have learned that \nvaccine production is not very profitable compared to other types of \ndrug development and manufacturing. Plus, they do not know if there is \ngoing to be a market for it.\n  This is a classic point of market failure--where the market really \ncan't respond to a future need.\n  This is where the Government must step in to provide incentives for \nmore manufacturers to build facilities in the United States.\n  Many will remember what happened during the last flu season, when \noverseas manufacturing facilities were shut down for safety reasons. \nBecause we had no manufacturing capacity domestically, we were stuck. \nWe should learn from this lesson. We cannot afford this problem when \nfaced with the threat of avian influenza. So the Federal Government can \nand must do more to improve domestic vaccine capacity.\n  What does that mean? That means we are going to have to have some \nkind of guarantee that if you make this vaccine, we guarantee we will \nbuy so many millions of doses of this vaccine.\n  Why is that important?\n  For this strain of the avian flu--in technological terms, H5N1--the \nvirus that we have isolated in people who have contracted it in \nThailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, the National Institutes of \nHealth and Infectious Disease, under Dr. Fauci, has been developing a \nvaccine. The initial reports that came out in July were that this \nvaccine has great promise. However, what we don't know is will the \nvirus that mutates and comes to this country be H5N1 or will it be H5N3 \nor H5N5? We don't know. Therefore, if a manufacturer were to \nmanufacture all these doses of vaccine for H5N1, that may not work for \nthe kind of viruses we might get later on. I am told it might work for \nsome; it might slow it down a little bit.\n\n  That is why we need to have incentives for vaccine manufacturers in \nthis country so they know if they manufacture the vaccine, it will be \npurchased. We may not use it all. We may have to develop new vaccines \nlater on down the road. But at least we will have these vaccines in \ncase H5N1 is the virus that gets here because we know that virus. That \nis why we have to move and we have to move right now. We do not have \nmuch time to invest in preparation for avian flu.\n  Some may ask, Why wasn't this done before? Perhaps we should have \ndone\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\nsomething better before. But after Katrina, maybe a lot of our eyes \nwere opened that we were not prepared and that we have to do something \ndifferent from what we are doing. Also, the virulence and the spread of \navian flu has taken new leaps in the last several months that we had \nhoped might not happen. So we are faced right now with an urgent \nsituation. We need to start right now.\n  Later on, I will be offering an amendment to this bill that will \nbasically do the following things: One, double our global surveillance \nof the avian flu through the Centers for Disease Control to identify \nand contain as soon as possible. In my conversation with CDC and \nothers, this figure is about $33 million to adequately do the \nsurveillance.\n  Second, to restore the budget cuts to local and State public health \ndepartments and emergency preparedness activities to help communities \nprepare to recognize, treat, and quarantine the avian flu virus if it \nreaches our country. The President's budget cut $122 million from \ngrants to State and local public health departments for emergency \npreparedness activities. These were grants that were first funded under \nour Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services in 2001 in \nresponse to the September 11 attacks.\n  Again, as best as we could determine in talking to those who \nadminister programs, in order to get it up to the point where they \nwould be prepared for an avian flu outbreak, it is about $600 million \nnationally.\n  Next, we need to increase the stockpile of antivirals. I mentioned \nearlier the World Health Organization recommended that each company \nstockpile enough Tamiflu--that is a brand name made by Roche \nPharmaceuticals in Switzerland. They have the patent which has been \nvery effective. The World Health Organization recommended each country \nstockpile enough for 40 percent of their population.\n  As I mentioned, right now we have enough for about 1 percent. Other \ncountries have heeded this warning and have gotten in line to purchase \nthis. The United States, as I said, has 2 million doses on hand, enough \nfor 1 percent of the population.\n  We need additional resources. We need to build this up to serve at \nleast 50 percent of our population. This comes at about $20 per dose as \nit is a multidose vaccine. It is not just one vaccine, you have to take \na couple, three doses but only if you get infected. The tab for this is \nabout $3 billion.\n  Why, again, do we need to do that? Because we do not have any company \nmaking it in this country. Roche has the patent. I want to be \nrespectful of patent rights, but other companies in America could, \nunder patent law, make an agreement with Roche, for example, to \nmanufacture it under their patent. Again, they are not going to do it \nif there is no buyer out there. Who is buying it? If we are to have \nenough of a stockpile to protect 50 percent of our population, we are \ngoing to need to come up with the money right now to guarantee a buyer \nout there to get more antivirals manufactured in a hurry.\n  Consider the nightmare scenario if next year, God forbid, avian flu \ndoes mutate, it does reach the United States, and we only have enough \ndoses for a million or 2 million people? Who will get it? How will it \nbe distributed?\n  The next part of the amendment builds up and strengthens our vaccine \ninfrastructure. We only have one manufacturer of flu vaccine in the \nUnited States, and they do not have the capacity to rapidly ramp up and \nmake enough vaccine for what we need. In the event of a pandemic, the \nUnited States would have to rely on imported vaccines which countries \nmay be unwilling to export to us; They will want it for their own \npeople.\n  Again, the estimate to get a guaranteed order out for the vaccines \nwould be about $125 million. To provide new resources for outreach \neducational efforts to health providers in the public, the estimate is \n$75 million.\n  What this all adds up to, to be prepared for an outbreak of avian \nflu, is going to require somewhere around $4 billion, a little bit less \nthan $4 billion. That is a big chunk of change. I remind my colleagues \nthat is less than what we spend in Iraq in 1 month in order to start \nreassuring the people of this country that we are going to do whatever \nis necessary to respond to this threat that is looming on the horizon.\n\n  I don't have my charts. I will have some later that will demonstrate \nthe kinds of deaths we can expect in this country. When we looked at \nthe flu epidemic of 1918 and 1919, there were about 500,000 deaths in \nthe United States, 20 to 40 million deaths worldwide. We are looking at \nthe possibility in the United States of deaths that can range anywhere \nfrom 100,000 up to 2 million, anywhere in that range. Hospitalizations \ncould go anywhere from 300,000 to 10 million. Illnesses--we do not \nreally know, but it could go from 20 to 30 to 40 million up to 100 \nmillion or more. That is the kind of pandemic we are looking at.\n  When I first had my briefing on this at CDC last year, it was perhaps \nhoped that this avian flu would not mutate as rapidly as it has. But it \nhas. So now we are in a situation of waiting until that next shoe drops \nwhen we find it has gone from a human to a human to a human. When that \nhappens, we have to be able to react immediately. It is almost the \nmidnight hour right now.\n  I hope it never hits, obviously; but since the experts say it is not \na matter of if but is only a matter of when because this is a virulent \nvirus, I hope it is put off long enough so we can get the vaccines \nmade, buy the antiviral, and put in place the surveillance and \nquarantine that we need so that when it does happen--because we are \nassured by the experts that it will--we can respond, we can quarantine, \nwe can isolate, and if it starts to spread we can give the people who \nare infected the antivirus they need and we can vaccinate other people \nso they do not get it.\n  I am hopeful we can reach some agreement on an amendment to do that. \nI hope to be offering that sometime later. It is being worked on right \nnow. I hope we can find the money to do this. This is an emergency \nbasis because I think this is an emergency basis. We passed an \nemergency to respond to Katrina; no one objected to that. We passed \nemergencies to respond to September 11; no one objected to that. I am \ntired of looking in the rearview mirror. I don't want to have us \nlooking in the rearview mirror a couple of years from now when the \navian flu has struck. It is time to look ahead. That is what this is \ngeared to do, start putting these things in place.\n  Keep in mind, it is less than 1 month's expenditure of money in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I am happy to defer to Senator Stevens if he has something \nhe would like to say.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are still in morning business, are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will wait for the Senator's statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska. I will try to be brief.\n  I just want to offer my strong support for the amendment Senator \nHarkin is going to propose and state why I think this is such an \nimportant issue.\n  Let me first say, that I am generally of the view that we should not \nbe tacking on unrelated amendments to the defense bills.\n  The money in this legislation is badly needed by our men and women in \nuniform and I do not want to slow this bill down.\n  But, this amendment dealing with the avian flu pandemic is so \nimportant to our public health security--and our national security--so \nimportant to the lives of millions of people around the world, that it \nsimply cannot wait. In fact, the situation is so ominous that Dr. Julie \nGerberding, the Director of the CDC, said that an avian flu outbreak is \n``the most important threat that we are facing [today].''\n  In light of these developments, I believe it is worth the U.S. Senate \nspending just a few hours on this critical issue, even if it is not \ndirectly related to the underlying legislation.\n  Over the last few months, we have heard alarming reports from \ncountries all over Asia--Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand--about \ndeaths from the avian flu.\n  International health experts say that two of the three conditions for \nan\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\navian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist. First, a new strain \nof the virus, called H5N1, has emerged and humans have little or no \nimmunity. Second, this strain has shown that it can jump between \nspecies.\n  The last condition--the ability for the virus to travel efficiently \nfrom human to human--has not been met, and it is the only thing \npreventing a full blown pandemic. Once this virus mutates and can be \ntransmitted from human to human, because of global trade and travel, we \nwill not be able to contain this disease. We learned this lesson from \nSARS, which took less than 4 months to get from Asia to Canada, where \nit caused human and economic devastation.\n  When I started talking about this issue 7 months ago, many people \nthought that the avian flu was a mild concern, an Asian problem, an \nunlikely threat to Americans here in the U.S.\n  As time has progressed, the Nation's top scientists and experts have \nfocused greater attention on the possibilities of an avian flu \npandemic, and they have rapidly come to consensus that it is not a \nmatter of if the pandemic will hit but when? It is not a question of \nwhether will people die but how many? And the main question, the \nquestion that keeps me awake at night, is whether the United States \nwill be able to deal with this calamity?\n  From what we have seen with the lack of readiness and dismal response \nto Hurricane Katrina, I think that all of us would have to conclude \nthat the answer, at this point in time, is no.\n  Whether we are talking about having adequate surveillance capacities \nin our State and local health departments, having enough doctors and \nhospital beds and medical equipment for infected individuals, or having \na vaccine or treatment that is guaranteed to work, I don't want to be \nan alarmist, but here in the U.S., we are in serious trouble.\n  Several of us here in the Congress--on a bipartisan basis--have taken \nthe first steps needed to address this looming crisis. In April of this \nyear, I introduced the AVIAN Act, S. 969 that would increase our \npreparedness for avian flu pandemic. Senators Lugar and Durbin and \nseveral others have cosponsored this act and I thank them for that. We \nneed to move this bill as quickly as possible.\n  In May, I and Senators Lugar, McConnell, and Leahy included $25 \nmillion for avian flu activities as part of the Iraq supplemental. \nToday, this money is helping the World Health Organization to step up \nits international surveillance and response efforts.\n  In July, I included an additional $10 million to combat avian flu in \nthe Foreign Operations assistance bill. That bill is currently in \nconference, and I hope this funding will be retained.\n  I am also working with Senate Defense authorizers on an amendment to \nrequire the DOD report to Congress on its efforts to prepare for \npandemic influenza.\n  This report must address the procurement of vaccines, antivirals and \nother medicine; the protocols for distributing such vaccines or \nmedicine to high priority populations; and how the DOD intends to work \nwith other agencies, such as HHS and State, to respond to pandemic flu.\n  Today, with leadership by Senator Harkin, we are introducing an \namendment to the DOD appropriations bill to provide $3.9 billion in \nemergency funds for avian flu activities. Senator Harkin has already \noutlined what this amendment does, so I will not rehash what he has \nalready said.\n  The bottom line is that this amendment needs to be passed and passed \nas quickly as possible.\n  I know that $3.9 billion is a lot of money--especially given our \nfiscal situation today. But this is one issue on which we cannot be \npenny-wise and pound-foolish. If we don't invest the money now, this \npandemic will hit America harder, more lives will be lost, and we will \nhave to spend significantly more in resources to respond after the \nfact.\n  As we learned the hard way after Hurricane Katrina, the failure to \nprepare for emergencies can have devastating consequences. This nation \nmust not be caught off guard when faced with the prospect of the avian \nflu. This amendment will help the Federal agencies to prepare the \nNation to prevent and respond to avian flu.\n  America is already behind in recognizing and preparing for a \npotentially deadly and economically devastating avian flu pandemic that \npublic health experts say is not a matter of if but when. We must face \nthe reality that in this age when you can get on a plane in Bangkok and \narrive in Chicago in hours, this is not a problem isolated half a world \naway but one that could impact us right here at home.\n  The need is great, and the time to act is way overdue. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes'' and support this amendment.\n  To reiterate, Senators Lugar, McConnell, and Leahy already worked \nwith me to include $25 million for avian flu activities as part of the \nIraq supplemental. I included an additional $10 million to combat avian \nflu in the foreign operations assistance bill. But as Senator Harkin \nnoted, we need much more based on the briefing we received from the \nadministration yesterday. We have to move now on this issue. It has to \nbe moved rapidly. We have to build an infrastructure to create vaccines \nand to purchase enough antiviral drugs. I strongly urge that on a \nbipartisan basis we make this one of our top priorities. This is a \ncrisis waiting to happen. If we are not prepared for it now, we will \nall be extraordinarily sorry.\n  The only other comment I will make is, I know times are tough with \nrespect to our budget. I am working with my colleagues across the aisle \nto figure out ways we can come up with the money for Katrina and Iraq. \nThis is a sound investment. If we don't make this investment now, we \nwill pay much more later.\n  So I hope the amendment Senator Harkin is going to offer will get \nbipartisan support and receive the utmost consideration from this \nChamber.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want the Senate to know I welcome the \nattention of Senators to the problem of the avian virus. In 1997, \nbecause of information I discovered concerning what Senator Obama just \nmentioned--the intersection where wild birds come to Alaska from the \nChinese mainland and other places in the world, including Russia--we \nbegan a series of funds in the Agriculture bill to study the process of \nthis virus being transmitted. As Senator Obama has mentioned, so far it \nhas always been bird to bird or animal to animal. There has been no \ntransmutation to take it from human to human or bird to human. It is \none of the dangerous problems of the world, no question about it.\n  When I first heard of Senator Harkin's amendment, I said I might--I \nsaid I would cosponsor it. As I read it, it is not just about the \nvirus. It is reversing the President's decision with regard to State \nand local public health agencies. It is starting an addition to the \ndomestic vaccine infrastructure. All of that, I understand, was part of \nthe briefing some Senators had yesterday and I am informed others will \nsoon get.\n  There is a BioShield group working in the administration, \nparticularly in the agencies that are dealing with disease control and \nvarious other subjects. There will undoubtedly be a presentation by \nthem to the Congress. There has not been such a presentation yet. The \nbriefing the Senators got was for the information concerning what those \npeople are doing who are working on that plan.\n  This is an amendment that sort of short circuits the concept of \ndealing with it and asks for some of the money they ask for, but I am \ntold the amendment will not distribute the money the way the BioShield \nproposal will distribute it. It is brought to us as an emergency \nmeasure. It may well be that the BioShield people bring us a bill that \nis partially emergency and partially funded. We do not know yet.\n  But very clearly we do know there is no current human-to-human \ntransmission that has been known of in the world. For us to say this is \nthe greatest problem we have and is superior to some of the things we \nare doing, particularly in Iraq or in the war on terror, I think is a \ntotally misplaced comparison, as far as I am concerned. I am just back \nfrom Iraq. I have seen some of the dangers over there and have talked \nto some of the people who have been injured over there. To compare the \nmoney we have in this bill to fund them with funding a proposal to deal\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\nwith a virus, for something that has not yet become a threat to human \nbeings, I believe is wrong.\n  The BioShield proposal will be before the Congress, I am told, in \nthis Congress. I want to announce now that I will ask the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee to raise a point of order to this amendment. It is \nan emergency declaration. It is not the recommendations of the \nBioShield group who briefed the Senator last night. It is a premature \nattempt to bring it to the floor on the Defense bill where it does not \nbelong. So I hope the Senate will agree with us and not make this an \nemergency appropriations at this time.\n  Now, there is no question in my mind this could well develop into a \npolitical argument. I have been on this floor now since 1981 as one of \nthe managers of this bill. I cannot remember a time when we had a \npolitical argument on a nongermane amendment to this bill. This is a \nbill to fund the people in uniform overseas. It is not the \nauthorization bill where there are amendments from time to time offered \nwhich are nongermane. We have had a policy of no nongermane amendments \non this bill. I intend to pursue that policy.\n  This is not a germane amendment. This is an amendment that is \npremature in terms of avian flu. Again, I say no one has a greater \ninterest in this avian flu than I do. When I go home on weekends and I \ngo to a restaurant I love, I know I am sitting next to people who have \njust come back from Russia. We go to Russia daily from my State. We go \nto China daily from my State. We have pilots who fly planes throughout \nChina, throughout Russia, living right there in the community in which \nI live. We know there is an avian flu potential over there. The birds \nthat come from over there intersect with our birds. We know that. We \nhave been studying that since 1997. Just yesterday, I talked to a \ndoctor about avian flu vaccine and when we would be able to get it for \nAlaska. I was told we will get it in time.\n  But now I come out here and I have an amendment to be offered when we \ntake up the bill that makes it an emergency to appropriate almost $4 \nbillion, and not on the basis of recommendations of the experts but on \nthe basis of some Senators who were briefed yesterday, prematurely, at \ntheir request, of studies that are going on at the administration.\n  Now, I am not one who takes lightly bringing subjects to this bill \nthat do not pertain to protecting people in uniform. We had a similar \nsituation once with regard to anthrax and other studies, and we acted \nvery promptly because that did apply to people in uniform. But this is \nnot something that pertains to the defense of the United States. It \ncould very well be in the future a very vital issue to our Nation and \nto the world, but right now we ought to wait for the scientists to come \nand tell us what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, where it \nneeds to be done, and who is going to do it. But this is throwing money \nat a wall. I will oppose that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10656-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10656-S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Supervision and administration costs associated \n     with a construction project funded with appropriations \n     available for operation and maintenance, and executed in \n     direct support of the Global War on Terrorism only in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan, may be obligated at the time a construction \n     contract is awarded: Provided, That for the purpose of this \n     section, supervision and administration costs include all in-\n     house Government cost.\n       Sec. 9013. Amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     in this title are designated as making appropriations for \n     contingency operations related to the global war on terrorism \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 2006''.\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Along with the Senator from Hawaii, I am pleased to \npresent the Defense appropriations bill for 2006. This bill reflects \nthe bipartisan approach that my cochairman, Senator Inouye, and I have \nalways maintained regarding the Department of Defense. It is, once \nagain, a pleasure\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\nto work with him on this bill and with other members of our \nsubcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee through this \nprocess.\n  This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee \nyesterday by a unanimous vote of 28 to 0. We have worked hard to make \ncertain the bill reaches out and is understood, is appreciated, and \nsupported by every member of our Appropriations Committee.\n  As we will be debating this bill, there are hundreds of thousands of \nmen and women in uniform forward deployed and serving our country in \nover 120 countries and also throughout the United States. Their bravery \nand dedication to our country are extraordinary, and their sacrifices \ndo not go unnoticed.\n  Each year, the Department of Defense faces critical challenges. The \nDepartment must ensure that we can maintain high levels of readiness \nand we are able to respond to the call of duty wherever and whenever it \nis necessary. And it must ensure we are simultaneously invested in the \nresources which will enable us to meet the threats of tomorrow.\n  This bill, which Senator Inouye and I will present I hope today, \nreflects a prudent balance among those challenges. It recommends $440.2 \nbillion in budget authority for the Department of Defense. This funding \nincludes $50 billion for contingency operations related to the global \nwar on terrorism pursuant to section 402 of the concurrent budget \nresolution on the budget for 2006.\n  While this bill is a $7 billion reduction from that provided in the \nPresident's budget request for 2006, it still meets the Defense \nSubcommittee's allocation for both budget authority and outlays, and it \nis consistent with the objectives of this administration and the \nrecommendations contained in the Senate national defense authorization \nbill for 2006 as it was reported.\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate. We believe \nthis bill addresses key requirements for readiness, quality of life, \nand transformation of the force. This bill will honor our commitment to \nour Armed Forces. It helps ensure they will continue to have first-rate \ntraining, modernized equipment, and quality infrastructure. It also \nprovides the funds needed to continue the global war on terrorism.\n  Mr. President, yesterday Senator Inouye and I met with GEN John \nAbizaid, Commander of the U.S. Central Command, and GEN George Casey, \nthe Commander of the multinational force in Iraq, to discuss the global \nwar on terrorism and the current situation in Iraq.\n  The central command, with its responsibility for the Middle East, the \nHorn of Africa, parts of south Asia, and central Asia, has the lead in \nfighting this war on terrorism. It is a war that some envision may last \nfor several generations. I am not talking about the war in Iraq. I am \ntalking about the overall war on terrorism. And I repeat, we are \ninformed that is a war that many envision will last for generations.\n  The terrorists we face view this war as a worldwide crusade for their \nideology, a war that they are willing to win at all costs, at least try \nto win at all costs. In fact, they see that inflicting suffering on \ninnocent civilians furthers their cause. In my view, the United States \nhas to lead the world in fighting this terrorist movement. We must \nremain resilient. We must set the example. We must stay the course.\n  Our meeting with Generals Abizaid and Casey was both insightful and \ndisturbing, but I am convinced our country has entrusted this global \nwar on terrorism to two very capable leaders. They understand the \nchallenges we face and are committed to successfully prosecuting this \nwar on terrorism.\n  We also talked about the strategy in Iraq and agreed that building \nlocal Iraq military capacity is a central tenet to our success there. \nGeneral Abizaid and General Casey informed us that Iraqi security \nforces are already in charge of large parts of Iraq. Fourteen of the \ncountry's 18 provinces are now in charge of their own force.\n  Last year, before the Iraqi elections, we deployed an additional \n12,000 troops to maintain stability throughout the countryside. This \nyear, our senior commanders have only requested 2,000 troops for that \nsame purpose. Let me repeat that. When they had an election last year, \nit was believed that 12,000 troops, our troops, in addition to the \nforces there, were needed to help maintain stability throughout the \ncountryside. This year, senior commanders have only requested 2,000 \ntroops for that. Although this is a small metric, it is tangible proof \nof forward progress and tangible proof that the Iraqis can, will, and \nare taking over substantial responsibility to meet the problems in \ntheir own country.\n  Currently, our military leaders have assigned 8 to 10 military \npersonnel to each and every Iraqi unit as advisers. They are helping \nIraqi units leverage their strength and shore up their weaknesses.\n  There are those who say we should accelerate this process, training \nmore Iraqi forces faster so we can bring U.S. troops home sooner. this \nsounds like a straightforward solution, but the situation is not so \nsimple or clear-cut.\n  Earlier this month, along with Senators Warner and Kerry, I traveled \nto Iraq, and I repeatedly asked two questions: Can we speed up the \ntraining and equipping of Iraqi forces? And even more fundamentally, I \nasked of those there, both Iraqis and Americans, what do they think \nabout our mission in Iraq.\n  On the first question, the unanimous feedback from U.S. civilian and \nmilitary officials was that we cannot be rushed in the process of \ntraining Iraqis. It must be done in a careful and measured way.\n  The U.S. Government is not only helping to build Iraqi forces, we are \nbuilding capacity both within the Iraqi ministries and the security \nforces within the Government itself. The Iraqi Government must assume \nresponsibility for these forces, which means after the United States \nequips and trains these people, the Iraqis must pay their way and \nsustain them. This may lead to a drawdown of U.S. forces at an \nappropriate time in the future, but a premature withdrawal of U.S. \nforces would be disastrous for the Iraqi people and for the world. We \nmust continue to demonstrate our commitment that we will stay in Iraq \nuntil our mission is complete and remain engaged in a mission so that \nwe are certain that the Iraqis will complete that and be able to \nsustain their new Government.\n  The second question I asked was: What do you think of our mission in \nIraq? The response I received was unanimous. U.S. civilians, our men \nand women in uniform, told me they believe we are doing what is \nimportant, that we should stay the course and get the job done, do our \njob.\n  I was impressed with the fact that so many young military people, \nwhen I asked them how long they had been there, told me they had been \nthere two and three times, and they had asked to come back so they were \nsure they had a part in finishing the job we undertook in Iraq.\n  Senator Inouye and I are part of a different generation. We are what \nis left of the World War II generation in the Senate. Our generation \nhad no doubt about our duty. I believe the young men and women of \ntoday's Armed Forces share our commitment to preserve and protect \nfreedom. Our visit with them was inspiring, and many times it left \ntears in my eyes. These young men and women make me proud to be an \nAmerican. Every one of them volunteered to enter the armed services. \nThere are no draftees in Iraq. I promised them that I am going to be \nback again to make certain they have the materials and the support they \nneed.\n  On this same trip, we traveled throughout the region to Kuwait, \nTurkey, and other countries where we visited with senior NATO \nofficials. They, too, talked about the broad problem of the world, the \nthreat of international terrorism. These military leaders from other \ncountries, as well as ours, and NATO highlighted the need for the \nUnited States to take the lead on the global war on terrorism and to \ncontinue to assist our friends and allies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa, \nand Europe, to make sure this crusade does not take root, that it does \nnot gather steam.\n  The bill we will place before the Senate will enable us to maintain \nour commitment and our support of these troops. I am proud again to \nthank my cochairman, my friend for so many years, for his support and \ninvaluable counsel on this bill. I thank Sid\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nAshworth, who has worked with me, and Charlie Houy, who has worked with \nSenator Inouye, and recognize them for their tremendous efforts on this \nbill. We have all worked together for a long time now, and I believe \nthis is as good a bill as we have ever brought before the Senate, \nrepresented by the vote I mentioned. Every member of the full \nAppropriations Committee voted that we should be allowed to bring this \nbill to the floor.\n  I hope that sometime today that will be possible. I hope my friend \nunderstands the circumstances under which we are making statements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nendorsement of H.R. 2863, the fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill. As the chairman noted, this bill was unanimously approved by the \nAppropriations Committee. It is a bipartisan bill which was crafted by \nChairman Stevens with the full involvement of the minority.\n  In compliance with the committee allocations, this bill is $7 billion \nlower than the amount requested by the administration. As such, the \ncommittee had to make several difficult decisions to meet the reduced \nlevel. Even under these conditions, I can assure my colleagues that \nthis is a very good bill which will meet our national security needs \nfor the coming year.\n  The top priority of this measure is to ensure that we provide for the \nwell-being of our men and women in uniform and their families. The bill \nincludes a 3.1-percent pay raise, and it provides $19.3 billion to run \nour military hospitals and pay for the other day-to-day health care \ncosts for our forces.\n  Not counting the costs of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, this \nmeasure includes nearly $125 billion to safeguard military readiness \nand pay for other routine operations of the Department of Defense.\n  As most of my colleagues are surely aware, recruiting has become a \ngreater challenge in recent years. So I am pleased to note that this \nbill includes $622 million above the budgeted amount to improve \nrecruiting tools so that we can maintain the highest quality in our \nmilitary. Furthermore, a total of $146 billion is recommended in this \nbill for investing in much needed equipment for our forces today and \nour forces of the future.\n  We all know that the war in Iraq is controversial, on which many of \nour colleagues have very strong opinions. But I believe what we all \nagree upon is the need to support our troops who are now serving in \nharm's way. To that end, the bill provides an additional $50 billion \nfor pay, operations, and equipment to support our fighting forces \noverseas. These funds are essential to support these brave men and \nwomen.\n  Today is September 29. The fiscal year ends tomorrow. It is \nimperative that we move this bill as quickly as possible. After Senate \npassage, the committee will still need to take this bill into \nconference. Because of that, I would urge my colleagues not to offer \namendments to this bill which might be better suited for other \nlegislation except to meet truly emergency requirements. I believe \nthere will be plenty of time in the coming months to consider issues \nwhich are not relevant to this defense spending measure.\n  This is a good bill. I strongly support it and urge all of my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that the \nclassified annex that accompanies the 2006 Defense appropriations bill \nis available in S407 for all Members and those staffs who have \nappropriate clearance. There has been a request that we distribute this \nto Members' offices. That is prohibited. We must keep these documents \nin a classified area, and only those who are cleared may have access to \nthem. This annex is available in S407. We will make arrangements for \nthat room to stay open whatever time the Senators and their cleared \nstaff wish to have access to it, but it is not possible for us to \ndistribute.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1886\n\n     (Purpose: To make available emergency funds for pandemic flu \n                             preparedness)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Obama, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Schumer, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 1886:\n\n       On page   , at the appropriate place at the end of Title 9, \n     insert the following:\n\n                               TITLE   .\n\n     SEC. 101.\n\n       (a) From the money in the Treasury not otherwise obligated \n     or appropriated, there are appropriated to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention $3,913,000,000 for activities \n     relating to the avian flu epidemic during the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2006, which shall be available until \n     expended.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated under subsection (a)--\n       (1) $3,080,000,000 shall be for the stockpiling of \n     antivirals and necessary medical supplies\n       (2) $33,000,000 shall be for global surveillance relating \n     to avian flu\n       (3) $125,000,000 shall be to increase the national \n     investment in domestic vaccine infrastructure including \n     development and research\n       (4) $600,000,000 shall be for additional grants to state \n     and local public health agencies for emergency preparedness, \n     to increase funding for emergency preparedness centers, and \n     to expand hospital surge capacity\n       (5) $75,000,000 shall be for risk communication and \n     outreach to providers, businesses, and to the American public\n       (c) The amount appropriated under subsection (a)\n       (1) is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress); and\n       (2) shall remain available until expended.\n       (d) This title shall take effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nperiod of routine morning business between the hours of 2:30 p.m. and 4 \np.m. today. Senators have been invited to the White House to attend the \nswearing in of Judge Roberts. Buses will be provided for \ntransportation. We will not conduct business during the period of that \nimportant event.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the distinguished President pro \ntempore of the Senate allow us to be in a period of morning business \nduring that period of time? There are some people who want to come and \ntalk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am asking for morning business during that period. \nThere would be morning business with no votes from 2:30 to 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted the amendment I sent to the desk \nread because I want those who are not here, who are maybe in their \noffices, and their staff to understand what it is. It is not that long \nof an amendment. It basically tracks what I said earlier in my opening \nstatement.\n  I wish to respond a little bit to what was said on the floor just a \nminute ago. First of all, I point out to the Senator from Alaska that \nmaybe this might be more appropriate on the Labor-HHS bill, the Labor-\nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill.\n  I remind people, tomorrow is the end of the fiscal year. They have \nnot brought the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill to \nthe floor. We do not know if they are ever going to bring it to the \nfloor. So we do not have an opportunity to offer it there. The Defense \nauthorization bill was up, and they took that off the floor. So I have \nnot had an opportunity to offer it there.\n  Now we have Defense appropriations. Quite frankly, this is about \ndefense. It is about defending our people--not against a terrorist but \nagainst terrorism, the terrorism of an avian flu pandemic. That is what \nthis is about.\n  Now, I heard the Senator talk about BioShield. Well, I think maybe we \nought to understand that BioShield money cannot be used for this \nbecause BioShield money can only be used for\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\ndrugs for which there is no commercial market. Obviously there is a \ngreat commercial market for Tamiflu.\n  So they can have all kinds of study groups and stuff going on down at \nthe White House, but they have been privy to this information for a \nlong time down at the White House, I say to my colleagues, more privy \nto this information than we have been. So if people are saying, ``Well, \nwhy are you offering this now?'' I am offering it now because it is the \nmidnight hour. We have to do something about this. We have to put the \nmoney up there. We have to get moving on it now--not next year, not \nafter some study group in the White House has banged this thing around \nfor another 3 months.\n  Who is in charge of this study group? I do not know. We had a \nbriefing yesterday by Secretary Leavitt, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Gerberding, \nothers. I thought it very unusual we would have a top-secret meeting, a \nbriefing. Be that as it may, that is what they wanted to do. It became \nclear to me we have to do something. We can't dawdle any longer.\n\n  The Senator said there is a task force at the White House working \nunder BioShield. That is not what this is about. BioShield, fine, that \nhas its own process. There is a reason for BioShield, for developing \ndrugs that have no commercial market. That is not what this is about. \nThis is about money for surveillance, quarantine. It is about money for \nbuilding up local public health facilities, buying antivirals to cover \nhalf of our people. There is a market for that. We just don't have \nthem; that is all. It is about putting money into vaccine production.\n  We only have one flu vaccine manufacturing plant in America. I am \ntold the reason for that is because there is not much profit in \nvaccines, not like Viagra or Cyalis, drugs such as that. I can't fault \nthe drug companies. There is no money to be made from this. They are in \nthe business of answering to their shareholders. This is a proper place \nfor Government interference, interjection.\n  Some of the things I heard from Alaska didn't comport with what we \nare trying to do. H5N1, the virus that struck in Southeast Asia, was \nisolated. We brought it back to NIH. They have been developing a \nvaccine based on H5N1. Preliminary reports are promising, but we are \nnot there yet. The problem is, if we run off on a tangent, all we do is \nmake the vaccine for H5N1, we might be invaded by H5N2 or 3, or 4 or 5, \nsome other mutation, and that vaccine may not be adaptable for that. \nThat is why we need to build up the vaccination manufacturing \ncapability in this country.\n  Yes, we need to be preparing the vaccine for H5N1, but we have to \nbuild up capacity for rapidly developing other vaccines in case it is a \nmutation and is not that virus. Keep in mind, this is not some scenario \nof maybe. When you talk to the people at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention or NIH, they say it is not a matter of if, it is \nwhen. We have to be prepared.\n  We had warnings before. We had warnings about Katrina. We knew things \nweren't adequate in New Orleans and the gulf coast. We had a lot of \nwarnings before 9/11 about terrorists blowing up the World Trade \nCenter, using airplanes as weapons. We had all those warnings. We \nignored them. We cannot afford to ignore this.\n  The chairman raised all kinds of arguments as to why this should not \nbe on the Defense appropriations bill. Well, we don't have any other \nbill. It is before us. This is a money matter. It has to do with using \nGovernment money to get us ready. Quite frankly, I can think of a \nbetter place than the appropriations bill.\n  The Senator from Alaska also said this has never happened where we \nhave done something that didn't pertain to our troops and defense on an \nappropriations bill. I am sorry. About 14 years ago, I offered an \namendment to increase funding for breast cancer research to the Defense \nappropriations bill, and it was adopted. Quite frankly, I must say, the \nDOD has done a great job in utilizing those funds ever since, and the \nmoney we put in after that. They have done some of the best grant \nprograms on breast cancer research. That didn't have anything to do \nwith troops in the field, but it was added to the Defense bill. That is \nnot the only example. There are others. I mentioned that one because I \nhappened to be involved. To say we have never done this before on a \nDefense appropriations bill is not factual.\n  I am hopeful we can get to a vote on this amendment and have a strong \nbipartisan vote on this bill to get us ready and to reassure our people \nthat we are going to defend them to the maximum extent possible from an \noutbreak of avian flu.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague from Iowa. My \ncolleague recognizes the need for this country to prepare for a \npossible influenza pandemic. I am not here to be a historian, to \ndetermine what has happened in the past on Defense appropriations \nbills. I will share that disease surveillance is not something new. It \noccurs day in and day out. The Centers for Disease Control is an active \nparticipant in the surveillance efforts for a potential global outbreak \nof avian flu. Post-9/11, this country became not only concerned but \nbegan actively preparing for consequences of chemical, biological, and \nradiological threats that could be used by terrorists.\n  We should pause and remind ourselves these potential acts can be \ndeliberate, accidental, or natural. Clearly, the threat of avian flu is \na natural occurrence. The Centers for Disease Control, the World Health \nOrganization, all participate in preventing the spread of avian flu and \nwork to make us better understand when that threat may affect us here \nat home.\n  The Senator from Iowa targets a number of things that are very \nappropriate and important: stockpiles, global surveillance, a national \ninvestment in domestic vaccine infrastructure, additional grant moneys \nfor local public health agencies. But clearly, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is right; the majority of these need to be \nconsidered in and appropriated from the committees that have \njurisdiction over the relevant agencies--the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Centers for Disease Control.\n  We are all alarmed about any of these threats, whether it is \ndeliberate, accidental, or natural. This year the Subcommittee on \nBioterrorism and Public Preparedness has held six hearings and/or \nroundtables on this subject. We have examined the infrastructure we \ncurrently have to research, develop, and approve countermeasures \nagainst all of these threats. These countermeasures can be antivirals, \nas the Senator spoke of, for avian flu. They could be vaccines, as we \nhave already purchased with BioShield, for anthrax for example. We are \ncommitted to ensure that we have the right kinds of countermeasures to \nprotect the American public.\n\n  But we have a fiduciary responsibility to the American people, too. \nThat is to make sure that we do not invest billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars into a stockpile that, in fact, has a life \nexpectancy shorter than the threat.\n  I have come to plead with my colleagues, let's approach this in a \ncomprehensive way. Let's, in fact, put together a plan that addresses \nnot only avian flu but all of those chemical, biological, radiological \nthreats that exist today. I remind you of the threat from anthrax and \nsmallpox we have debated in this building before this date. I remind my \ncolleagues that we have currently invested some $800 million for \nanthrax vaccines for the national stockpile. We have this week received \na briefing from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as Senator \nHarkin said, and the Director of the CDC and the head of National \nInstitute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases during which they \ntalked about their initial approach to the threat of avian flu. I \nstress the word ``initial'' because it is yet to have the input of this \nbody, of the committees, and the subcommittees that have held hearings, \nthat have met with representatives from industry, that understand the \ndeficiencies in our infrastructure to confront this and other similar \nthreats.\n  Vaccine shortages are not just an infrastructure deficiency for avian \nflu. There is a deficiency across the board for vaccines in this \ncountry, in large part because of the policies we have adopted. I \nsuggest this is not an issue we can just throw money at. This is an\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nissue that needs a comprehensive plan and approach as to how we set up \na structure and mechanism so we are not on this floor in the future \ntalking about further deficiencies. In many cases, everything Senator \nHarkin lists will be components of comprehensive legislation that we \nplan to deal with how much and what we should stockpile. It will deal \nwith global surveillance and whether we can do it better than we do \ntoday. It will deal with the vaccine infrastructure and our reliance on \nhaving the manufacturing, research, and development capabilities on the \nshores of the United States and not have us reliant on a company that \nmight have a facility outside of the United States.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues, let's do it in a comprehensive way \nso we are prepared to move forward in an expedited process that would \nanswer all these questions before we adjourn this calendar year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was yielded to for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina yielded for a \nquestion to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator from Iowa allow me to yield to the \nminority leader?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  I thank the Senator. He is a very thoughtful individual and chairman \nof the Bioterrorism Subcommittee on which I sit. He has given a \nthoughtful response. I respect that. I think there is a certain logic \nto what the Senator has said. I might use the phrase ``seductive \nlogic,'' because obviously there is a lot more out there than just \nthis.\n  I respond to my friend by using an analogy: Just as I thought, it was \nwrong to put FEMA under Homeland Security because they are two \ndifferent things. Homeland Security has to do with terrorism, that kind \nof threat; FEMA, natural disasters. I still think those should be \nseparate. I thought it was wrong before to put them together. This is \nalso the same kind of thing. The bioterrorism the chairman has been \ndoing a great job at, that is one thing. The surveillance that is \nneeded for terrorism and things such as that is different than the kind \nof surveillance needed by the CDCP in terms of a flu outbreak. You are \ntalking about different people, different disciplines, a whole \ndifferent set of parameters other than fighting some kind of biological \nterrorist threat.\n  So while there may be logic, at some point, for doing this in a \nbroader authorization bill--that is fine--I am saying to my friend, I \ndon't think we have time to wait for that. I don't know when the bill \nwould come up. Secondly, as I said to the chairman of this committee, \nthis probably ought to be on the Labor-Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill. But that has not been brought up, and I don't know \nif it is ever going to be brought up.\n  So my thinking is that because of the urgency of this--and the \nSenator and I heard the briefing yesterday--I thought we ought to at \nleast do something to get this thing moving and moving now rather be \nwaiting to January or February or who knows when. So I submit to the \nchairman that while he has logic in what he says in putting this \ntogether, I think in this one case it has to be separated out right \nnow. That is all I am trying to say.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me try to connect the logic with the \nreality, that if the Senator permits me, I will sit down with him next \nweek. I believe I can show him at least the initial language that puts \nthis altogether in a comprehensive way and in fact addresses not only \nthe deliberate and accidental biological, chemical, and radiological \nthreats but also includes the natural threat that avian flu clearly \nemanates from. I believe there is a new structure, not an existing \nstructure, within the framework that will work, and if the Senator will \nwork with me next week, I think his comfort level would be as great as \nmine today that we can address this threat in a comprehensive way, and \nthat is a pledge that we will do it expeditiously, this year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, if he will yield further, I \nappreciate it. I would like to work with him on this, and I think our \nstaffs have been, but again I am not certain when we are going to get \nto the appropriation on that. That is what I don't know. When will we \never get to an appropriation on that? I say to my friend, I don't know. \nAs I said, there is a logic in what he is saying. I am saying because \nof the problem of avian flu, because it could be so imminent, I don't \nthink we have any days to wait. That is all I am saying.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina holds time.\n  Mr. BURR. I would be happy to yield time to the minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator doesn't need to recognize me. The Chair needs \nto recognize me. Is he finished?\n  Mr. BURR. Does the Senator need time before 2:30?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know. Are we under controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not under controlled time.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. BURR. If the minority leader will allow me a few more minutes, I \nwill conclude my comments as they relate to the amendment by the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Let me say, if I can, for the purposes of what the Senator raised \nwith me, there is a willingness on the part of Members on both sides of \nthe aisle that this body move expeditiously to address this threat. I \ndon't believe the timing is going to be a problem as we move through \nthis year. I think it is a question of whether we sufficiently \nconstruct a mechanism to assure us that we have done the right thing; \nthat just to dump money into any system that might be deficient today \nwould be a mistake. I truly believe that with the support on both sides \nof the aisle and both bodies of leadership, this is an issue we can \nsufficiently resolve and we can do it in an expeditious way.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank you very much. I apologize to the \nSenator from North Carolina for interrupting. I did not mean to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I approach this a little differently. There is always \ntomorrow. But on this issue, there is no tomorrow; there is only today. \nI have been worried about this issue for some time. Yesterday, my \nconcern became paramount. The people of the State of Nevada and this \ncountry deserve our attention today, not tomorrow.\n  Dr. Julie Gerberding said:\n\n     . . . many influenza experts, including those at CDC, \n     consider the threat of a serious influenza pandemic to the \n     United States to be high. Although the timing and impact of \n     an influenza pandemic is unpredictable, the occurrence is \n     inevitable and potentially devastating.\n\n  I am concerned about smallpox. I am concerned about anthrax. I am \nconcerned about chemical terrorism, biological terrorism. But this \npandemic is coming. We have been told this time and time again. I think \nit is incumbent upon this body to pass our amendment that is now before \nthe Senate. Republicans and Democrats need to pass this amendment \nbecause the American people deserve it.\n  Four years after 9/11, the Government was supposed to be better \nprepared for the next national disaster. Yet as we witnessed all too \nclearly and painfully with Hurricane Katrina, our Government was not. \nWe owe it to the American people to do better in the future. Today, we \nhave that opportunity.\n  The human and economic toll of Hurricane Katrina has been dramatic, \nbut the devastation caused by Katrina would pale in comparison with a \npotential global avian flu pandemic, which, the head of the Centers for \nDisease Control says is inevitable.\n  One health expert has concluded that nearly 2 million Americans would \ndie in the first year alone from this. Now, a flu pandemic in the \nUnited States would cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars \ndue to death, lost productivity, and disruptions to commerce and \nsociety.\n\n  Perhaps the only thing more troubling than contemplating the possible \nconsequences of avian flu is recognizing that neither this Nation nor \nthe world is prepared to deal with it. We have no plan. Today we have \nno plan.\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nWe know that one of our best opportunities to limit the scope and \nconsequences of any outbreak is to rapidly detect the emergence of a \nnew strain that is capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. \nYet we are not devoting enough resources to effective surveillance \nabroad.\n  We all know that State and local health departments will be on the \nfront lines of a pandemic and health care providers must develop surge \ncapacity plans so they can respond to a pandemic.\n  This Congress is poised to approve a $130 million cut for State and \nlocal preparedness funding for the Centers for Disease Control. That is \nin the President's budget--a $130 million cut.\n  We also know once a flu strain has been identified, we need to \ndevelop a vaccine. That takes time, some say as long as 8 months. Our \nexisting stock of vaccines, assuming they are effective against a \nfuture, as yet unidentified, strain may protect less than 1 percent of \nall Americans. And we have only one domestic flu vaccine manufacturer \nlocated in the United States.\n  It is estimated that if our capacity to produce a vaccine is not \nimproved, it could take 15 months to vaccinate the first responders, \nmedical personnel and other high risk groups.\n  We know it will take months to develop, produce, and distribute a \nvaccine once we have had it perfected. But we must rely on antiviral \nmedicines as a stopgap against this pandemic. Other nations that \ncertainly do not have the resources we have, including Great Britain, \nFrance, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, Finland, and New Zealand have \nordered enough of this Tamiflu, an antiviral pill, to cover up to 40 \npercent of their population. We have virtually nothing.\n  The consequences of a pandemic could be far reaching, impacting \nvirtually every sector of our society and our economy. Yet we have not \ntaken appropriate action to prepare the medical community, business \ncommunity, or the American public so they can take necessary steps to \nprepare for and respond to an avian flu outbreak.\n  This great country of ours can do better. We have to. We cannot \nafford to wait to do better. That is why I am so happy to join my \nfriends in sponsoring this amendment.\n  To put this amendment in perspective, this amendment calls for $3.9 \nbillion in emergency funds for pandemic flu preparedness at the CDC. To \nput this amount in perspective, the cost of our amendment is less than \nwhat we spend in 1 month on the war in Iraq--far less than we spend in \n1 month there. We are facing the real prospect of another war here at \nhome called the flu. This amendment would go a long way toward \ncommitting the resources necessary to fighting and winning the war.\n  People say, well, where are we going to get the money? We have no \nchoice. The American people deserve it. We can't stay back saying we \nwill do it tomorrow. We need to do it today and I want everyone within \nthe sound of my voice to know this is not a partisan issue. We need \nRepublicans and Democrats to support this effort because this flu is \ngoing to strike us all.\n  This is not meant to be alarmist. It is meant to let everyone know \nthe time is here to do something about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, we have several minutes remaining before we \nmove on. I take this opportunity to assure the minority leader that I \nwas in the same briefing. I think all Members were somewhat shocked at \nsome of the things we heard. This is a Member who was not shocked \nbecause I have been charged as a subcommittee chairman since the \nbeginning of the year with looking at all the aspects of this. I read \ndaily the international press reports of how many new cases of avian \nflu, in what country, how many humans have contracted it from an animal \nsource, how many humans potentially have contracted it from another \nhuman. The reality is this is something that from a committee \nstandpoint we keep up with. We understand the sense of urgency. I plead \nwith my colleagues that the answer is not to throw money at the threat. \nIt is to have a comprehensive plan where research and the investment \nfor that research pays off in countermeasures to protect the American \npeople.\n  Senator Harkin described very well that what is H5N1 avian flu in \nmost of Southeast Asia today, by the time it travels, whether it is by \nhumans or potentially by wild birds, the mutations that may take place \nmight make irrelevant any vaccine that is produced today and antivirals \nthat exist today, used to treat it might have potentially less than a \nsatisfactory effect. Without a system that invests in research and \ndevelopment, how in the world do we expect new antiviral drugs and new \nvaccines to be produced?\n\n  To suggest that we put all our eggs into this limited approach--let's \nput this money up, and let's buy whatever is available on the \nmarketplace--is comforting if, in fact, we believe this is a threat for \ntomorrow or next week or next month. The reality is this pandemic may \noccur next year or 3 years or 5 years down the road, and if we want to \nprotect the American people, if we want to do our job, then you have to \nset up a comprehensive mechanism for that research, that development, \nand whatever product is needed to address the threat we may face.\n  Again, I commend those Members who have come to the floor and \nproposed the appropriations for this item. I disagree that this is the \nappropriate bill. I disagree that you should appropriate this much \nmoney or any money without a comprehensive plan as to how we produce \ncountermeasures that continue past this one appropriations.\n  I pledge to the minority leader and to Senator Harkin, but more \nimportantly to every Member of this body, to work with them \naggressively over the next 60 days to not only produce legislation out \nof the subcommittee, but to work with my chairman, Chairman Enzi, and \nto work with both leaders and all 100 Senators to make sure this \nlegislation is passed in this body and by the House of Representatives, \nand signed into law by this President. I believe that it is that \nurgent. But, there is also a requirement for us to do it right, in \nfact, that is the single most important factor that we should consider.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10688-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to continue the discussion we were \nhaving. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that the first \namendment on the Department of Defense appropriations bill is one \ndealing with avian flu. If that is the most important amendment the \nother side of the aisle has for the Department of Defense bill, we \nought to go ahead and vote on the appropriations bill as a whole right \nnow. That is not the appropriate place to put it.\n  To make it sound as though nobody is working on this issue and no \nmoney is available is a total disservice to the agencies that work on \nit and this body as a whole. We have been working on it. We have been \nworking on it partly through the Katrina episode, making sure vaccines \nand other items that were needed for whatever would be available down \nthere in a timely manner. Fortunately, we already had some laws in \neffect that allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take \nsome emergency action to put items in place and get things done. We \nwill be reviewing that to see if they worked as well as they could.\n  We have had a bioshield fund in place for a while. That bioshield \nfund has money in it to do what needs to be done on any kind of \nterrorism or pandemic that comes up. What we have lacked is the plan. \nActually, the plan falls under the jurisdiction of my committee, and we \nhave been working on it. I divided the committee up--and Senator Harkin \nis on the committee--to more closely follow the acronym of our office. \nWe are the HELP Committee, and we are in charge of health and education \nand labor and pensions.\n  Of course, we have been devoting a tremendous amount of time recently \nto getting a pensions bill ready so it can be debated on the floor on a \nmoment's notice. It is ready to go. There is a lot of agreement on both \nsides of the aisle, so we can get that out of here pretty\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nfast and protect hard-working Americans' pension funds. But we need to \ndo the Department of Defense appropriations bill first.\n  A more appropriate place to debate this issue would be on almost \nanything that comes up later. As the Senator from Iowa knows, if there \nis a lot of debate on a bill that comes up, it probably is not going \nanywhere at this time of the year and with the crises we face. So \nperhaps that is why he decided he would put it on this bill.\n  We are working on it. Again I assure everybody we are working on it \nin the subcommittee that deals with public health and bioterrorism, \nunder the jurisdiction of Senator Burr. He has been doing an \noutstanding job with that subcommittee. He hired some spectacular \npeople who have a depth of understanding that I don't think we have \nseen for a long time in regard to those particular issues. He has held \nhearings on those issues and gathered valuable information. He has gone \npretty far afield to make sure we are covering all of the things that \ncould happen.\n  He has a bill that is virtually ready to go. It will include the \ncapability and the plan for handling a pandemic, as well as any \nunexpected event. It greatly compresses the time for dealing with those \nissues from anything we have had before. It provides a coordination \nbasis that is necessary for unexpected events.\n  I congratulate him for his efforts and for how widely he has \nresearched it, and for the number of fellow Senators he has involved in \nit.\n  Yesterday, there was a briefing he helped set up so we would know \nmore about, particularly, avian flu. That kind of thoroughness should \nbe congratulated. We ought to be working with him to make sure we are \ngetting the bill done.\n  I have to say, whether the threat is made by man or one that occurs \nnaturally, we need to be prepared, and I agree with Senator Harkin on \nthat point.\n  Senator Harkin, Senator Burr, and I serve on the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. All of us also serve on the \nSubcommittee on Bioterrorism and Public Health Preparedness. As I said, \nSenator Burr is chairman of that subcommittee. He has held six hearings \nand roundtables on what we need to do to have a strong national \nbiodefense.\n  As chairman of the full committee, I am looking forward to working \nwith Senator Burr, Senator Harkin, and the rest of the committee \nmembers to pass a bill this fall that will develop our capabilities to \ndevelop defenses against avian flu and a host of other biological \nthreats we face--some known and some unknown--regardless of whether \nthey are manmade or naturally occurring.\n  Senator Burr has been working on that comprehensive bill to build on \nProject BioShield. His bill will address everything from liability \nprotection to biosurveillance, from the threat of terrorism to the \nthreat of a normal disease.\n  As committee chairman, I fully intend to report that legislation to \nthe floor this year to create a viable and innovative biodefense \nindustry. We do need to create incentives and eliminate barriers to \ndevelop this industry because we cannot count on the Government alone \nto supply us with the countermeasures, the antidotes, and the detection \ntools we have to have to ensure our safety against biological threats.\n\n  Most importantly, we already have billions of dollars available in \nProject BioShield to do what Senator Harkin wants to do. What we need \nto do is create an environment that will encourage business into this \nindustry before we discourage them out of the industry. We need to get \nthem back in. We need the innovativeness of small business and big \nbusiness, and we need to make it more attractive so the drug and \nbiotechnology companies will want to be engaged.\n  We have the money. What we need is a plan, and that plan is what we \nhave been working on diligently. I do ask Senator Harkin to work with \nme, to work with Senator Burr, to work with our majority leader, and to \nwork with Senator Kennedy, the ranking member on the HELP Committee, to \nmake that happen. We have the capability to do it. We should be able to \nput together a package that should take relatively short debate on the \nfloor, the House can match up to it, and we can do a conference and get \nit into effect. That would be better than having a full-blown debate on \nthe Department of Defense appropriations bill, holding that bill up \ninterminably when the money is needed, and creating difficulty in the \nconference committee, which will undoubtedly result in this measure \nbeing thrown out of the conference committee because it is not \napplicable to this bill and, therefore, that conference committee.\n  I appreciate the attention he has brought to the issue. It has \nbrought attention to the issue. We need to do it the right way, and \nthat is to include it in the development of a comprehensive bill that \nwill deal with public health and bioterrorism.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Burr and all those who have been \nworking with him on developing that bill. I don't think anybody could \nhave put it together in a shorter time period than he has. We are just \n9 months into this term, and he is already delivering. That is a \ntremendous statement on our part of his capability. Again, I cannot \nexpress how thorough it has been. Let's do it right. Let's do it \nthrough a stand-alone bill on which both sides of the aisle can join. \nLet's get this done, solved, and eliminate it as a problem under the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The issue of avian flu is one of the critically \nimportant issues of our time. Second only to the potential for the \nexistence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of suicidal \nterrorists, this issue has the potential to be catastrophic to the \nnational security interests of this country.\n  I cannot imagine a more timely issue or one more appropriate to be \nbrought up on this legislation than something that will protect the \nAmerican people who are currently dreadfully exposed to the possibility \nof a global pandemic. We need a new sense of urgency in addressing this \nissue.\n  People have died because of avian influenza: 115 people have \ncontracted it in Asia; 59 of those people have died. Leading experts \nsay it is only a matter of time before this deadly disease becomes more \nefficient in moving from person to person. We should not await that \ndreadful day, but act proactively to protect the national security \ninterests and the health interests of the people of the United States \nof America.\n  Previous influenza epidemics have been catastrophic, killing not \nhundreds of thousands, but millions of human beings. We cannot afford \nto wait for that kind of event to occur.\n  We are currently woefully unprepared. The estimates are that we have \nin our stockpiles only enough vaccine to cover about 1 percent of the \nAmerican people. There are about 2.3 million doses of Tamiflu and 2 \nmillion doses of experimental pandemic flu vaccine in our stockpile. \nAnd another antiviral may have been compromised by the Chinese use on \ntheir poultry population, thereby imperiling its efficacy. We are way \nbehind the curve in preparing for a potential outbreak or pandemic of \nthis severity and potential magnitude. Other developed nations are way \nahead of us in terms of compiling their stockpiles and preparing their \npublic health agencies for a rapid response to this grave health \nthreat.\n  The final point I wish to make is I think more than anything else, \nthe lesson of Hurricane Katrina has taught us this: When it is a matter \nof life and death for the American people, we better prepare for the \nworst, even as we hope for the best because then one of two things will \nhappen: If the worst occurs, you are prepared to protect the life, the \nsecurity, and the safety of those who place their confidence in us. \nThat is the very least they should expect from their Government. And if \nthe worst did not happen, then we will be pleasantly surprised.\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\n  When it comes to dealing with avian influenza, let us not have a \nrepeat of the mistakes of Hurricane Katrina. Let us be prepared so we \nmay protect our citizens or so we may be pleasantly surprised. That is \nwhat Government is all about. That is why I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the Harkin amendment.\n  I thank our leader Harry Reid and, once again, Senator Kennedy for a \nlifetime of leadership on these issues and for his courtesy to me \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I first pay tribute to my friend, \ncolleague, and the chairman of our HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, for \nhis comments and his statements. We have worked very closely together \nand will continue to do so on a variety of different health-related \nissues. We are working together on the challenges that we are facing \nfrom Hurricane Katrina, and we are also working on health and \neducation, as well as issues of pensions and higher education.\n  We come at this with somewhat different viewpoints. First, I commend \nSecretary Leavitt for an excellent briefing and presentation yesterday. \nAll of our colleagues have had the opportunity to read in our national \nnewspapers the dangers associated with avian influenza, including the \npotential threat that it presents and why it is different from the \nseasonal flu that concerns families all over this country, particularly \nto the elderly.\n  We have to be reminded that 36,000 people every year die from the \nflu, even when we work to make sure they have access to the appropriate \nflu vaccine. But that is the number that we lose, and that certainly is \na tragedy.\n  We heard an outstanding presentation by Secretary Leavitt, as well as \nan outstanding presentation by Dr. Julie Gerberding, who is the head of \nthe CDC and who has been enormously perceptive in terms of looking at \nthe avian flu that we are facing. We also heard from General Michael \nHayden, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and others. The one \nthing that came out of that meeting, that I think all of us were \nimpressed by, is the sense of immediacy. I think that is what Senator \nHarkin is reacting to and responding to, the real potential danger \nwhich would be devastating to potentially tens of millions of \nAmericans.\n  Perhaps we are being overly sensitive to this issue by adding this \namendment to the Defense appropriations bill because of the recent \ntragedy of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Obviously Katrina has been \nparticularly devastating, and Rita was certainly enormously harmful as \nwell.\n  There were several of us in that briefing who left saying if we are \ngoing to make a mistake, it will be on the side of taking too much \naction.\n  The Secretary outlined a very vigorous program that he himself is \ninvolved in, working with the other agencies of Government and working \nwith other members of the Cabinet. Avian flu is going to involve just \nabout every kind of public policy issue, including transportation, \nhealth, commerce, and so many others. He gave us the assurance that he \nis going to have his own plan that will be released in the next few \nweeks.\n  As Senator Harkin and others have pointed out, this particular \nlegislation outlines the areas where funding should be directed, and \nalso gives great flexibility to the administration in terms of its \nexpenditures. Senator Harkin says that the funds will be available \nuntil spent. By passing this amendment today, we will not get caught at \na time when either the Senate or the House is not in session. We now \nhave an opportunity to make the necessary resources available, as well \nas direct the ways that it ought to be expended.\n  During the presentation, the Secretary pointed out that their goal \nwas to buy enough antiviral treatment to cover 80 million people, which \nis about one-quarter of the Nation's population. That was going to be \nat the cost of $20 a course of treatment. It was brought up by our \ncolleagues that if this pandemic strikes the United States, there is \nnot going to be a family that is not going to want to make sure that \nthey have protections for their children and for themselves, for their \nspouses, for their parents, and for their grandparents.\n  Every family is going to want to make sure they are able to afford \nand obtain that antiviral treatment. If one is affected by avian \ninfluenza and the antiviral treatment is taken immediately, the risk of \ndeath is diminished in a dramatic way. I think it is going to be very \ndifficult to accept that this Nation will be satisfied with just one \nout of four Americans having access to this treatment. Even more so, \nwhen we already know the potential dangers of a pandemic by what we \nhave seen in the places affected and impacted by avian flu.\n  This legislation will only cover 50 percent of the population. It \ndoes not cover three out of four Americans. And, it does not cover the \nwhole population. It costs $1.6 billion just to cover a quarter. We \ndoubled that roughly to $3.2 billion, which puts us into the range \nsuggested by experts.\n  The point that was made very carefully by the Secretary is that we \nare going to have to deal with surge capacity, and that our hospitals \ndo not have this capability at the present time. That is going to be \nvery important.\n  Previously, we have provided help and assistance to local communities \nand to State agencies to help them meet their surge capacity needs. \nBeyond that, it is going to be enormously important that we invest \nfunds, as this legislation does, in surveillance--not only detection in \nthis country but detection in foreign countries. That is the best way \nthat we are going to be able to deal with this avian flu, to get the \nearliest possible detection.\n  As a result of that briefing yesterday, I do not think any of us \nwould feel that we have a full alert system working around the world. \nWe had reports from various countries. A number of the countries, large \ncountries as well as small, have effectively buried this health \nchallenge and denied that they ever had it. We have to be very \nproactive if we are going to protect Americans. We have to be able to \ndevelop a system internationally where we can identify early warning \nsigns of a pandemic. That kind of surveillance, is included in this \nlegislation.\n  We have to make sure we have the capability in our States to be able \nto detect this when it first affects a community. We have to set up a \nsystem for our health clinics and for our hospitals to make sure that \nthe first indications of this kind of health challenge are going to be \naddressed. We need the detection and then we need the containment. To \ncontain flu, we need to build our public health infrastructure in the \nlocal community. We are very far away from that kind of capability.\n\n  A year ago, I think the Department submitted a public report about \nhow many States actually had moved ahead in terms of developing their \nplans. About half of the states have yet to develop pandemic \npreparedness plans, and those with plans have yet to be evaluated for \nquality and feasibility.\n  When I entered the Chamber, I was listening to my friend, Senator \nEnzi, talk about the BioShield Program which we put in place in \npreparation for the kind of challenge that we might face from \nbioterrorists. It focused on different bioterrorism agents that might \npose a direct health threat, and allows the Secretary to put in place a \nsystem to respond quickly and effectively to those kinds of challenges.\n  Our colleague, Senator Burr from North Carolina, has held an \nextraordinary number of hearings in these areas. I know he has been \npreparing legislation to deal with a number of these items that I am \nmentioning today. He has done a magnificent job in the development of \nthose hearings. But that still does not mean that with the kind of \nchallenge avian flu presents, which can be so devastating, that we \nshould not be alert and ready to go.\n  We can point out that our whole system of vaccines is woefully \nlagging in the United States for a variety of different reasons. Today, \nwe do not have the direct capability and capacity to develop the kind \nof avian flu countermeasures we need, including vaccines or producing \nenough antiviral medication. The best estimate is even if we were to \ngive all the contracts out today, it would be well into the year 2007 \nbefore we were able to provide important coverage for all Americans. So \nwe are talking years into the future before we can even provide \nTamiflu, something that we know can make a difference.\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\n  It does seem to me that we do not have a day to waste. This is \nsomething that is very dangerous.\n  Finally, one could ask, Is it appropriate to be on a Defense \nappropriations bill? Well, if we were talking about something like \nnuclear weapons, I would say, yes, because we are concerned about the \ndangers of nuclear proliferation. I, quite frankly, believe avian flu \npresents a much greater threat, because it is imminent, highly lethal, \nand we have few countermeasures.\n  I do not see a great difference myself--certainly it will not be much \nof a difference to the families who are affected, whether it is \nterrorism or the fact that this kind of influenza has spread to this \ncountry and their family is infected with a deadly virus. That is why I \nbelieve that action is necessary.\n  Very quickly, we have seen reductions in two very important agencies. \nOne is HRSA, which provides grants to help hospitals in the area of \npreparedness so that they can develop a response plan, get clearance \nwith the State and HHS. Hospitals have begun working on plans, but they \nare woefully far behind, and this program was cut again this year.\n  Then we have the Centers for Disease Control that will be certainly a \nlead agency--I would hope that it would be a lead agency--and we know \nthat their public health expenditures have been reduced. I think this \nis tragic myself. It is a jewel of an organization in terms of American \npublic health, and it has done extraordinarily well. It is extremely \nwell led at the present time, and it does not seem appropriate to me \nthat we ought to be reducing the CDC budget, when the agency has such \ngreat responsibility in this area at this time.\n  Yesterday, when I asked Secretary Leavitt whether we could actually \nuse the BioShield money--I think we have close to $6 billion in that--\nhe said that it was set up and structured so that the funds are not \napplicable to this particular kind of challenge.\n  I think the amounts we are talking about are appropriate, given the \nessential nature of the potential disaster. The new flu strain poses a \ndeadly threat. One of the important points made by Secretary Leavitt \nyesterday is that even this very deadly strain they are most concerned \nabout can mutate further. It is always somewhat difficult to develop \nthe vaccines and antivirals because these strains can alter and change, \nmaking the vaccines no longer effective. But having said that, they \nbelieve the treatments they have developed can have an important impact \non saving the lives of those infected with avian flu. In the areas \nalready affected with avian flu, we see a death rate of 44 percent in \nVietnam, 71 percent in Thailand, almost 100 percent in Cambodia--and an \naverage of 50 percent for all of Asia.\n  The great challenge, as we heard yesterday, occurs when it moves from \nthe birds into human beings. That is a big leap. I will come back and \nmake a longer talk about how that comes about and how rare that process \nis, but that has happened.\n  Then, the next leap is whether it is easily spread from person to \nperson. For example, if one member of the family--if a child has it, is \nit easily communicable to the child's siblings? There is only one \nrecorded instance, as we were told yesterday, where that has taken \nplace. But it has taken place. That is a very important warning sign \nbecause it suggests that this influenza has the potential to become a \npandemic and be absolutely devastating.\n  We were reminded yesterday, during the briefing, there are usually \nthree pandemics every 100 years. They talked about what happened in the \nimmediate postwar period of 1918, when soldiers had been at the front \nand they contracted dangerous influenza. In the US, over 500,000 people \ndied from that pandemic flu, and another 50 million worldwide died.\n  We do not want to be unduly alarmist, but we have to be serious about \nit. This meeting we had was in S-407. It was going to be top secret, \nevidently. I said to the Secretary, now that we have heard all this \nnews, it seems to me the public ought to know about it, they ought to \nunderstand it, and it ought to be explained by the top health officials \nin the country so we get accurate information. We have a number of \nthose--Secretary Leavitt, Dr. Tony Fauci, Dr. Julie Gerberding--who are \nenormously competent, thoughtful scientists, researchers, who have a \nlifetime of commitment trying to understand these dangers. The more \nAmericans listen to them and read the information on this and the \nauthentic science, the better off they are going to be.\n  But I believe this Harkin amendment is saying we have been put on \nnotice. If there is an avian flu outbreak, they will say, Didn't you go \nto the briefing upstairs in 407 where they laid this out to you? You \nare on the HELP committee. You know the dangers. You worked with \nSenator Frist when we passed BioShield. Senator Burr, when he was in \nthe House, was a principal sponsor--even before 9/11. The elements of \npreparedness, detection, and containment that are in this amendment \nwere included in BioShield as well. These are thoughtful ideas. There \nis strong support for them in the HELP Committee. Today, we have an \nopportunity to take action on the floor. The administration is going to \nbe responsible for that when this amendment is passed.\n  I join with my colleague and friend, Senator Enzi, and with Senator \nBurr, our other colleague who has provided great leadership in the \ncommittee, to get legislation on preparedness out as early as possible.\n  My chairman, Senator Enzi, likes to do it the old-fashioned way. He \nlikes to listen to witnesses make the presentations, mark up the bill \nand get it to the floor, and he does it with extraordinary success. I \nwould say, on this particular occasion, we ought to get the resources \nout there now.\n  Senator Harkin has outlined the general areas which I think are \njustifiable, where the resources should be spent. I would also like to \nsee the Secretary bring together all the major drug companies, which I \nthink he intends to do, and go over this and get a plan from them about \nhow we can maximize the safety and security for all Americans. This is \nwhat this amendment is all about.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for his comments and statements \nabout avian flu. I look forward to working with him on this issue. Our \nonly real difference is whether we move ahead now, trying to at least \nprovide those essential resources for the Secretary, the President, and \nthe administration, to act now and prepare us for the threat of avian \nflu or wait until it's too late.\n  We can work with our colleagues within our committee to try to \ndevelop additional legislation to further improve our preparedness and \ndevelop effective treatments for avian flu. That is certainly a \nresponsibility that we have. I welcome the opportunity to do that with \nmy friend from Wyoming and also the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reflect for a moment on what America went \nthrough with Hurricane Katrina, reflect on what it has meant to our \ncountry and what it has meant to our Government. That was the greatest \nnatural disaster of modern time. Americans were shaken to the core \nwatching television night after night to see victims of Hurricane \nKatrina and what they were living through. Many of those scenes we \nwitnessed did not look like America. It just doesn't seem like our \ngreat Nation where people would be in such a helpless and almost \nhopeless state--to find people struggling just to survive the \nfloodwaters and the hurricane damage, to see Americans begging for \nwater and food, to see what appeared to be refugees--in fact, \nevacuees--trying to bring their children across interstate bridges to \ndry land, to see people thrown in many different directions, families \ndivided and still not united. To see all of that occur day in and day \nout 24-7 was a startling scene. It was an indication to all of us that \nwe needed to take a step back and\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\ntake a look at America from a different angle.\n  Perhaps too many of us had been lulled into the belief that this sort \nof thing could never happen, that leaders in America would never let us \nreach this terrible point, whether it is a natural disaster or a \nterrorist disaster, that someone somewhere in Washington or in a State \ncapital or in a city hall had not made preparations and plans to deal \nwith it. It is that concern that has led so many people to call for an \nhonest appraisal of what happened with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita and what we need to do in America to be better and stronger and \nbetter prepared.\n  I don't think the people of this country expect the Senate or their \nGovernment to look at the world through the rearview mirror. We can't \nspend our time looking back and reliving every moment and pointing a \nfinger of blame here and there or some place for some satisfaction, \npersonal or political. But it is critically important that we review \nthat scenario, that we don't repeat the same mistake, so that the next \ntime, we are better prepared. That is what we need.\n  That is why we need an independent, nonpartisan commission--people \nwithout allegiance to the President or to the Democratic Party or to \nthe Republican Party but people who are truly Americans first who will \ncome together in a commission and ask those questions so that we can be \nbetter prepared for our future. Unfortunately, there has been \nresistance to this idea, but that is nothing new.\n  After 9/11, many of us called for the creation of a commission to \nfind out why our intelligence sources failed so miserably and what we \ncould have done to avoid that terrible disaster of 9/11. At that time, \nthe White House opposed the creation of the 9/11 Commission, and many \nmembers of the President's party also said it is premature, we don't \nneed it. But good sense prevailed. More than that, the 9/11 survivors' \nfamilies prevailed--those widows and widowers, those children and \nspouses who came forward and demanded the creation of this independent \nCommission. They were the political force. They were an irresistible \nforce. They created this Commission with two extremely talented \nindividuals: Governor Kean of New Jersey, a Republican, and Congressman \nLee Hamilton of Indiana, a Democrat. They came together with others of \nlike mind and did a great national service.\n  The 9/11 Commission not only analyzed what went wrong, which you \nalmost have to start with, but then they said: Here is how we could do \nbetter. They produced a proposal for reforming the intelligence \nagencies of America--there are many of them--so that they would be \nbetter coordinated, share information, and be there to protect America. \nThe first line of defense against any terrorism is not our military. \nThe first line of defense is intelligence. We need to see the danger \ncoming before it strikes and stop it. That is what good intelligence \ncan bring you.\n  With their suggestions, on a bipartisan basis with the support the 9/\n11 families, we moved forward. Credit should go where it is due. In the \nSenate, Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Senator Joe Lieberman, \nDemocrat of Connecticut, took the proposals of the 9/11 Commission, \nworking with the Members of the House of Representatives, and crafted a \npiece of legislation which I was honored to be part of, and we worked \nliterally for months to get that done. We gave up a valuable commodity \naround here: we gave up our time with our families. We came back during \nthe August recess and held hearings. We pushed the bill, and it was \nsigned by the President.\n  Good things happened. Why? Because we had the right leaders in place. \nThese Commission leaders were in place. They pointed to weaknesses, and \nthey told us how we could overcome. They called for reform. They stayed \nwith the agenda until it was accomplished. It was a model for all of us \nand one we should look to when it comes to Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita. That is why I believe an independent, nonpartisan \ncommission is so necessary.\n  The House of Representatives had a hearing earlier this week. They \nbrought in Michael Brown. He pointed a finger of blame in every \ndirection, including his own administration. When it was all said and \ndone, people said: Well, at least he was brought before this committee \nand the members that did appear and was held accountable. That is a \ngood thing. It is an important thing. But it isn't going to bring us to \nthe point we ought to be in this country. We want to find out what went \nwrong. Why didn't we think ahead if we had been warned so many times \nabout the dangers in New Orleans? Why didn't we plan ahead when it came \nto positioning forces, positioning food and supplies? Why didn't we \nhave a communications network that could survive a natural disaster? \nWhy didn't we have better cooperation at all levels of government? \nWhere do we need to change the law so that at some given moment, it is \nclear who is in charge? What could we have done to save those lives we \nlost in those disasters? What should we do now to reunite these \nfamilies and put their lives back in order? These are all valid points.\n  The reason I have reflected on these circumstances, 9/11 and the \nhurricanes, is because the amendment that is pending right now on this \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill gives this Senate an \nopportunity to step forward right now at an early moment to avert the \nnext tragedy. Let me tell you what I mean. We need a wake-up call in \nAmerica. Most public health officials here and around the world agree \nthat an outbreak of a new pandemic is virtually inevitable. I use the \nwords ``virtually inevitable'' with some care. Those are the words of \nDr. Gerberding, who is the head of the Centers for Disease Control.\n  You have to be a student of history to remember the great flu \npandemic of 1918 that claimed so many innocent lives in America. What \nDr. Gerberding and other health officials are telling us is that unless \nwe aggressively monitor and immediately contain this avian flu, it is \nlikely to be a global pandemic.\n  The difference, of course, is the world of 2005 is so much different \nfrom the world of 1918. In the world of 2005, an infected person is 12 \nhours away from your doorstep. That is about as long as it takes to fly \nfrom one part of the world to another.\n  We have to prepare and we have to start now, no excuses. That is why \nthe Harkin amendment, which I am happy to cosponsor, is so important. \nPeople say: Why would you bring up an amendment about a national \npandemic of avian flu on a Department of Defense appropriations? Don't \nyou have health appropriations or other things? It is true. And Senator \nHarkin and I happen to be on the subcommittee that would more naturally \nbe the place to bring up this amendment. However, he is doing it \nbecause we have relatively few opportunities in this Senate to act. We \nbelieve, in supporting this amendment, we need to act, and to act now.\n\n  I am told what makes the avian flu so dangerous is that humans have \nno natural immunity to this strain of flu. We remember the flu shots \nand all the warnings we have received over the years. For the most \npart, those flu shots are increasing our already natural resistance to \nflu. When it comes to the new strain of avian flu, we have no \nresistance. We have no immunity. It is not a question of children and \nsick people and the elderly being vulnerable, we are all vulnerable. \nThat is what happened in 1918. The healthiest looking people on the \nstreet could be dead in 24 hours. That was the nature of that flu and \ncould be the nature of this flu challenge.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has suggested that an avian flu \noutbreak in the United States could claim the lives of 200,000 people--\na conservative estimate. Compare that to 36,000 lives lost each flu \nseason to typical, normal flu. It is not just that the CDC that is \nanticipating a flu pandemic. Yesterday, Senator Frist asked the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Mr. Leavitt, to ensure that \nthere are U.S. antiviral drugs in the national stockpile to provide \ntreatment for 50 percent of the American population in the event of an \noutbreak. I fully support Senator Frist's recommendation. As most \neveryone knows, he is a medical doctor, in addition to being the \nmajority leader of the Senate.\n  I am pleased to join in offering this amendment which provides the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services with the money it needs to \npurchase those drugs. That recommendation alone will require about $3 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\n  What is the antiviral drug? The one most commonly referred to is \ncalled Tamiflu. If a person has flu-like symptoms and calls the doctor \nas soon as they feel them coming on, that doctor might prescribe \nTamiflu, which if taken quickly, could lessen the severity of the \ninfluenza. The notion is, we should be prepared as a nation with this \nantiviral Tamiflu in the stockpile, or something like it, so that if we \ndo see this flu coming toward America, we are prepared to provide some \ntreatment for people as they start to exhibit symptoms.\n  This amendment that Senator Harkin has offered, with my support and \nothers, provides funding to the Department of Health and Human Services \nso it can enter into a contract to buy those drugs now. Until the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has that money on hand, all of \nour conversations are just theoretical.\n  Remember last year when we talked about running out of flu vaccine, \nand the flu had already hit? It was a little late. That is what we are \ntrying to avoid. Step in early for the virtually inevitable pandemic \nand have a stockpile of medicine available for America. Be prepared. \nThat is what this amendment has as its watchword.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services cannot add antiviral \ndrugs to the stockpile until it has the money to purchase them. This \namendment provides the money to the Department of Health and Human \nServices so they can purchase drugs to treat up to 50 percent of the \nU.S. population.\n  I asked yesterday in one of the briefings, why did you pick a number \nlike 40 or 50 percent? The public health experts, such as Dr. Fauci and \nothers, say that is the percentage of the population we think may be \nexposed. Let's not revisit the scenario of last year's flu season when \nthere was not enough medicine and we had to make decisions about \nrationing the medicine. There came a time when we said there is not \nenough flu vaccine. I said, well, I feel pretty healthy, I will get to \nthe end of the line. And when it was all over we ended up with more \nthan we needed. It was not good management of flu vaccine in our \ncountry.\n  Baruch Fischoff of Carnegie Mellon University, an expert on the \npublic perception of risk, says telling people they cannot get flu \ntreatment ``isn't the American way.'' ``That is rationed health care. \nWe just do not accept that.''\n  We have to prepare for developing something else which is going to \ntake a lot of energy, a lot of resource and ingenuity. We have to \nprepare and develop a vaccine to deal with this flu that prevents the \ninfection from ever setting in. Right now, that vaccine does not exist. \nEven if it did, we do not have the manufacturing capacity in the United \nStates to produce vaccines at the rate we need them.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment, now pending, doubles our commitment to \nresearch and development, the manufacture of, even the purchase of an \neffective avian flu vaccine.\n  Remember last year when one of two flu vaccine manufacturers for a \ntypical flu season had to close its European facility? The United \nStates could not turn to any domestic supplier to make up for the loss \nof those doses of vaccine because we did not have that capacity.\n  We talk a lot about the U.S. dependence on foreign suppliers for oil. \nWe shouldn't have to depend on other countries for the medicines we \nneed during a global health crisis.\n  Another lesson from last year's flu vaccine shortage, we have to have \na plan. In the face of the vaccine shortage, prices for a dose of flu \nvaccine in Kansas at one point went as high as $600. In Colorado, 600 \ndoses of flu vaccine were stolen from a doctor's office.\n  Despite these images of chaos, State and local health officials \nworked long and hard to maintain calm and also figure out how many \ndoses there were, where they were, and how to get them to the people \nwho needed them the most.\n  If we intend to rely on good work, long hours, and a public health \nworkforce that does not get sick, we may be in trouble. This amendment \nrestores cuts to State and local public health agencies so they will \nhave the money to be prepared. It includes enough money for communities \nto figure out where we will take care of people who are sick when the \nhospitals and clinics reach capacity, which could happen.\n\n  Again, the people who turned New Orleans airport into a hospital \nshowed bravery and grace under pressure. But we can do better than \nairport lounges and convention centers as makeshift clinics in \nAmerica--only if we think ahead; only if we are prepared. Let's give \nour State and local agencies the resources and timeline to prepare for \na pandemic flu outbreak.\n  This time, we are virtually certain it is going to hit. This time, no \nexcuses. We should be prepared. We need to begin now to prepare, and do \nit aggressively. The best possible outcome would be an early detection \nof the outbreak, quick containment and treatment, and then development \nof a vaccine to prevent its spread. This amendment doubles the \ninvestment of the Centers for Disease Control in global disease \ndetection in an effort to find, stop, and prevent the spread of the \navian flu as soon as it mutates into a strain that can move \nefficiently, in the words of the medical community, ``from person to \nperson.''\n  I heard one of the public health leaders the other day say it might \nnot be this winter, it might be next winter, but it is going to happen. \nIf we know that, and we do not act to prepare for what President Bush \nsays could become the first pandemic of the 21st century, we are \nfailing in leadership. We will have failed as much as any official who \ndid not respond to the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina.\n  The funding we propose to add to this bill to prepare for a virtually \ninevitable, probably global public health crisis is less than we spend \non the war in Iraq in 1 month. That is what it will take to get America \nready so this avian flu does not claim so many lives.\n  This investment will, in fact, save lives. Hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican lives could be spared, by the most conservative estimates. It \ncould be as many as 1.7 million American lives that are at risk in this \npandemic, according to an adviser to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Understand, this amendment does not create any new programs \nor start any new initiatives. It simply accelerates the work of the CDC \nin preparing for the outbreak of this deadly flu. The preparation will \ntake time. There is not much we can do about that. Avian flu could \nbegin to spread at any time.\n  Currently, they have reported 115 cases of avian flu around the \nworld. Where humans were affected by it, over half of them have died. \nThere isn't anything we can do about the current situation, but there \nis something we can do about the threat to America. What we can do is \nstep up to this challenge, purchase the antiviral drugs we need now, \ninvest in domestic capabilities for vaccine protection for America, and \nprepare for emergency care during a flu pandemic.\n  We talk a lot about national security in the Department of Defense \nbill, but a strong America begins at home. We found that out. We found \nit out on the gulf coast. We were not prepared. We did not do our job. \nNo one stood up soon enough and early enough and said it is time to \nhold people accountable. It is time to think ahead, think beyond the \nmoment, think to what we need.\n  What if I am wrong? What if this flu pandemic does not occur? What if \nthis money is invested in things that, frankly, do not become \nnecessary? That could happen. And I pray that it does. If we could \nspare Americans and people around the world the suffering that could be \nassociated with that pandemic, I wish that happily. I would be glad to \nstand and say, well, perhaps we did too much too soon. But I would much \nrather stand here and apologize for doing too much too soon than to \nstand here and make excuses for not doing enough when we had to.\n  The Harkin amendment is an important amendment for the strength of \nAmerica, for the health of America, and for the protection of America. \nI look forward to supporting it. It would be wonderful if we had a \nstrong bipartisan rollcall to say that we will start with this national \nchallenge, coming together in a bipartisan fashion, both the \nadministration and Congress dedicated to making certain that we learned \na lesson from Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10694-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10694-S10696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10694]]\n                                ETHANOL\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am here for my daily speech \non oil independence for this country. Before the assistant minority \nleader leaves the floor, as he has been such a leader in this area, and \nbefore this Senator launches into this series of conversations for the \nSenate about the need to have oil independence and the ways that we can \nbe going about it, bringing to the Senate each day a new kind of \ntechnology we should be looking at--today I am going to talk about the \nexpansion of ethanol--I invite the Senior Senator from Illinois, since \nhe has been such a leader in this area, for any comments that the \nSenator would like to make in a colloquy before I continue with the \nseries of speeches on oil independence.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. He has \nidentified an issue which every American family understands every time \nthey go to the gasoline station.\n  The cost of filling up the tank nowadays is stunning. Even the \nautomobile manufacturers are starting to advertise cars with good gas \nmileage. We haven't seen that in a long time, have we? It reminds all \nAmericans how dependent we are on foreign fuel and foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  The Senator from Florida, a leader on this issue, remembers we \nbrought an amendment to the floor on the Energy bill saying we believe \nAmerica should set as a national goal reducing our dependence on \nforeign oil by 40 percent over the next 20 years. Sadly, it was \ndefeated on a partisan rollcall.\n  I cannot believe this is a partisan issue. Our dependence on foreign \nenergy puts us at the mercy of the Saudis and others who really do not \nlose a lot of sleep if our economy is not doing well and if our \nfamilies suffer.\n  I am glad the Senator stepped forward. He identifies ethanol. It is \nnear and dear to my heart because my State produces more than any other \nState. And it is homegrown. We do not need to have a Saudi prince \nsmiling at us to find a gallon of ethanol. All we need is for God to \nbless us with a little sunshine on that corn crop, and we know just \nwhat to do with it.\n  I am glad the Senator is raising this issue. It goes back to a point \nI made in my earlier statement about public health: a stronger America \nbegins at home. What the Senator from Florida is reminding us is \nwhether it is public health or energy, it is time to focus the \ningenuity, creativity, and innovation of this country into making \nAmerica stronger at home. I am glad the Senator is leading us in that \ndiscussion today.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like the Senator from Illinois to \nrespond to the fact that Hurricane Katrina and now Hurricane Rita has \ngiven us another lesson of just how thin and delicate this oil supply \nand refinery pipeline is, so that the least little disruption in it--a \nhurricane or the shutting down of a refinery, in this case, five or six \nrefineries that are shut down, or, Lord forbid, a terrorist act, the \nsinking by a terrorist of a supertanker in the Strait of Hormuz in the \nPersian Gulf--any one of these things could absolutely disrupt the \nworld that is so thirsty for oil consumption, and could send our \ngasoline prices not shooting through $3, but could be sending it \nthrough $4 and $5 and $6 a gallon.\n\n  Would the Senator comment on that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to comment, through the Chair, and say to \nthe Senator from Florida that because of the hurricanes we have lost 22 \npercent of our refining capacity in America. So if you wonder why the \nprice of gasoline is high, higher than it has been historically, that \nis one of the reasons. I might add, parenthetically, when it comes to \nthe price of gasoline and oil companies, almost any excuse will do to \nraise the price of gasoline. But in this case, we know that the \nreduction of 22 percent of our refining capacity means there is less \ngasoline on hand and, therefore, prices are being pushed upwards.\n  Today at a press conference, I announced a bill that I am going to \nintroduce which will create a national gasoline reserve and jet fuel \nreserve. Presently, we have 700 million barrels of crude oil which are \nbeing held as our National Petroleum Reserve. The President started \nreleasing that. But releasing crude oil does not meet the need for \nrefining capacity. So the crude oil coming into this narrow funnel of \nreduced refining capacity does not solve the need.\n  What I believe we should do is give to any President a tool to \nrespond to shortages in gasoline in various regions that cause price \nspikes; the same thing with jet fuel. Three new airlines are in \nbankruptcy mainly because of the increase in the price of jet fuel. So \nwe think we should be setting aside these resources, again, keeping \nAmerica strong at home, so we are not watching our economy flounder and \nour families suffer because of these skyrocketing gasoline prices.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like the Senator from \nIllinois to comment on the fact that in America most of the oil \nconsumption is in the transportation sector. In the transportation \nsector, most of the oil is consumed in our personal vehicles. So we \ncould start reducing the consumption of oil in our own vehicles a \nlittle, have increased miles per gallon, substitute ethanol for \ngasoline, have hybrid engines, hybrid engines you plug in to give a \nfull charge at night while it is in the garage. We could have ethanol \nnot made just from corn, which is homegrown, but made from sugarcane, \nsugar beats, cellulose. It could be grass. We happen to have 31 million \nacres of prairie grass in this country. Cut the grass. Make cheaper \nethanol. Therefore, for every gallon of ethanol that goes into that gas \ntank--and you can use existing engines in our personal vehicles--you \nare making a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, and that means we are \nburning that much less gasoline, which means we are burning that much \nless oil that we have to import from foreign shores.\n  I would like the Senator from Illinois, who has been a leader in this \narea, to comment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Responding to the Senator from Florida, through the \nChair, the nation of Brazil decided, years ago, they were tired of \ntheir vulnerability to foreign energy sources and they said: We are \ngoing to make a national mission of energy independence. By moving \ntoward homegrown fuels and conservation, they have reduced their \ndependence on foreign oil to less than 15 percent, while the United \nStates depends on foreign oil, consuming over 60 percent at the current \ntime. And most of it, as the Senator said, goes into the cars and \ntrucks we drive.\n  The Senator raises an issue that is near and dear to my heart about \nthe fuel efficiency of cars and trucks. A little walk down memory lane: \nIn 1975, when the price of a barrel of oil went up from $3 to $5, to \n$12, America went into a panic and Congress said: We have to do \nsomething about it. The average fuel efficiency of cars and trucks in \nAmerica was about 18 miles a gallon. So we put in a Federal Government \nmandate that the auto manufacturing companies had to have an average \nfleet fuel efficiency of 28 miles a gallon, which they had to reach \nover the next 10 years. They had to move from 18 miles a gallon to 28 \nmiles a gallon over the next 10 years. They screamed bloody murder. \nThey said: It is technologically impossible. The cars and trucks we \nbuild will not be safe. And you are forcing America to buy foreign \nvehicles.\n  We ignored them. We said: Do it. We believe you can. If we have to \norder you to do it, we are going to order you. We ordered them to do \nit, and in a matter of 10 years they reached the goal of an average \nfleet fuel efficiency of 28 miles per gallon. The year was 1985.\n  It has been 20 years since then, and we have done nothing except \nwatch the truck exemption--which we converted into SUVs--create this \nnew breed of heavy, fuel-inefficient vehicle such as this god-awful \nHummer. If you want to drive a Hummer, for goodness sakes, join the \nArmy.\n  In this situation, these fuel-inefficient vehicles have dominated our \nmarket, and our average fuel efficiency in America has gone from 28 \nmiles a gallon in 1985 to less than 22 miles a gallon today. We are \nimporting more and more oil to drive the miles we need.\n  So I offered an amendment on the floor--and the Senator from Florida, \nI am sure, remembers it--and said: Is it too much to ask the auto \nmanufacturers to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks in \nAmerica by 1 mile a gallon each year for the next 10 years so we can \nget to 32 miles a gallon?\n  The Senator knows what happened. We had resistance not only from the\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\nautomobile companies but their workers. Do you know what they said? \nThey said: It is technologically impossible. The cars and trucks you \nwant us to build will not be safe. And you are going to force foreign \nmanufacturers on American consumers. They will not have any place to \ngo. It is the same story we heard 30 years ago. The amendment was \ndefeated.\n  But today I think if we called it up for reconsideration there would \nbe a few more votes. People are understanding you cannot control your \nfate and you cannot control your pocketbook if you are spending $100 \nevery time you drive into the service station to fill the tank of that \nSUV. So I think folks are more sensitive to it.\n  I have written to the big three manufacturers, to their CEOs, and \nsaid: Listen, it is time to sit down and get serious. The American \nconsumers want a more fuel-efficient vehicle. You know you can do it. \nHow can we work together to achieve it?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, just exactly what the Senator \nfrom Illinois says, there is a waiting list a mile long to get the \nhybrid vehicles that, in the case of Toyota, get 50 miles to a gallon \nin city driving. Yet what do we have to do to get the rest of the \nautomobile manufacturers?\n  Maybe it is going to take Hurricane Katrina, with a scare of a \nshortage, with the shutting down of refineries, that is going to \nfinally get our collective heads out of the sand and face the fact we \nare so dependent on oil--and foreign oil--and that this is not a good \nposition for this country to be in.\n  Does the Senator from Illinois remember when we offered a simple \nlittle amendment, and it was only to increase miles per gallon on SUVs, \nphased in over a multiyear period, and we could not get anymore than \nabout 39 votes out of 100 Senators in this Chamber? Yet we are facing \nthe crisis we are today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say, in response to the Senator from Florida, \nthrough the Chair, I think America understands what this means. Our \nvulnerability, our dependence on foreign oil, means we are drawn into \nwars and foreign policy decisions which we may not want to make. It \nalso means our economy is burdened by inefficiency and vehicles that \nare really burning too much gasoline. It also means that for every \nextra gallon we burn, there is more pollution in the air. So it is from \nthree different perspectives.\n  Our lack of fuel efficiency in our vehicles is burdening America with \nresponsibilities and decisions which American consumers would agree and \nAmerican families would agree we should not have to make as a nation.\n  Now, I know I voted for the Energy bill--I do not know how the \nSenator from Florida did--because it contained provisions about ethanol \nand biodiesel. But if you look beyond those provisions, you will find \nin that bill many subsidies for oil companies. What an irony that we \nprovide subsidies to oil companies at a time when they are experiencing \nthe highest profits, windfall profits, they have ever seen--billions of \ndollars. And do you know why? Because the price of gasoline is much \nhigher than is warranted by the price of crude oil. So that Energy bill \nwe had the President sign last August really does not step up to the \nplate and address the reality of the energy challenge of America.\n  I believe Americans want us to move toward energy independence, to \nmove toward using fuels that are efficient and do not pollute. And I \nbelieve they want us, as a nation, to create incentives for renewable, \nsustainable energy sources, for innovation in energy technology that \nwill create new companies, new jobs, new opportunities in this country.\n  We cannot be looking backward. We have to look forward in terms of \nwhat our children need for energy in the 21st century.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this Senator would say that it \nis only going to get worse if we do not do something now. This Senator \nthinks we are approaching a crisis because China is now on the scene, \nand China is becoming a huge consumer of oil. They are second only to \nthe United States in the consumption of oil. They have had 40-percent \ngrowth in their demand on the world's oil supply. China's purchases of \nnew passenger cars has risen by 75 percent.\n  In a tight world oil market, with new demands put on the supply by \nemerging nations such as China, it is only going to get worse. And here \nwe are, the United States of America, importing 58 to 60 percent of our \ndaily consumption of oil from foreign shores. It is an accident waiting \nto happen.\n  What does it take to collectively shake the American people to the \npoint that the body politic will demand of their elected \nrepresentatives that we start making changes--synthetic fuels, \nalternative fuels, higher miles per gallon, alternatives such as \nethanol, hybrid vehicles, encouraging them, satisfying the demand? The \nwaiting list is a long list. What is it going to take?\n  Will the Senator give me any kind of reflection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to respond to the Senator from Florida \nthrough the Chair and say that Hurricane Katrina, those catastrophic \nwinds that blew down the coast of Mississippi and Alabama caused a \ngreat deal of suffering. People still suffer today from the \nconsequences.\n  Maybe, in that terrible natural disaster and tragedy, something good \nwill come of it. If those winds blow down the doors of indifference \nwhen it comes to some basic issues in America, then we can build, as a \ncountry, from that sad experience--whether it is caring for the most \nvulnerable in America, who were the ones who suffered; whether it is \nstanding together as a nation, saying we are part of an American \nfamily, and if that tragedy hits your State of Florida or my State of \nIllinois, we will stand together to make sure your State gets back up \non its feet; or whether it is looking at our dependence on foreign \nenergy and saying: We have to change. This struck a part of America \nfrom which energy comes and is refined. We have to change in terms of \nour policy.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Florida, maybe that great \ndisaster, that terrible suffering that came from it, will also bring \nwith it a new awakening in this country about a new direction we need, \na direction that moves our Nation together, unified as a community, to \nsolve the serious challenge we face today.\n  It was not too long ago, I say to the Senator from Florida, we would \nsit on the floor and argue about the ``ownership society.'' Remember \nthat? Privatizing Social Security: We don't need Social Security. Just \nlet me have my own private account. Well, you heard that a lot. And the \nmodel of the ownership society group was: Just remember, we are all in \nthis alone.\n  Well, we learned better. We learned with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nand other challenges, the only chance we have is when we are all in \nthis together. And together as a nation we have done amazing things.\n  I think the life of the Senator from Florida tells that story. Most \npeople don't know--but I sure do--you served in the House of \nRepresentatives. You were an elected statewide official in Florida and \nmanaged to squeeze into that public service career a trip in space as \nan astronaut. And I know you then came to the Senate with dedication \neven greater to this country.\n  Together, Florida is strong, Illinois is strong. We are strong as a \nnation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. As we close this out--under the previous \norder, at 4 o'clock we will be in other business--I will continue my \ndrumbeat on a daily basis about the need for energy independence. I \nknow what our people in Florida believe. They feel very strongly about \nit. Before I engaged in the colloquy with the Senator from Illinois, I \nhad intended to talk about some specifics of the use of ethanol and the \nmanufacture of ethanol and how that could help us ween ourselves from \ndependence on foreign oil. I shall pick that up on another day, but I \nwill continue this daily, trying to sound the alarm for this country \nthat if we don't do something, we will rue the day that we did not.\n  I am told that we might have a couple of more minutes here. I will go \nahead and close out some of my comments. As the Senator from Illinois \nand I discussed in our colloquy, it is true that transportation is \nwhere we are consuming most of our oil. If you want to do something \nabout lessening your dependence on foreign oil, go to the place where \nwe consume most of it. That is in our personal vehicles. One thing that \nwe have to do is pursue alternative fuels to petroleum. Gasoline\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\nand diesel, petroleum products, accounted for over 98 percent of \ntransportation motor fuels sold in the year 2004. Only 2 percent are \nfrom alternatives to petroleum. We need to increase that 2 percent, and \nit can come from many different sources of alternatives to petroleum, \nsuch as ethanol.\n  As the Senator from Illinois and I discussed, corn is clearly a basis \nfor ethanol. But with the advance of technology, there are many other \nsources as well. Cellulose and glucose are two. Glucose, sugar, we \nraise a lot of sugarcane in Florida. They do in Louisiana. We raise a \nlot of sugar beets throughout the Midwest and the West. That is a \nsource of ethanol. It was one of the things that I pushed for, at the \ntime of the discussion of CAFTA, to get the administration, through the \nDepartment of Agriculture, to start the study on making ethanol from \nsugarcane. I will pick up in the future with a discussion of ethanol \nmade from sources other than corn, as I bring to the attention of the \nSenate how much this is getting to be an emergency situation that we \nare depending on oil. And of that oil, almost 60 percent of it comes \nfrom foreign shores. That is not good for this country. We have to \nchange that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10696-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEDICARE COST-SHARING AND WELFARE EXTENSION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, more than 10,000 years ago, on the eastern \nedge of the Mediterranean Sea, people became farmers. They started \ngrowing crops of emmer and einkorn wheat. They harvested the grain with \ncurved, handheld sickle-blades.\n  And 5,000 years ago, Mesopotamian farmers yoked cattle to pull plows. \nThe plows' bronze-tipped blades cut deeply, greatly increasing \nproductivity.\n  Today, in Ethiopia, wheat farmers still harvest their wheat with oxen \nor by hand. They use tools much like those invented 5,000 years ago. An \nEthiopian wheat farmer harvests an acre of wheat in a week.\n  A few weeks ago, in Montana, a wheat farmer whom I know near Fort \nBenton, in Chouteau County, finished harvesting this year's hard-red \nspring-wheat crop. He and his family drive a John Deere 60 series STS \ncombine that they bought for more than $225,000, a couple of years ago. \nSTS stands for the ``single-tine separator'' system that the combine \nuses for threshing and separating. The combine's rotor technology \nyields a smooth, free-flowing crop stream, giving the farmer higher \nground speeds and increased throughput capacity. This Fort Benton wheat \nfarmer harvests 5 acres and 220 bushels of wheat in half an hour.\n  What the Ethiopian farmer can do in a week, the Montana farmer can do \nin 6 minutes.\n  There are a lot of reasons for the difference: land, climate, seed \nquality, farming skills. But one big difference between the \nproductivity of farmers in Ethiopia and the productivity of farmers in \nMontana is their tools--their physical capital.\n  Capital distinguishes the modern age. Capital is the most important \nreason why the average American earns about $40,000 a year and the \naverage sub-Saharan African earns about $600 a year. Capital makes \nAmerican workers more productive and more competitive.\n  This is my fifth address to the Senate on competitiveness. Starting \nthis summer, I spoke on competitiveness generally. I spoke on the role \nof education in competitiveness. I spoke on the role of trade in \ncompetitiveness. I spoke on the role of controlling health-care costs \nin competitiveness. And today, I wish to speak about the role of \ncapital and savings in competitiveness.\n  Capital means financial wealth--especially that used to start or \nmaintain a business. Many economists think of capital as one of three \nfundamental factors of production, along with land and labor.\n  Capital and the productivity that it engenders set apart developed \neconomies from the developing world. With capital investment, the \nconstruction worker uses a backhoe, instead of a shovel. With capital \ninvestment, the accountant uses a calculator, instead of an abacus. \nWith capital investment, the office worker uses a personal computer, \ninstead of a pencil.\n  In the late 1950s, there were about 2,000 computers in the world. \nEach of these computers could process about 10,000 instructions per \nsecond.\n  Today, there are about 300 million computers. Each of them can \nprocess several hundred-million instructions per second.\n  In less than 50 years, the world's raw computing power has increased \nfour-billion-fold. This sustained increase in productivity is \nunparalleled in history. Capital investment in information technology \nmade it possible.\n  In 1960, capital investment in information technology was about 1 \npercent of our economy. By 1980, investment in IT increased to 2 \npercent of our economy. By 2000, investment in IT increased to 6 \npercent of our economy.\n  These are slow, single-digit increases in investment. But look at the \nrevolutions that they ignited.\n  This information technology investment contributed to a new era of \nAmerican worker productivity and competitiveness. That productivity \ncontinues today. In the mid-1990s, when the benefits of IT investment \nkicked in, American workers began producing nearly 4 percent more per \nhour. As increased productivity surged through the economy, the \nstandard of living improved for the Nation.\n  Capital made possible this unprecedented productivity. Investment \nmade possible this capital. And savings made possible this investment. \nSavings is the seed corn for productivity growth.\n  National savings fuels investment. Investment provides capital to our \nworkers. Capital ignites productivity. And productivity makes our \neconomy accelerate.\n  Savings is what is left of income after consumption. National savings \ncollects the surpluses of private households, businesses, and \ngovernments. When workers put part of their salaries into 401(k) plans, \nthat adds to national savings. When companies hold on to their excess \nearnings and profits, that too adds to national savings. And when the \ngovernment runs a budget surplus, that public sector savings adds to \nthe national pool of savings, as well.\n  The three elements of national savings--household savings, corporate \nsavings and public savings--are fundamental to economic \ncompetitiveness. Savings lets us invest in new factory equipment, \nmachines, or tools. Savings lets us invest in high-technology \ninnovations. Savings lets us invest in human, physical, and \nintellectual capital.\n  But America's level of national savings is dwindling. The decline of \nAmerica's savings demands action.\n  At the end of last year, net national savings stood at just under 2 \npercent of gross domestic product. That is less than $2 for every $100 \nthat our Nation earns. This is down more than 70 percent since 2000. No \nother industrialized country in the world has such a low national \nsavings rate.\n  If we break down national savings into its component parts, we can \nsee why national savings has fallen off. First the good news: Corporate \nsavings has held steady--even increased--over the past decade. But the \ngood news ends there.\n  Personal savings--what American households are contributing to the \nNation's savings--has fallen dramatically. Just 10 years ago, Americans \nsaved about $4 of every $100 that our economy produced. By the end of \n2004, we were saving just 99 cents. And today? The recent data show \nthat personal savings has fallen even further, below zero.\n  In July, for every $100 of disposable income that Americans \ngenerated, we spent that $100, plus 60 cents more.\n  Rather than saving, American households are borrowing. In the 1980s, \ntotal household debt equaled about 70 percent of a year's aftertax \nincome. By 2004, household debt equaled 107 percent of aftertax income.\n  And the bad news gets worse. As American households fish pennies out \nof the Nation's piggy bank, there is a growing hole at the bottom. The \npublic sector is draining national savings as the huge Federal budget \ndeficits grow.\n  In just 4 years, the Federal Government's contribution to national \nsavings has gone from a positive contribution of more than 2 percent of \nthe economy, to a drain of more than 3 percent. Instead of contributing \n$2 for every $100 the economy earns, the Federal Government takes out \n$3 dollars. Government deficits are the chief cause of our abysmal \nnational savings rate.\n  With national savings so low, how has America's economy remained an \nengine of growth?\n  We find the answer in Japan, Europe, China, and even the developing \nworld.\n  Americans have stopped saving. But the rest of the world has not.\n  Today, Americans turn to foreign lenders for our savings. The rest of \nthe world has become America's creditor, happily lending their savings \nto our Government, corporations, and households. Fully 80 percent of \nthe world's savings come to America. The world's largest economy has \nbecome the world's largest debtor.\n  This is a big change. Between 1950 and the early 1980s, our foreign \nborrowing was balanced. Some years we borrowed from foreigners. And \nother years we lent. But for most years, we remained a net creditor.\n  Since then, our situation has dramatically reversed. We now depend on \nforeigners to fuel our economy.\n  Look at foreign and domestic investment flows. Last year, our net \nborrowing from foreign lenders totaled nearly $700 billion. This year, \nour net foreign borrowing could well exceed $800 billion.\n  This kind of borrowing adds up. As recently as 1985, America had zero \nnet foreign debt. Today, America's net foreign debt is the size of \nnearly 30 percent of our economy.\n  The last time that we had this level of foreign debt, Grover \nCleveland lived in the White House. The last time that\n\n[[Page S10698]]\n\nwe had this level of foreign debt, 18 percent of Americans were \nunemployed, violent railroad strikes shook the Nation, and a deep \ndepression gripped the world economy.\n  What is worse, soon, the ratio of foreign debt to GDP will hit 50 \npercent. In 7 years, the ratio will hit 100 percent.\n  This is unprecedented, not just for the United States. It is \nunprecedented for any modern industrialized country.\n  We welcome foreign investment in America. Our economy's openness to \nthe world's capital has helped keep our economy strong. Foreign \ninvestment fuels our economy and creates good American jobs.\n  But if we continue to become increasingly dependent on foreign \ncapital, then we will have to pay the piper.\n  First, continued borrowing means an ever-growing claim on our \nNation's assets. The more that foreigners lend to America, the more \ndividend and interest payments they will collect--not Americans but \nthem.\n  In 2005, for the first time since these data were recorded, America \nwill pay more on foreigners' investments in America than American \ninvestors earn on their investments abroad. This year, these payments \ncould amount to $30 billion. By 2008, these payments could rocket to \nmore than $260 billion.\n  That would be a quarter of a trillion dollars paid out that would not \nboost our productivity. That quarter of a trillion dollars would \nincrease foreign countries' standard of living, not ours.\n  That would be a quarter of a trillion dollars simply paying on our \nexisting debt. More and more, we would have to borrow new amounts from \nforeign sources to pay back funds that we had already borrowed.\n  And that would be a quarter of a trillion dollars of behavior that \none associates with a Third World economy, not the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Second, foreigners are increasingly not investing their savings in \nAmerica's productive sectors, but in U.S. Government securities. \nForeigners are frequently buying our Government securities as part of \nschemes to manipulate currency markets and subsidize their exports. \nThose schemes further hurt our competitiveness and our future standard \nof living.\n  That is, they are not investing in plants and equipment, they are \ninvesting in our securities so they can accomplish other objectives and \ngoals.\n  When 80 percent of the world savings flows to one country, the world \neconomy is unbalanced. When 80 percent of the world savings flows to \njust the United States of America, that is a big imbalance.\n  This imbalance creates dangerous problems and distortions in the U.S. \neconomy and throughout the world.\n  Eventually, the pendulum will swing back. The world economy will \nreturn to equilibrium. Foreign investors will decide to rebalance their \nportfolios. They will reduce their lending to America. America will \nhave to pay more for its borrowing. Interest rates will rise. This \nrebalancing could cause severe dislocations in our economy.\n  We can steer clear of some of these costs. But we can do so only if \nwe consider them now and do what we can to secure our economy from \nsudden and difficult adjustments later.\n  Where do we look for solutions?\n  America must increase its own national savings. We must finance more \nof our own investment.\n  We must create a reliable and stable pool of investment funding to \nfulfill our investment needs. This saving will also make us more \nprofitable in the long run. We will gain the returns on capital \ninvestment here. We will not send them abroad.\n  We will continue to welcome foreign savings to our shores. But \nAmerica will have a higher stock of self-financed investment.\n  How do we do this? First, we must plug the biggest leak in our \nnational savings pool: the federal budget deficit. The federal \ngovernment continues to run huge deficits. Prior to 2003, the record \ndeficit was $290 billion in 1992. But in 2003, the government set a new \nrecord deficit of $375 billion dollars. In 2004, the government set an \neven higher record deficit of $412 billion dollars. This year, the \ngovernment is projected to run a deficit of more than $300 billion \ndollars. The last 3 years have produced the 3 largest deficits in the \nNation's history.\n  Now with the immense costs of Hurricane Katrina, Goldman Sachs now \npredicts that the deficits for the next 2 years will once again be \nabout $400 billion. That would be 2 more years of deficits once again \napproaching record levels. Each year's deficit adds up.\n  These deficits increase our national debt. At the end of fiscal year \n2001, the government's debt held by the public was $3.3 trillion. By \nthe end of this month, economists project that debt held by the public \nwill rise to $4.6 trillion. This would be an increase of 40 percent in \njust 4 years.\n  There are times when deficits are appropriate. If the economy is in a \nrecession, net borrowing by the federal government can help to restore \nprosperity and job growth. But with the economy humming along now, huge \ndeficits no longer serve Americans well. Instead, these large deficits \ndivert domestic and international savings away from productive economic \nsectors. These productive sectors need savings to invest in innovative \ncapital goods that can boost productivity, help our economy to grow, \nand improve our Nation's living standards.\n  We must be honest about our spending needs today and in the future. \nBudget forecasts for the near-term that neglect the costs of war and of \nneglect upcoming reductions in revenues--such as reform of the \nalternative minimum tax--serve no one but cynical political \nstrategists. And the retirement of the baby boom generation beginning \nin 2008 will put enormous long-term pressure on the federal budget \nthrough increased Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare spending. We \nmust own up to these long-run problems.\n  Once we define the problem honestly, we must find ways to solve it.\n  First, we must restore the pay-as-you-go rules for both entitlement \nspending and tax cuts. We are stuck in a hole. We have to stop digging. \nWe must pay for any new spending or tax cuts that we enact.\n  Until 2003, tough pay-as-you-go rules governed the Congressional \nbudget process. But these rules expired in 2003. And a virtually \nmeaningless alternative has taken their place. We must restore strong \nand meaningful pay-go rules.\n  Second, we must reduce the annual tax gap. As much as $350 billion of \ntaxes went unpaid in 2001. Since then, the government has collected \nonly $55 billion of that 2001 shortfall. These huge gaps occur every \nyear. We cannot afford this tax gap.\n  Third, we must eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending. For \nexample, the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human \nServices recently discovered that the government had paid nearly $12 \nmillion in benefits to recipients in Florida who had already died.\n  Fourth, we must eliminate wasteful and unfair tax breaks such as \nabusive tax shelters and corporate tax loopholes.\n  Finally, we must slow the growth in healthcare costs. We cannot rein \nin budget deficits without controlling the growth in healthcare costs. \nThe private sector cannot sustain its current healthcare cost growth. \nAnd neither can the public sector. We cannot clamp down on healthcare \ncosts in the public sector alone. Providers will just shift healthcare \ncosts to the private sector. Fortunately, solutions that contain \nprivate sector healthcare costs will likely also help contain public \nsector healthcare costs, as well.\n  Taking these five steps would go a long way towards reducing Federal \nbudget deficits and increasing national savings.\n  Increasing private savings is more complicated. We cannot adopt pay-\nas-you-go rules for families. Instead, we have to provide families with \nthe tools that they need to develop their own growth plan.\n  The first tool is financial education. Too few Americans know how to \ndevelop a family budget. And too few know how to assess the risk of an \nadjustable rate mortgage when interest rates are rising.\n  We need to provide our children, and their parents and grandparents, \nwith the tools that they need to make good financial decisions--to have \nmore savings and less debt.\n  Programs such as ``Stash Your Cash''--a program to teach young people \nthe basics of finance, saving, and investing--are a good start.\n  As part of ``Stash Your Cash,'' this summer, 15 pigs--each one 4 feet \ntall\n\n[[Page S10699]]\n\nand 750 pounds--appeared in the streets of Washington. And it was not \njust another political statement.\n  The colorful animals on street corners were oversized piggy banks. \nLocal middle school students and artists painted each one.\n  ``Stash Your Cash'' gets to kids early. It teaches them financial \nvocabulary, how to create a budget, and how and why they should save \nfor the future. It teaches middle-school students that creating a \nbudget helps them understand where their money goes, ensures that they \ndo not spend more than they earn, finds uses for money to achieve \ngoals, and helps them set aside money for the future.\n  We can all benefit from these lessons. Savings is vital for our \nchildren's and our families' financial future. And what is vital for \nour families is vital for our country.\n  Second, we need to make it easier to save.\n  The most successful savings programs are payroll-deduction savings \nthrough employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. We can make these programs \neven more successful by encouraging employers to enroll eligible \nemployees automatically. Employees would opt out of saving instead of \nopting in. Without automatic enrollment, just two-thirds of eligible \nemployees contribute to a 401(k) plan. With automatic enrollment, \nparticipation jumps to over 90 percent. The largest increases are among \nyounger and lower-income employees.\n  Only half of private sector workers have a 401(k) or similar plan \navailable to them. We need to bring payroll-deduction retirement \nsavings to the other half.\n  Who is that other half? Part-time workers, those who put in less than \n1,000 hours a year, do not have to be covered by 401(k) plans. Small \nemployers are less likely to offer 401(k) plans, or similar \narrangements, to their workers. And lower-income workers are less \nlikely to have a plan available than moderate- and higher-income \nworkers.\n  We have a voluntary pension system. We should not change that. But we \ncan make savings opportunities available to more workers without \nforcing employers to provide more benefits.\n  Third, we need to make incentives for saving more progressive. Like \nmany tax incentives, our current savings incentives give more bang-for-\nthe-buck to those in the higher tax brackets. Our income taxes go to \njust the opposite.\n  In 2001, we took an important step toward fairness by creating the \nSaver's Credit. The Saver's Credit helps low-to-moderate-income \ntaxpayers to save by providing a credit of up to half of the first \n$2,000 that they contribute to an IRA or 401(k) plan. More than 5 \nmillion taxpayers claimed this credit in 2001. It works. But it will \nexpire after 2006. We must extend it and we must expand it to cover \nthose with no income tax liability.\n  In ancient times, people viewed the toil of farming as a curse. The \nancient text tells how when man left the Garden of Eden, he heard God \nsay:\n\n       Cursed be the ground because of you;\n       By toil shall you eat of it\n       All the days of your life:\n       By the sweat of your brow\n       Shall you get bread to eat,\n       Until you return to the ground--\n       For from it you were taken.\n\n  But now, increased investment, capital, and productivity have made it \nso that we may hear the blessing with which Moses blessed the children \nof Israel on the plains of Moab, across the River Jordan:\n\n       The Lord will give you abounding prosperity in . . . the \n     offspring of your cattle, and the produce of your soil in the \n     land that the Lord swore to your fathers to assign to you. \n     The Lord will open for you His bounteous store, the heavens, \n     to provide rain for your land in season and to bless all your \n     undertakings. You will be creditor to many nations, but \n     debtor to none.\n\n  From ancient times, the sages recognized that the terms \n``prosperity'' and ``debtor'' rarely apply to the same country.\n  Let us return to being a country whose saving provides the seed corn \nthat brings those blessings of ``abounding prosperity.''\n  Let us seek the blessings of being ``creditor to many nations, but \ndebtor to none.''\n  And let us do the work that we need to do to see that ``[t]he Lord \nwill [continue]. . . to bless all [the] undertakings'' of this great \nLand.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10699-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10699-S10702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--Continued\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

It will only be available when this bill is signed into law \nby the President.\n  Sometime during the first quarter, operating accounts for day-to-day \noperation costs--operation and maintenance for the Army, for the Marine \nCorps, and for the training efforts of Iraqis--are in the reserve \naccount and will not be available. It is imperative we get this bill to \nthe President so it can be signed to make the money available by the \nmiddle of November.\n  Increased fuel costs are putting pressure on operating accounts. We \nall know what it costs us when we pull up to a gas station and fill up \na tank. It costs just as much or more to fill up the tanks in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for those people who are in the air and on the ground. That \nmoney is not going to be available unless we approve this bill.\n  One of the things that bothers me is that there is money in this bill \nto finance continued production of the C-130Js. That production \ncontract is planned for mid-November, but there is no money available \nnow. It will not be available until the 2006 bill is signed. There are \na whole series of things in this bill that are designed to take the \npressure off of the way the funding is being carried out at the \nDepartment of Defense. The ability to finance the improvised explosive \ndevice task force initiatives will be constrained unless that $50 \nbillion portion of this bill is passed.\n  So I urge the Senate to help us get this bill through as quickly as \npossible. I know that is sort of difficult now with the recesses that \nare coming up, but very clearly we are starting to get amendments that \nare not germane to this bill, and I hope that will not go on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I and the Senator from Hawaii join in \nasking the clerks in both cloakrooms that they would send out a notice \nthat we intend to move for third reading if there is no amendment \npresented within an hour.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I discussed this with the distinguished \nfloor managers.\n  First, parliamentary inquiry: Is the Harkin amendment now the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to set \naside\n\n[[Page S10700]]\n\nthat amendment so the distinguished Senator from Missouri and I could \noffer an amendment, and that upon the completion of action or the \nsetting aside, whichever transpires first, it be in order to return to \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1901\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1901.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To appropriate $1,300,000,000 for Additional War-Related \n Appropriations for National Guard and Reserve Equipment for homeland \n           security and homeland security response equipment)\n\n       On page 228, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                  National Guard and Reserve Equipment\n\n       For an additional amount for ``National Guard and Reserve \n     Equipment'', $1,300,000,000, to remain available until \n     expended: Provided, That the amount available under this \n     heading shall be available for homeland security and homeland \n     security response equipment; Provided further, That the \n     amount provided under this heading is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the \n     conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 95 (108th \n     Congress).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so Members will know, this amendment adds \n$1.3 billion in emergency funding for National Guard equipment to the \nsupplemental portion of the fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill. The funding is set aside for the National Guard to buy much \nneeded items for homeland security and natural disaster response.\n  Hurricane Katrina exposed glaring deficiencies in the equipment \navailable for the National Guard to respond to such disasters. After \nHurricane Katrina, we had barely sufficient levels of trucks, tractors, \ncommunication, and miscellaneous equipment that is necessary to respond \nto the overwhelming scale of this storm. If we have another hurricane \nor, God forbid, a large-scale terrorist attack, our National Guard is \nnot going to have the basic level of resources to do the job right.\n  As we know, in every one of our 50 States, we have seen in our career \ntimes where the National Guard was called upon to help. The National \nGuard Chief, LTG Steven Blum, recently noted that the Guard has only \nabout 35 percent of what is officially required to respond to \nhurricanes, natural disasters, or possible terrorist attacks at home.\n  Yesterday, in an appearance in the House of Representatives, General \nBlum noted that Guard members responded to this disaster with \ninsufficient and outdated communications. General Blum noted we are \ngoing to need at least--a staggering amount--$7 billion to procure the \ncommunications, trucks, medical supplies, and machinery necessary to \nrespond to future disasters.\n  We knew, even before that hearing, that without any doubt there is an \nimmediate need for at least $1.3 billion. We have to procure essential \nequipment such as a family of medium tractor vehicles, new SINCGARS \nradios, night-vision goggles, and other equipment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent report from the National Guard \non these critical needs be printed in the Record.\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       National Guard units that deployed to combat since \n     September 11th have been the best trained and equipped force \n     in American History. $4.3 billion has been invested to \n     provide those units with the very best, state-of-the-art \n     equipment available in the world today.\n       This is an unprecedented demonstration of the DoD \n     commitment to ensure that no soldier or aiman, regardless of \n     component (Active, Guard, or Reserve), goes to war ill-\n     equipped or untrained. With the help of the US Congress, this \n     was accomplished over a two-year period. It is a reality for \n     National Guard overseas combat deployments.\n       Now, the senior leadership of the DoD is extending the same \n     level of commitment to the National Guard, the nation's first \n     military responders in time of domestic need.\n       The DoD has a comprehensive reset plan that recognizes the \n     National Guard's critical role in Homeland Defense and \n     support to Homeland Security operations. This will take time \n     and resources. I am confident that a real sense of urgency \n     exists to make this a reality for America.\n       Communications equipment, tactical vehicles and trucks and \n     engineer equipment are the National Guard's highest equipment \n     priorities.\n                                         H. Steven Blum, LTG, USA,\n                                     Chief, National Guard Bureau.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we got into this situation for two reasons:\n  First, unfortunately, with all the other needs of this country, we \nhave traditionally underfunded the National Guard's equipment level. \nSecond, much of the equipment the Guard does have is being used in the \nongoing war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in our needs across the \nMiddle East and Central Asia. We all know there is no prospect that we \nare going to see it again back in the United States any time soon.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, and I \ncochair the Senate National Guard Caucus. On September 13, the two of \nus wrote the President to urge that the administration deal with this \nproblem immediately. We want to demonstrate by our letter that this is \nnot a partisan issue, it is a national issue.\n  We asked the President include the $1.3 billion in the next \nsupplemental spending bill to deal with Hurricane Katrina. But we can't \nwait for the President to request the funding. We have to act now. The \ndate this next supplemental spending bill will be submitted is still \nuncertain. We don't know when it is going to be submitted. But with \nthis Defense appropriations bill, we have billions of dollars in \nemergency funding. Much of that emergency funding, rightly so, will go \ntoward ensuring that our men and women abroad have the right tools to \ndo their jobs. We should do that. But it is just as reasonable and \nnecessary that we add emergency funding to deal with the equipment \nneeds of our troops at home.\n  Certainly in the last couple of months, we have seen probably at no \nother time how much that equipment is needed, and we know there will be \nother occasions.\n  I praise Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for including so much \nequipment money for the Guard in supplemental baseline bills. While \nmost of that new equipment will go toward the Guard's overseas \nwarfighting needs, our Guard and Reserve have a greater percentage and \na greater activity than at any time in decades, and they need the help. \nThe funding we are now asking for takes a big step forward.\n  I have worked with them closely. Of course, I want to see the \namendment accepted. I will, of course, ask for a vote, if we can't \nreach such agreement.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Alaska and the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii have spent even more years in this body than I \nhave, and they worked closely to help our National Guard. Senator Bond \nand I have done our best to fashion a reasonable and necessary piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join wholeheartedly my \nNational Guard Caucus cochairman, the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, in urging the Senate to adopt these emergency appropriations \nfor our National Guard.\n  We have had a lot of talk about emergency responders and people \nwondered, Did this group do their job? Did that group do their job? As \nGovernor of Missouri for 8 years, I saw the National Guard respond, and \nrespond fully, to every natural disaster we had. We had floods, we had \ntornadoes, we had some other civil disorders, and the Guard responded. \nThey responded with the equipment they needed.\n  Since that time, I have served in the Senate as cochairman of the \nNational Guard. I have seen the Guard continue to respond to State \nemergencies time after time after time. When they have been called upon \nto go abroad as part of the national defense mission, they have done so \nextremely well.\n  Unfortunately, the men and women of the National Guard, those vital \ncitizen soldiers who volunteer to serve their country, have not been \nwell resourced. It appears when equipment\n\n[[Page S10701]]\n\nis available the Pentagon obviously takes care, first, of the active. \nIn this situation, we have seen a tremendous drain on equipment--not \njust from emergencies around the country but from the National Guard's \nparticipation and contribution of equipment to our overseas mission. As \na result, the equipment readiness in critical areas of the National \nGuard has fallen to about 34 percent. We are asking the men and women \nof the Guard to go into situations--whether they be overseas military \nsituations or a vital rescue mission such as New Orleans--without the \nequipment.\n  Our Guard, along with others, responded and responded promptly to the \ndisaster of the gulf coast. They were in Louisiana. They went proudly. \nWe sent an engineer battalion from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri. They \nwent down there, and they performed admirably. They had one set of \ntrucks, one set of communications equipment, and one set of night \nvision goggles. The need was great, and they asked for a second of the \nNational Guard engineering units to be deployed. We had to refuse, not \nbecause we did not have the personnel ready--we did not have the \ntrucks, we did not have the communication equipment. We absolutely \ncould not respond in that situation because of a lack of equipment.\n  When we read the stories about the National Guard's participation, \none gets a better understanding of how effective and how responsive the \nNational Guard is.\n  As the Senator from Vermont said, we have requested that an emergency \nappropriation be added to the supplemental. I join with him today in \nasking the Senate to approve as an emergency appropriations measure the \nmoney we need. This money is critically important. It includes trucks. \nThe big trucks the National Guard has can drive through flood areas. \nThey can rescue people. They can also go in war zones. They need night \nvision goggles. You may think night vision goggles are necessary \nprimarily in war. Think about going into New Orleans, which has lost \nall of its power, all of its lighting, and you are trying to find \npeople who are in grave personal danger because of the rising \nfloodwaters. You need the night vision goggles to see them. Most \nimportantly, think about communications. How do they work with other \nunits, other Federal units, other State units, when they are on a civil \nmission? When they are under control of the local officials who have \nthe responsibility, who have the local command, how do they communicate \nwith them? They cannot in too many instances.\n  That is why this particular appropriation is so important that we \nbegin resourcing our Guard. We can all be very proud of the Guard in \nour States. We do not have every Member of the Senate as a member of \nthe National Guard Caucus, but I have not found a Member of this Senate \nwho is not extremely proud of his or her National Guard. They know when \nthe chips are down, when lives are in danger, the Guard can and will \nrespond. The Guard comes to our defense regularly. The very least we \ncan do is make sure we support the Guard when they go in. Not giving \nthem the equipment they need is not an answer. We are not going to send \nthem into harm's way without the equipment to do their job.\n  This is an important amendment. This is a large sum. We, obviously, \nare very much aware of the needs. This is a pressing need, and the \nemergencies and the wartime situation we are in compel a response to \nthe needs of the Guard.\n  I thank my colleague from Vermont for offering this, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join in seeing that the National Guard gets the \nappropriation resources they need. I thank the managers of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I was \ngoing to suggest that if the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nHawaii want to accept the amendment, we could actually get some \nsignificant business done right here.\n  While they are thinking about this, I must say there are few people \nin this Senate more senior than I, but certainly the Senator from \nHawaii is much more senior, the Senator from Alaska is much more \nsenior. They are only two of five people senior to me, and they want a \nquorum.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one of the minor procedural problems we have \naround here with an emergency clause is this has to go through several \nlayers of clearance. It is not a higher pay grade, it is a different \npay grade, it is a different responsibility. The distinguished floor \nmanagers are working on that. We have the budget committees and others \nwho have to act on it.\n  I appreciate very much the work of Chairman Stevens and Senator \nInouye. I hope we will be able to resolve this very shortly. We have \ntwo of the best leaders in the Senate handling this bill. Whatever \nneeds to be done I assure my colleagues will be done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the Harkin amendment the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Leahy amendment is pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1886\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the Leahy amendment be set aside \nand the Harkin amendment be brought before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have had some conversations about this amendment. It \nis an amendment that raises the subject of the way the Government is \ngoing to approach the great problems associated with Asian flu. Under \nthe circumstances, it has been my recommendation that we take this \namendment to conference because then the subject will be in this bill. \nIf the agencies involved can come together with an appropriate plan and \nrequest for money, we would then be able to do this in conference.\n  Although I have had some question about this amendment, we have \ndiscussed this now with the author of the amendment. As I indicated to \nhim, if it would pass, I would cosponsor, and I ask that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa.\n  The amendment (No. 1886) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The pending amendment is the Leahy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is that the Leahy-Bond amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I clarify with the desk that I am shown on \nthe Leahy amendment; it is the Leahy-Bond amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is listed as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Nomination Of John Roberts\n\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I will reflect a moment on the \nvote we took earlier today. This vote has such weight because of its \nplace in our system of government. The Supreme Court is a final voice \non the extent of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, the \ndemarcation of power between\n\n[[Page S10702]]\n\nthe legislative and executive branch of Government, and the division of \npower reserved for the Federal Government and the governments of the \nindividual States. As a Member of this legislative body and in a former \nlife as a State Governor, I am acutely aware of the importance of the \nlines and the consequences when they are broached.\n  As a Member of the Senate, I do not welcome decisions overturning \nlegislative acts that I support, but I frequently work with my \ncolleagues to reject efforts to meddle in State affairs. As a Governor \nattempting to guide my State, I had to labor through many burdens \nplaced in our way, the State's way, by an intrusive Federal Government.\n  The judicial branch of our Government--most notably the Supreme \nCourt--has been designated by the Constitution as the branch to \nmaintain these divisions of power and referee the tensions between our \ngovernments. After observing Judge Roberts during the days of hearings \nbefore the Committee on the Judiciary, I am convinced the power that \ncomes with the vote of a Supreme Court Justice will be in wise and \ncapable hands.\n  Throughout the strenuous sessions, Judge Roberts' intelligence, \npatience, and temperament were on full display. Judge Roberts made a \nconvincing case through words and demeanor that he will approach his \nresponsibility with modesty and humility.\n  Also, as Judge Roberts repeatedly reminded his inquisitors, he is not \na politician. I commend him on his willingness to remind my colleagues \nthat he was not before Congress to compromise or give hints on how he \nmight vote on a hypothetical case in exchange for confirmation votes; \nrather, he confirmed repeatedly that the Constitution will be his guide \nto these questions.\n  I suspect that some of my colleagues have come to rely on the \njudiciary to advance changes that have no support in the duly elected \nmember of our legislature, State and national; hence, their frustration \nwith Judge Roberts.\n\n  Judge Roberts has clearly defined views of the role of the judiciary \nand the role of the legislature, and they do not appear to be blurred. \nAs Judge Roberts put it so well:\n\n       If the people who framed our Constitution were jealous of \n     their freedom and liberty, they would not have sat around and \n     said, ``Let's take all the hard issues and give them over to \n     the judges.'' That would have been the farthest thing from \n     their mind.\n\n  As did the Founders, I do not believe State and National legislative \nbodies are incapable of settling tough and contentious issues. I do not \nbelieve it is benevolent or admirable for judges to remove questions \nfrom the public realm because they are divisive. Judge Roberts has \nshown the modesty and respect to refrain from that path.\n  Judge Roberts also has made it clear he finds no place for reflection \non the public attitudes and legal documents of foreign lands in the \nconsideration of constitutional questions. They do not and should not \noffer any guidance as to the words and the meaning of our own \nConstitution.\n  During his testimony, Judge Roberts displayed a respect for the \nConstitution and the rule of law as the principles that should guide \nhim when ruling on a case. His view of the role of the judiciary is \nvery consistent with my own.\n  Finally, I believe President Bush has executed his duties in a \nresponsible manner that will serve our Nation well. He interviewed many \ndistinguished and qualified judges and attorneys in the country. He \nconsulted with Members of the Senate. After careful and thoughtful \ndeliberation, President Bush returned to the Senate the name of John \nRoberts. I am very pleased today that 78 Members of the Senate agreed \nand confirmed him to the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1901\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the Bond-Leahy amendment regarding additional funding for \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This is relative to the extraordinary work that they \ndid in Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the extraordinary work that our \nGuard does throughout the Nation. In fact, as I speak, I am sure they \nare on the ground for this unfolding tragedy in California with the \nfires. I am not able to speak more fully at this time but I wanted to \nregister my support for the amendment and will speak later tonight. I \nunderstand this amendment may be accepted. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir great support at this time of obvious need. The people of \nLouisiana and the gulf coast are grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10702-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10702-S10705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1901, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment has been offered before and \nagreed to before. Unfortunately, it has not been enacted into law. It \ndoes very well on the floor of the Senate. It just doesn't do very well \nin conference committee. For some reason, when it gets to a conference \ncommittee, it is usually removed. I hope this will be an exception \nbecause I think what we are talking about with this amendment is \nsomething that most Senators on both sides of the aisle would agree \nwith.\n  The premise behind this amendment is as follows: If you are willing \nto serve in the Guard or Reserve and if you are willing, when \nactivated, to leave your job and your family behind to risk your life \nfor America, we should do our best as a nation to stand behind you. \nThat is it.\n  How do we stand behind the men and women of the Guard and Reserve \nwhen they are activated to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan? In a variety \nof ways. Communities come forward, churches, friends, community groups \nhelp the family of a soldier who is overseas. But there is one other \nthing that happens that is as important, if not more. Many times that \nactivated Guard or Reserve member faces a cut in pay. They have a good \njob. They have been activated. They have to serve for a year or more. \nThey are being paid less during the time they are serving our country. \nSo we encourage employers across America to stand behind their \nemployees. If your employee is activated, stand behind your employee. \nMake up the difference in their pay.\n  It turns out that hundreds of corporations across America have said \nthat is the right thing to do. That is the patriotic thing to do. Yes, \nwe will stand behind the men and women activated into the Guard and \nReserve. We will make up the difference in pay so that their families \nback home have financial peace of mind that they can pay the mortgage, \nthe utility bills, keep the family together while that soldier is \nrisking his life overseas.\n  We think so highly of these companies for their patriotism and \ndedication to our soldiers that we have created a Web site at the \nDepartment of Defense. You can go to it. It is a site that \ncongratulates these employers for their devotion and allegiance to our \ntroops.\n  Unfortunately, there is one employer that refuses to do this. It \nturns out it is the largest single employer of all the Guard and \nReserve who are being activated. One employer that refuses, despite \nthis Web site, despite all these speeches, one employer that refuses to \nstand behind the soldiers who were activated in the Guard and Reserve \nand to make up the difference in pay if they are paid less when they \nare activated than they were paid in civilian life. Who is this \ndeadbeat employer that won't listen to these calls for patriotic \nresponsibility to the men and women in uniform? What employer in \nAmerica, after all that these soldiers have been through, will not \nstand behind them and make up the difference in pay? That employer is \nthe Federal Government of the United States.\n  One out of 10 Guard and Reserve serving today are Federal employees. \nThe Federal Government refuses to make up the difference in pay for \nthose who have had a cut in pay because they are risking their lives \nfor America.\n  I have offered this amendment time and again. I don't understand why \nit gets killed in conference committee every time I offer it. So many \nSenators come to the floor and say what a great idea it is. Yet when it \ngoes to conference committee, it doesn't survive. This amendment brings \nthe Federal Government into the 21st century and into line with \ncountless other major employers. So many of America's top companies do \nthe right thing for members of the National Guard and Reserve. So many \nof these are good patriotic corporate citizens in our private sector. \nBut in the public sector, 24 State governments, including my home State \nof Illinois, provides the same income protection for their State \ngovernment workers. Counties do it, cities do it, villages do it at \ngreat sacrifice, and we thank them for that.\n\n  This amendment simply allows the Federal Government to catch up with \nthe times, to match what other major employers are already doing, and \nto provide the same type of income protection for our Federal \nGovernment civilian employees who also serve in the Guard and Reserve.\n  I propose this amendment because it is not clear that a real \nopportunity to\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\noffer it will ever come on the Department of Defense authorization bill \nthis year.\n  The Senate is on record as supporting this measure. We have passed it \non three previous occasions. Two of those occasions were amendments to \nappropriations bills, such as the one before us.\n  This is the same language as reported out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last Congress, except this version does not include any \nretroactivity provision. Though I personally support that, this \namendment doesn't go that far.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that this measure has a \ncost but not a budget score. It is not retroactive. It is prospective \nonly and subject to available appropriations. The funds to provide this \ndifferential pay to these Federal employees in the Guard and Reserve \ncan come from funds already appropriated to the agencies for salaries. \nTwenty-four State governments do this. We have letters from those \nStates attesting to the fact that the benefit has required no \nadditional appropriations.\n  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have supported this \nmeasure in the past, and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for \nstanding with our men and women in uniform.\n  Let me show data which is illustrative of what we are facing.\n  Recent data from the Department of Defense's newest ``Status of \nForces Survey of Reserve Components'' tells us that 51 percent of \nreservists lose income during mobilization, and 11 percent lose more \nthan $2,500 per month.\n  So in addition to the sacrifice of being separated from their family, \nrisking their lives in service to their country, many of them are \ntaking substantial cuts in pay.\n  The new ``Status of Forces Survey of Reserve Components'' also \nreveals that income loss is one of the top factors cited by National \nGuard and Reserve components as reasons they might choose to stop \nserving in Reserve components. This is not only an injustice that we in \nthe Federal Government are not making up the pay differential, it, in \nfact, is one of the reasons some in the Reserve and Guard say they are \nnot going to re-up. We cannot retain their good services to our country \nbecause of the economic sacrifice which that service creates.\n  The Department of Defense operates a program called Employer Support \nof Guard and Reserve--ESGR for short--which recognizes and pays tribute \nto those patriotic, outstanding employers who go beyond the legal \nminimum job protections in support of their workers who are citizen \nsoldiers. ESGR operates this Web site which lists 900 companies, \nnonprofits, and State and local governments which offer this pay \ndifferential for mobilized workers. Search our Government Web site all \nyou will, but you will not find the Federal Government on the list. We \ndo not provide the same benefit to these men and women in service to \nour country as these other employers.\n  The number of employers providing this type of support to their \nworkers in the National Guard and Reserve has grown steadily, and we \nowe them a great debt of gratitude for the love of country and devotion \nto our men and women in uniform, but the Federal Government is still \nnot one of those employers.\n  I think this measure is long overdue. The Federal Government should \nnot be lagging behind major corporations and roughly half of the \ngovernments of the States of the United States in terms of the quality \nof support for the men and women in the Guard and Reserve.\n  We should be a leader, not a follower. We should set the example \nright now with this amendment. We can fix this problem, and we can do \nit quickly.\n  Let me briefly make a few points for the minority of my colleagues \nwho might continue to have reservations about this concept.\n  This measure does not bust the budget. Certainly, it results in some \nexpenditures, but the money to make up for any lost income by these \nmobilized Federal workers is drawn from the funds already previously \nappropriated to the same agency the workers were serving in before they \nwere activated. The money is already there. State governments that \nprovide similar benefits report that they require no additional \nappropriations to meet this responsibility.\n\n  Second, this measure is not additional pay for military service. \nReservists continue to receive the same military pay for the same \nmilitary job. Any differential pay they receive from their Federal \ncivilian employer is separate and apart from that and is simply \nintended to keep such employees financially whole while they are away. \nIt is a reflection of the value they provided to their Federal agency \nbefore they were mobilized and a reflection of the value they will \nprovide again when they return.\n  The military pay a reservist gets during mobilization is for the \nmilitary role he or she performs and is utterly unchanged by this \namendment.\n  Third, the wisdom of this amendment is readily understandable by the \nentire force, whether Active Duty or Reserve. Some people ask how to \nexplain to an Active-Duty soldier or his or her family why a Reserve \nsoldier sharing the same foxhole--to use an old colloquialism--\nperforming the same duties, is allowed to draw both military pay as \nwell as the lost portion of their civilian income. This is easy to \nexplain and easy to understand.\n  Unlike Active component troops, Reserve component troops structure \ntheir lives and make their financial commitments based on their regular \ncivilian income. Their house payments, their car payments, the kids' \ntuition payments--everything in their financial picture is based on the \nincome of a civilian life. When that income disappears during \nmobilization and is replaced by lower military income, the family \nsuffers a real hardship.\n  The Active component family may not suffer that hardship. They \nunderstood going in what the parameters of their family budgets were. \nAllowing a Federal civilian employer to alleviate this hardship for \ntheir workers, as many private employers already do, makes clearly \nexplainable and understandable sense.\n  Soldiers take care of one another. No troop wants to see his buddy \nstruggle or suffer problems with their family. Certainly, no Active-\nDuty soldier wants that Reserve soldier standing by his side helping \nhim to fight this war to be distracted by financial hardship back home.\n  Let me tell you who endorses this legislation: the American Legion, \nthe National Military Family Association, the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the National Guard Association of the United States, and \nthe Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.\n  The reason to support this measure is simple and straightforward: the \nFederal Government cannot and should not do less for its employees in \nthe Guard and Reserve than other major employers in America. It is time \nfor the U.S. Government to be an employer which is as supportive of our \ntroops as Sears, IBM, Home Depot, General Motors, and 24 State \ngovernments. They have already passed similar legislation. They have \nalready made a commitment to our troops. How can we commend all these \nother employers who go the extra mile to support our troops while we \nfail to do so? Can we hold them up as examples and not be an example \nourselves? I think the answer is no.\n  What we can do is adopt this amendment. I invite all my colleagues to \ncome together once more to adopt the Reservist Pay Security Act, and I \nurge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, when this amendment \nis adopted, for goodness' sake and for the sake of these soldiers, \ndon't kill it in conference committee. Stand by these soldiers all the \nway through the process. For years now, these soldiers have been \nshortchanged. It is time for us to make a difference in their lives and \nmake a commitment to these great men and women.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I withdraw that request and ask for the \nadoption of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 1908.\n  The amendment (No. 1908) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S10705]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, here we go again, yes, here we go again. The \nfiscal year ends tomorrow at midnight. Only two of the annual \nappropriations bills required to fund the Federal Government have been \nsent to the President. This is deja vu all over again.\n  As a result, the Congress is rushing through the stopgap money \nmeasure called a continuing resolution in order to prevent a massive \nshutdown of the departments and agencies of the Federal Government.\n  Is this the way to run a government?\n  This is no way to run a government.\n  The appropriations process is a very simple process, in reality. The \nPresident sends his recommendations to the Congress in the form of a \nbudget, usually in early February. Subsequently, the House formulates \nreports, debates and passes 11 annual appropriations bills. To its \ncredit, the House has done exactly that. It has done its job.\n\n  What is wrong with the Senate?\n  I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cochran. \nYes, I commend him. With his steady leadership, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has formulated and reported all of the annual \nappropriations bills. Eight of those appropriations bills have been \npassed by the Senate. Four appropriations bills are now pending in the \nSenate. This includes the Defense appropriations bill, the \nTransportation-Treasury appropriations bill, Labor-Health and Human \nServices-Education appropriations bill, and the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, which is likely to be added to the Transportation \nappropriations bill in order to conform to the House version.\n  That is where we stand today.\n  What is the problem?\n  Regrettably, the Senate Leadership has not seen fit to bring three of \nour appropriations bills to the floor. This is not the fault of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has called upon the \nleadership, as did I, to give the appropriations bills high priority in \nthe scheduling of floor time.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, the Transportation-\nTreasury appropriations bill, and the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill were approved by our Appropriations Committee over \n2 months ago. I simply do not understand why the leadership is dragging \nits feet! Why not debate legislation that will fund critical \ninvestments in our schools, in our healthcare systems, and for our \nNation's transportation infrastructure? Are Senators not going to have \nthe opportunity to debate bills that provide over $211 billion?\n  We need to debate each of these funding bills individually. We need \nto conference them individually with our House counterparts--not just \nconsider them as sub-parts of a large omnibus package. That is what I \nbelieve the chairman of the Appropriations Committee wants, and that is \nwhat I, too, would like to see happen. I urge my colleagues to work \ntoward that goal.\n  It is unfortunate that most of the regular programs of the \ndepartments and agencies of Government will limp into the new fiscal \nyear, which begins--when? this Saturday, the day after tomorrow, under \nthe terms and conditions of a very restrictive continuing resolution. \nHere we are in the midst of one of the largest natural disasters to hit \nthe United States, and only two regular appropriations bills have been \nenacted. One would think that the Congress would want to enact all of \nthe annual appropriations bills before the beginning of the fiscal year \nso that the Federal agencies can hit the road running on October 1st \nand deal with the problems confronting the American people. Instead, we \nare enacting a very restrictive stop-gap measure that merely prevents \nthe Government from shutting down. What a shame. It is very unfortunate \nthat the House majority refused to fix the problem created by the \ncontinuing resolution for the Community Services Block Grant program, \nwhich provides critical healthcare and nutrition services to the \nneediest Americans. It is very unfortunate that, as we approach winter \nwith fuel prices expected to grow dramatically, this continuing \nresolution reduces funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram.\n  In conclusion, I am disappointed that the appropriations bills have \nnot been enacted on a timely basis. Having said that, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the continuing resolution. We have no other \nchoice.\n  I urge the leadership to call up the remaining appropriations bills, \ndebate them, and send them to conference with the House. We have an \nobligation to the American people to get our work done. Debate and \ndeliberation is what the Senate is supposed to be about--debate and \ndeliberation and amending. The American people expect us to debate \nthese bills and to protect the power of the purse and, thereby, protect \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars. These matters should not be swept under \na carpet somewhere. More, not less, transparency is needed in debating \nappropriations bills. The Congress should have completed action on all \nthe appropriations bills--not just two--on all the appropriations bills \nbefore the end of the fiscal year tomorrow night. Failing that, we \nshould enact eleven individual, fiscally responsible annual \nappropriations bills before the termination of this continuing \nresolution on November 18th.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10705-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10705-S10706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF SAM VOLPENTEST\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate and pay \ntribute to the life of a great Washingtonian, a great American, and \nsomeone that I know even in the Nation's Capital will be remembered for \nhis great contributions. Yesterday, I learned of the death of Sam \nVolpentest, a resident of Washington State, who lived to be 101-year-\nold.\n  Sam has continued to play a leadership role in our State. We were all \nproud of the fact that we all attended his 100th birthday party last \nyear and that for the last several months he has continued to play a \nvital role in the State of Washington on important economic issues.\n  I am proud to say that Sam was a friend, and I am grateful for his \nmentorship and his wisdom. My thoughts are with his family and the \nlarger Tri-City community that mourn his loss. This is a man who had a \nlist of unending accomplishments and literally touched thousands of \nlives of his fellow citizens. He changed the course of history in \nWashington State and left his mark on this Nation's history, as well.\n  Sam's legacy was one of generosity, of leadership, of commitment, of \ninspiration--important lessons for Washingtonians to still benefit \nfrom.\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\n  My remarks today cannot justify the significance of his contribution. \nSam moved with his family from Seattle to the Tri-Cities in 1949 and \nwent into business as a tavern owner. The Tri-Cities was just at the \nbeginning the epicenter of the nuclear age, a sleepy little town in \nRichmond that sprung to life when the Hanford site was selected in 1943 \nas the location of the Manhattan Project, plutonium production \nactivities as part of President Roosevelt's strategy to win World War \nII. The Manhattan Project transformed the entire region from literally \nan agriculture and fishing economy centered on the Columbia River into \na Federal booming town. It changed the course of our State and Nation's \nhistory.\n  Central Washington was booming, and Sam thought it was the right \nplace for a salesman like him and his family; so he went to work right \naway on community and business issues.\n\n  It was his vision for the community that continued to push the \ncommunity and the representatives who came here to Washington and those \nin Washington, DC, to further see the future in Washington State.\n  Hanford had grown due to the Federal investment in the Manhattan \nProject and later in support of the Cold War. At that time, Sam, a \nformer salesman and tavern owner, found himself rubbing shoulders with \nthe likes of Senators Jackson and Magnuson, and stories about Sam, \nScoop, and Maggie are numerous and legendary.\n  I think this picture shows that even at that time, with my \npredecessors, Senator Warren Magnuson and Senator Scoop Jackson, Sam \nVolpentest even back then was right in the thick of things. The fact \nthat he still consulted with Senator Murray and me up until the last \nseveral months showed his dedication to what this country needed to be \nfocused on.\n  In 1956, Sam decided that Richland, WA--one of the Tri-Cities \nsurrounding Hanford--looked too much like a construction camp. That is \nbecause it was a community that literally sprang up overnight out in \nthe desert. Sam wanted that community to continue to grow.\n  The N-Reactor was one of the most critical investments in the Tri-\nCities, with Sam Volpentest's fingerprints on it. The Hanford site \nevolved as our Nation's nuclear needs changed. Sam's efforts helped \nAmerica stay in the lead during the nuclear age, put Americans to work, \nimproved the lives of those living in central Washington, and it played \nan incredible role for our country.\n  In the mid-1960s, as the nuclear age transitioned, Sam saw the \nwriting on the wall: the Tri-Cities would need to evolve with it. As \nHanford's nuclear weapons material production activities began to slow, \nSam's vision drove him to change his strategy as well.\n  I come back to a critical point I want to say. In the 1940s, as World \nWar II raged in Asia, Europe, and North Africa, my State responded to \nthe Federal Government's call. As Federal investment grew during the \nearly days of the Manhattan Project, this remote area of our State \nresponded with the energy infrastructure that was so critical in \nhelping launch the nuclear age. This world's first large-scale \nproduction nuclear reactor, the B Reactor, located in our State, played \nan incredibly vital role.\n  The reason I emphasize that is because Sam realized that once that \ngoal was achieved, the region needed to keep playing an important role \nin our national security issues, and that was through the contributions \nof its workforce and materials needed throughout our time period post-\nWorld War II.\n  Our contribution and Sam's continuing contribution was to make sure \nthe Federal investment and cleanup work at Hanford was actually \nachieved. Sam knew that the Tri-Cities had a lot to offer our Nation, \nbut he knew that the economy needed to have diversity and that cleanup \nwas part of it. So what did Sam do? He went about convincing Federal \nofficials, private investment, and other resources to come to Hanford \nand explore more efficient ways to clean up the waste, and not just at \nour site in Washington State but around the world.\n  Sam's vision led to a larger vision that has leveraged the workforce \nin the State of Washington. Those efforts led to the establishment of \none of our National Laboratories, the Pacific Northwest National Lab in \nthe Tri-Cities. Today, Federal research dollars spur research and \ndevelopment in countless scientific areas--from proteomics research, \nnuclear materials cleanup, biofuels, and many more.\n  Sam did not just want to get the work done; he wanted the workforce \nand the community to be safe. Sam worked to further the economic \ndevelopment and success of his community through a variety of \ngovernment and community organizations.\n  One of his most important projects was helping the business community \nget access to small business contracts that were being part of the \nFederal work commissioned at Hanford. Some of the most notable projects \nSam Volpentest is responsible for in the Tri-Cities in Washington State \nare a six-story Federal building in Richland, the inception of the \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory, three freeways, twin bridges \nover the Columbia River, the N-Reactor Hanford Generating Plant, the \nFast Flux Test Facility, the Life Sciences Laboratory and the \nEnvironmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, the Hanford House/Red Lion \nHotel, the Iowa Beef Processing Plant, and Sam's namesake, the \nVolpentest HAMMER Training and Education Center.\n  This training center is probably one of Sam's greatest \naccomplishments because it still today provides Hanford workers with \nreal-time training in safety and response. The training facility now \nhas trained countless first responders from governments all over our \ncountry and all over the world on how to respond to safety incidents \nfrom a more robust public participation. Sam's efficiency at this \ntraining facility gives those who are first responders the on-the-job-\ntraining they need.\n  Sam was often asked when he was going to retire--for example, whether \nit would be at age 65 or 75. He said: Why would I want to do that? \nDon't retire. Look to the future. Ask what you can do for your \ncommunity that has been so good to you. Get out there and do something. \nAnd even if you do it for free, it will make you feel great afterward.\n  That was Sam Volpentest, a great Washingtonian, a great member of our \ncountry. We will miss ``Mr. Tri-Cities,'' and we will try to live up to \nhis legacy of accomplishment and continue to bring about a good \ncooperative relationship between a key part of Washington State, the \ngreat Tri-Cities, and our Federal Government, in making sure the \nVolpentest legacy continues.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10706-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10706-S10711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDING THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thought the CR--the continuing \nresolution, as it is known around this place--was going to be laid down \ntonight. I guess it will not be laid down until tomorrow. But I will be \noffering an amendment the first thing in the morning on behalf of \nmyself and a number of other cosponsors: Mr. Kohl, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Carper, and Ms. \nCantwell. I think by tomorrow morning there are going to be a lot more \non this list.\n  It is basically a very simple amendment. All it says is:\n\n       Notwithstanding section 101 of this joint resolution, \n     amounts are provided for making payments under the \n     ``Community Services Block Grant Act'' at a rate not less \n     than the amounts made available for such Act in fiscal year \n     2005.\n\n  Well, what that means is that this amendment, then, will continue the \ncommunity services block grants at last year's level.\n  Now, you might say: Well, wait a minute. Isn't that what a continuing \nresolution does, it continues everything at last year's level?\n  Well, we have a continuing resolution the likes of which I have never \nseen. I have not seen it in the last 10 years. I have asked my staff to \ngo back 20 years or so to see if we had something like it.\n  Here is what the House has done. They have sent us a continuing \nresolution that continues funding either at last year's level or at the \nHouse budget level, whichever is lower--whichever is\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\nlower. Now, what you will find out in there is that there are cuts in \neducation, cuts to a whole lot of things. But most of those cuts do not \ntake effect until next year. Education money goes out next summer. So \nfor the continuing resolution, from now until--what?--November 18, I \nthink it is, or something like that--a couple months--they will not be \nhit. But there will be a 50-percent cut in the Community Services Block \nGrants, which means by Saturday they will be cut 50 percent--right now.\n  Now, the occupant of the Chair, a former distinguished Governor of \nVirginia, I know he knows about the community services block grants. \nThey do a lot in his State, as they do in our States: the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, housing, Head Start, transportation for \nthe elderly, job search, all kinds of things, even helping low-income \npeople apply for the earned income tax credit. There are a whole host \nof things done by Community Services Block Grants. It will be cut 50 \npercent, not next year, Saturday, Sunday. It will be a 50-percent cut \nimmediately.\n  Now, I am going to read it into the Record this evening. I am sorry I \nhave to keep the distinguished Senator in the chair for a little while \ntonight, but I think it is important for people to understand what we \nare doing here.\n  If this were just affecting programs like education next year--we are \ngoing to fix that by November, granted. But this is now. This happens \nnow. The poorest of the poor in our country are going to get hit \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday, because of the wording of that continuing \nresolution, with a 50-percent cut, including victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, children all across the country.\n\n  We just had the mayor of Baton Rouge here the other day, Kip Holden. \nHe was up here asking for more money for community services block \ngrants. When he found out from my staff what the continuing resolution \ndid in cutting it 50 percent, he couldn't believe it. He said they have \nbeen invaluable in assisting Katrina evacuees, getting things done that \nFEMA could not. He was up here pleading for more funding for community \nservices block grants. He said it was beyond belief that Congress would \nbe cutting this program at a time when it is most urgently needed. But \nthat is exactly what the Congress will do if it passes this CR.\n  Once again, we are 1 day from the end of the fiscal year. Like an \nirresponsible schoolchild, the Congress has not completed its homework. \nIt has finished 2 of the 11 appropriations bills. Why do we find \nourselves once again in this sorry state of disarray? Consider the \nLabor-Health and Human Services appropriations bill, which is the bill \nthat funds community services block grants. Under the very capable \nleadership of our distinguished chairman, Senator Arlen Specter, our \nsubcommittee did its job in a timely, orderly manner. We passed the \nSenate Labor-Health and Human Services-Education appropriations bill \n2\\1/2\\ months ago, July 14. But once it left our committee, it seemed \nto disappear into a black hole. It hasn't been brought up on the floor. \nIt is not even scheduled to be brought up on the floor. This is the \nbill that funds the community services block grants.\n  We didn't cut it. It was bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats on the \nsubcommittee and on the full Committee on Appropriations voted to \ncontinue the funding for community services block grants at last year's \nlevel. Here we are, 1 day away from yet another end-of-fiscal-year \ntrain wreck.\n  Like actual train wrecks, this one will have real human casualties \nand victims, real hardship. This has not been done before. I know no \none is here. There are no more votes tonight. Senators have all gone \nhome. But I will be back on this floor tomorrow. We get 30 minutes \ntomorrow morning, 30 minutes to do something to protect the poorest of \nthe poor, those who have no one to fight for them, those who rely upon \nour community service agencies out there to help them get through a \ntough time, to provide the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance \nProgram. Even in Virginia, as well as Iowa, up in the northern part of \nthe country, cold weather is starting to set in. It is in the 30s at \nnight. Pretty soon it will get down to freezing, in October and \nNovember. We are going to need to get LIHEAP money out to these people. \nHow are we going to do it when we have cut funding 50 percent? We are \nnot supposed to speak about the other body here, but what could have \nbeen on their minds in doing something like this?\n  Now we are going to bring this up tomorrow. I assume the leadership \nis going to want us to rubberstamp it, a continuing resolution that \nwill mandate drastic cuts to these vital services for the poorest of \nthe poor, rubberstamp it, get it out of here, 30 minutes of debate \ntomorrow. We will talk about it. We will rubberstamp it, and we will \nget on our planes and go home. We are comfortable. We are going to be \nable to afford heat. We will be able to afford food for our families. \nWe don't have anything to worry about. We make a lot of money around \nhere. Eighty percent of this place is filled with millionaires. That is \nfine. We are comfortable.\n  Think about those who are not so comfortable. We are going to see \ndevastating cuts. I mentioned serving victims of Hurricane Katrina. One \nhundred seventy-one thousand people, estimated not by me but by those \ninvolved with the evacuees, 171,000 people are being served under the \ncommunity services block grants right now. It is 50 percent, this \nweekend--not next year, now--a 50-percent cut now. I don't know if \npeople understand this. Poor people are going to suffer.\n  For the record, in fiscal year 2005, the CSBG was funded at $637 \nmillion, $636.6 million, to be accurate. The House provided $320 \nmillion for next year. Therefore, under this continuing resolution, \nwhich says you either take last year's level or the House level, \nwhichever is less, that is what you do. Well, the House level is $320 \nmillion, a 50-percent cut.\n  I have a chart that shows the funding levels for community services \nblock grants. In each of the last 3 years, it has been cut. The last \ntime it was raised was in the fiscal year from 2001 to 2002 to $650 \nmillion. Ever since then, in fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005, it was \ncut from 650 to 645 to 642 to 636.6. Now they want to cut it in half. \nWhat is interesting about this chart is they want to cut it to 320 \nmillion. That is the level it was at in 1986. That is how much we \nprovided in 1986 for the community services block grants.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT APPROPRIATIONS HISTORY\n                              [In millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFY 2005........................................................   $636.6\nFY 2004........................................................    642.0\nFY 2003........................................................    645.8\nFY 2002........................................................    650.0\nFY 2001........................................................    600.0\nFY 2000........................................................    527.7\nFY 1999........................................................    500.0\nFY 1998........................................................    489.7\nFY 1997........................................................    489.6\nFY 1996........................................................    389.6\nFY 1995........................................................    389.6\nFY 1994........................................................    385.5\nFY 1993........................................................    372.0\nFY 1992........................................................    360.0\nFY 1991........................................................    349.4\nFY 1990........................................................    323.0\nFY 1989........................................................    318.6\nFY 1988........................................................    325.5\nFY 1987........................................................    335.0\nFY 1986........................................................    320.6\nFY 1985........................................................    335.0\nFY 1984........................................................    316.8\nFY 1983........................................................    341.7\nFY 1981........................................................    394.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. We are saying to the poorest in our country: We are going \nto take you back to 1986.\n  I have a modest proposal. Why don't we take our Tax Code and move it \nback to 1986? Whatever people were paying in taxes, we will move \neverything back to then. How would the most comfortable in our society, \nthe wealthiest, the richest, like that? I rather doubt that that would \nbe something you would ever accomplish around here. Yet for the poorest \npeople in our country, we can take them back to 1986.\n  I have been here 30 years. I have never seen anything like this: \n170,000 victims of Hurricane Katrina; in Texas, 72,000 evacuees have \nbeen served by this program; in Louisiana, more than 43,000 hurricane \nvictims. Almost all the community action agencies in the impacted area \nwere up and running by the second day after the storm. They were \nfinding shelter, feeding people, clothing people, getting them medical \nattention. Now they are helping victims find employment. Community \naction agencies have been actively working with faith-based \norganizations all across the gulf coast to provide relief\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\nservices. I mentioned what the mayor of Baton Rouge said. He was up \nhere wanting to get more money for community services block grants. \nWhat does he get hit in the face with? Not only are you not getting \nmore, they are cutting you in half. He couldn't believe it.\n  Nationwide, this cut would eliminate or disrupt essential services \nfor some 6.5 million low-income people, including nearly 2 million \nchildren. A majority of rural outreach centers will be closed, denying \nentire rural communities access to services. Many of the one-stop \nneighborhood centers in suburban and urban areas would also be shut \ndown.\n  Here is a chart that gives you an idea of what this 50-percent cut \nmeans. I mentioned 6.5 million people, 2 million kids. Communities will \nlose 21 million CSBG-supported volunteers. These are the volunteers the \nCSBG people pull together to do things. These are volunteers who want \nto, for example, volunteer their time to drive some elderly, low-income \npeople to a community health center. These are good people, many of \nthem church based, who volunteer their time to drive people to a meal \nsite for a senior citizen meal. They volunteer their time to take low-\nincome kids to a Head Start Program, for example. They are volunteers \ndoing good things, but they need someone to pull it together, organize \nit, manage it, and get the transportation. That is what CSBG does. So \nwe are going to cut it by 50 percent.\n  These volunteers are going to say: I would like to volunteer my time \nto drive these elderly, but you don't have any vehicle for me. Who is \nsetting up the time? Who is making sure they are going to be there when \nI get there? No one. As a result, we are going to lose all these \nwonderful volunteers.\n  Private food banks all over the Nation rely on space, refrigerators, \nand transportation supported by CSBG. Think about all of the food banks \nall over America that are already being stressed to the limit. They are \nsupported by the community services block grants. Now we are going to \ncut them in half. What happens to the space, what happens to the \nrefrigerators, the transportation? Several million Americans will lose \nnutritional services and emergency food--not next year; this is not \nprospective. This is next week. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram is administered by CSBG. This cut will reduce staff in half, \nwhile home heating costs are expected to rise 50 to 70 percent. Cold \nweather is coming. Heating costs are going up. Cut CSBG.\n  That is something we can be proud of right? We can be proud of what \nwe are doing here. What a shame.\n  These cuts are callous, ill advised, and they are cruel. This is \ncruel. I have no other way to say it. They are cruel. It couldn't come \nat a worse time. We know the rate of poverty is going up. Winter is \ncoming on. We have had a couple of disasters, Rita and Katrina. What we \nare saying is, guess what, we are going to pull the rug out from \nunderneath you. We are going to hurt you a little bit more. Maybe the \nHouse didn't know what they were doing. Maybe they didn't know this was \nin there. I don't know. What my amendment does is, it simply continues \nthe level at last year's level. It ought to be increased by all rights. \nWe know the number of Americans living in poverty has increased in each \nof the last 4 years. The purchasing power of community services block \ngrants continues to decline. Each year, about 1 million more people \nqualify for community services block grant services. There is not any \nmoney to meet their needs right now. As bad as this is, the picture I \nam painting, right now community service agencies provide services to \nonly 1 in 5 people in poverty; with $636 million, 1 in 5 are served. \nNow we are going to take that down even more.\n  I don't understand why the majority party in this Congress again and \nagain proposes to slash programs from those who have the least in our \nsociety while adamantly insisting that tax cuts for the most fortunate \nare untouchable and sacrosanct. We can't touch them.\n  We all recognize that after 4 years of tax cuts, war and emergency \nspending, budget deficits are out of control. We all know this must be \naddressed, including with appropriate spending cuts. But what I don't \nunderstand is why we are asking the poor to bear the lion's share of \nthe burden when it comes cutting the funding. Why are they on the front \nline? Why are they being cut this weekend? I object to repeated efforts \nby the majority party in this Congress to try to balance the budget on \nthe backs of the poor. Even before Katrina struck, the majority party \nwas already planning to slash food stamps by $3 billion and Medicaid by \n$10 billion. Katrina stopped that.\n\n  But who is the target of spending cuts? The poor, those who rely on \nFederal programs for health, education, disability, and veterans \nbenefits.\n  Last week, a group of House Republicans launched what they call \nOperation Offset. They insist that all of the tax cuts of the last 4 \nyears are off limits and untouchable, including the huge tax cuts for \nthe most privileged and wealthy people in our society. Instead, \nOperation Offset would pay for Katrina recovery by slashing programs \nfor the least fortunate among us, including deep cuts in Medicare, cuts \nin Medicaid, cuts to the School Lunch Program, cuts to the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, cuts in college aid, needy students, and on \nand on.\n  In short, with the leadership in this Congress, tax reductions for \nthe rich are sacred and cannot be touched, while programs for the poor \nare fair game for deep cuts. I object. I object to this. I believe the \nclear majority of Americans reject this approach also. It offends their \nsense of fairness and equity.\n  This has to stop, and this is the place to stop it on this continuing \nresolution. We have to stop this one. This is so unconscionable. I \ndon't know how anyone could ever feel good about this or feel we have \ndone our job.\n  It is unconscionable, it is drastic, and it is cruel to cut the \ncommunity services block grants in this manner.\n  I know what people are going to say tomorrow. They are going to come \nout here and say: Well, the House passed the continuing resolution and \nthey have gone home. If my amendment is adopted, why, it has to go back \nto the House and they went home, and we will be accused of shutting \ndown the Government.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry. The House of Representatives can come back \non Palm Sunday. On Palm Sunday, they can come back to vote on the Terri \nSchiavo situation. Regardless of what you think about it, right or \nwrong, I am saying, if they can call the House back for that, if they \ncan do that, they can call the House back to protect the poorest in our \nsociety from the cuts in the CSBG. We can pass it in the Senate, call \nthe House back, and they can vote on it. We would not be shutting the \nGovernment down. If the House does not want to come back, they will be \nshutting the Government down. We are supposed to put a knife in the \nbacks of the poorest in our country because the House did this? They \ncan come back. We ought to force them to come back. We ought to force \nthem to do what is right.\n  It is up to us in this body to have the correct response. We have to \nseize this opportunity and correct the misplaced priorities of the last \n5 years and correct this one.\n  Last week, September 15, President Bush in New Orleans said:\n\n       We have a duty to confront poverty with bold action.\n\n  Let me repeat that. You may not have gotten it the first time. \nPresident Bush said on September 15:\n\n       We have a duty to confront poverty with bold action.\n\n  OK, so what we are going to do is pass a continuing resolution that \ncuts community services block grants by 50 percent--starting this \nweekend--that service the poor in our country. They are going to cut it \nby 50 percent. I guess that is pretty bold action. I guess they are \ngoing to confront poverty with bold action; yes, they are going to make \nmore poor people. We have a duty to confront poverty with bold action.\n  I wonder if the President knows this. I wonder if anyone around the \nPresident has told him what the House did. I wonder if he is saying: \nYes, that is the thing to do. Is the President okaying this? Has he \nsent word to the House that this is perfectly fine with him, that this \ncomports with what he said last week?\n  I would like to hear from the President on this one. I would like to \nhear if he supports cutting community services block grants by 50 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\n  I would like to quote from a letter I recently received from a number \nof faith-based groups urging Congress to drop plans on the budget \nreconciliation to cut CSBG. I want to talk about it because it is \nappropriate to this. The group said the budget:\n\n     continues to ask our Nation's working poor to pay the cost of \n     a prosperity in which they may never share. It is clear that \n     programs, such as Medicaid and the Food Stamp Program that \n     are slated for cuts by Congress, will, in fact, have greater \n     burdens placed on them as a result of Hurricane Katrina. \n     These programs represent the deep and abiding commitment of \n     the Nation to care for the least among us.\n\n  I could not have said it better. As we look for ways to assist the \nleast among us, we should not hesitate to ask the most among us to help \nshare some of the burden. We need to restore this funding.\n  I said I was going to give an example of who is hit by this. I have \ntwo other letters. One is from Ozark Action, West Plains, MO; Ozark \nCommunity Action Partnership:\n\n       The result of a Continuing Resolution as proposed, which \n     would be the reduction of CSBG funds by 50 percent, Ozarks \n     Action, Inc., located in rural southern Missouri (Douglas, \n     Howell, Ozark, Oregon, Texas and Wright counties), would be \n     faced with reducing its current staffing levels by 50 \n     percent. As a result many of the services to low-income \n     families would become unattainable.\n       Currently we have staff located in 10 communities on a full \n     time basis in each of these six counties. The reduction would \n     mean that 5 [full time employees] would be reduced. The issue \n     then becomes which of the six counties no longer will be \n     served or will have significantly reduced services.\n       In addition to serving the resident low-income population \n     in this high poverty service area, these ten staff carry out \n     the function of providing services to those individuals that \n     have come to the area as a result of the two devastating \n     hurricanes (Rita and Katrina). . . .\n       CSBG staff also conducts LIHEAP services for both the \n     Energy Assistance program as well as providing the emergency \n     energy services.\n\n  I did not mention that. Sometimes low-income people, especially \nelderly, get caught with the first or second cold snap. They have not \nthought ahead, and maybe they don't have enough oil in the tank. They \nneed some help right away. They don't have credit, and they don't have \nmoney. The community services block grants provide for that, to get \nthem enough fuel oil, heating oil--whatever it might be--to get them \nthrough that snap. They say:\n\n       This in and of itself will put a large burden on the State \n     to provide adequate service to those in need of energy \n     assistance.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Ozark \nAction, Inc., be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                           Ozark Action, Inc.,\n\n                                                  West Plains, MO.\n       The result of a Continuing Resolution as proposed, which \n     would be the reduction of CSBG funds by 50%, Ozarks Action, \n     Inc., located in rural Southern Missouri (Douglas, Howell, \n     Ozark, Oregon, Texas and Wright counties), would be faced \n     with reducing its current staffing levels by 50%. As a result \n     many of the services to low-income families would be \n     unattainable.\n       Currently we have staff located in 10 communities on a full \n     time basis in these six counties. The reduction would mean \n     that about 5 fte's would be reduced. The issue then becomes \n     which of the six counties no longer will be served or will \n     have significantly reduced services.\n       In addition to serving the resident low-income population \n     in this high poverty service area, these ten staff carry out \n     the function of providing services to those individuals that \n     have come to the area as a result of the two devastating \n     Hurricanes (Rita and Katrina). In Howell County, which has \n     seen approximately 15 to 20 evacuee families, Ozark Action is \n     operating as the clearing house and information hub for needs \n     and services. This service would no longer be available with \n     such steep reductions as a result of staff cost. Just in this \n     past five days we have had three additional families move to \n     the area and we believe that as families decided to move \n     further north after deciding that returning home will not be \n     an option or limited option in the future, we will see \n     another wave of individuals moving to the area.\n       CSBG staff also conducts LIHEAP services for both the \n     Energy Assistance program as well as providing the emergency \n     energy services. This in and of itself will put a large \n     burden on the state to provide adequate service and coverage \n     for those in need of energy assistance.\n       Additionally, one of the remaining staff conducts Earn \n     Income Tax credit returns from the period of January 1 \n     through April 30th. This would have a major impact on those \n     who receive EITC and will reduce the available income that \n     these individuals receive through the EITC program.\n       CSBG Funds are used also, in a variety of ways, to support \n     other agency programs where their own funding is inadequate. \n     All such support would of necessity cease.\n           Sincerely;\n                                                     Bryan Adcock,\n                                          Executive Director, OAI.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have another letter from East Missouri \nAction, again outlining what is going to happen here:\n\n       In the event that a continuing resolution is passed which \n     would effectively fund CSBG at the FY-06 House appropriations \n     level--\n\nA cut of 50 percent--\n\n     serious cuts in services provided to low-income families in \n     Southwest Missouri would occur. . . .\n       In-home visits will no longer be a priority. This will \n     require more volunteers for clients who are home bound. Other \n     catalytic activities such as life skills training workshops \n     will be scaled back if not totally eliminated.\n       [East Missouri Action Agency] serves as the point of \n     service for most other helping organizations in seven of our \n     eight counties. . . . Families will be referred to other \n     helping agency with little or no follow-up . . . we will not \n     have the staff to effectively work with them.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the East Missouri \nAction Agency also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   EAST MISSOURI ACTION AGENCY, INC.\n\n  Bollinger, Cape Girardeau, Iron, Madison, Perry, St. Francois, Ste. \n                    Genevieve, & Washington Counties\n\n\n      impact of continuing resolution at house fy06 funding level\n\n       In the event that a continuing resolution is passed which \n     would effectively fund CSBG at the FY-06 House appropriations \n     level, serious cuts in services currently provided to low-\n     income families of Southeast Missouri would occur.\n       1. Working with families and individuals in one-on-one case \n     management fashion to help them achieve self-sufficiency and \n     providing projects to assist them in this effort will have to \n     be eliminated. The remaining resources will have to be \n     expended doing only emergency services.\n       2. EMAA serves as the point of service for most other \n     helping organizations in seven of our eight counties. EMAA \n     serves as the clearinghouse and screener for emergency \n     services throughout the county. There will be no time for \n     discussion of the underlying causes of the emergency \n     situation with these families. Families will be referred to \n     the other helping agency with little or no follow-up. \n     Partnerships with these other organizations will be in \n     jeopardy because we will not have the staff to effectively \n     work with them.\n       3. As just recently seen with Hurricane Katrina, EMAA was \n     one of hundreds of CAAs which mobilized relief efforts even \n     before several of the national charitable organizations and \n     the Federal Government itself mobilized. CAAs have always had \n     the flexibility to rise to the need in these situations, \n     however, with this cut, that ability is gone.\n       4. Community Change projects such as, resource development, \n     poverty awareness & education, housing development, community \n     gardening, emergency service coordination networks, \n     leadership development, childcare development, and other \n     projects to improve the community at large will be greatly \n     scaled back due to the lack of funding.\n       5. In-home visits will no longer be a priority. This will \n     require more volunteers for clients who are home bound. Other \n     catalytic activities such as life skills training workshops \n     will be scaled back if not totally eliminated. If we do not \n     receive a special grant for income tax assistance, we may \n     have to discontinue the VITA income tax assistance project \n     which leveraged $1.4 million in our eight county area for \n     2004. If we do not provide this free income tax assistance \n     for the low income families in Southeast Missouri, for-profit \n     vendors will, which will reduce the benefit to the families \n     even more.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, people say, What do community services \nblock grants do? Here are some of their activities: Parenting education \nto 175,000 Head Start families, helping people be good parents; \ntransportation for elderly Americans to medical appointments, which I \nmentioned earlier, such as the community health centers; home ownership \ncounseling for the low income, how they might be able to afford and pay \nfor their own home; mentoring and counseling for at-risk youth; in-home \nchore services for homebound elderly. Think about that. Domestic \nviolence services. I mentioned refrigerators and transportation \nservices for food banks; transitional housing for homeless families. \nYou wonder what happens to homeless families? Community service action \nagencies find them transitional housing and especially now with winter \ncoming on. Lead inspection programs,\n\n[[Page S10710]]\n\nscreening homes for lead-based paint, and we know how devastating that \nis on low-income children. Food stamp outreach, going out to make sure \nlow-income people know they are eligible for food stamps, that they do \nnot have to go hungry.\n  Community services block grant networks, let me talk about who these \npeople are. Their local networks were made up of 1,090 local eligible \nentities, of which 88 percent were Community Action Agencies.\n  The local agencies use CSBG funding for their core operations \ndeveloping and for developing and coordinating programs to fight \npoverty in 99 percent of the counties in the United States.\n  Who are the participants? Who are served? Twenty-two percent of all \npersons in poverty--I said about 1 out of 5; we are going to make it \neven lower than that--more than 15 million individuals who were members \nof almost 6 million low-income families.\n  Data provided by 4 million families show that more than 2.7 million \nhad incomes at or below the poverty guideline. Think about this. Of \nthese, 1.1 million families were ``severely poor'' with incomes below \n50 percent of the poverty guideline. That means for a family of 4, we \nare talking about less than $7,000, probably $7,500 a year; 1.1 million \nfamilies with less than $7,000 a year. That is who is being served by \nthe community services block grant.\n  Another 1.6 million families had incomes between 50 percent and 100 \npercent of the poverty guideline; almost 1.7 million working poor \nfamilies who relied on wages or unemployment insurance and collectively \nmade up 44 percent of all program participants; nearly 430,000 families \nwere TANF, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families; twenty-two percent \nof TANF monthly caseloads are CSBG clients; and about 1.4 million \nfamilies are headed by single mothers.\n  These program serve more than 3.7 million children in poverty, 1.8 \nmillion adults who had never completed high school, 1.1 million people \nwho were disabled, 3 million who lack health care.\n  That is who is served. I just mentioned all the programs that serve \nthese people.\n  In my own State of Iowa, northwest Iowa, northeast Iowa, southwest \nIowa, they are talking about how much they are going to have to cut \nback. In a five-county area in northwest Iowa, services at seven \noutreach centers which assist over 10,000 each year, have been scaled \nback. This is a 50-percent cut. This is not phony stuff. This is real. \nIn a seven-county area in northeast Iowa, the Community Action Agencies \nalready had to reduce office and staff hours in eight family service \noffices due to reductions in CSBG funding over the last 2 years. With a \n50-percent reduction in CSBG, the family services staff will likely be \nreduced from 16 full and part-time individuals to 7 individuals \nemployed less than 40 hours a week. That is to serve a seven-county \narea in northeast Iowa.\n  In Iowa, this is the time of the year temperatures are starting to \ndrop and food supplies are running short as gardens stop producing. I \nthink I just picked the last tomato off my tomato plant last week.\n  Without staff to take and process applications and provide \nassistance, the LIHEAP program year starts October 1. That is what, \nSaturday? That is Saturday. The LIHEAP program year starts October 1, \nSaturday.\n  In northeast Iowa, the CAA there faces an inability to ensure that \nthose in poverty will continue to receive home heating assistance and \nfood assistance. If CSBG is reduced--this is southeast Iowa--by 50 \npercent, the agency will have to reduce staff and close one very rural \noutreach center. That will mean clients who need emergency assistance \nfor food, utilities, disconnect notices would have to drive about 45 \nmiles to apply for assistance. These are people who probably do not \neven have transportation. They do not own cars.\n  The centers--I am reading here from the report--are terribly busy \nwith the increase in the number of families coming to the outreach \ncenters because they have been evicted, about to become homeless, have \na disconnect notice from their utilities or their utilities have \nalready been disconnected.\n  President Bush, September 15, 2005:\n\n       We have a duty to confront poverty with bold action.\n\n  I hope someone in the bowels of the White House is listening to a \nlittle bit of my remarks. They do not have to buy it all. I hope they \nlisten to a little bit of it. I hope that something will click up in \none of those heads in the White House and say: Wait a minute. Is Harkin \nright? Could this possibly be happening? He must be wrong. He is just \nup there doing his thing. But just in case, we better check on it. I \nhope somebody at the White House is saying, maybe we ought to check on \nthis.\n  When they check, they will find out I am right. What the House has \nsent us will cut it 50 percent starting Saturday, and it will have \nthese effects. One may say, Oh, no, it will not, but it will.\n  That is why I have not come out on the floor to bemoan the CR for the \ncuts in education because we are going to fix that. The money for \neducation does not go out until next summer. We have time to take care \nof that. The other cuts that are in the CR, we can take care of that. I \nwould not go on like this if it was just education because we are going \nto have time to fix it later on. That is not what I am talking about. I \nam talking about something that is right now, needs the money now, the \nmoney goes out now, not next year--now, October 1. October 1, they will \nbe cut 50 percent just like that. There is no carryover money. There is \nnot a lot of money sitting someplace that they can carry over.\n  We have already cut this program, as I said, in each of the last 3 \nyears. This Senate--well, I should say the Appropriations Committee, I \ncannot say the Senate, the Appropriations Committee passed it at last \nyear's level, bipartisan, Republicans and Democrats.\n  I hope someone in the White House may have picked up on this. I hope \nthey are going to check it, and I hope one of them will say: We cannot \nleave our boss hanging out there. Our boss said this and our boss meant \nit.\n  I believe he did mean it. But he probably does not know.\n  The President is busy. I am not faulting him for that. He probably \ndoes not know what the House did.\n  I would like to believe that if this person in the White House who \nmay have listened to this or picked up on it and checked out and found \nout that that is exactly what the CR does, the continuing resolution \ndoes, they will get to someone higher up the food chain to get to the \nPresident to let him know about this, and maybe the President will get \non the phone and he will call the leadership and say: You have to do \nthis. You have to adopt this amendment. You cannot leave me hanging out \nthere having said this and then turn around and expect me to sign a \ncontinuing resolution that cuts the poorest of the poor.\n  That is what we would be saying. He said that last week. Now he is \ngoing to get something and he has to sign it. I would hope the \nPresident might get on the phone or at least have his Chief of Staff or \nsomebody do it and tell them we have to fix this. If it means the House \nof Representatives comes back on Friday afternoon or Friday evening or \nSaturday morning to fix it, so be it.\n  So they are going to be a little uncomfortable--oh, my goodness. I \nassume some Congressmen have probably gotten on a plane, and they went \nsomeplace, they have gone home. My goodness, they will have to get on \nan airplane--not at their expense. The Government will pay for it. They \ndo not have to pay anything for it. They have to go to an airport, get \non an airplane, fly back to Washington, put on a suit and tie and go \nback to the House floor and correct this. I know it is a terrible \nburden. It is a terrible thing to ask of someone making $160,000 a \nyear, or whatever we make around here now.\n  Well, I jest, tongue in cheek. It is not too much to ask. They should \ndo it, and the President should tell them to do it. Come back here and \nfix this. Do not leave him hanging out there having said that last \nweek.\n  Heaven forbid that we should have the House come back and work on a \nFriday. My, my, work on a Friday? Whoever heard of such a thing? The \nworking poor work on Friday. Or maybe they have to come back Saturday \nand fix it, Saturday morning or Friday night. Poor people work at \nnight. They are working two jobs.\n  No, I am sorry, I do not mind making Members of the House \nuncomfortable if they have to get on a plane or come back to the House \nand fix this. That is a small price to pay to make sure that\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\nwe live up to what the President said a week ago. This is not even bold \naction. This is continuing to do what we have been doing in the last \nyear. It is not too much to ask. It is time that we made the \ncomfortable a little bit uncomfortable so we can give some comfort to \nthose who are uncomfortable.\n  We will be voting on this tomorrow. I hope that Senators will not be \nswayed by this, ``Well, we cannot do this because the House has gone \nhome.'' Well, let us comfort the uncomfortable. Let us tell the poorest \nof the poor we are not going to leave them in the lurch, we are not \ngoing to cut them by 50 percent, and let us have them come back and fix \nthis tomorrow night. They can do it.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the occupant of the chair for allowing \nme to talk about my amendment because I will not have much time in the \nmorning. I only have 30 minutes. Some other people may want to talk. I \nknow no one is here. I hope some people may be watching and taking heed \nof this. I will be back tomorrow morning, in a more succinct manner, \nobviously, to lay out this case on why we have to adopt an amendment to \nkeep the community services block grants at last year's level.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, has come to the floor to offer an amendment \nthat makes reference to the community services block grant funding and \nthe possibility that if we pass a continuing resolution without \nadequately funding this program, communities all across America will be \ndenied some basic funds they need.\n  I have made a point, as I travel around my State of Illinois, of \nasking village presidents and mayors and leaders how this money is \nused. It turns out to be money that is essential for many programs. It \nis one of the most unusual programs in that there is such a wide \nvariety of things that are done with these dollars by communities, from \nafterschool programs for children at risk to programs for senior \ncitizens that are essential for their well-being.\n  I am sorry I wasn't here earlier to join with Senator Harkin, but I \ncome to the floor in support of his effort. America can do better. We \ncan make certain that we fund these essential programs so that the \nvulnerable across America are not left behind. If we focus on this, as \nwe should have before Hurricane Katrina--and we will in the future--it \nis going to be a stronger nation.\n  I want to make sure my voice is added to that of Senator Harkin in \nsupport of this valuable program.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week the Washington Post \nreported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was making plans \nto ``reimburse churches and other organizations that have opened their \ndoors to provide shelter, food and supplies to survivors of hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.''\n  I understand FEMA's good intentions here, but we need to be very \ncareful. There may be extraordinary circumstances when FEMA may need to \nrent buildings that might happen to belong to a church or mosque or \nsynagogue. And I understand that under both Presidents George W. Bush \nand Bill Clinton, there have been appropriate ways to provide \ncharitable choice and to fund faith-based organizations. I support \nthat. I am currently working with Senators on both sides of the aisle \non our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on legislation \nto help all of Katrina's 372,000 displaced schoolchildren, including \nsome who are enrolled in private and even religious schools. But the \nkind of reimbursement described in the Washington Post article makes me \nwant to waive three yellow flags and two red ones.\n  One obvious concern is constitutional. The first amendment says that \n``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' Paying churches for work \nthey choose to undertake as churches raises obvious questions. That is \nnot my major concern. My major concern is making sure that we honor \nwhat it has always meant in America to be a volunteer, to be \ncharitable, and to respect our religious traditions.\n  When Jesus fed the loaves and the fishes to the multitude of 5,000, \nhe didn't send the bill to Caesar. As Americans with a strong religious \ntradition, we believe in helping our neighbors. In the book of Mark, \nJesus tells us to ``love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with \nall thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength'' and to \n``love their neighbor as thyself.'' This idea of loving and caring for \nour neighbors is not limited to Christianity. Jesus himself drew the \ncommands to love God and love our neighbor from the Old Testament in \nDeuteronomy and Leviticus. I don't ever remember reading: ``Love God, \nlove your neighbor, and send the bill to Washington for the expenses.''\n  From pioneer days, volunteering and helping our neighbors has been an \nessential part of the American character. No other country in the world \nhas anything similar to what we have in their traditions. They do not \ngive as we give. They do not have that same spirit. It is one of the \nthings that makes this a unique country. Our forefathers would be \ndumbfounded to think that if a neighbor's barn burned down and the \ncommunity joined together to rebuild it, that they would expect a check \nfrom Washington, DC to pay them back.\n  In that same Washington Post article, Reverend Robert E. Reccord of \nthe Southern Baptist Convention helped put this in balance when he \nsaid:\n\n       Volunteer labor is just that: volunteer. We would never ask \n     the government to pay for it.\n\n  At my church in Nashville, Westminster Presbyterian, where I am an \nelder, we took up a collection for the victims of Katrina and raised \nabout $80,000 in cash. We then filled up the parlor in the church with \nother things that we were told they needed in southern Mississippi. We \nloaded up a truck with diapers and Clorox and other necessities, and \nour associate pastor went down there with that truck for a few weeks to \nhelp people in need. Are we now supposed to send the Federal Government \na bill for the food and the supplies and three weeks of the pastor's \nsalary? Of course not. No one in our church expects that, nor should \nthey.\n  So churches and synagogues and mosques and religious organizations \nthat are being good neighbors aren't looking for a Government handout. \nThey are looking to lend a hand. We should respect them. We should \nthank them. We should honor them. They are performing an invaluable \nservice. We encourage them by providing tax incentives for charitable \ngiving. But we should also remember that virtue is often its own reward \nand that some rewards are in heaven, and we should be very careful \nbefore we start reimbursing churches for their charity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Washington Post to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 27, 2005]\n\n  FEMA Plans To Reimburse Faith Groups for Aid--As Civil Libertarians \n         Object, Religious Organizations Weigh Whether To Apply\n\n              (By Alan Cooperman and Elizabeth Williamson)\n\n       After weeks of prodding by Republican lawmakers and the \n     American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     said yesterday that it will use taxpayer money to reimburse \n     churches and other religious organizations that have opened \n     their doors to provide shelter, food and supplies to \n     survivors of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n       FEMA officials said it would mark the first time that the \n     government has made large-scale payments to religious groups \n     for helping to cope with a domestic natural disaster.\n       ``I believe it's appropriate for the federal government to \n     assist the faith community because of the scale and scope of \n     the effort of how long it's lasting,'' said Joe Becker, \n     senior vice president for preparedness and response with the \n     Red Cross.\n       Civil liberties groups called the decision a violation of \n     the traditional boundary between church and state, accusing \n     FEMA of trying to restore its battered reputation by playing \n     to religious conservatives.\n       ``What really frosts me about all this is, here is an \n     administration that didn't do its job and now is trying to \n     dig itself out by making right-wing groups happy,'' said the \n     Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United \n     for Separation of Church and State.\n       FEMA officials said religious organizations would be \n     eligible for payments only if they operated emergency \n     shelters, food distribution centers for medical facilities at \n     the request of state or local governments in the three states \n     that have declared emergencies--Louisiana, Mississippi and \n     Alabama. In those cases, ``a wide range of costs would be \n     available for reimbursement, including labor costs incurred \n     in excess of normal operations, rent for the facility and \n     delivery of essential needs like food and water,'' FEMA \n     spokesman Eugene Kinerney said in an e-mail.\n       For churches, synagogues and mosques that have taken in \n     hurricane survivors, FEMA's decision presents a quandary. \n     Some said they were eager to get the money and had begun \n     tallying their costs, from electric bills to worn carpets. \n     Others said they probably would not apply for the funds, \n     fearing donations would dry up if the public came to believe \n     they were receiving government handouts.\n       ``Volunteer labor is just that: volunteer,'' said the Rev. \n     Robert E. Reccord, president of the Southern Baptist \n     Convention's North American Mission Board. ``We would never \n     ask the government to pay for it.''\n       When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf \n     Coast, religious charities rushed in to provide emergency \n     services, often acting more quickly and efficiently than the \n     government. Relief workers in the stricken states estimate \n     that 500,000 people have taken refuge in facilities run by \n     religious groups.\n       In the days after the disaster, house Majority Leader Tom \n     DeLay (R-Tex.) and other Republicans complained that FEMA \n     seemed reluctant to pay church groups. ``There are tons of \n     questions about what is reimbursable, what is not \n     reimbursable,'' DeLay said Sept. 13, noting that Houston \n     alone had ``500 or 600 churches that took in evacuees, and \n     they would get no reimbursement.''\n       Becker said he and his staff at the Red Cross also urged \n     FEMA to allow reimbursement of religious groups. Ordinarily, \n     Becker said, churches provide shelter for the first days \n     after a disaster, then the Red Cross takes over. But in a \n     storm season that has stretched every Red Cross shelter to \n     the breaking point, church buildings must for the first time \n     house evacuees indefinitely.\n       Even so, Lynn, of Americans United for Separation of Church \n     and State, said that federal reimbursement is inappropriate.\n       ``The good news is that this work is being done now, but I \n     don't think a lot of people realize that a lot of these \n     organizations are actively working to obtain federal funds. \n     That's a strange definition of charity,'' he said.\n       Lynn added that he accepts the need for the government to \n     coordinate with religious groups in a major disaster, but not \n     to ``pay for their good works.''\n       ``We've never complained about using a religious \n     organization as a distribution point for food or clothing or \n     anything else,'' Lynn said. But ``direct cash reimbursements \n     would be unprecedented.''\n       FEMA outlined the policy in a Sept. 9 internal memorandum \n     on ``Eligible Costs for Emergency Sheltering Declarations.'' \n     Religious groups, like secular nonprofit groups, will have to \n     document their costs and file for reimbursement from state \n     and local emergency management agencies, which in turn will \n     seek funds from FEMA.\n       David Fukitomi, infrastructure coordinator for FEMA in \n     Louisiana, said that the organization has begun briefings for \n     potential applicants in the disaster area but that it is too \n     early to know how many will take advantage of the program.\n       ``The need was so overwhelming that the faith-based groups \n     stepped up, and we're trying to find a way to help them \n     shoulder some of the burden for doing the right thing,'' he \n     said, adding that ``the churches are interested'' but that \n     ``part of our effort is getting the local governments to be \n     interested in being their sponsor.''\n       A spokeswoman for the Salvation Amy said it has been in \n     talks with state and federal officials about reimbursement \n     for the 76,000 nights of shelter it has provided to Katrina \n     survivors so far. But it is still unclear whether the \n     Salvation Army will qualify, she said.\n       The Rev. Flip Benham, director of Operation Save America, \n     an antiabortion group formerly known as Operation Rescue, \n     said, ``Separation of church and state means nothing in time \n     of disaster; you see immediately what a farce it is.''\n       Benham said that his group has been dispensing food and \n     clothing and that ``Bibles and tracts go out with everything \n     we put out.'' In Mendenhall, Miss., he said, he preached to \n     evacuees while the mayor directed traffic and the sheriff put \n     inmates from the county jail to work handing out supplies.\n       Yet Benham said he would never accept a dime from the \n     federal government. ``The people have been so generous to \n     give that for us to ask for reimbursement would be like \n     gouging for gas,'' he said. ``That would be a crime against \n     heaven.''\n       For some individual churches, however, reimbursement is \n     very appealing. At Christus Victor Lutheran Church in Ocean \n     Springs, Miss., as many as 200 evacuees and volunteer workers \n     have been sleeping each night in the sanctuary and Sunday \n     School classrooms. The church's entrance hall is a Red Cross \n     reception area and medical clinic. As many as 400 people a \n     day are eating in the fellowship hall.\n       Suzie Harvey, the parish administrator, said the church was \n     asked by the Red Cross and local officials to serve as a \n     shelter. The church's leadership agreed immediately, without \n     anticipating that nearly a quarter of its 650 members would \n     be rendered homeless and in no position to contribute funds. \n     ``This was just something we had to do,'' she said. ``Later \n     we realized we have no income coming in.''\n       Harvy said the electric bill has skyrocketed, water is \n     being used round-the-clock and there has been ``20 years of \n     wear on the carpet in one month.' When FEMA makes money \n     available, she said, the church definitely will apply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10712-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10712-S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBRANCES OF SAM VOLPENTEST\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to share the very sad \nnews that Sam Volpentest--a name many of us in Congress know well--\npassed away last night at the age of 101.\n  Here in our Nation's Capital, Sam was a near constant fixture--always \nsearching for new ways to help his beloved community of the Tri-Cities \nto move forward.\n  To fully appreciate Sam's contributions, you have to understand \nsomething about the geography and history of my State. The Tri-Cities--\nwhich are Richland, Pasco, and Kennewick--are located on the Columbia \nRiver in the southeastern region of Washington State.\n  From the Hanford nuclear facility, to the pristine beauty of the last \nfree-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, to the many varied \nagricultural and business challenges, the Tri-Cities are diverse and \nvery unique.\n  Located across the Cascade Mountains from Seattle and other \npopulation centers, it could be pretty easy for these three communities \nto have their needs overlooked.\n  Well, Sam made sure that never happened.\n  Whenever something important was happening in the Tri-Cities, I could \nalways count on Sam to show up in my Senate office to share it with me, \neven if I didn't know he was coming.\n  I vividly remember many years ago when the chair of the Energy \nCommittee cut funding for the construction of HAMMER. HAMMER is a \nworld-class training facility located in Richland, WA.\n  Well, I like to think I am always on top of the issues affecting my \nhome State, but Sam kept me on my toes. I showed up at my office one \nmorning at about 7:30 a.m. Guess who was already there, standing there, \nwaiting for me outside my door. Sam Volpentest.\n  Although Sam may have only had about an inch or two on me, that man's \npassion could move mountains. And on that day, his passion was for \nbuilding HAMMER.\n  Well, I didn't want to mess with Sam, so I marched right into that \nEnergy Committee chairman's office, and I fought side by side with Sam \nto restore those cuts. And we won.\n  I was proud to stand with Sam at the HAMMER groundbreaking ceremony \nin July of 1995. Sam was 91 years young at that time. I still have that \nshovel on display in my office as a reminder of\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\nwhat we can all do if we have passion and heart, and if we work \ntogether.\n  Just look at HAMMER today. It is a first-rate facility that keeps \nHanford workers safe.\n  HAMMER has created jobs. It has created economic opportunities and \ndevelopment, and it has the potential now to be a Homeland Security \ntraining center for first responders across the country.\n  Our entire country owes Sam a debt of gratitude for all he has done \nfor so many people.\n  During my years in the Senate, I have worked with a lot of people. \nBut no one--no one--has come close to matching Sam's energy, his \ncommitment, and his success.\n  Sam has been a role model to me and to all of us who want to spend \nour lives giving something back to the communities we care about most. \nI thank him for helping me be a better representative for all the \npeople of my home State.\n  Sam was a one-person Chamber of Commerce. He was a visitor's center \nand he was a cheerleading squad all wrapped into one. Sam Volpentest \nwas the heart and soul of the Tri-Cities. He was one of a kind. Sam \nwill be dearly missed, but he will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10713-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

Mr. President, we are currently observing National \nHispanic Heritage Month, a time when many members of the Latino \ncommunity and the country at large remember and celebrate the profound \ncontributions of Hispanic culture that are woven into the great \ncultural fabric of America. National Hispanic Heritage Month is \ncelebrated between September 15 and October 15, to coincide with the \nIndependence Day anniversaries of nations throughout Latin America. In \n1968, President Lyndon Johnson's proclamation of National Hispanic \nHeritage Month was authorized by Congress. In 1988, the recognition was \nexpanded to a month-long celebration.\n  America is home to nearly 41 million Latinos, including a thriving \npopulation in my home state of Wisconsin. This month, we should take \nthe time to embrace the many important contributions throughout \nAmerican history of American Latinos that affect all of our everyday \nlives. This month we celebrate the historic efforts of Cesar Chavez, \nJaime Escalante, Roberto Hernandez, Henry Cisneros, Ellen Ochoa and \nRoberto Clemente, to name just a few. We celebrate their work to break \ndown barriers and create bridges for future generations.\n  But as we celebrate Hispanic heritage, it is also time to address the \nchallenges that face the Hispanic community, such as access to \neducation and health care, fair working conditions, racial profiling \nand, for many, an ability to keep their family together while working \nto become legal, permanent residents of this great country. I am a \nstrong supporter of the SOLVE Act, introduced by Senators Kennedy and \nMcCain, that would help keep many Latino families together while their \npetitions for permanent legal residency are processed. The legislation \nwould help hard-working Hispanics and others become legalized citizens \nand would offer a new temporary worker program.\n  While we work to improve the immigration system, we must enhance the \neducation of Latino students. Many Latino students face social, \neconomic, and language barriers that can prevent them from receiving \nthe top-quality education they, like all American students, deserve. We \nmust increase funding for English proficiency programs, programs to \nhelp low-income students attend college, and programs to help parents \ninvolve themselves in their children's education. It must be a priority \nfor Congress to ensure equal education for all so the Hispanic \ncommunity can continue to flourish and contribute to American culture.\n  In closing, I express my hope that the 109th Congress begins to \naddress these and other pressing priorities for Latinos across the \ncountry. We should not limit our celebration of National Hispanic \nHeritage Month to saluting the achievements of Hispanics, we also need \nto make sure that we act on the educational, health, labor and other \nneeds of all Americans of Hispanic heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10713-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10713-S10714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WATER TECHNOLOGY AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fresh water is a substance that we as \nAmericans assume will be available when and where we want it. However, \nthe disruption of water and wastewater services following Hurricane \nKatrina and Hurricane Rita has shown how fragile those assumptions can \nbe. The resulting fear, panic and instability are what we rarely \nexperience in this Nation. However, as we look around the globe, those \nsame fears, sense of panic, and sense of instability is a daily \noccurrence for over 1 billion people across the globe who have little \nor no hope for a speedy resolution of their concerns.\n  We must help solve the expanding problems of insufficient clean \ndrinking water and inadequate wastewater treatment. These are matters \nof international importance for several reasons. First, we are a member \nof an increasingly international economy, and the expansion or \ncontraction of economies the world over affects our industry and \neconomy. Furthermore, disease knows no borders and can spread through \nwater. Most importantly, we care about the well being of others. All \nthese national policy goals are intimately related to adequate water \nand wastewater treatment across the world.\n  There are many ways that we can help address this world-wide problem. \nHowever, lasting solutions require that local individuals and \ninstitutions have the capacity to maintain and expand their own \nservices.\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\n  This point has been hammered home by a report to be released by the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies and Sandia National \nLaboratories today. The report reinforces what any organization \naddressing international water issues already knows: the local \ncommunity must accept, embrace, maintain and take responsibility for \nthe solution to their water issues. There are several initiatives in \nplace in our country that are helping local communities across the \nglobe in this regard.\n  The Department of Energy National Laboratories have tested tools and \ntechniques for improving our domestic capacity in the desert southwest. \nThe labs have shared that information with institutions around the \nglobe to help strengthen local capacity.\n  As an example, Sandia National Laboratories' efforts to create new \ntechnologies to address major U.S. water issues are being applied to \ncritical water issues in the strategically important Middle East. \nOngoing interactions with Iraq, Jordan, Libya and Israel are helping \naddress water safety, security and sustainability issues with \ntechnologies in water management modeling, water quality monitoring and \ndesalination.\n  Sandia is also working to rebuild Iraq's science and technology \ncapacity in collaboration with the Arab Science and Technology \nFoundation and the Departments of Energy and State. Just last week in \nAmman, Jordan, Sandia co-hosted a meeting where proposals developed by \nIraqi scientists and their international collaborators were reviewed \nand presented to international funding agencies. Two such proposals for \nimproving water resources management in Iraq were presented by Sandia \nstaff and their Iraqi counterparts.\n  Separately, Sandia is working with the United Nations Educational, \nScientific, and Cultural Organization to develop a proposed planning \nframework for water management in Iraq. This framework will utilize an \nadvanced water management model developed at Sandia coupled with \ntraining of Iraqi water managers and scientists. This proposed \nframework is expected to be presented to Iraq's Ministry of Water in \nNovember.\n  In other areas, Sandia has reached a preliminary agreement with the \nRoyal Scientific Society, RSS, in Jordan to pilot test a new technology \nfor real-time collaborative development of water management models over \nthe Internet. This technology will enable U.S. and Jordanian water \nexperts to jointly assemble, test and deploy water management models, \nworking in real time while half a world apart. Sandia has also \ndeveloped a proposal with the Jordanians to pilot test real-time water \nquality monitoring technology utilizing Sandia's chem-lab-on-a-chip \ntechnology.\n  In Libya, Sandia is working on a program with the Departments of \nEnergy and State to refocus former Libyan weapons scientists on \ndevelopment of peaceful technologies that will enable Libya to develop \na strong, internationally-engaged economy. Water is a very high \npriority for the Libyans, and they are reconfiguring their former \nweapons development laboratory into a facility they have named the \nRenewable Energy and Water Desalination Research Center. Sandia is \nhelping identify desalination technologies for use in Libya, with \nparticular attention to technologies for treating the brackish water \nthat is produced as a by-product of pumping oil and gas.\n  Further, Israeli water experts came to Sandia in 2003 to learn about \nwater security. The trip led to a series of visits between Israeli \nwater security experts, the Environmental Protection Agency's National \nHomeland Security Research Center, and Sandia. These interactions \nresulted in a collaborative proposal to test Sandia's real-time, chem-\nlab-on-a-chip water quality monitoring technology in Israel's water \nsupply system.\n  Congress helped develop these tools by allowing the Department of \nEnergy Laboratories to use part of their resources for laboratory \ndirected research and development. In the case of Sandia, these seed \nfunds have produced sensor technologies to test water for contaminants \nand terror agents, numerical models to help groups jointly manage and \nplan for the future and reduce conflict, water treatment technologies \nthat may reduce costs and make impaired water available for beneficial \nuses, and tools to detect and respond to terrorist attacks in our \nmunicipal drinking water systems. These seed projects have then been \nextended and are coming to fruition under direct funding we have \nprovided through the Department of Energy, DOE.\n  The work at Sandia National Laboratory does not represent a \ncomprehensive list of all the achievements within the DOE. In fact, \ntwelve of our national laboratories, all of whom have worked to expand \nand protect water supplies in some way, have worked jointly for three \nyears to develop an outline of the ways water and energy resources are \ninter-related. These institutions are now working under DOE direction \nto develop a report to Congress on this interdependency, which I \nbelieve will help us determine which programs will most effectively \nensure sufficient water supplies to support our energy needs and \nsufficient energy supplies to meet our water needs.\n  Additionally, these national laboratories are now working with both \nFederal and non-Federal institutions around the U.S. to develop a \ntechnology development roadmap. This effort will clearly identify our \nhighest priority investments in research, development and \ncommercialization so we can expand our nations' water supplies.\n  The success of these investments led us to authorize a new DOE \nprogram as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That program is \nbroad. I believe that overall it will help resolve problems related to \nwater just as we are working to resolve our energy supply problems. I \nam particularly interested in the technology development aspects of the \nprogram and therefore plan to introduce a bill soon to instruct the DOE \nto focus attention on technology development and commercialization. A \nsimilar bill was introduced last Congress in partnership with Members \nfrom the House, and I have high hope that working together we can pass \nlegislation this Congress.\n  I must note that DOE efforts are not the only activities that can \nassist the U.S. in addressing international water issues. The Bureau of \nReclamation has a 30-year history of developing desalination \ntechnologies that have a significant international impact. The Bureau's \nreputation and capabilities in this area cannot be underestimated, and \nI hope the administration will develop a long-term strategy for use and \nexpansion of those resources. Further, I have supported the Office of \nNaval Research's efforts to develop mobile water treatment technology \nfor our troops. This technology has proven its worth by being deployed \nto Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Additionally, my colleague and friend, Majority Leader Frist, \nintroduced legislation this spring entitled the ``Safe Water Currency \nfor Peace Act of 2005'', S.492, which directs the Department of State \nto develop a cohesive international water development policy and then \nto begin to implement that strategy. This policy effort holds strong \npromise for the future of water as well.\n  I believe and remain a champion of the need to look ahead, to see the \nfuture of water supplies in this nation and the world and to actively \nprepare for that future. I have said before, and I still believe, that \nthere is no more important or essential substance to us than water. It \nis the source from which life springs. It also has the potential to be \nthe source of incredible conflict at both local and international \nlevels. Fresh water supplies are coming under pressure all over the \nglobe. Seriously confronting this problem before it leads to tremendous \nburdens on this nation and the world is an endeavor as worthwhile as \nany I can contemplate. The need is great. The goal is good. The \ninitiatives I have discussed today, and others like them, can help us \nconfront this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10714-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10714-S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AVIAN INFLUENZA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support and cosponsor \nSenator Harkin's amendment aimed at enhancing our capability to combat \nan avian flu pandemic. This amendment provides absolutely crucial \nfunding for key items that will clearly be needed to fight off this \nmenace: a substantial stockpile of the only antiviral medication \neffective against H5N1 flu; expansion of the ability of our State and\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\nlocal public health departments, which are the first line of defense \nagainst flu, to meet the threat; increased global surveillance for \ndangerous pathogens to pick up the first signs of a spreading epidemic, \na priority issue that Senator Frist and I have worked on for several \nyears; improving our country's infrastructure for vaccine manufacture, \nwhich is sorely deficient; and money for communication and outreach, so \nwe can have everybody prepared and on the same page.\n  We are all concerned about preparation for bioterrorist attacks. \nSmallpox, anthrax, plague, and other pathogens may be coming down the \nroad at some point. But the public health experts tell us that H5N1 \navian flu has already started down the road. It is not in the U.S. yet, \nand the scientists don't know when it might get here, but it is heading \nin our direction. The avian flu virus is spreading throughout Asia, \ncarried by migratory waterfowl with a worldwide reach. The virus is \ncontinuously changing and adapting, heading toward the human-to-human \ntransmission capability that could trigger a pandemic.\n  And we do know from the first 100 human cases, which have been \nlimited so far to Southeast Asia, that this stuff is really lethal, \nwith a case-fatality rate approaching 50 percent. By contrast, the \ndeadly 1918 Spanish flu that killed millions of people had a case-\nfatality rate of only 2 percent. We're talking about a threat to this \nNation as big as any we have faced.\n  Fortunately, we have a good idea of the measures we need to take to \nmitigate the impact of avian flu. But these measures cost money and \nhave a significant lag time before they can be put in place. Many of \nthese measures require resources only available in foreign countries. \nWe don't know how much time we have got, and we have got to get moving \non this right now. We really can't wait weeks and months for the \n``right'' appropriation bill, for some ``advisory committee'' to finish \nits work, or for the completion of a ``comprehensive'' antiterror plan. \nThe responsible, prudent move is to act now, to start putting in place \nthe countermeasures that we know will work if implemented in time. The \nold philosopher who said that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure'' may not have known anything about RNA viruses, but that \nadvice would seem quite applicable to our current situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10715-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10715-S10716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, on Sunday, September 18, just outside of \nChicago, Farm Aid staged its 20th annual concert, playing to a sell-out \ncrowd of more than 28,000. Over the years, Farm Aid has raised more \nthan $27 million to fund national, State and local efforts of various \nkinds to support and strengthen family farm agriculture and rural \ncommunities.\n  The first Farm Aid concert, on September 22, 1985, was organized by a \ngreat American who is richly acquainted with the heart and soul of \nrural America, Willie Nelson. Originally conceived as a way to raise \nmoney to help struggling farm families, the first Farm Aid concert also \nserved to highlight the crucial challenges facing family farms and \nrural communities.\n  I have vivid memories of that first Farm Aid concert 20 years ago. I \nremember getting on the train in Carroll, IA, west of Ames, and riding \nit all the way to Champaign, IL. That was a trainload of people with \nhigh hopes and good spirits. But more important, that train was packed \nwith people who understood firsthand the severity of the farm crisis, \nand who had a deep, passionate commitment to doing something about it. \nWe spent the train trip discussing ideas for turning the situation \naround, and by the time we arrived in Champaign, we were fired up to \npush for big changes.\n  The mid-1980s were a tumultuous time for rural America. In my own \nState of Iowa, the economic devastation experienced by family farms and \nsmall towns was the worst since the Great Depression. As in the 1930s, \nthe human toll of the crisis was poignant and profound. There were many \ntens of thousands of people who had spent their lives working hard and \nplaying by the rules, but who were losing their farms, their homes and \ntheir livelihoods. That affected me personally, as it did most Iowans \nand people all across America. And like so many others, I was convinced \nthat we needed new ideas and better policies to save America's family \nfarm agriculture and to revitalize our rural economy.\n  The first Farm Aid concert drew a tremendous amount of national and \neven international attention to the crisis in rural America. Farm Aid \nopened people's eyes to the plight of family farms and small towns. It \nhelped farm families directly and it led to policy changes that have \nmade a positive difference.\n  Family farms and rural communities are still struggling, and so Farm \nAid is as important as ever. And in that same spirit, this year's \nconcert highlighted and helped support a special Farm Aid Family Farm \nDisaster Fund to provide aid to farm families and rural communities \nthat have been devastated by hurricanes across the gulf region, drought \nin the Midwest or other natural disasters elsewhere. In the tremendous \nresponse to the hurricanes, we have seen the same outpouring of concern \nand compassion by the American people that has supported Farm Aid over \nthe years.\n  I salute Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Neil Young, Dave Matthews \nand all the others who have devoted themselves to making Farm Aid a \nsuccess in helping family farms and rural communities throughout the \nyears--including David Senter, Carolyn Mugar and Corky Jones. I wish \nthem and Farm Aid many more successful years supporting family farms \nand rural communities and raising awareness of their vital importance \nto us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10716-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10716-S10717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Commerce Committee was scheduled \nto conduct an afternoon hearing regarding emergency communications. I \nregret that the hearing was postponed, and I hope and expect that the \nsession will be quickly rescheduled. The events of September 11, 2001, \nuncovered a fundamental weakness in our communications system. We \nlearned the hard way that in a time of crisis--when communication is \nmost important--our first responders could not communicate at a basic \nlevel. Now, some 4 years later, Katrina has showed we have not fixed \nthe problem. One of the biggest problem facing police, fire and first \nresponders in the gulf coast was that the communications system was \nknocked off line. It was remarkable to watch as the television news \ncrews had better luck communicating than our first responders. As the \ndisaster unfolded, emergency officials repeatedly cited communications \nfailures as a major obstacle to the disaster response effort.\n  So despite the good work of the 9/11 Commission and the hard work of \nnational and local officials, we find that the system is not hardened \nagainst terror or nature, and we remain dangerously vulnerable. Like \nall of my colleagues, I want a system that will work when we need it \nmost. Frankly, there is not much good in an emergency communications \nsystem that doesn't work in emergencies. We must push ahead with the \nDTV transition so that new spectrum is made available and new \ntechnologies can come online. The Federal Government must commit the \ntime, resources, training, technology, and leadership to create a \nnational and truly interoperable communications system. It is a \nnational job to ensure capability across regions, among rescues units, \nand up and down chain of command.\n  I also believe we should deploy a redundant emergency communications \nsystem that, with a flick of switch, will operate during times of \ncrisis when the main system is disabled. I have introduced a bill to \naddress this immediate need. S. 1703 requires experts at the Department \nof Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission evaluate \nthe feasibility and cost of deploying an emergency communications \nsystem. The agencies will evaluate all reasonable options, including\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nsatellites, wireless and terrestrial-based systems. They will evaluate \nall available public and private resources that could provide such a \nsystem and submit a report to Congress detailing the findings.\n  The DHS is then authorized to request appropriations to implement the \nsystem. Congress would then be in position to put in place whatever \nprograms and funding are needed to get the job done. We have myriad \nday-to-day communications issues to address. I am mindful of these \nneeds. As was pointed out by a witness in the Commerce Committee's \nmorning hearing, we have major problems with ``operability'' within a \nparticular agency that must be addressed before we can seriously tackle \n``interoperability''--communicating across jurisdictions and among \ndifferent agencies.\n  However, we must also take steps to address an immediate crisis. We \nmust ensure that we can respond in emergency situations with an eye \ntoward building a reliable, redundant system for the long term. It is \nmy hope that the Congress will consider this proposal, and other \nrelevant proposals, before we recess for the year. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10717-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRESIDENT URIBE'S APPOINTMENT OF A CABINET-LEVEL ADVISOR ON AFRO-\n                            COLOMBIAN ISSUES\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to an \nimportant step towards progress for Afro-descendants in Colombia, and \nan important opportunity for Afro-descendants throughout Latin America.\n  I wish to commend the work of my colleagues in the Congressional \nBlack Caucus on this issue, as well as the tireless efforts of \nnongovernmental organizations and religious groups both here and in \nColombia.\n  This August, President Uribe of Colombia created a cabinet-level \nposition on Afro-Colombian issues, and appointed an Afro-Colombian to \nfill the post. The creation of this position is especially significant \nbecause it signals both a recognition of the severity of the situation \nof Afro-descendants in Colombia and a willingness to address these \ninequalities.\n  At the same time, many of us recognize that this is only a first step \nand much more needs to be done.\n  I will be monitoring the progress of this office very closely in the \ncoming months, and I especially look forward to the development of \nPresident Uribe's Committee on Civil Rights and Sustainable Development \nfor Afro-Colombians.\n  It is my hope that this institution will have the resources and \nmandate to do an effective job of bringing some measure of equality and \njustice to a marginalized segment of Colombian society. It is my hope \nthat this will encourage other governments in Latin America to consider \ntaking additional measures to address racial discrimination, as well as \neconomic and social marginalization, faced by Afro-descendants in their \ncountries.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, our own country is being awakened \nto a great divide in our midst. As we struggle with troubling \nintersections of race and class, and how we have failed the most \nvulnerable members of our population, I hope we will be able to take a \nmoment to reflect on similar struggles in places such as Colombia, \nEcuador, Brazil and Venezuela.\n  While I realize that Colombia continues to face many challenges--from \nhuman rights to narco-trafficking--I wanted to bring some good news, \nthat is often overlooked, about the country of Colombia to the \nattention of the Senate. I applaud these efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10717-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SIMON WIESENTHAL\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Simon \nWiesenthal, the moral conscience of our generation and of generations \nto come. I was proud to cosponsor the resolution authored by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Schumer, that passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent, commemorating Mr. Wiesenthal's life and accomplishments.\n  Mr. Wiesenthal died on Tuesday, September 20, 2005, at the age of 96. \nAfter surviving internment in 12 Nazi concentration camps, Mr. \nWiesenthal took on a mission for the world--to ensure that through the \ncrucible of the Holocaust we acknowledge and understand our common \nhumanity.\n  Simon Wiesenthal's name has become synonymous with the term ``Nazi \nhunter,'' the man responsible for bringing more than 1,100 Holocaust \ncollaborators to justice. But as the noted author, Robert Lifton, has \nsaid, what defined Wiesenthal ``wasn't so much his identifying \nparticular Nazi criminals, . . . it was his insisting on an attitude of \nconfronting what happened and constantly keeping what happened in mind \nand doing so at times when a lot of people would have preferred to \nforget.''\n  Simon Wiesenthal constantly made sure that we understood the \nHolocaust was not a discrete event relegated to a particular time and \nplace, but that it was, and is, emblematic of the depths to which \nhumanity can descend and the heights to which it can soar.\n  Simon Wiesenthal survived the Nazi death camps through what some \nmight call luck, some might call random acts of kindness or just \nindifference, or what some might call miracles. Whatever the reason, \nfathomable or unfathomable, Wiesenthal became our guide on a painful \nand essential journey through memory and consciousness, an examination \nof what we are and what we should be. That is a journey that is never-\nending by definition--it was not for him and should not be for us.\n  He was a detective searching for criminals, and he was a philosopher \nseeking after truth and justice.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \nPontifical Visit of His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House \nof Cilicia, to my home State of California in October, 2005.\n  The Catholicos represents the Great House of Cilicia, an historic \nArmenian religious center established in 1441. The Catholicosate was \nrelocated to Antelias, Lebanon following the atrocities of the Armenian \nGenocide, which included destruction of houses of worship in Cilicia. \nToday, His Holiness Aram I represents hundreds of thousands of Armenian \nAmerican Christians, as well as Armenians across the Near East. The \nArmenian faith is 1,700 years old and it is significant that Armenia \nwas the first nation to officially adopt Christianity as a state \nreligion in 301 AD.\n  The Catholicos' spiritual, cultural and educational influence extends \nwell beyond the Armenian people. His Holiness Aram I, who holds a \nMaster of Divinity, a Master of Sacred Theology, a Ph.D., and several \nhonorary degrees, has authored numerous articles and texts in Armenian, \nEnglish and French, some of which have been translated into other \nlanguages. The Catholicos has worked to strengthen interfaith relations \nbetween Christian and Muslim communities. In 1974, the Catholicos was \none of the founding members of the Middle East Council of Churches.\n  His Holiness Aram I was elected as Moderator of the Central and \nExecutive Committees of the World Council of Churches, WCC, a renowned \norganization which represents over 400 million Christians worldwide. \nThe WCC brings together over 340 churches and denominations in more \nthan 100 countries throughout the world. The Catholicos is the first \nOrthodox, first Middle Easterner and youngest person to hold this \nposition and his unanimous re-election as Moderator in 1998 was \nexceptional in the history of the WCC.\n  During his trip to California, which is titled ``Towards the Light of \nKnowledge,'' the Catholicos will visit churches as well as educational \nand cultural institutions in Los Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco. \nThis momentous visit was initiated by His Eminence, Archbishop Moushegh \nMardirossian of the\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nWestern Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America to \ncommemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and the \n1600th Anniversary of the creation of the Armenian alphabet.\n  I am honored to recognize this milestone visit to California by a \ndistinguished Armenian and world leader. I wish both the Catholicos and \nthe Armenian community in California a renewed sense of purpose and \ninspiration from this visit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10718-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY, INC.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute to Alpha Kappa \nAlpha Sorority, Incorporated, America's first Greek-letter organization \nestablished by black college women.\n  On Thursday, September 22, 2005, I had the pleasure of spending time \nwith nearly one hundred members of this remarkable organization, \nincluding Representative Sheila Jackson Lee and AKA's International \nPresident, Linda White. I have long been aware of the rich history and \ntremendous contributions made to our Nation by Alpha Kappa Alpha and \nthe other eight Black Greek Letter Organizations and I was particularly \ndelighted to participate in AKA's event entitled ``The Spirit, Let's \nShare it and Connect,'' which focused on the many ways in which AKA \ncontributes to our communities.\n  In 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority was founded at Howard University \nin Washington, DC, by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, who envisioned AKA as a \nsource of social and intellectual enrichment for its members. Over the \npast century, AKA has evolved into a nationwide organization of \ncollege-trained women working to improve the socioeconomic conditions \nin their cities, States and countries throughout the world.\n  Alpha Kappa Alpha's achievements are the result of volunteer service \nthat captures the organization's core values. Each year, a National \nProgram theme is constructed around one of AKA's five ``targets'': \nEducation, the Black Family, Health, Economics and the Arts. This \nyear's target is Education, with the Signature Program of the \nadministration being ``The Ivy Reading AKAdemy,'' a reading initiative \nfocused on early learning and mastery of basic reading skills by the \nend of third grade. All AKA chapters are required to implement an after \nschool reading initiative for students in kindergarten through third \ngrade. Across the United States there are nine such federally funded \ndemonstration sites in low-performing, economically deprived, innercity \nschools.\n  AKA has made several significant contributions to the black community \nand to American society over all over the past century. These efforts \nhave included a wide range of issues, including among them election \nreform and health care and education initiatives. For example, in 1983 \nAKA launched a massive registration drive designed to increase black \nvoter registration by 25 percent by the November 1984 elections. In \n1999, AKA was awarded a $50,000 grant from the United States Department \nof Transportation to promote increased seatbelt use and vehicle \npassenger safety in the minority community. That same year, AKA \nestablished a funded partnership with the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services to promote women's health. Just 4 years ago, \nAKA raised over $25,000 for sickle cell anemia. In 2002, AKA built and \ndedicated nine AKAdemies in South Africa and contributed $25,000 to the \nNational Council of Negro Women's Mortgage Liquidation Fund.\n  In addition to advancing these services, AKA maintains a focus on \nimproving the quality of life for its members. AKA cultivates and \nencourages high scholastic and ethical standards; promotes unity and \nfriendship among college women; alleviates problems facing girls and \nwomen; maintains a progressive interest in college life and serves over \n170,000 women in the United States, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa. \nIts distinguished alumni include national civic leaders such as \nastronaut Mae Jamison, author Toni Morrison, poet Maya Angelou, Coretta \nScott King, Rosa Parks, and the late Judge Constance Baker Motley. I \nwas deeply saddened to learn of the death of Judge Constance Baker \nMotley earlier this week. A champion of civil rights and a giant of the \nlegal profession, she will be remembered for her lasting contributions \nto American jurisprudence and to our larger society. I am certain that \nthe women of AKA join me in mourning her passing, grateful and \nheartened by the fact that the civil rights movement existed in large \npart because of the efforts of their friend in sisterhood.\n  I am privileged and proud to have a special bond with the remarkable \nwomen of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Incorporated and am honored to share with \nmy colleagues the many reasons we should all admire and thank the \nmembers of this organization for their long-lasting and unwavering \ncommitment to improving the lives of so many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10718-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10718-S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 40 years ago today, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed landmark legislation into law creating the Foundation on \nthe Arts and Humanities. I was privileged to be one of the cosponsors \nof this measure, which created the National Endowment for the Arts and \nthe National Endowment for the Humanities and bring a new nationwide \nfocus to the creative community across America in the fields of \nliterature and history, the visual arts, and the performing arts.\n  Throughout these four decades, the Endowments have provided \nimpressive leadership in enhancing the cultural life of the Nation. The \nbudget for the two agencies is relatively small, but they have \ndistributed Federal grants to a wide range of deserving educational and \ncultural organizations in communities in all parts of the country.\n  The best of our cultural heritage has broad appeal to peoples \neverywhere. The scholarship, the history, and the arts of America are \nadmired around the world. Each generation of scholars and artists has \nmuch to share with the rest of the world, and with the generations to \ncome as well. The important role of the Endowments is to support the \nmuseums, the galleries, and the theaters in our communities, and assist \nthem in presenting these artistic achievements so that audiences, \nstudents and scholars can study them, and learn from them.\n  Down through the ages, the arts have inspired generations after \ngenerations with their beauty, tolerance and understanding. They enable \nindividuals to reach beyond their own experience and know something of \nother peoples and other cultures. In this shrinking world, it is even \nmore important to respect our neighbors, and build cultural bridges to \nreach out to one another in our shared world. The arts and humanities \noffer indispensable opportunities to achieve this important goal.\n  The Endowments help disseminate the creative work being done at the \nlocal level. In Massachusetts, we are privileged to have an \nextraordinary range of cultural institutions that document the story of \nour Commonwealth from its earliest days to the present. We are very \nproud of the cultural landmarks that tell of our history, so that \nfuture generations too will understand the challenges that faced the \nPilgrim settlers in Plymouth, the struggle for independence that began \nin Boston Harbor and at Concord Bridge, the harrowing era of one stop \non the Underground Railroad, the rugged life in the fishing community \nof New Bedford, and the early years of the China trade.\n  So, too, in every other State in our Nation, the story is told of \ndiscovery, development and achievement, the continuing story of the \nAmerican journey.\n  The important task of the Endowments is to honor and preserve this \nlegacy. Over the past four decades, they have compiled an impressive \nrecord of vital support for both the arts and humanities. The Arts \nEndowment has funded major arts exhibitions, dance tours by large \nnational companies, and performances by smaller regional companies. The \nHumanities Endowment has provided vital research and educational \nsupport in colleges and universities across the country. It has \nsupported a national effort to preserve important documents, brittle \nbooks and important artifacts. Its public programs have underwritten \nbrilliant documentaries on topics ranging from the story of the Civil \nWar to the story of baseball.\n  These two great Endowments have amply fulfilled the early hope that\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\nthey could improve the quality of the arts and humanities and expand \ntheir reach, and we in Congress are very proud of all they have \naccomplished.\n  There have been times of controversy and criticism as well, but the \nEndowments have clearly earned the bipartisan respect and support that \nthey now enjoy. The arts and humanities are an essential part in the \nlife of the Nation and in all of our lives, and the Endowment's mission \nis to ensure that they always will be.\n  I commend the current chairmen of the Humanities Endowment and the \nArts Endowment, Bruce Cole and Dana Gioia. They follow in impressive \nfootsteps of their illustrious predecessors, through Republican and \nDemocratic administrations alike. We are grateful for all that they and \ntheir outstanding staff members do each day to fulfill their important \nmission.\n  It is gratifying on this 40th anniversary of the creation of the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities to recognize their \nsuperb record of achievement, and I congratulate all those who have \ndone so much to make it so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10719-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  MASSACHUSETTS BEST COMMUNITY WINNERS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize three \noutstanding Massachusetts communities, each of which has been chosen by \nAmerica's Promise as one of the ``100 Best Communities for Young \nPeople'' in this Nation. The communities of Barnstable County, \nBrockton, and Cambridge, have demonstrated outstanding civic leadership \nfor our children. Community leaders, businesses, teachers and \nGovernment officials work together in these communities to give their \nchildren both the tools and the opportunities they need to succeed. I \nam very proud that such exemplary communities can be found in my home \nState.\n  Barnstable has an impressive record of civic involvement. Not only \nare community leaders active in the lives of their youth, but they \nencourage their children to participate in community activities. Over \n40 percent of the households in Barnstable have young people \nparticipating in community service, and this is, in large part, a \nreflection of the extensive programs in area high schools such as \nJunior State of America, Mentoring, Peer Leaders, and National Honor \nSociety. In the Barnstable middle school communities, initiatives such \nas Schools for Success, which works with underachieving youth in the \nBarnstable Middle School to improve academic achievement and social \nskills, have evolved and flourished. The community involvement extends \noutside of the school systems as well with organizations such as \nChildren's Cove, a program run by the Barnstable County district \nattorney's office, the State department of social service, and Cape Cod \nHealth Care, together with other community partners to assist children \nwho have experienced sexual abuse.\n  In Brockton, successful community organizations work tirelessly to \nprovide their children with every opportunity to learn, grow, and \nremain both physically and mentally healthy. The Brockton After Dark \nprogram organizes several different activities each weeknight at seven \nlocations across the city, including basketball games, open swim time, \ntennis, soccer, performing arts, and open mike nights. By keeping \nvulnerable youth off the streets, the program contributed to a \nsignificant drop in crime. The Target Outreach initiative directs at-\nrisk youth to positive alternatives offered by the Boys & Girls Clubs \nby recruiting children to club activities as a diversion to gang \nactivities. In its first 2 years, the program far surpassed its \nenrollment goal. In 2004-2005, 179 members of the Brockton High School \nKey Club, a partner in Brockton's Promise, completed 3,800 hours of \ncommunity service in Brockton. Together, the mayor, the district \nattorney and the chief of police have organized successful Kids Road \nRaces, youth field trips to the local Brockton Rox baseball game, and \nmuch more.\n  The city of Cambridge has also illustrated its dedication to \nimproving the quality of life for its youth and their families. In \n1997, Cambridge introduced the Agenda for Children, which consisted of \nmore than 50 meetings with over 600 community members to bring the \ncity's health, human services, schools, police, and library departments \ntogether with nonprofit providers and the Cambridge Community \nFoundation to help improve the quality of life for its youth. In \naddition, the Neighborhood Service Project provides youth with an \nopportunity to work with their peers targeting a variety of issues from \nteen pregnancy to multiculturalism. The Cambridge Prevention Coalition, \npartnering with other organizations, has developed a Peer Leadership \nProgram which creates teen leaders mobilized around substance abuse \nissues. All in all, Cambridge has over 150 programs within the city \nlimits attending to the needs and services of youth and their families.\n  What I have given here is just a small sampling of the incredible \nprograms occurring in the Commonwealth. I applaud these three cities on \ntheir recognition by America's Promise; encourage them to continue \ntheir great work and I hope other communities will follow their \nexample.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10719-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN REMEMBRANCE OF MILDRED LIGHT ALDRIDGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Mildred Light Aldridge, an educator and \nadministrator for many years and the wife of the late Reverend Dr. \nAvery Aldridge, who passed away at the age of 77 on September 22, 2005. \nShe was an important member of the Flint community, and she will be \nsorely missed by many.\n  Mildred Light Aldridge was born in 1928 in Earle, AR. She received \nher bachelor's of art degree in elementary education from the \nUniversity of Michigan-Flint and her master's degree in guidance and \ncounseling from Eastern Michigan University. She taught on the \nelementary school level and worked as a guidance counselor in several \nmiddle schools before serving as principal of the Doyle Ryder Community \nSchool until her retirement in 1986. After retirement, she remained \nactive by founding and serving as the director of the Eagle's Nest \nChild Care and Development Center. She also served for the past 23 \nyears as an instructor of the adult ladies fellowship class at Foss \nAvenue Baptist Church.\n  Mildred Light Aldridge participated in various civic and community \norganizations, including the Flint Chapters of the NAACP and the Urban \nLeague, the Visually Impaired Center of Flint, and on the advisory \nboard of the Mott Community College Foundation. She was also affiliated \nwith the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the \nFlint Congress of School Administrators. In addition, Dr. Aldridge held \nhonorary doctorate degrees from Arkansas Baptist College and Selma \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Aldridge is mourned by many in the Flint community and is \nsurvived by her two children, Derrick Aldridge and Karen Aldridge-\nEason, and by her 10 grandchildren. This is, indeed, a great loss to \nall who knew her, and I know my colleagues will join me in paying \ntribute to the life of Mildred L. Aldridge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10719-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10719-S10720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO JOHN DEERING AND HIS ``TESTAMENT'' SCULPTURE\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, nearly half a century ago, Arkansas \nexperienced one of its darkest moments. As nine African-American \nstudents fought to integrate Central High School, they were accosted by \nstudents, threatened by parents and forsaken by local leaders. It took \nan intervention by President Dwight Eisenhower to bring desegregation \nto this public school.\n  But in the 48 years since this event my State has seen brighter days, \nmost recently on August 30, 2005, when I was proud to be present for \nthe unveiling of ``Testament,'' a sculpture of the Little Rock Nine \ndepicting the nine brave students on their journey to claim an equal \neducation.\n  ``Testament'' is a tribute by John Deering, one of Little Rock's own, \nto those students and the courage they demonstrated that day. The life-\nsized sculpture depicts the nine students as they were in 1957: Equally \nbrave, scared, determined. It is the largest bronze statue in Arkansas \nand the first\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\nmonument honoring the civil rights movement on the grounds of a \nSouthern State capitol. During the 40th anniversary of the \ndesegregation, John came up with the idea for the sculpture. With \napproval from the Little Rock Nine Foundation, John created the work \nwith his wife Kathy and studio partner Steve Scallion. The sculpture \nhas been 7 years in the making and now stands proudly in Little Rock.\n  I would like to recognize John for this sculpture and his \ncontributions to journalism and the arts. As the editorial cartoonist \nfor the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, John has earned numerous local and \nnational accolades. He has been recognized by the Arkansas Press \nAssociation with the Best Editorial Cartoonist Award seven times in his \ncareer and in 1996 he won the illustrious Berryman Award from the \nNational Press Foundation. His editorial cartoons are nationally \nsyndicated, as is his comic strip ``Strange Brew,'' allowing readers \nthroughout the country to share in his humor.\n  But make no mistake, John is serious about his cartoons, and the \nartistry is as important to him as the jokes. His dedication to \nartistry has translated to other mediums, including painting and \nsculpture. John has works displayed throughout the country. \n``Testament'' is not the first monument he has sculpted for Arkansas. \nIn 1987, John created a life-size sculpture of an American soldier for \nthe Arkansas Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which I consider both poignant \nand powerful.\n  When the ``Testament'' sculpture was unveiled, the Little Rock Nine \nonce again stood together in solidarity. An emotional moment for those \nbrave men and women, it was also a moving event for John as 7 years of \nprivate work was finally put on public display. As this sculpture \nstands on Arkansas' capitol grounds, it serves as a testament to the \nLittle Rock Nine, as well as Arkansas' past and future. I applaud John \nfor his valuable artistic contribution to Arkansas and the nation and I \nhope that this statue will serve as a lasting reminder of the \ndifficulties and triumphs of the civil rights movement for generations \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10720-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN H. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today, I pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of John H. Johnson. John was a pioneer whose monumental works in \npublishing and generous acts of philanthropy have had profound \ninfluence on the lives of millions, both inside and outside Arkansas.\n  John's life story is one we can all learn from and admire. Raising \nhimself up from poverty to the top of the business world, he is proof \nthat hard work and determination can create success. Born the grandson \nof slaves in a one-room house in Arkansas City in 1918, John went on to \nbecome the first African American to be named to Forbes' list of the \n400 wealthiest Americans.\n  The founder, publisher and chairman of Johnson Publishing company--\nthe largest African-American owned publishing company in the world--\nJohn's magazines, Ebony and Jet, are the number one African-American \nmagazine and newsweekly respectively. Ebony currently has a circulation \nof 1.7 million and a monthly readership of over 11 million, while Jet \nhas a readership of over 8 million weekly, and both publications \ncontinue to lead the way in African-American journalism. Linda Johnson \nRice, John's daughter, currently serves as President and CEO of her \nfather's company and I wish her the best in building on her father's \nsuccess.\n  Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996--the highest honor \nthis Nation bestows on civilians--John's life was full of \naccomplishments and accolades. John was recognized with the Magazine \nPublisher's Association publisher of the year award, the Black \nJournalists' Lifetime Achievement Award and the Wall Street Journal/Dow \nJones Entrepreneurial Excellence Award. He has been inducted into the \nAdvertising Hall of Fame, the National Business Hall of Fame and, in \n2001, he became the first African American inducted into the Arkansas \nBusiness Hall of Fame. During his life, John was also appointed to \nvarious posts by Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon and served on \nthe boards of corporations ranging from Dillard Department Stores to \nthe Chrysler Corporation to Twentieth Century Fox Film.\n  But John's influence extends beyond the business world. He helped \nchange race relations in this country, both with his publications and \nactivism. In 1955, John made history when he published the unedited \nphotographs of the mutilated body of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old \nmurder victim who was viciously beaten, shot and then drowned in \nMississippi for allegedly whistling at a white woman. The pictures, \nintended to show the reality of the Jim Crow South, helped spark the \nCivil Rights Movement.\n  As far as John went in life, he was not one to forget his roots. \nRaised in poverty in Arkansas by his mother, John has spent much of \nlife giving back to his community and state. John's dedication to \neducation and improving the lives of children has been one of his \ngreatest passions and the results of his work will be felt in Arkansas \nfor decades to come. In May, Arkansas City and the University of \nArkansas at Pine Bluff dedicated the John H. Johnson Cultural and \nEducational Museum. The museum contains memorabilia, printed materials \nand videos about John's life, which will serve as an inspiration to our \nchildren as they strive to succeed. There are also plans in the works \nfor the John H. Johnson Delta Cultural and Entrepreneurial Learning \nCenter in Arkansas City, as well as a related academic complex in Pine \nBluff. These facilities will undoubtedly be an asset to the university \nand provide valuable education opportunities for the students of \nArkansas.\n  John H. Johnson's legacy will live on and continue to influence the \nState of Arkansas, and the Nation, for many years. Through his \npublications, activism and generosity, John has left an indelible mark \non society. He was a trailblazer and his contributions to our Nation \nare immeasurable. I join all of Arkansas in saluting the memory of John \nH. Johnson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10720-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10720-S10721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING JUDGE CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to honor and celebrate the \nremarkable life and legacy of Judge Constance Baker Motley, a \ntrailblazer for civil rights who dedicated her life to advancing the \nAmerican values of justice and equality for all.\n  Judge Motley was born and raised in New Haven, CT at a time when \nwomen and minorities were denied the right to an equal education, and \nemployment, housing and voting rights. Despite remarkable odds, Judge \nMotley decided at the age of 15 that she would be an attorney. Although \nshe was discouraged by many, Judge Motley remarked that she was ``the \nkind of person who would not be put down.''\n  Judge Motley graduated from Columbia Law School in 1946 and joined \nthe legal staff of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc. It \nwas there that for nearly 20 years, Judge Motley orchestrated the legal \nchallenge to the ``separate but equal doctrine,'' culminating in the \nSupreme Court victory in Brown v. Board of Education that guaranteed \nequal educational opportunities for all Americans. In addition to the \nseminal decision in Brown, Judge Motley argued the 1957 school \ndesegregation case in Little Rock, AR that led President Eisenhower to \ncall in federal troops to protect nine black students at Central High \nSchool. During Judge Motley's tenure at the NAACP, she successfully \nargued numerous cases desegregating restaurants and recreational \nfacilities in Southern cities and cases overturning the convictions of \nthe Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and countless others who engaged in \nnonviolent sit-ins and protests of discriminatory practices.\n  In 1965, Judge Motley became the first woman to be elected president \nof the Borough of Manhattan where she continued to advocate for the \nrights of women, minorities and the poor. In 1966, President Johnson \nappointed Judge Motley to the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) databases of personally identifiable information are \n     increasingly prime targets of hackers, identity thieves, \n     rogue employees, and other criminals, including organized and \n     sophisticated criminal operations;\n       (2) identity theft is a serious threat to the nation's \n     economic stability, homeland security, the development of e-\n     commerce, and the privacy rights of Americans;\n       (3) over 9,300,000 individuals were victims of identity \n     theft in America last year;\n       (4) security breaches are a serious threat to consumer \n     confidence, homeland security, e-commerce, and economic \n     stability;\n       (5) it is important for business entities that own, use, or \n     license personally identifiable information to adopt \n     reasonable procedures to ensure the security, privacy, and \n     confidentially of that personally identifiable information;\n       (6) individuals whose personal information has been \n     compromised or who have been victims of identity theft should \n     receive the necessary information and assistance to mitigate \n     their damages and to restore the integrity of their personal \n     information and identities;\n       (7) data brokers have assumed a significant role in \n     providing identification, authentication, and screening \n     services, and related data collection and analyses for \n     commercial, nonprofit, and government operations;\n       (8) data misuse and use of inaccurate data have the \n     potential to cause serious or irreparable harm to an \n     individual's livelihood, privacy, and liberty and undermine \n     efficient and effective business and government operations;\n       (9) there is a need to insure that data brokers conduct \n     their operations in a manner that prioritizes fairness, \n     transparency, accuracy, and respect for the privacy of \n     consumers;\n       (10) government access to commercial data can potentially \n     improve safety, law enforcement, and national security; and\n       (11) because government use of commercial data containing \n     personal information potentially affects individual privacy, \n     and law enforcement and national security operations, there \n     is a need for Congress to exercise oversight over government \n     use of commercial data.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today we reintroduce the Specter-Leahy \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Specter and I introduced a comprehensive \nbill to bring urgently needed reforms to protect Americans' privacy and \nto secure their personal data. Chairman Specter has shown great \nleadership on this issue, and I appreciate his dedication to solving \nthese challenging problems through his willingness to work together to \nenhance this legislation as we have deemed appropriate. Since initial \nintroduction of our bill, we have worked with Senator Feinstein and \nother members of the Judiciary Committee to address areas of concern \nand to perfect the bill. We have also worked closely with a wide \nvariety of stakeholders and experts in these issues, which has also \nimproved the bill.\n  I especially thank Senator Feinstein for her dedication and resolve \nto address these difficult data security and privacy concerns. I \ncommend her input and leadership, and I am pleased that she is joining \nas an original cosponsor of this revised bill. I also thank Senator \nFeingold for his commitment to ensuring that the government also acts \nresponsibly in its use of our personal information and appreciate his \nsupport as an original cosponsor. This is a good bill--carefully \ncalibrated to help remedy the problems we set out to address--and I \nlook forward to continuing our efforts to pass effective legislation.\n  We have teamed together and applied our collective wisdom to sort \nthrough these issues with care and precision. We took the time needed \nto develop well-balanced, focused legislation that provides strong \nprotections where necessary, and that offers strong penalties and \nconsequences as disincentives for those who fail to protect Americans' \nmost personal information.\n  Reforms like these are long overdue. As we look toward the end of the \nyear, these necessary reforms should be included in our domestic \npriorities so that we can achieve some positive changes in areas that \naffect the everyday lives of Americans.\n  First our bill requires data brokers to let people know what \nsensitive personal information they have about them, and to allow \npeople to correct inaccurate information. These principles have \nprecedent from the credit report context, and we have adapted them in a \nway that makes sense for the data brokering industry. This is a simple \nmatter of fairness.\n  Second, we would require companies that have databases with sensitive \npersonal information on Americans to establish and implement data \nprivacy and security programs. In the digital age, any company that \nwants to be trusted by the public must earn that trust by vigilantly \nprotecting the databases they use and maintain which contain Americans' \nprivate data. They also have a responsibility in the next link in the \nsecurity chain, to make sure that contractors hired to process data are \nadequately vetted to keep the personal information in these databases \nsecure. This is increasingly important as Americans' personal \ninformation more and more is outsourced for processing overseas and \nbeyond U.S. laws.\n\n  Third, our bill requires notice when sensitive personal information \nhas been compromised. The American people have a right to know when \nthey are at risk because of corporate failures to protect their data, \nor when a criminal has infiltrated data systems. The notice rules in \nour bill were carefully crafted to ensure that the trigger for notice \nis tied to ``significant risk of harm'' with appropriate checks-and-\nbalances, in order to make sure that companies do not underreport. We \nalso recognize important fraud prevention techniques that already \nexist. But our priority has been to make sure that victims have \ncritical information as a roadmap that offers the assistance necessary \nto protect themselves, their families and their financial well-being.\n  Finally, our bill addresses the government's use of personal data. We \nare living in a world in which our government increasingly is turning \nto the private sector to get personal data the government could not \nlegally collect on its own without oversight and appropriate \nprotections. This bill would place privacy and security front and \ncenter in evaluating whether data brokers can be trusted with \ngovernment contracts that involve sensitive information about the \nAmerican people. It would require contract reviews that include these \nconsiderations, audits to ensure good practice, and contract penalties \nfor failure to protect data privacy and security.\n  This legislation meets other key goals. It provides tough monetary \nand criminal penalties for compromising personal data or failing to \nprovide necessary protections. This creates an incentive for companies \nto protect personal information, especially when there is no commercial \nrelationship between individuals and companies using their data. We \nalso would authorize an additional $100 million over four years to help \nstate law enforcement agencies fight misuse of personal information.\n  This is a solid bill--a comprehensive bill--that not only deals with \nthe need to provide Americans notice when they have already been hurt, \nbut that also deals with the underlying problem of lax security and \nlack of accountability in dealing with the public's most personal and \nprivate information.\n  I commend Senator Specter for his leadership on this emerging \nproblem. Senator Feinstein and Senator Feingold have long recognized \nthe importance of data privacy and security, and I appreciate their \nsupport in this effort and on this bill. Other members on the Commerce \nCommittee, such as Senator Nelson and Senator Cantwell, and on the \nBanking Committee, have also taken great strides in these areas as \nwell, and we look forward to working closely with them to pass \nlegislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1793. A bill to extend certain apportionments to primary airports; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nSpecter to introduce legislation that is important to a number of rural \ncommunities located in over half of the States. Our legislation will \nensure that over 50 mostly rural airports will not see an 85 percent \nreduction in their annual grant from the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's Airport Improvement Program.\n  I think all Senators are well aware of the wide-ranging impact the \ntragic events of September 11, 2001, have had throughout our economy. \nOne of the hardest hit industries has been commercial aviation, which \nis continuing to feel the effects in terms of higher costs and loss of \npassengers. Nowhere has the decline in commercial aviation been felt \nmore than in small and rural communities.\n  All across America, small communities already face growing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently depends on the quality of their airports and the\n\n[[Page S10735]]\n\navailability of scheduled air service. For small communities, airports \noften provide the critical link to the national and international \ntransportation system.\n  Ensuring small communities have the resources they need to preserve \nthis vital airport infrastructure in rural areas is the purpose of our \nbill.\n  Under current formulae for distributing Federal funds, every airport \nthat has more than 10,000 annual passenger boardings is guaranteed an \nentitlement grant from the FAA's AIP of at least $1 million per year. \nThese are called ``primary'' airports. Airports with less than 10,000 \nannual boardings receive $150,000. Unfortunately, there are a handful \nof primary airports that have had their annual boardings drop below \n10,000 as a result of the effects of 9/11. One of these airports is the \nRoswell International Air Center in my State of New Mexico.\n  For the passed two years, Congress has permitted these so called \n``virtual primary'' airports to retain their full $1 million \nentitlement, even though their annual boardings had dropped below the \n10,000 threshold as a direct result of 9/11. This two-year waiver was \nincluded in section 146 of the Vision 100 aviation reauthorization act. \n(P.L. 108-176).\n  Unfortunately, based on preliminary boarding data for 2004, there are \nstill about 50 primary airports that have not yet regained their \nprevious boarding levels. As a result, these airports will face a cut \nin their annual entitlement in FY2006 from $1 million to $150,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these likely virtual primary \nairports for fiscal year 2006 be printed in the Record.\n\n               Likely Virtual Primary Airports for FY2006\n\n       Alaska--Fort Yukon, Gustavus, Haines, Iliamna, Kodiak, \n     Metlakatla, Skagway, Merrill Field* and Manokotak*.\n       California--Imperial, Santa Rosa, Visalia.\n       Connecticut--Groton-New London.\n       Florida--Naples.\n       Georgia--Athens.\n       Iowa--Burlington, Fort Dodge.\n       Illinois--Belleville, Quincy.\n       Indiana--Lafayette.\n       Kansas--Garden City, Salina.\n       Kentucky--Owensboro.\n       Maine--Rockland*.\n       Massachusetts--Worcester.\n       Michigan--Alpena, Escanaba.\n       Minnesota--Grand Rapids, Hibbing.\n       Montana--Sidney-Richland*.\n       North Carolina--Hickory, Pinehurst/Southern Pines.\n       Nebraska--Grand Island, Kearney, Scottsbluff.\n       New Hampshire--Lebanon.\n       New Mexico--Roswell.\n       Ohio--Youngstown/Warren.\n       Oregon--Pendleton.\n       Pennsylvania--Altoona, Bradford, Brookville, Lancaster, and \n     Reading*.\n       Rhode Island--Block Island, Westerly.\n       Tennessee--Jackson.\n       Utah--Cedar City.\n       Virginia--Weyers Cave.\n       Washington--Anacortes, Moses Lake, and Port Angeles*.\n       West Virginia--Clarksburg*.\n       Wyoming--Laramie.\n       *These primary airports where above 10,000 boardings in \n     CY2003 but could lose their $1 million AIP entitlement based \n     on the preliminary CY2004 enplanements.\n       List compiled from preliminary FAA data.\n\n  The good news is a number of airports that were virtual primary \nairports in fiscal year 2005 have seen their annual boardings increase \nback above 10,000 per year. However, for this handful of airports that \nwere still below 10,000 boardings in 2004, I believe it is appropriate \nthat they have another year to regain their status as primary airports \nand not suffer the loss of 85 percent of their fiscal year 2006 annual \nentitlement grant for airport improvement projects.\n  Thus, our bill provides a simple one year extension of the existing \nlaw to preserve the airports' current level of federal funding and give \nthese mostly rural communities a little breathing room while the \nairline industry recovers from the effects of 9/11.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter and resolution from the City of \nRoswell and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material; were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              City of Roswell,\n\n                                  Roswell, NM, September 21, 2005.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The purpose of this correspondence \n     is to, on behalf of the City of Roswell, request your \n     assistance on an extremely important matter. Your time, as \n     well as that of your staff, particularly Dan Alpert, has been \n     and will continue to be most appreciated.\n       Attached is a resolution passed by our City Council on \n     Thursday, September 8th pertaining to the pending loss of our \n     annual $1 mil entitlement funds. Unless there is action \n     involving extending the passenger boarding enplanement waiver \n     as suggested, the City will only be eligible for $150,000 to \n     use for airport improvements beginning with the FY 06 Budget. \n     As far as we know we are the only Airport affected in the \n     State of New Mexico, a fact that may have been mentioned to \n     you by Councilor Judy Stubbs when she visited with you \n     recently.\n       Our request of you is that if you can influence, beginning \n     with the Senate Commerce and Transportation Committee, an \n     amendment to the FY 06 Budget to extend the enplanement \n     waiver through the FY 07 Budget, we would be most grateful. \n     Suffice is to say, the loss of almost $900,000 each year will \n     be devastating to our Airport and our economy\n       As is the case every time we approach you for assistance, \n     we are grateful for your concern and whatever assistance you \n     feel you can provide us.\n       Thank you again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill B.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to protect Social \nSecurity cost-of-living adjustments (COLA); to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am joined by several of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to introduce the Social Security COLA \nProtection Act of 2005. This legislation will provide some relief to \nseniors from rising Medicare premiums, and ensure that their Social \nSecurity cost-of-living-adjustments or COLAs are made available for \nother essential needs such as food and housing.\n  I first thank Senators Cantwell, Leahy, Corzine, Murray, Salazar, \nReed and Mikulski in joining me in this effort. Last Congress several \ncolleagues joined Senator Daschle and myself to introduce a similar \nbill. Representative Herseth in the House has introduced the companion \nbill today, and I thank her as well for her leadership on this and \nother important issues to seniors in South Dakota.\n  In my home State, 1 in 6 people are Medicare beneficiaries. That \nrepresents 16 percent of our total State population. Many of these \nindividuals live on modest fixed incomes and have to pay close \nattention to the checks they write and the groceries they buy every \nmonth. The seniors of my State are people that worked very hard all of \ntheir lives, as farmers, small business owners, teachers and parents. \nIn old age, all they are hoping for is an opportunity to live out their \nyears with a basic level of comfort and certainty.\n  Unfortunately, as the cost of health care continues to rise at \nalarming rates, it becomes more and more difficult for seniors to have \na sense of security during their retirement years. According to the \nKaiser Family Foundation, U.S. spending on health care was \napproximately $1.7 trillion in 2003, almost two and a half times the \n$696 billion spent in 1990. That $1.7 trillion represents over 15 \npercent of the gross domestic product. While spending did level off in \n2004, according to an analysis by the Center for Health System Change, \noverall health spending growth outpaced overall economic growth by 2.6 \npercent in 2004.\n  Increases in health care costs hit the pocketbooks of every American. \nRecently the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS \nannounced that the Medicare Part B premiums, which pay for seniors' \ndoctor visits and other nonhospital services, will rise 13 percent in \n2006. The 2006 increase will mark the third year in a row that \nbeneficiaries will be subjected to a rise in their premiums of more \nthan 10 percent.\n  These premium increases will come at the same time that many Medicare \nbeneficiaries will start to pay an additional premium for the Part D \nprescription drug program. Those premiums will range, averaging from \n$20 to $35 a month. Both Part D and Part B premiums will be taken from \na senior's Social Security check.\n  While seniors can expect a modest increase in their Social Security \nCOLA every year, that increase has not kept up with the pace of \nincreased health care costs and specifically Medicare premium costs. \nThis is unfortunate, and does force many seniors to have to face the \nharsh reality every year that their fixed income is shrinking as their \nhealth costs go up. This October we should learn the Social Security \nCOLA for 2006, and I fear that the combination of a modest increase and \nincreased costs for participating in Medicare Part D are going to be \ndifficult to adjust to for many seniors in South Dakota.\n  This is why I have introduced the Social Security COLA Protection Act \nof 2005, which will mandate that no more than 25 percent of a senior's \nCOLA be absorbed by the increase in Medicare premiums. This is \nimportant legislation that will protect the financial security of many \nretirees in my home State and across the country. I thank all of the \nMembers who have introduced this bill with me today and urge the rest \nof my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, and \n        Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 1796. A bill to promote the economic security and safety of \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators Leahy, \nDayton, Dodd and Corzine, I am introducing legislation that, if \nadopted, will protect and even save the lives of victims of domestic or \nsexual violence and their families. This bill, the Security and \nFinancial Empowerment (SAFE) Act, addresses the impact of domestic and \nsexual violence that extends far beyond the moment the abuse occurs.\n  I am introducing this legislation today as a tribute to Paul and \nSheila Wellstone, who were such champions for victims of domestic \nviolence. Senator Wellstone and I first introduced this legislation \ntogether in 1998. Paul's desk was just behind me here on the Senate \nfloor. I can still see him behind me waving his arms and making the \ncase for people who have no voice.\n  Not long ago, domestic violence was considered a family problem, and \nmany victims had nowhere to turn for help.\n  Today, thanks to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) we have made \ngreat progress in fighting these violent crimes. I worked to help pass \nthis landmark legislation in 1994 and I am proud to be a part of \nreauthorizing it this year. But although VAWA has been a great success \nin coordinating victims' advocates, social service providers and law \nenforcement professionals to meet immediate challenges, there is still \nwork to be done.\n  As someone who has spent my entire public life working with victims \nand experts to fight domestic violence, I am offering this bill based \non what these courageous individuals have told me they need. Financial \ninsecurity is a major factor in ongoing domestic violence. Too often, \nvictims who are not economically self sufficient are forced to choose \nbetween protecting themselves and their children and keeping a roof \nover their heads. It is critical that we help guarantee the economic \nsecurity of victims of domestic or sexual violence so that they can \nprovide permanent safety for themselves and their families and so that \nthey are not forced, because of economic dependence, to stay in an \nabusive relationship.\n  In order to do this, we must ensure that victims of domestic or \nsexual violence can seek the help they need without the fear of losing \ntheir jobs. Too many victims have been fired for missing work in order \nto find shelter or get a court restraining order, even after receiving \npermission from their employers. Today, a woman can use the Family and \nMedical Leave Act to care for a sick or injured spouse, but she cannot \nuse that act to seek protection from her abuser. The SAFE Act will \nallow victims to take time off from work without penalty in order to \nmake court appearances, seek legal assistance, and get help with safety \nplanning. For too many victims, access to these essential services can \nmean the difference between life and death.\n  Unfortunately, some victims of domestic or sexual violence are forced \nto leave their jobs and relocate to protect themselves and their \nfamilies. We must ensure the continued financial security of these \nvictims through the use of unemployment benefits. Currently, a woman \ncan receive unemployment benefits if she leaves her job because her \nhusband must relocate. But if that same woman is fleeing her husband's \nabuse, in many States she cannot receive the same benefits. Currently, \n28 States and the District of Columbia provide some type of \nunemployment assistance to victims of domestic or sexual violence. Our \nbill will ensure that assistance is available in every State, so that \nno woman has to make the tragic choice of risking her safety to protect \nher livelihood.\n  Moreover, victims must not be made silent by the fear of \ndiscrimination in employment and insurance. Punishing victims for \ncircumstances beyond their control is wrong and only helps abusers in \ntheir efforts to control their victims. Denying a woman employment\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\nbecause she is a victim of domestic violence robs her of the economic \nsecurity she needs to escape a dangerous relationship. Making insurance \ncoverage decisions based on a history of abuse only encourages women to \nlie about their victimization and avoid seeking help until it is too \nlate. The SAFE Act prohibits discrimination in employment and insurance \nbased on domestic or sexual violence, to ensure that victims are never \npunished for their abusers' crimes.\n  Sadly, domestic violence and poverty are inextricably linked, and \nmany victims of domestic or sexual violence are also recipients of \nTemporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF). Work requirements in this \nprogram often punish victims who must take time off to protect \nthemselves and their children. In 1996, Senator Paul Wellstone and I \noffered an amendment to TANF called the Family Violence Option, which \nallows States to adjust TANF work requirements for victims of domestic \nviolence. The SAFE act will strengthen the Family Violence Option, in \norder to protect some of the most economically vulnerable victims.\n  Despite the great progress that has been made, domestic violence is \nstill a serious problem in our country. Domestic violence is the \nleading cause of injury to women, and over 5.3 million incidents occur \nevery year. Domestic or sexual violence also continues to have severe \neconomic consequences, costing businesses between 3 and 5 billion \ndollars each year in lost productivity. The SAFE Act will help victims \nto escape dangerous situations and prevent abuse from occurring. This \nwill not only protect the lives of countless victims, it will allow \nthem to be more productive members of the economy.\n  I am proud of the guidance we've received from advocates in crafting \nthis legislation. I want to thank them for their efforts and their \ncommitment to breaking the cycle of violence. I want to particularly \nacknowledge the efforts of the advocates in Washington State who have \nprovided invaluable input in drafting this legislation. The support and \nleadership of our communities will help us take this critical next step \nin passing SAFE.\n  For victims of domestic violence, an abusive relationship can seem \nlike a hopeless situation. Through VAWA, we have already provided new \nhope to millions of these victims. The SAFE Act is the crucial next \nstep in ending the cycle of abuse. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and provide victims and their families with the tools they need \nfor productive, independent and most importantly, safe futures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Severability.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Domestic violence crimes account for approximately 15 \n     percent of total crime costs in the United States each year.\n       (2) Violence against women has been reported to be the \n     leading cause of physical injury to women. Such violence has \n     a devastating impact on women's physical and emotional health \n     and financial security.\n       (3) According to a recent study by the National Institutes \n     of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     each year there are 5,300,000 non-fatal violent \n     victimizations committed by intimate partners against women. \n     Female murder victims were substantially more likely than \n     male murder victims to have been killed by an intimate \n     partner. About \\1/3\\ of female murder victims, and about 4 \n     percent of male murder victims, were killed by an intimate \n     partner.\n       (4) According to recent government estimates, approximately \n     987,400 rapes occur annually in the United States, 89 percent \n     of the rapes perpetrated against female victims. Since 2001, \n     rapes have actually increased by 4 percent.\n       (5) Approximately 10,200,000 people have been stalked at \n     some time in their lives. Four out of every 5 stalking \n     victims are women. Stalkers harass and terrorize their \n     victims by spying on the victims, standing outside their \n     places of work or homes, making unwanted phone calls, sending \n     or leaving unwanted letters or items, or vandalizing \n     property.\n       (6) Employees in the United States who have been victims of \n     domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking too often suffer adverse consequences in the \n     workplace as a result of their victimization.\n       (7) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking are particularly vulnerable to changes \n     in employment, pay, and benefits as a result of their \n     victimizations, and are, therefore, in need of legal \n     protection.\n       (8) The prevalence of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, stalking, and other violence against women at \n     work is dramatic. About 36,500 individuals, 80 percent of \n     whom are women, were raped or sexually assaulted in the \n     workplace each year from 1993 through 1999. Half of all \n     female victims of violent workplace crimes know their \n     attackers. Nearly 1 out of 10 violent workplace incidents are \n     committed by partners or spouses. Women who work for State \n     and local governments suffer a higher incidence of workplace \n     assaults, including rapes, than women who work in the private \n     sector.\n       (9) Homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the \n     job. Husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 percent \n     of workplace homicides against women.\n       (10) Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of \n     employed battered women surveyed were harassed at work by \n     their abusive partners.\n       (11) According to a 1998 report of the Government \n     Accountability Office, between \\1/4\\ and \\1/2\\ of domestic \n     violence victims surveyed in 3 studies reported that the \n     victims lost a job due, at least in part, to domestic \n     violence.\n       (12) Women who have experienced domestic violence or dating \n     violence are more likely than other women to be unemployed, \n     to suffer from health problems that can affect employability \n     and job performance, to report lower personal income, and to \n     rely on welfare.\n       (13) Abusers frequently seek to control their partners by \n     actively interfering with their ability to work, including \n     preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their \n     partners at work, limiting the access of their partners to \n     cash or transportation, and sabotaging the child care \n     arrangements of their partners.\n       (14) More than \\1/2\\ of women receiving welfare have been \n     victims of domestic violence as adults and between \\1/4\\ and \n     \\1/3\\ reported being abused in the last year.\n       (15) Victims of intimate partner violence lose 8,000,000 \n     days of paid work each year, the equivalent of over 32,000 \n     full-time jobs and 5,600,000 days of household productivity.\n       (16) Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the \n     workplace, can impair an employee's work performance, require \n     time\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\n     away from work, and undermine the employee's ability to \n     maintain a job. Almost 50 percent of sexual assault survivors \n     lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the \n     assaults.\n       (17) More than 35 percent of stalking victims report losing \n     time from work due to the stalking and 7 percent never return \n     to work.\n       (18)(A) According to the National Institute of Justice, \n     crime costs an estimated $450,000,000,000 annually in medical \n     expenses, lost earnings, social service costs, pain, \n     suffering, and reduced quality of life for victims, which \n     harms the Nation's productivity and drains the Nation's \n     resources.\n       (B) Violent crime accounts for $426,000,000,000 per year of \n     this amount.\n       (C) Rape exacts the highest costs per victim of any \n     criminal offense, and accounts for $127,000,000,000 per year \n     of the amount described in subparagraph (A).\n       (19) Violent crime results in wage losses equivalent to 1 \n     percent of all United States earnings, and causes 3 percent \n     of the Nation's medical spending and 14 percent of the \n     Nation's injury-related medical spending.\n       (20) The Bureau of National Affairs has estimated that \n     domestic violence costs United States employers between \n     $3,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 annually in lost time and \n     productivity. Other reports have estimated that domestic \n     violence costs those employers between $5,800,000,000 and \n     $13,000,000,000 annually.\n       (21) United States medical costs for domestic violence have \n     been estimated to be $31,000,000,000 per year.\n       (22) Surveys of business executives and corporate security \n     directors also underscore the heavy toll that workplace \n     violence takes on women, businesses, and interstate commerce \n     in the United States.\n       (23) Ninety-four percent of corporate security and safety \n     directors at companies nationwide rank domestic violence as a \n     high security concern.\n       (24) Forty-nine percent of senior executives recently \n     surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their \n     company's productivity, 47 percent said domestic violence \n     negatively affects attendance, and 44 percent said domestic \n     violence increases health care costs.\n       (25) Only 28 States have laws that explicitly provide \n     unemployment insurance to domestic violence victims in \n     certain circumstances, and none of the laws explicitly cover \n     victims of sexual assault or stalking.\n       (26) Only 6 States provide domestic violence victims with \n     leave from work to go to court, to the doctor, or to take \n     other steps to address the domestic violence in their lives, \n     and only Maine provides such leave to victims of sexual \n     assault and stalking.\n       (27) No States prohibit employment discrimination against \n     all victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or \n     stalking. Five States have limited protections against such \n     discrimination for some victims under certain circumstances.\n       (28) Employees, including individuals participating in \n     welfare to work programs, may need to take time during \n     business hours to--\n       (A) obtain orders of protection;\n       (B) seek medical or legal assistance, counseling, or other \n     services; or\n       (C) look for housing in order to escape from domestic \n     violence.\n       (29) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, or stalking have been subjected to discrimination by \n     private and State employers, including discrimination \n     motivated by stereotypic notions about women and other \n     discrimination on the basis of sex.\n       (30) Domestic violence victims and third parties who help \n     them have been subjected to discriminatory practices by \n     health, life, disability, and property and casualty insurers, \n     and employers who self-insure employee benefits, who have \n     denied or canceled coverage, rejected claims, and raised \n     rates based on domestic violence. Although some State \n     legislatures have tried to address those practices, the scope \n     of protection afforded by the laws adopted varies from State \n     to State, with many failing to address the problem \n     comprehensively. Moreover, Federal law prevents States from \n     protecting the almost 40 percent of employees whose employers \n     self-insure employee benefits.\n       (31) Existing Federal law does not explicitly--\n       (A) authorize victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work \n     to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or \n     assistance with safety planning activities;\n       (B) address the eligibility of victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking for \n     unemployment compensation;\n       (C) prohibit employment discrimination against actual or \n     perceived victims of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, or stalking; or\n       (D) prohibit insurers and employers who self-insure \n     employee benefits from--\n       (i) discriminating against domestic violence victims and \n     those who help them in determining eligibility for coverage, \n     rates charged, and standards for payment of claims; or\n       (ii) disclosing information about abuse and the location of \n     the victims through insurance databases and other means.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to prohibit outbound call telemarketing to individuals eligible to \nreceive benefits under title XVIII of such Act; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Medicare Do Not Call Act, to prohibit private insurance companies \nfrom telemarketing their Medicare prescription drug and Medicare \nAdvantage plans to Medicare beneficiaries. I am very pleased to be \nintroducing this bill along with my colleagues, Senators Johnson and \nLautenberg. I thank my colleagues for their support of this important \nlegislation.\n  Beginning this Saturday, October 1, private insurance plans offering \nMedicare prescription drug coverage will begin marketing their products \nto Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Depending on which Medicare region they live in, beneficiaries will \nbe confronted with selecting from as many as 20 stand-alone \nprescription different plans. In New Jersey, beneficiaries will choose \namong 17 different plans. Under current law, these plans can both send \nmail to and call seniors and people with disabilities who are eligible \nto enroll in the Medicare Part D benefit. As a result, in addition to \nbeing flooded with mail, our seniors and disabled will be flooded with \nphone calls.\n  I am extremely concerned that permitting plans to telemarket creates \ngreat potential for unscrupulous individuals and businesses to defraud \nthis vulnerable population. Even if the plans themselves are honest \nbrokers, it may be difficult for a senior or disabled beneficiary to \ndistinguish between who is honest and who is not.\n  I am very concerned that such individuals may seize the opportunity \nto take advantage of this vulnerable population. Unless we act now, \nthere will be an endless potential for fraud and identity theft within \nthe Medicare Part D plan.\n  Beneficiaries are already confused about what their rights are with \nrespect to the new prescription drug benefit. A senior who is told that \nshe must provide her Social Security or credit card number to a \ntelemarketer in order to obtain Medicare prescription drug coverage may \nfeel compelled to do so, lest she forgo her opportunity to obtain \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Concerns about telemarketing fraud against seniors are very real. The \nDepartment of Justice estimates that telemarketing crooks cheat one out \nof six consumers every year, resulting in costs to Americans of $40 \nbillion a year. Americans over 65, our Nation's seniors, are the \nprimary target of these scams.\n  At a time when identity theft is at an all time high, the Federal \ngovernment should take every precaution available to protect the \nAmerican public. We should not permit government-sponsored programs, \nsuch as the Medicare prescription drug program, to engage in \ntelemarketing. The best way to prevent such fraud from occurring is to \nprohibit telemarketing of any and all Medicare sponsored prescription \ndrug products. The Medicare Do Not Call Act will do just that. My \nlegislation imposes serious criminal penalties on unscrupulous \nindividuals and companies that seek to defraud Medicare beneficiaries \nthrough telemarketing appeals. We must do everything we can to protect \nthis vulnerable population.\n  The bottom line is that telemarketing simply is not necessary to \neducate seniors about their prescription drug options. My legislation \npermits insurance companies who are contacted by beneficiaries to \ndiscuss plan options with them. As beneficiaries talk to trusted \nfriends and organizations and read over the literature about the \ndifferent drugs plans, they can then contact plans to discuss their \noptions further. My legislation does not stop beneficiaries from \nspeaking to these companies; it simply prohibits these companies from \nmaking the initial `cold call' to beneficiaries.\n  I deeply believe that the Federal government has a responsibility to \ndo everything in its power to prevent telemarketing fraud. Permitting \ndrug plans to telemarket to seniors and people with disabilities may \nprovide a source of information to these individuals; however, because \neach plan wants to sell their own products, telemarketers may not \nprovide the most objective information about a beneficiary's options.\n  There are better ways to educate seniors and disabled about the \nprescription drug benefit. The Medicare Do Not Call Act provides \nadditional resources--$2 per Medicare beneficiary--to the State Health \nInsurance Counseling and Assistance Programs (SHIPs) to provide \ncounseling and enrollment assistance services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. SHIPs provide valuable objective information to \nbeneficiaries and can provide tremendous assistance in helping \nbeneficiaries select the plan that best suits their needs.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. By prohibiting these un-invited calls we can protect \nseniors and other Medicare beneficiaries from fraudulent intentions and \nensure that this complicated transition within the Medicare program be \nas straightforward, and safe, as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1798\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that the reductions in Social Security benefits which are \nrequired in the case of spouses and surviving spouses who are also \nreceiving certain government pensions shall be equal to the amount by \nwhich two-thirds of the total amount of the combined monthly benefit \n(before reduction) and monthly pension exceeds $1,200, adjusted for \ninflation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \nis very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland \nand very important to government workers and retirees across the \nNation. I am reintroducing a bill to modify a cruel rule of government \nthat is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying the benefits \nof their hard work during retirement. My bill has bipartisan support \nand had 29 cosponsors last year. With this strong bipartisan support, I \nhope that we can correct this cruel rule of government this year.\n  Under current law, a Social Security spousal benefit is reduced or \nentirely eliminated if the surviving spouse is eligible for a pension \nfrom a local, State or Federal Government job that was not covered by \nSocial Security. This policy is known as the Government Pension Offset.\n  This is how the current law works. Consider a surviving spouse who \nretires from government service and receives a government pension of \n$600 a month. She also qualifies for a Social Security spousal benefit \nof $645 a month. Because of the Pension Offset law, which reduces her \nSocial Security benefit by 2/3 of her government pension, her spousal \nbenefit is reduced to $245 a month. So instead of $1,245, she will \nreceive only $845 a month. That is $400 a month less to pay the rent, \npurchase a prescription medication, or buy groceries. I think that is \nwrong.\n  My bill does not repeal the government pension offset entirely, but \nit will allow retirees to keep more of what they deserve. It guarantees \nthat those subject to the offset can keep at least $1,200 a month in \ncombined retirement income. With my modification, the 2/3 offset would \napply only to the combined benefit that exceeds $1,200 a month. So, in \nthe example above, the surviving spouse would face only a $30 offset, \nallowing her to keep $1,215 in monthly income.\n  Unfortunately, the current law disproportionately affects women. \nWomen are more likely to receive Social Security spousal benefits and \nto have worked in low-paying or short-term government positions while \nthey were raising families. It is also true that women receive smaller \ngovernment pensions because of their lower earnings, and rely on Social \nSecurity benefits to a greater degree. My modification will allow these \nwomen who have contributed years of important government service and \nfamily service to rely on a larger amount of retirement income.\n  Why do we punish people who have committed a significant portion of \ntheir lives to government service? We are talking about workers who \nprovide some of the most important services to our community--teachers, \nfirefighters, and many others. Some have already retired. Others are \ncurrently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These \nindividuals deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the \nPension Offset currently requires.\n  Government employees work hard in service to our Nation, and I work \nhard for them. I do not want to see them penalized simply because they \nhave chosen to work in the public sector, rather than for a private \nemployer, and often at lower salaries and sometimes fewer benefits. If \na retired worker in the private sector received a pension, and also \nreceived a spousal Social Security benefit, they would not be subject \nto the Offset. I think we should be looking for ways to reward \ngovernment service, not the other way around. I believe that people who \nwork hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane, \nlegislative technicalities.\n  Frankly, I would like to repeal the offset altogether. But, I realize \nthat budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, I hope \nwe can agree that retirees who have worked hard all their lives should \nnot have this offset applied until their combined monthly benefit, both \ngovernment pension and Social Security spousal benefit, exceeds $1,200.\n  I also strongly believe that we should ensure that retirees buying \npower keeps up with the cost of living. That's why I have also included \na provision in this legislation to index the $1,200 amount to inflation \nso retirees will see their minimum benefits increase along with the \ncost of living.\n  The Social Security Administration recently estimated that enacting \nthe provisions contained in my bill will have a minimal long-term \nimpact on the Social Security Trust Fund--about 0.01 percent of taxable \npayroll.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and support my \nlegislation to modify the Government Pension Offset. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by section 2 shall apply with respect \n     to monthly insurance benefits payable under title II of the \n     Social Security Act for months after December 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 1800. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe new markets tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould re-authorize the New Markets Tax Credit for five additional \nyears. I'd like to thank the Senator from West Virginia, Jay \nRockefeller, for cosponsoring this legislation, as well as Senator Jim \nBunning. Their strong support is appreciated, and this program will \nhelp revitalize many communities all across America.\n  The New Markets Tax Credit was enacted in December 2000 as part of \nthe Community Renewal Tax Relief Act and offers a seven-year, 39 \npercent Federal credit made through investment vehicles known as \nCommunity Development Entities (CDEs). CDEs combine private investment \ndollars with capital\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nraised through the incentive to make loans to or investments in \nbusinesses in low-income communities.\n  In its brief period of existence, the New Markets Tax Credit has had \na tremendous success in strengthening and revitalizing communities. In \nMaine, Coastal Enterprises, Inc. issued a $31.5 million long-term NMTC \nloan to Katahdin Forest Management, which provided additional working \ncapital for two large pulp and paper mills. These investments resulted \nin the direct employment of 650 people and potential jobs for another \n200. The Katahdin Project has helped to diversify the area economy \nthrough the development of new, high-value wood processing enterprises \nand recreational tourism.\n  CDEs have also invested in a new child care facility on Chicago's \nwest side, the first new supermarket and shopping center in inner-city \nCleveland in 30 years and a new aerospace facility in rural Oklahoma.\n  All of these projects demonstrate the revitalization and \nstrengthening of communities that the Credit is helping to make \npossible. In only 3 years, CDEs have raised $2 billion of capital for \ndirect investment in economically distressed communities across the \nNation. This impressive activity over a short period of time points to \nthe need and opportunity for such investment in low-income communities.\n  Unfortunately, as effective as the New Markets Tax Credit has been, \ndemand for the incentive has far exceeded supply. In fact, the average \ndemand in the first three rounds was a staggering 10 times the amount \nof available credits. The Treasury Department awarded the first round \nof $2.5 billion in tax credits in March 2003, a second round of $3.5 \nbillion in May 2004, and a third round worth $2 billion in May 2005.\n  Despite the track record of the New Markets Tax Credit and continued \ndemand for the incentive, it will expire at the end of 2007. Congress \nmust reauthorize this Credit to ensure investment capital continues to \nflow to our most disadvantaged communities. Our bill renews this \nvaluable incentive for 5 additional years, through 2012, with an annual \ncredit volume of $3.5 billion per year, adjusted for inflation.\n  It is critical that Congress act to renew the New Markets Tax Credit. \nIt is a modest incentive that clearly works for our most vulnerable \ncommunities. I look forward to working with Finance Committee Chairman \nGrassley to re-authorize the Credit and to ensure that it includes all \nareas of the country, including rural areas underserved by traditional \ninvestments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1800\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``New Markets Tax Credit \n     Reauthorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Extension.--\n       (1) In general.--Paragraph (1) of section 45D(f) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to new markets tax \n     credit) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--There is a new markets tax credit \n     limitation of $3,500,000,000 for each of calendar years 2008 \n     through 2012.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Paragraph (3) of section 45D(f) \n     of such Code is amended by striking ``2014'' and inserting \n     ``2019''.\n       (b) Inflation Adjustment.--Subsection (f) of section 45D of \n     such Code is amended by inserting at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) Inflation adjustment.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of any calendar year \n     beginning after 2008, the dollar amount in paragraph (1) \n     shall be increased by an amount equal to--\n       ``(i) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year, determined by \n     substituting `calendar year 2007' for `calendar year 1992' in \n     subparagraph (B) thereof.\n       ``(B) Rounding rule.--If a dollar amount in paragraph (1), \n     as increased under subparagraph (A), is not a multiple of \n     $1,000,000, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest \n     multiple of $1,000,000.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Allard, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Mr. Bond, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Chafee, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 1801. A bill to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act \nto reauthorize the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce, along with Senators Allard, \nCollins, Sarbanes, Bond, Murray, Chafee, Mikulski, Dodd, Akaka, \nSchumer, Corzine, Landrieu, and Clinton, the Community Partnership to \nEnd Homelessness Act of 2005 (CPEHA). This legislation would \nreauthorize and amend the housing titles of the McKinney-Vento Homeless \nAssistance Act of 1987. Specifically, our bill would realign the \nincentives behind the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \nhomelessness assistance programs to accomplish the goals of preventing \nand ending long-term homelessness.\n  During the past several weeks, stark pictures of the reality faced by \nmany in the wake of Hurricane Katrina have made more of the country \naware of the day-to-day pressures faced by those who are homeless. \nUnfortunately, as many as 3.5 million Americans experience homelessness \neach year. Ten to 20 percent are homeless for long periods of time. \nMany of these Americans have severe disabilities. Many have worn a \nuniform for our country, with the Veterans Administration estimating \nthat at least 500,000 veterans experience homelessness over the course \nof a year. Statistics regarding the number of children who experience \nhomelessness are especially troubling. More than one million children \nexperience homelessness each year; that is one in ten poor children in \nthe United States. We have learned that children who are homeless are \nin poorer health, have developmental delays, and achieve less in school \nthan children who have homes.\n  Many of those who are homeless have a simple problem--they cannot \nafford housing. Using the most recent census data, 56 percent of \nextremely low-income families are paying more than half their income \nfor housing. Between 1990 and 2000, shortages of affordable housing for \nthese families worsened in 44 of the 50 States. In 2000, it was \nestimated that 4.6 million units of low-income housing would need to be \ncreated in order to take care of this problem. As rents have soared and \naffordable housing units have disappeared from the market during the \npast five years, even more working Americans have been left unable to \nafford housing.\n  So why should the Federal Government work to help prevent and end \nhomelessness? Simply put, we cannot afford not to solve this problem. \nHomelessness leads to untold costs, including expenses for emergency \nrooms, jails and shelters, foster care, detoxification, and emergency \nmental health treatment. It has been almost twenty years since the \npassage of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, and we \nhave learned a lot about the problem of homelessness since then.\n  There is a growing consensus on ways to help communities break the \ncycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness. If we combine Federal \ndollars with the right incentives to local communities, we can end \nlong-term homelessness. This bipartisan legislation will do just that. \nIt will reward communities for initiatives that prevent homelessness, \npromote the development of permanent supportive housing, and optimize \nself-sufficiency.\n  The Community Partnership to Help End Homelessness Act of 2005 will \nset us on the path to meeting an important national goal. I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this bill and other homelessness \nprevention efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Community \nPartnership to Help End Homelessness Act of 2005 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nCommunity Partnership to End Homeless Act of 2005. I am proud to be an \noriginal co-sponsor of this legislation because I believe that this \nbill will greatly assist the Nation's efforts on ending the long-\nstanding tragedy of homelessness. I applaud the hard work of the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee's Housing \nand Transportation Subcommittee, Senators Allard and Reed for \ndeveloping this important legislation.\n  As a former member of the Banking Committee, former chair of the VA-\nHUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, and now the \ncurrent chair of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, HUD, and \nRelated Agencies (TTHUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, the issue of \nhomelessness has been one of my main priorities. During my tenure on \nthose subcommittees, I have learned a great deal about the causes of \nhomelessness. The causes are varied ranging from the lack of affordable \nhousing to mental or physical ailments to unforeseen economic problems.\n  The good news is that since the Congress first created the McKinney-\nVento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987, there has been a great deal of \nresearch on homelessness and new approaches have been developed to \nsolve homelessness. The most significant finding is the importance of \npermanent housing in ending homelessness. Due to this finding, I \nincluded a provision in the fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations Act that required HUD to spend at least 30 \npercent of the homeless assistance grant funds on permanent housing.\n  Re-focusing HUD on permanent housing was something that senators on \nboth sides of the aisle strongly and rightfully support. The 30 percent \npermanent housing set-aside requirement was established because HUD was \nnot producing enough housing for homeless people. This was a problem \nbecause HUD is the only federal agency that provides permanent housing.\n  By 1998, just prior to the enactment of the 30 percent set-aside, \nonly 13 percent of HUD homeless grant funds were being spent on \npermanent housing. Therefore, the 30 percent set-aside was created to \nre-balance HUD's homeless programs so that permanent housing was being \nprovided. And, the set-aside has not hurt funding for supportive \nservices since we have continually increased the HUD homeless account \nand the Administration has worked with other agencies, such as HHS and \nVA, to ensure that they are providing services to homeless people. In \nthe Senate's fiscal year 2006 TTHUD bill, we have provided a $174 \nmillion increase over fiscal year 2005 for the HUD homeless account.\n  The focus on permanent housing was backed by sound research that \ndemonstrated the cost-effectiveness of this approach. By focusing on \npermanent housing and especially those who were chronically homeless, \nHUD's programs became correctly focused on those most needy of this \nassistance, such as disabled homeless veterans. For those reasons, I am \nextremely pleased and supportive of the bill's provision that requires \nHUD to use at least 30 percent of funds for permanent housing \nactivities. This provision is probably the most important piece of this \nlegislation.\n  In addition to the permanent housing requirement, I strongly support \nthe bill's provisions that require outcome-based performance \nevaluations, promote access to mainstream resources for supportive \nservices, and consolidate HUD's competitive grant programs. I \nespecially support the bill's efforts to encourage localities and \ngrantees to participate and use the Homeless Management Information \nSystem (HMIS), which was initiated by Senator Mikulski and me in the \nfiscal year 2001 VA-HUD and Independent Appropriations Act. I am proud \nthat the vast majority\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nof continuum-of-care grantees have implemented the HMIS. This system is \nabsolutely critical for developing an unduplicated count of homeless \npeople and an analysis of their patterns of use of federal assistance \nprograms.\n  This is a strong bill supported by members on both sides of the \naisle. I hope that the Senate and the Congress can pass important \nlegislation because this bill will help eliminate the tragedy of \nhomelessness. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1802. All to provide for appropriate waivers, suspensions, or \nexemptions from provisions of title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 with respect to individual account plans affected \nby Hurricane Katrina or Rita; read the first time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President I rise to introduce the Pension Flexibility \nin Natural Disasters Act of 2005. The bill provides appropriate \nwaivers, suspensions or exemptions from the provisions of title I of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, with \nrespect to individual account plans affected by Hurricane Katrina or \nRita.\n  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have brought terrible devastation in the \ngulf coast. Not only have so many homes in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama and Texas been destroyed but many businesses have been \ndestroyed as well.\n  Any business that maintains a pension or retirement plan for their \nworkers is subject to certain reporting, disclosure and fiduciary \nprovisions of ERISA as well as being subject to the pertinent \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code. ERISA sets up many \nrequirements and deadlines that businesses simply cannot meet due to \nthe devastation of their businesses and the destruction of all of their \nrecords.\n  This bill postpones reporting requirements for businesses that have \nbeen adversely affected by storms in these presidentially-declared \ndisaster areas. It also will facilitate getting individuals access to \ntheir retirement savings in the form of hardship loans or distributions \nby allowing plan fiduciaries flexibility in making those distributions \nin view of these terrible disasters.\n  I hope my colleague will join me in supporting this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pension Flexibility in \n     Natural Disasters Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR, SECRETARY OF THE \n                   TREASURY, AND THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY \n                   CORPORATION.\n\n       The Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, and \n     the Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation shall exercise their authority under section 518 \n     of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 \n     U.S.C. 1148) and section 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 to postpone certain deadlines by reason of the \n     Presidentially declared disaster areas in Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and elsewhere, due to the effect \n     of Hurricane Katrina or Rita. The Secretaries and the \n     Executive Director of the Corporation shall issue guidance as \n     soon as is practicable to plan sponsors and participants \n     regarding extension of deadlines and rules applicable to \n     these extraordinary circumstances. Nothing in this section \n     shall be construed to relieve any plan sponsor from any \n     requirement to pay benefits or make contributions under the \n     plan of the sponsor.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 260\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Azerbaijan is scheduled to hold \n     elections for its parliament, the Milli Majlis, in November \n     2005;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan has enjoyed a strong relationship with \n     the United States since its independence from the former \n     Soviet Union in 1991;\n       Whereas international observers monitoring Azerbaijan's \n     October 2003 presidential election found that the pre-\n     election, election day, and post-election environments fell \n     short of international standards;\n       Whereas the International Election Observation Mission \n     (IEOM) in Baku, Azerbaijan, deployed by the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of \n     Europe, found that there were numerous instances of violence \n     by both members of the opposition and government forces;\n       Whereas the international election observers also found \n     inequality and irregularities in campaign and election \n     conditions, including intimidation against opposition \n     supporters, restrictions on political rallies by opposition \n     candidates, and voting fraud;\n       Whereas Azerbaijan freely accepted a series of commitments \n     on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law when that \n     country joined the OSCE as a participating State in 1992;\n       Whereas, following the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1358 (2004) demanding \n     that the Government of Azerbaijan immediately implement a \n     series of steps that included the release of political \n     prisoners, investigation of election fraud, and the creation \n     of public service television to allow all political parties \n     to better communicate with the people of Azerbaijan;\n       Whereas, since the 2003 presidential election, the \n     Government of Azerbaijan has taken some positive steps by \n     releasing some political prisoners and working to create \n     public service television;\n       Whereas the United States supports the promotion of \n     democracy and transparent, free, and fair elections \n     consistent with the commitments of Azerbaijan as a \n     participating State of the OSCE;\n       Whereas the United States is working with the Government of \n     Azerbaijan, the political opposition, civil society, the \n     OSCE, the Council of Europe, and other countries to \n     strengthen the electoral process of Azerbaijan through \n     diplomatic efforts and non-partisan assistance programs, \n     including support for international and domestic election \n     observers, voter education and election information \n     initiatives, training for candidates and political parties, \n     and training for judges and lawyers on the adjudication of \n     election disputes;\n       Whereas the Government of the United States has awarded a \n     contract to conduct exit polling throughout Azerbaijan;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and opportunity to exercise \n     their civil and political rights, free from intimidation, \n     undue influence, threats of political retribution, or other \n     forms of coercion by national or local authorities or others;\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires \n     government and public authorities to ensure that candidates \n     and political parties enjoy equal treatment before the law \n     and that government resources are not employed to the \n     advantage of individual candidates or political parties; and\n       Whereas the establishment of a transparent, free and fair \n     election process for the 2005 parliamentary elections is an \n     important step in Azerbaijan's progress toward full \n     integration into the democratic community of nations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan \n     to hold orderly, peaceful, and free and fair parliamentary \n     elections in November 2005 in order to ensure the long-term \n     growth and stability of the country;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     the full participation of opposition parties in the upcoming \n     elections, including members of opposition parties arrested \n     in the months leading up to the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections;\n       (3) calls upon the opposition parties to fully and \n     peacefully participate in the November 2005 parliamentary \n     elections, and calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to \n     create the conditions for the participation on equal grounds \n     of all viable candidates;\n       (4) believes it is critical that the November 2005 \n     parliamentary elections be viewed by the people of Azerbaijan \n     as free and fair, and that all sides refrain from violence \n     during the campaign, on election day, and following the \n     election;\n       (5) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     election monitors from the Office for Democratic Institutions \n     and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Azeri political parties, \n     representatives of candidates, nongovernmental organizations, \n     and other private institutions and organizations, both \n     foreign and domestic, unimpeded access to all aspects of the \n     election process;\n       (6) supports recommendations made by the Council of Europe \n     on amendments to the Unified Election Code of Azerbaijan, \n     specifically to ensure equitable representation of opposition \n     and pro-government forces in all election commissions;\n       (7) urges the international community and domestic \n     nongovernmental organizations to provide a sufficient number \n     of election observers to ensure credible monitoring and \n     reporting of the November 2005 parliamentary elections;\n       (8) recognizes the need for the establishment of an \n     independent media and assurances by the Government of \n     Azerbaijan that freedom of the press will be guaranteed; and\n       (9) calls upon the Government of Azerbaijan to guarantee \n     freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10760-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 261--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  CRISIS OF HURRICANE KATRINA SHOULD NOT BE USED TO WEAKEN, WAIVE, OR \n   ROLL BACK FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL \n          JUSTICE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Obama, Mrs. Boxer, \nand Mr. Jeffords) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                              S. Res. 261\n\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the Gulf Region \n     on August 29, 2005, destroying property, causing massive \n     floods, and resulting in more than $35,000,000,000 in insured \n     property losses and over 1,000 deaths;\n       Whereas expeditiously rebuilding those areas affected by \n     Hurricane Katrina and providing the victims of the storm with \n     normalcy and relief must be the top priorities for Congress;\n       Whereas Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff \n     recently commented, ``We are going to have to clean probably \n     the greatest environmental mess we have ever seen in the \n     country as a result of Hurricane Katrina'';\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina demonstrates the connection \n     between the health and safety of communities and the health \n     of natural resources;\n       Whereas many of the hardest hit areas in New Orleans and \n     the Gulf Coast from Hurricane Katrina were low-income and \n     minority communities already facing decades of environmental \n     injustices;\n       Whereas at least 9 major oil spills, and scores of smaller \n     oil and hazardous substance spills, leaks, and other releases \n     have occurred;\n       Whereas 60 underground storage tanks, hazardous waste \n     storage facilities, and industrial facilities, and 5 \n     Superfund sites in New Orleans were hit by Hurricane Katrina, \n     yet monitoring reported to date has only been conducted at a \n     handful of sites for a limited number of contaminants;\n       Whereas nearly 1,000 drinking-water systems were disabled \n     or impaired because of power outages or structural damage, \n     many people have been told to boil their water, and safe \n     drinking water may not be available for the entire population \n     for years to come;\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency's initial water \n     quality tests found that flood water in New Orleans contains \n     10 times more E. Coli bacteria than the Agency considers safe \n     for human contact and lead concentrations that exceed \n     drinking water standards, and the mix of contaminants poses a \n     serious disease risk to those wading through the filthy \n     water;\n       Whereas proper implementation and enforcement of Federal \n     public health and environmental regulations are necessary to \n     protect human health, especially among vulnerable \n     populations, and are necessary in times of emergency to \n     ensure that the response to a disaster does not exacerbate \n     the initial impact;\n       Whereas major industrial facilities and toxic waste sites \n     disproportionately impact low-income individuals, minorities, \n     children, the elderly, and all underserved communities;\n       Whereas more than 1 in 4 Americans, including 10,000,000 \n     children, live within 4 miles of a Superfund site, which \n     poses serious public health issues when sites are not cleaned \n     up adequately and in a timely manner;\n       Whereas the health of low-income and minority communities \n     continues to suffer, largely because of the cumulative impact \n     of all sources of pollution on public health in the acute \n     impact area and the failure to consider cumulative impacts \n     upon siting of new industrial facilities and cleanup of \n     existing toxic communities;\n       Whereas the addition of poor environmental protection and \n     enforcement to existing health vulnerabilities has only \n     exacerbated the conditions in these communities, which often \n     suffer from higher rates of illness and death in comparison \n     with middle-class, suburban, and more affluent communities;\n       Whereas Federal public health and environmental laws \n     provide many opportunities to address environmental risks and \n     hazards in minority and low-income communities if applied and \n     implemented;\n       Whereas Executive Order 12898 states that each Federal \n     agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its \n     mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, \n     disproportionately high and adverse human health or \n     environmental effects of its programs, policies, and \n     activities on minority and low-income populations;\n       Whereas in 2005, the Congress passed and President Bush \n     signed into law (Public Law 109-54) language prohibiting the \n     Environmental Protection Agency from using appropriated funds \n     to work in contravention of Executive Order 12898 and further \n     delay the implementation of this Order, which is critical to \n     achieving environmental and health equity across all \n     community lines;\n       Whereas environmental cleanup of affected areas must be \n     done in an effective and timely manner to ensure the victims \n     of Hurricane Katrina can return to their homes without \n     enduring preventable environmental or health risks; and\n       Whereas weakening, waiving, and rolling back Federal public \n     health and environmental protections would further threaten \n     the heavily-damaged area of the Gulf Coast, negatively impact \n     the public health of the already most-affected communities, \n     and put public health and the environment at greater future \n     risk at the expense of all communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the crisis of Hurricane Katrina and other such \n     disasters should not be used to weaken, waive, or roll back \n     Federal public health, environmental, and environmental \n     justice laws and regulations;\n       (2) State, local, and regional authorities must retain \n     their authority for compliance and permitting of industrial \n     and other facilities, and their role in enforcing and \n     implementing monitoring and cleanup regulations;\n       (3) testing, monitoring, cleanup, and recovery in the \n     region hit by Hurricane Katrina and other areas of national \n     emergency--\n       (A) should be completed in a manner designed to protect \n     public health and the environment and ensure habitability of \n     the region and mitigate against the effects of future storms; \n     and\n       (B) should be carried out in compliance with Executive \n     Order 12898; and\n       (4) the Federal rebuilding of communities and the economy \n     of the Gulf Region should be a model of the integrated, \n     diverse, and sustainable society that all people in the \n     United States desire and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10760-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10760-S10761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 55--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \nREGARDING THE CONDITIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME A SIGNATORY TO \n  ANY MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE RESULTING FROM THE WORLD TRADE \n              ORGANIZATION'S DOHA DEVELOPMENT AGENDA ROUND\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Baucus, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Reed, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Specter, Mr. Levin, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Byrd, Mrs. \nDole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Shelby, Ms.\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\nCollins, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Graham, Mr. Reid, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Santorum, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution;

Con. Res. 55\n\n       Whereas members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are \n     currently engaged in a round of trade negotiations known as \n     the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round);\n       Whereas the Doha Round includes negotiations aimed at \n     clarifying and improving disciplines under the Agreement on \n     Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Antidumping Agreement) and the \n     Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (Subsidies \n     Agreement);\n       Whereas the WTO Ministerial Declaration adopted on November \n     14, 2001 (WTO Paper No. WT/MIN(01)/DEC/1) specifically \n     provides that the Doha Round negotiations are to preserve the \n     ``basic concepts, principles and effectiveness'' of the \n     Antidumping Agreement and the Subsidies Agreement;\n       Whereas in section 2102(b)(14)(A) of the Bipartisan Trade \n     Promotion Authority Act of 2002, the Congress mandated that \n     the principal negotiating objective of the United States with \n     respect to trade remedy laws was to ``preserve the ability of \n     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws . . . \n     and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, \n     especially dumping and subsidies'';\n       Whereas the countries that have been the most persistent \n     and egregious violators of international fair trade rules are \n     engaged in an aggressive effort to significantly weaken the \n     disciplines provided in the Antidumping Agreement and the \n     Subsidies Agreement and undermine the ability of the United \n     States to effectively enforce its trade remedy laws;\n       Whereas chronic violators of fair trade disciplines have \n     put forward proposals that would substantially weaken United \n     States trade remedy laws and practices, including mandating \n     that unfair trade orders terminate after a set number of \n     years even if unfair trade and injury are likely to recur, \n     mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than the full \n     margin of dumping or subsidization, mandating higher de \n     minimis levels of unfair trade, making cumulation of the \n     effects of imports from multiple countries more difficult in \n     unfair trade investigations, outlawing the critical practice \n     of ``zeroing'' in antidumping investigations, mandating the \n     weighing of causes, and mandating other provisions that make \n     it more difficult to prove injury;\n       Whereas United States trade remedy laws have already been \n     significantly weakened by numerous unjust and activist WTO \n     dispute settlement decisions which have created new \n     obligations to which the United States never agreed;\n       Whereas trade remedy laws remain a critical resource for \n     American manufacturers, agricultural producers, and \n     aquacultural producers in responding to closed foreign \n     markets, subsidized imports, and other forms of unfair trade, \n     particularly in the context of the challenges currently faced \n     by these vital sectors of the United States economy;\n       Whereas the United States had a current account trade \n     deficit of approximately $668,000,000,000 in 2004, including \n     a trade deficit of almost $162,000,000,000 with China alone, \n     as well as a trade deficit of $40,000,000,000 in advanced \n     technology;\n       Whereas United States manufacturers have lost over \n     3,000,000 jobs since June 2000, and United States \n     manufacturing employment is currently at its lowest level \n     since 1950;\n       Whereas many industries critical to United States national \n     security are at severe risk from unfair foreign competition; \n     and\n       Whereas the Congress strongly believes that the proposals \n     put forward by countries seeking to undermine trade remedy \n     disciplines in the Doha Round would result in serious harm to \n     the United States economy, including significant job losses \n     and trade disadvantages: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     agreement or protocol with respect to the Doha Development \n     Round of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or any \n     other bilateral or multilateral trade negotiations, that--\n       (A) adopts any proposal to lessen the effectiveness of \n     domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions, including proposals--\n       (i) mandating that unfair trade orders terminate after a \n     set number of years even if unfair trade and injury are \n     likely to recur;\n       (ii) mandating that trade remedy duties reflect less than \n     the full margin of dumping or subsidization;\n       (iii) mandating higher de minimis levels of unfair trade;\n       (iv) making cumulation of the effects of imports from \n     multiple countries more difficult in unfair trade \n     investigations;\n       (v) outlawing the critical practice of ``zeroing'' in \n     antidumping investigations; or\n       (vi) mandating the weighing of causes or other provisions \n     making it more difficult to prove injury in unfair trade \n     cases; and\n       (B) would lessen in any manner the ability of the United \n     States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including the \n     antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws;\n       (2) the United States trade laws and international rules \n     appropriately serve the public interest by offsetting \n     injurious unfair trade, and that further ``balancing \n     modifications'' or other similar provisions are unnecessary \n     and would add to the complexity and difficulty of achieving \n     relief against injurious unfair trade practices; and\n       (3) the United States should ensure that any new agreement \n     relating to international disciplines on unfair trade or \n     safeguard provisions fully rectifies and corrects decisions \n     by WTO dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body that \n     have unjustifiably and negatively impacted, or threaten to \n     negatively impact, United States law or practice, including a \n     law or practice with respect to foreign dumping or \n     subsidization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/29/senate-section/article/S10761-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10761-S10762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1882.
