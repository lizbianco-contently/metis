Mr. President, this morning we are returning to the budget \nresolution for what we hope will be the final day. Chairman Gregg and \nSenator Conrad will be managing the time until 10:30 a.m. At 10:30, we \nhave an order for a series of four stacked votes. The first two are on \nthe debt limit extension, and the last two votes are in relation to the \navian flu amendments to the budget resolution. The two managers will \nthen control the remaining time until 1:30 this afternoon when all time \nexpires.\n  At 1:30 today, we begin disposing of the pending amendments and any \nadditional amendments that are offered. This is the beginning of the \nso-called vote-arama. This is a difficult process. These votes will \nlikely continue for a while today and possibly into the evening. I urge \nmy colleagues to remain in or around the Chamber.\n  I was talking to the Democratic manager, and we both agreed, as does \nthe Republican manager, that our colleagues must and we encourage them \nto show restraint during the day and recognize not every amendment \nneeds to be offered. Yesterday, Senators missed some votes because they \ndid not show up on time. The managers will be very clear in terms of \nhow much time is allowed for each vote. We encourage Members to stay \nclose to the Chamber so they do not miss the votes. The only way to \nfinish the budget is to have that discipline and not to drag the votes \non for 15 minutes or more. I also encourage Members to rethink whether \nthey need to offer their amendments, as I stated earlier.\n  Finally, I note that we have some nominations to consider before we \nadjourn. On the list of nominations are two district judges we will \nfinish. If votes are needed, then we will need to schedule those votes \nwith the budget votes as well. However, I hope we can work on a \nnominations list that will be agreed to by unanimous consent.\n  I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad for their efforts so far. I \nthank everyone in advance for their patience during this budget \nprocess.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3133\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment on avian flu. I \noffered this same amendment in the committee because after testimony by \nSecretary Leavitt before the Committee on the Budget, we are clearly \nstill unprepared to meet any potential pandemic.\n  Here is what the U.N. said on March 9:\n\n       ``Bird flu is likely to spread to birds in the United \n     States within six months and could produce an epidemic among \n     humans `at any time,' said a U.N. official. The prediction by \n     David Nabarro was the first by a top global health official \n     pinpointing when birds carrying the flu will arrive in the \n     lower 48 States.''\n\n  He went on to say, and I hope my colleagues and their staffs are \nlistening:\n\n       ``There will be a pandemic sooner or later,'' Nabarro said. \n     ``It could start any time. We have a virus capable of \n     replicating inside humans. We have a virus that humans are \n     not resistant to. We have a virus about which we don't \n     understand everything.''\n\n  The administration's assessment of what could happen if there were a \npandemic is truly sobering. I will discuss the Bush administration \nestimates of possible consequences from avian flu pandemic. In terms of \nillness, if it were severe, 90 million people could be affected in this \ncountry. The requirement for outpatient medical care: 45 million \npeople.\n  Colleagues, we are totally unprepared for something of this \nmagnitude.\n  Hospitalization, if it were severe, 9.9 million people in this \ncountry would require hospitalization. ICU care--that is intensive \ncare--almost 1.5 million people would need intensive care. We do not \nhave the ventilators, we do not have the facilities, and we do not have \nthe beds to accommodate that level of illness. Mechanical ventilation, \nalmost 750,000 people would require ventilation. Again, we simply are \nnot prepared for that.\n  And most sobering of all are the deaths. They anticipate in this \ncountry alone almost 2 million people could die.\n  Right now, the death rate is running far above that. We know, for \neveryone who has been diagnosed with this illness, roughly half are \ndying. Because these viruses tend to burn out, we would not get that \nsame effect if we have a widespread outbreak, but nonetheless the \npotential is truly sobering. Again, we are not prepared.\n  Local communities will require Federal assistance if a pandemic \nstrikes. This is from the director of public health in Seattle in King \nCounty, WA, as quoted in the USA Today on February 21, of this year:\n\n       Our hospitals and our public health system are funded for \n     normal levels of operation . . . but have always relied on \n     the federal government should we have need for more \n     ventilators, for example, in the event of an earthquake or \n     other mass-fatality event. ``What the federal planners are \n     not getting,'' she says, ``is that if there is a pandemic, \n     every community will be asking for ventilators from the \n     national stockpile at the same time.''\n\n  Clearly she has that right. We are not prepared.\n  The Secretary said in his testimony before the Committee on the \nBudget that what is different about a pandemic is that it happens \neverywhere at once. You do not have the option of dealing with a few \nhotspots.\n  It is very clear we need more resources. What we most need additional \nresources for is to develop vaccines. We also need antivirals and more \nresources for public health. But clearly the top priority has to be \ndeveloping vaccines that can safeguard people against this illness.\n  Here is the summary of our situation with respect to vaccines. We \nhave limited vaccine production capacity, relying on only three \ncompanies. The bird flu virus is mutating, making current vaccines less \neffective. Current vaccine production is egg based and could be \nthreatened by bird flu itself. That is a very important point. The way \nthey make vaccine now, they use eggs, but of course the eggs are in the \nbird population. This is a bird flu. The population we would currently \ncount on to produce vaccine may itself be threatened.\n  Finally, we need alternative technologies, since companies have few \nincentives to build expensive cell-based production facilities.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, it is very clear we cannot rely on \neggs. Currently, there is not the production of the number of eggs to \nproduce a max vaccine in a rapid way. So we have to move to a cell-\nbased technology. But companies have few incentives to build these \nexpensive cell-based production facilities unless they are guaranteed \nthere is going to be a market.\n  The amendment I am offering would increase funding by $5 billion to \ncombat an avian flu pandemic and increase local preparedness. The \namendment would distribute that money as follows--this is based on \ntestimony before the committee and our own outreach to the scientific \ncommunity--an additional $1.5 billion to increase the stockpile of \nantivirals and necessary medical supplies, including masks, gloves, \nventilators, antibiotics, and ongoing medical treatment needs for \nchronic-care patients.\n  With respect to antivirals, we know by the end of this year we are \nslated to have some 20 million courses of treatment of Tamiflu. The \nadministration's goal is 80 million. So we are well short of having the \nnecessary stockpiles of the antiviral Tamiflu. Clearly, we need more \nresources there. Clearly, we need more resources for ventilators. We \nalready heard public health officials say that will be one place where \nthere will be an extreme shortage should we face a pandemic.\n  Next, the amendment provides $2.5 billion to accelerate vaccine \nresearch, development, and manufacturing. And finally, it provides $1 \nbillion to increase State and local preparedness. The amendment also \nensures that the additional funding is fully offset, completely paid \nfor.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will support this amendment. I know \nthere is a resistance on the other side to increasing the top-line \nspending number. If there were ever a time to make an investment in \nprotecting America, this is it. We could face the tragedy of our time.\n  I am reading a book called ``The Great Influenza.'' It is about the \n1918 flu epidemic in which they estimate 50 to 100 million people died \nin this world. We have not had a pandemic since. Pandemics typically \noccur every 50 years or so, so we are well overdue. We did have a \nwidespread, very severe flu in 1968.\n  The Secretary says we are not prepared, says we are not ready. Local \nhealth officials say we are not ready. International health officials \nsay we are not ready. I hope very much we get ready and make this \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Obama, Senator \nClinton, Senator Durbin, and Senator Schumer be added as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Finally, the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, will \nhave an amendment that will be considered at the same time as mine. His \namendment is an empty vessel. Mr. President, let me send my amendment \nto the desk. I am sensing they do not have a copy there.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Schumer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3133.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, on Monday, we heard Secretary Leavitt tell \nus that the avian flu will arrive in the United States by this fall. \nAnd if our worst fears are realized and it becomes a virus that can \nspread easily from human to human, the avian flu could be here within \n30 days.\n  As Dr. Julie Greenberg, Director of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, has said, ``This is the most important threat we face \nright now.'' We are not talking about hundreds or thousands of lives \nhere--we are talking millions. Millions.\n  The question, then, is not whether we have taken steps to prepare \nourselves for the avian flu. Instead, the question is whether we have \ntaken every imaginable and necessary precaution--whether we have done \neverything we possibly could do--to combat potentially the greatest \nglobal health threat in a century.\n  I don't believe that we have. But I know that we must. The United \nStates cannot afford to have a Katrina-level of preparedness or a \nKatrina-like response to an international outbreak of avian flu. With \nso many warnings and so much knowledge of the threat we face, there is \nno excuse for failure this time around.\n  The first thing we need to do is increase our supply of Tamiflu and \nother medications. Countries such as Japan, France, England, and others \nhave now stockpiled enough Tamiflu to cover a quarter of their \npopulations. The United States has enough to cover just 2 percent.\n  If the avian flu mutates and is able to spread between humans, we \nwill also need a new vaccine to treat the new virus. But as we saw \nduring last year's flu season, our vaccine industry remains fragile and \neven the supply and distribution of something simple like a flu shot \nposes a challenge. This has to change.\n  Of course, as Secretary Leavitt has pointed out, the time it takes to \ndevelop a new vaccine means that we could be without any treatment for \nup to 6 months after the avian flu first breaks out. And that means \nthat if we have an outbreak, it is imperative that our public health \ninfrastructure be prepared to handle the crisis.\n  First, we need a clear chain of command. We can't be wondering who is \nin charge of dealing with an outbreak.\n  Second, we need an aggressive outreach campaign to warn and educate \nthe American public about what to do in the event of an outbreak.\n  Third, it is still unclear how much assistance the Federal Government \nis willing to provide already cash-strapped States to strengthen their \nfragile health infrastructures. Although States such as Illinois are \nrapidly increasing their efforts to prepare, many States will need \nsubstantial assistance to buy antivirals and other supplies. And our \nhospitals and health professionals still don't have the capacity to \ncare for large numbers of sick Americans.\n  The devastation wrought by Katrina last year has shown us that we \ncannot stop the forces of nature. But as the wealthiest country on \nEarth, we can prepare, and we can respond in a way that saves as many \nlives as possible.\n  We must do that now with the avian flu. The Conrad avian flu \namendment will provide the necessary funds for Federal agencies, \nworking with the States, to prepare for potential pandemic. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Burr will be offering an amendment \nat the same time as mine. What he is offering is a reserve fund that is \ndeficit neutral but has no money attached to it. But later in the \nprocess, if funding were provided, that reserve fund would provide a \nreceptacle. That is an empty vessel. There is nothing there.\n  It has value. I will support Senator Burr's amendment. It has value \nbecause at least there is a receptacle, at least there is a vessel, at \nleast there is a way of taking funds that might be provided for later. \nBut I want colleagues to know there is no new funding provided for in \nthe Burr amendment.\n  The only amendment being offered here that is going to have \nadditional resources to meet a possible pandemic is this one. So I hope \ncolleagues think very carefully before they cast this vote.\n  With that, Mr. President, I note that Senator Lieberman is in the \nChamber. He is next up to offer an amendment on homeland security. \nSenator Lieberman, of course, is the ranking member of the authorizing \ncommittee. He is, I think all would acknowledge on this floor, a \nleading voice on the question of homeland security.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator, how much time would he require?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in a tradition that is associated with \nmy family, I would ask the Senator from North Dakota, how much time \ndoes he have to offer?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, could the Senator do it in 10 minutes?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 10 minutes off the \nresolution to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3034\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3034, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my friend from North Dakota. I thank him for his leadership \non these matters of budget and really for his steadfastness.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2007 budget resolution to strengthen our homeland security efforts \nin the face of the administration's budget, which in this regard--\nconsidering the fact we are in the post-9/11 world, in a long war \nagainst Islamist terrorism--I consider the administration's budget to \nbe shortsighted and short funded, to be ill-considered and inadequate.\n  In my capacity as the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security \nCommittee, I have worked very closely with our chair, Senator Collins \nof Maine. This year, for the third year, I have worked with my staff, \nwith experts from outside of the Government, to construct what I \nbelieved would be a wartime budget for homeland security. A budget that \nwould do what really needs to be done to secure the American people \nagainst an enemy that has shown it will strike us not on the \nbattlefields of conventional war but in our neighborhoods, where we \nlive and where we work here in the United States of America.\n  The total I would add to the President's budget for homeland security \nis $8 billion. That, of course, is a significant sum, but in the \noverall context of the Federal budget submitted, it is less than one-\nthird of 1 percent of the Federal budget--and it would be used to \nsecure our homeland against an enemy of unprecedented inhumanity and \nagainst the forces of nature, which struck us badly in Hurricane \nKatrina, and, unfortunately, will again.\n  I propose to pay for this additional funding by tightening a number \nof tax loopholes. Therefore, the amendment would not add to the \ndeficit.\n  Of the $8 billion in additional spending I am proposing, $6.2 billion \nwould go directly to the Department of Homeland Security. The remainder \nis divided between the Department of Justice for law enforcement grants \nand the Department of Health and Human Services for public health \npreparedness in the face of a potential biological attack or a \npandemic.\n  The money would restore what I consider to be unjustified cuts for \nfirst responders who, in the war against terrorism, are also our first \npreventers--hundreds of thousands of eyes and ears, of equipment, to \ndetect and stop terrorists.\n  It would restore cuts for emergency managers and public health \nofficials and make needed new investments in first responder programs. \nIt would strengthen rail, transit, port, aviation, and chemical plant \nsecurity, as well as Coast Guard readiness and bioterrorism \npreparedness.\n  Let me just look at a few of the details.\n  We know our first responders do not have the training, equipment, and \nfrequently even the manpower they need to do their jobs properly \nwhenever danger strikes.\n  Here, shown on this chart, is first responder funding. It is \nunbelievable when you see it charted in this way, in the midst of the \nlong war against terrorism, in which our homeland has been struck. And \nwe must assume the enemy will try to strike us again.\n  First responder funding in fiscal year 2004 was $3.95 billion. On \nthis chart, you see a steady line going down, to the proposal here: \n$1.97 billion for the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency \nresponders we depend on to protect us.\n  The President's budget in this regard would cut preparedness funding \nby 16 percent overall. It would cut $802 million from the first \nresponder programs--a 23-percent cut from last year and a 50-percent \nreduction, as shown on the graph, from fiscal year 2004.\n  The administration's budget would entirely eliminate the Law \nEnforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and the Justice Assistance \nGrant Program--totally eliminate them--in a time of war against \nterrorism, and slash by 78 percent the highly successful, much depended \nupon COPS Program, Community Oriented Policing Services Program, which \nhas put police officers on the beat throughout America and by and large \nreduced the incidence of crime.\n  For the second year in a row, the administration is also proposing to \neliminate all funding for the Metropolitan Medical Response System, \nwhich supports planning and preparedness for potential mass casualties \nin a catastrophe. The administration is also proposing to eliminate \nfunding for the SAFER Program, which helps recruit, hire, and train \nlocal firefighters. The budget given to us cuts grants that State and \nlocal emergency planners rely on to help them prepare for catastrophe. \nThe fact is, without more support, our local communities will remain \nunprepared. That is dangerous in this age.\n  My amendment would begin to rebuild that support. It would restore \n$1.6 billion in proposed cuts to first responder programs and add an \nadditional $1.2 billion to help improve State and local capabilities, \nespecially in the area of interoperable communications. That would \nbring the total funding for first responders to $4.1 billion. Can we \nafford it? Honestly, we cannot afford not to afford it.\n  We would also restore funding for the programs I have talked about \nthat will be cut in the Justice Department.\n  What about port security, because this is a comprehensive homeland \nsecurity budget proposal? Moving on to port security, perhaps the \nsilver lining of the Dubai Ports World disagreement is greater public \nrecognition of the urgent need for port security. Ninety-five percent \nof all of the goods coming into America flow through our ports. A \nterrorism attack at a port would cause economic havoc, let alone human \nloss. And experts, of course, worry that weapons of mass destruction \ncould be smuggled into this country in a shipping container.\n  We, therefore, must invest strategically in our defense, which is why \nthis amendment would add an additional $1.7 billion for port security \nand for the Coast Guard, which performed so admirably in response to \nHurricane Katrina but still does not have the capitalized, updated \nequipment it needs to do the job--enormous job--we are asking it to do.\n  On chemical security, we know too many facilities remain vulnerable \nand\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\nthat an attack on one near a high-population center could have the same \neffect as a weapon of mass destruction. The administration's proposal \nis only $10 million. It is inadequate when compared with the $102 \nmillion the Coast Guard spent in 2005 and the $131 million it will \nspend in 2006 to protect chemical facilities at ports.\n  We face, as Senator Conrad has said, the threat and danger of \nbioterrorism and bioterrorist attacks and pandemics, and yet inadequate \nfunding is provided. Thus, my amendment would increase the money given \nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, funding for State \nand local bioterrorism programs by $500 million and add another $500 \nmillion to the Health Resources and Services Administration \nbioterrorism program.\n  We have to absorb the painful dual lessons of September 11, 2001, and \nof August 29, 2005, the day Katrina struck. Our enemies are ruthless \nand choose to fight us at points of vulnerability. That is why we have \nto close those vulnerabilities. Nature will strike in unpredictable \nways year after year. Yet so much of our national homeland security \nstructure continues to have gaps. There is no cheap way to provide for \nthe common defense, our constitutional responsibility. We have the best \nmilitary in the world, and we have it because we have invested in it. \nWe have the best personnel to carry out the protection of our homeland. \nWe will never have the homeland defense we need unless we are prepared \nto spend for it. There is no more urgent need the American people have.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the extraordinary commitment \nof the Senator from Connecticut to national defense, to a responsible \npolicy in fighting terrorism. He is clearly one of the leaders in the \nSenate and the Nation on the issue of how we should protect ourselves \nas a nation. I respect him immensely. I admire him. It is good to have \nhis voice on the issues of foreign policy and international terrorism \nand how we fight it.\n  On this issue, however, I respectfully disagree relative to the need \nfor these additional dollars at this time. In this budget, we have \nrobustly funded the fight on terrorism. The defense budget will be \nincreased in the core budget by $30 billion. A lot of that goes toward \nfighting terrorism. We have set aside $90 billion of additional money, \nthe purpose of which is to fight the war on terrorism. That is $40 \nbillion more than the administration asked for. In addition, within \nthose funds we have dedicated an additional $4 billion specifically to \nthe issue of port security and border security. Quite honestly, as \nchairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over port security and \nborder security, that is probably more money than those agencies can \nhandle in 1 year. We will have to be careful to be sure that that money \nis spent effectively and not pushed out the door in purchasing blue \nlights and whistles. We want to make sure it purchases real assets and \nadds real manpower that will assist us in the war on terrorism. We have \nmade a huge commitment in this budget to the issue of fighting \nterrorism.\n  The Senator from Connecticut correctly points out that first \nresponder funds are down in this budget. That is a decision that has \nbeen made because of the fact there was so much first responder money \nthat came so quickly, it simply hasn't been spent effectively yet. \nThere was $13 billion that we have put into first responders across the \ncountry. That is a huge number, so large, in fact, that $5.5 billion of \nit, which has already been appropriated, which is sitting there, has \nnot been spent, going back to 2004. There is literally $5.5 billion \nsitting in the pipeline that first responder groups have not spent, in \npart because State planning has not caught up to adequately meet the \nneed for using the available funding. As soon as they are, those \ndollars will go out. As soon as that pipeline of $5.5 billion starts to \nget drawn down--remember, we are adding another several billion dollars \non top of it in this bill--we are going to refill that pipeline to make \nsure that first responder funding is adequate.\n  It is not an issue of lack of dollars. It is an issue of lack of \nprogrammatic and systematic infrastructure, to a large degree--and \nplanning, to a large degree. You could put another $40 billion or $8 \nbillion or whatever billion on top of this, and you would still get \nlittle improvement in the amount of money flowing out to first \nresponders because the necessity of having the money flow in a way that \nactually produces programmatic results has not been resolved yet.\n  It should not be our purpose as the Federal Government to be hiring \npeople for local police forces and local first responder teams. What \nthis money is supposed to be used for primarily is to give them the \nsupport so they have the necessary interoperability equipment, the \nnecessary tactical equipment, and the necessary training to be \neffective as first responders. We should not be taking Federal first \nresponder dollars and replacing local dollars that are already being \nused for the purposes of putting people on the street. States are \nmaking progress. As they come at us, we will put more money out there.\n  In addition, in the appropriating process we have taken the view, \nwhich is a little different than the authorizing committee, that risk \nshould be where the money goes first. If a community has a high \nlikelihood of risk from a terrorist attack, that community should be \nthe place where we put the dollars. This has actually worked to the \ndisadvantage of the State of New Hampshire. But my view is strong that \nthese dollars, which are being used to basically upgrade the capacity \nof first responders to handle a terrorist attack, should go first to \nthose places most likely to be on the front lines. We know where those \nplaces are. They know who they are. That is why we have basically \nfunded it in that manner.\n  That is where we stand today. Very simply stated, there is an \nextremely robust commitment to fighting the war on terrorism in this \nbill: a $30 billion increase in defense spending; $90 billion in a \nseparate budgeting process for fighting the war on terror, $40 billion \nmore than the President asked for; $4 billion of new funds directed \nright at border security and port security; $2.3 billion directed right \nat avian flu and the purchasing of necessary supplies and antitoxins \nand hopefully vaccines, to address that issue. In the pipeline already \nfrom prior appropriations, there is $5.5 billion of funds out of the \n$13 billion that has been appropriated which is available for first \nresponders from prior appropriations onto which we will put another \nchunk of money here.\n  The issue is not dollars in almost all these accounts. It is not \ndollars in terms of this budget. In terms of the President's budget, \nthere may be a difference of opinion, but in terms of this budget the \nissue is not dollars. The issue is getting those dollars out \neffectively.\n  I oppose this amendment. I would have opposed it, anyway, because it \nbasically raises taxes and spends money and breaks the caps. I think \nthat is bad fiscal policy. I also oppose it on substance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3074\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3074.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n     Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 3074.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n Program by $3,318,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, increasing the funds \n available to carry out that program to the fully authorized level of \n   $5,100,000,000, to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $2,489,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $763,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $2,489,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $763,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $3,318,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $2,489,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $763,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 24, increase the amount by $3,318,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by $2,489,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 4, increase the amount by $763,000,000.\n       On page 22, line 8, increase the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $3,318,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $2,489,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment is straightforward. It would \nincrease funding for the LIHEAP program, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, by $3.318 billion. It is paid for fully by the \nclosing of corporate tax loopholes and is cosponsored by Senators \nKennedy, Kerry, Clinton, Lieberman, Rockefeller, Dorgan, Levin, Dayton, \nSchumer, Kohl, Bayh, Johnson, Leahy, Menendez, and Harkin.\n  The President's budget request and the level of funding assumed in \nthis budget resolution for LIHEAP is $1.782 billion. That represents a \n$379 million cut from the fiscal year 2006 enacted level. Last week we \nwere struggling to pass an additional $1 billion. The question before \nus is, are we going to accept this inadequate funding knowing full well \nit is inadequate today. I hope we don't do that. My amendment, the \nincrease of $3.318 billion, would reach the authorized level of $5.1 \nbillion set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. On five separate \noccasions during the course of the debate over LIHEAP in the last 6 \nmonths, the majority of the Senate has voted for this full funding \nlevel. I call upon all of those Members to join me today to ensure we \nhave full funding. We understand this year we are short of money. The \nPresident's budget starts us off with even less.\n  This year we benefited from unusually warm temperatures. I don't \nthink anyone would bet that next winter's heating season will be as \nmild and as forgiving as this season's. With higher energy prices--and \nwe know they are going up--with probably lower temperatures, we are \ngoing to be in a very serious position unless we adopt this amendment.\n  In the course of the debate about LIHEAP, many of our colleagues from \nwarmer States pointed out that they are not getting as much as they \nshould. If we get to the $5.1 billion level, this will truly be a \nnational program. Warmer weather States will have the money in the hot \nseason where they need air conditioning to help low-income people. I \nhope we can do so. For example, Alabama will receive $15 million from \nthe block grant formula under the President's budget. It would receive \n$87.2 million under my amendment, a 479-percent increase, and so on \nthroughout the country.\n  I hope we can pass this amendment. I hope we can have the foresight \nto recognize that we can't start off in the hole. We cannot expect warm \ntemperatures this next heating season. We have to do more for the most \nvulnerable.\n  I yield whatever remaining time I have back to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3136\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. \nI thank him also for his courtesy and graciousness.\n  The situation we have is, I have very few minutes left this morning. \nWe don't have another Senator. I have asked other Senators to come to \nthe floor. While we are waiting, I will do my final amendment. I send \nan amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3136.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a reserve fund for bold energy legislation that is \n                            deficit neutral)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR ENERGY LEGISLATION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \n     levels and limits in this resolution for a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment thereto or conference report \n     thereon, that would reduce our nation's dependence on foreign \n     sources of energy, expand production and use of alternative \n     fuels and alternative fuel vehicles, promote renewable energy \n     development, improve electricity transmission, encourage \n     responsible development of domestic oil and natural gas \n     resources, and reward conservation and efficiency, by the \n     amounts provided in such legislation for that purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over the total of the period of fiscal years 2007 through \n     2011.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in many ways this may be one of the most \nimportant amendments we offer on our side. I say that because if I look \nacross the horizon at the challenges facing America, energy dependence \nwould be right at the top of the list.\n  In his State of the Union Message, the President said:\n\n       [W]e have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, \n     which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.\n\n  I think the President has that exactly right.\n  We can see in this chart that imports now account for 60 percent of \ntotal U.S. consumption; that is, of the oil that we are consuming, 60 \npercent of it is imported. That creates a vulnerability for America. \nThis dependence on imported energy is dramatically adding to our record \ntrade deficit; $266 billion of the trade deficit over the last year is \ndue to imported petroleum products. We ran a trade deficit during that \nperiod of about $700 billion. More than a third of it is due to our \nreliance on foreign energy.\n  That represents over a third of the total trade deficit. The \nPresident made very strong statements in the State of the Union about \nthe need to reduce our dependence, reduce our vulnerability. But if you \nlook at his budget, you see something quite different: the clean coal \npower initiative, cut 90 percent; weatherization assistance grants to \nimprove conservation of energy in homes reduced almost a third; \nelectricity delivery and reliability, cut 23 percent; fossil energy \nR, cut 21 percent.\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago, President Bush had a small group of \nSenators to the White House to talk about energy. I told him I was \ngoing to be introducing legislation that would provide substantial \nincentives to do what Brazil did. It is very instructive to look back \nover the last 30 years. Thirty years ago, Brazil was 80 percent \ndependent on foreign energy. They reduced that to less than 10 percent \ntoday. If we look at our story, it is just the flip. Back in the 1970s, \nwe were 35 percent dependent upon foreign energy; today it is 60 \npercent.\n  I think the question presents itself: What did Brazil do? Brazil very \naggressively promoted biodiesel, ethanol, and flexible fuel vehicles. \nIn fact, the vast majority of their vehicle fleet in Brazil are now \nflex fuel vehicles. They have very aggressively promoted ethanol and \nbiodiesel. We should do the same. Those are the key components of the \nenergy plan I will be presenting to our colleagues--aggressive \npromotion of biodiesel and ethanol, alternative fuel vehicles, wind \nenergy, and coal-to-liquid fuel technology and energy efficiency in \nconservation.\n  Mr. President, my energy reserve fund creates a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for bold and balanced energy legislation that reduces our \nNation's dependence upon foreign sources of energy, expands the \nproduction and use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles, \npromotes renewable energy development, encourages responsible \ndevelopment of oil and natural gas resources right here in America, and \nrewards conservation and efficiency.\n  Mr. President, this is a deficit-neutral reserve fund. Only if we \nfind a way to pay for this initiative will it be able to go forward. My \nown view is that this is such a high priority for our country and \nraised, I think, to national attention by the President in his State of\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\nthe Union, but we don't have a budget to match bold words. We need bold \ninitiatives to match bold words, to really do something to reduce our \ndependence. It makes us vulnerable. It is weakening our economy.\n  I said to the President: What a difference it could make. Would it \nnot be wonderful if the President could wake up and instead of turning \nto the Middle East for oil, he could look to the Midwest of our own \ncountry where we could help grow our way out of this crisis by growing \nthe feedstock that could produce biodiesel and ethanol, soybeans, corn, \nand canola? We are about to build in North Dakota the biggest biodiesel \nplant in North America. That is going to help us wean ourselves from \nthis ongoing dependence upon foreign energy. I hope very much my \ncolleagues will support this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will soon offer an amendment to \nremove the airline passenger tax increase from this budget. It is \nfundamentally unfair for the President to raise taxes on everyday \nfamilies as he doles out massive tax cuts to the wealthy.\n  Hidden among the thousands of pages in this legislation is a proposal \nto double the minimum amount that airline passengers pay as a security \ntax. President Bush wants to increase this tax from $2.50 per flight to \n$5 per flight. That is a 100-percent tax increase.\n  The impact on a family of four traveling roundtrip on nonstop flights \nis illustrated by the chart that we have here. An increase in security \ntax for a family of four traveling roundtrip on nonstop flights, \ntypically, if it is $20 now, is going to be $40 obviously. That is \nquite a burden.\n  The traveling public is already too heavily taxed. Air travelers pay \nan enormous amount of Federal taxes on every airline ticket--nearly 20 \npercent of the base fare price now. For example, the tax on the average \ndomestic roundtrip flight of $230 is $45. That is a tax rate of almost \n20 percent.\n  Air travelers are taxed every time they turn around. They pay the \nFederal excise tax--on top of the Federal segment tax, on top of the \npassenger facility charge, on top of the security tax. Now the \nPresident wants to double the security tax.\n  To make matters worse, this tax increase will hit families the \nhardest. Sixty-three percent of the domestic air trips in this country \nin 2004 were taken for personal purposes, including vacations and \nvisits to families and loved ones.\n  I am one of the strongest advocates for transportation security \nresources for our country, but we have to provide these necessary \nresources by spreading the tax burdens across this country fairly and \nnot targeting everyday Americans while special interests raid the \nFederal Treasury.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that this amendment is \noffset by closing abusive tax shelters. So when we look at this, if the \nairlines don't pass along this tax increase to the average family, they \nthemselves will have to experience further losses. There was $10 \nbillion in losses in 2005 by the aviation industry. That is on top of \n$32 billion from 2001 to 2004. There were 150,000 jobs lost since 9/11. \nThey just cannot handle it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and say no to the \nBush airline passenger tax increases, keeping in mind that those tax \nincreases are put upon the average family to give the wealthiest among \nus huge tax breaks. It is unfair and it ought not to be permitted. I \nurge you in this instance to vote no on further tax increases for the \naverage American family.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \naccommodating the schedule of his colleagues by coming this morning and \noffering his amendment. Next in the queue is Senator Burr with an \namendment on avian flu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Chair advises \nthat the Senator from New Jersey did not send up an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3137\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. We neglected to do the most important part of \nit. I was overcome by the speech, Mr. President.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3137.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise on the Senate floor today to not only \noffer\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nthis amendment and talk about it, but to speak on an amendment of \nanother Member of the Senate, an amendment that also focuses on the \navian flu.\n  Our country faces threats, some of which we know and some of which we \ndon't know today. One real threat is the threat of pandemic bird flu. \nThe President of the United States was ahead of the curve on this with \na proposal to the Congress of over $7 billion for advanced development \nof vaccines, for the preparation the country needs to go through, and \nfor the stockpiles of antivirals and countermeasures.\n  The fact is that Congress has responded to his request. This year the \nbudget resolution highlights the fact that the President's request of \n$2.3 billion of taxpayers' money is in this budget resolution.\n  My colleague from North Dakota, for whom I have a tremendous amount \nof respect and who has helped, along with Senator Gregg, to move this \nbudget resolution through this body, has asked we increase that amount \nby $5 billion. If for 1 minute I thought $5 billion would make America \nsafer, I would be on the floor as a cosponsor of that amendment. But \nthe reality is, we are at a point where we are absorbing all the money \nwe can, given where we are in this process.\n  I just left a hearing with the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. My direct question to him was: The President's budget asked \nfor $2.3 billion. Is that sufficient for 2007?\n  He looked at me and said: Senator, where we are in the development of \nvaccines, where we are in our need for stockpiles, that amount fulfills \neverything we can do in preparation.\n  So I urge my colleagues not to support the amendment for an \nadditional $5 billion of taxpayers' money to potentially go into a \nblack hole. I remind my colleagues that the way this is funded is to \nraise taxes on the American people. We have used tax loopholes for \ncorporations to fund many items suggested in amendments on this floor. \nThe fact is, once again, the American people realize this is a covert \nway of raising taxes on them.\n  My amendment does something very simple. It creates a reserve fund. \nIt has been described as hollow because it has no money. I believe the \nAmerican people demand that we bring fiscal responsibility to this \ninstitution, to the Congress of the United States. I don't want to tie \nthe hands of individuals within the agencies if they see a need for \nsomething, but the creation of this reserve fund allows them to do it \nin a budget-neutral way.\n  I believe this will be overwhelmingly supported because, in fact, it \ndoesn't spend any new money, but it provides the flexibility and \nauthority to those who are charged with addressing this threat.\n  The amendment establishes a reserve fund, and that can help to \nrebuild our domestic vaccine industry, support advanced development and \nacquisition of needed drugs and vaccines, strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure, and increase surveillance and outbreak containment.\n  We are at a point in this Congress where we have the opportunity to \nreauthorize the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness \nand Response Act, and we are considering legislation on advanced \ndevelopment of vaccines and countermeasures against chemical, \nbiological, or radiological and natural threats. There are many issues \nthat we have to decide exactly how we are going to handle. But to throw \nmoney at them is, in fact, not the answer today.\n  Those who are charged with the responsibility of making sure this \ncountry is prepared, in fact, have sufficient funding today. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the Conrad amendment, to vote for the Burr \namendment, and to make sure this administration is able to carry out \nwhat has been a well-planned preparation for a known threat to this \ncountry and, I might add, to the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that 10 minutes of the chairman's \ntime be yielded to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the chairman very much. We have been trying to \ndistribute time so we can most efficiently use time on the floor. I \nyield 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3081\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I \ncall up amendment No. 3081 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3081.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To fully fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program. \n Adds $152 million to Function 800 (General Government) for PILT. Paid \n        for by closing $152 million in corporate tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 24, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $152,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, this amendment aims to fully fund the \nPayment in Lieu of Taxes Program for our country. It is an issue of \nvital importance to rural America. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort today by Senator Bingaman and Senator Leahy who are cosponsors \nof this amendment.\n  As I have said often on this floor before, rural America continues to \nwither on the vine. I will continue to come to this floor and sound the \nalarm of the plight of rural America because I am absolutely certain it \ndoesn't have to be this way.\n  The heartland of this country is a vast reservoir of American \npotential and strength, and the values, common sense, perseverance, and \nwork ethic embodied in the 50 million people who live in rural America \nare national treasures in and of themselves.\n  These people are also the stewards of our many public lands, and they \ndeserve support in that effort. That is where PILT comes in. Created in \n1976, PILT compensates local government for the presence of nontaxable \nFederal lands within their boundaries, as well as the associated costs \nof providing work, such as road work and law enforcement, to visitors \non those lands.\n  Over the years, inflation has taken its toll. Repeatedly underfunding \nthe PILT Program has also sent precisely the wrong message to rural \nAmerica. Full PILT funding for fiscal year 2007 will likely be close to \n$350 million, but the President's budget for PILT was reduced by $38 \nmillion, or 16 percent, from where it was last year.\n  This is not just about my State of Colorado where some counties are \nowned by the Federal Government to the extent of 95 percent; it is \nabout governments in at least 49 of our States where there are \nsignificant public land holdings within those States.\n  This amendment is fully offset by tax loophole closures. Some \ncolleagues have approached me about alternatives, and I will work with \nthem to explore other ideas in terms of funding alternatives.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this modest, \ncommonsense amendment. When I travel through the rural counties of \nColorado, I hear the voices of proud, hard-working rural Americans who \nfeel neglected by Washington. Let's take an opportunity in a very small \nway in this budget resolution to send a different signal that we in \nWashington care about rural America.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. This \nis an important amendment, certainly an important amendment to Western\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nStates such as ours that all too often are shortchanged in terms of \nwhat they get in lieu of taxes where the Federal Government owns vast \ntracts of land and then is not a good neighbor, doesn't pay its fair \nshare of the tab.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for his excellent amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask that Senator Bayh be added as a \ncosponsor to my avian flu amendment No. 3133.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I see the Senator from Maryland is now \non the floor. I say to the Senator from Maryland, I now have 6 minutes \nleft, and I am wondering if I could give 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, that would be fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have to give some time to Senator Baucus before the \ndebt limit vote. So I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. Does that leave the Senator with \nenough time for his other purposes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am sure Senator Gregg and I will be able to work it \nout.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I thank the Senator very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3103\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I offer amendment No. 3103.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 3103.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore funding for the civil works programs of the Corps \nof Engineers, the Federal Water Pollution Control State Revolving Fund, \nthe National Park Service, the Forest Service, the National Oceanic and \n Atmospheric Administration, Federal conservation programs, and other \nnatural resource needs, through an offset achieved by closing corporate \n                             tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,718,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $699,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $320,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $116,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $58,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, decrease the amount by $1,718,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, decrease the amount by $699,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, decrease the amount by $320,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, decrease the amount by $116,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $58,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $2,912,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $1,718,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $699,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $320,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $116,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by $58,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 21, increase the amount by $2,912,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 22, increase the amount by $1,718,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 1, increase the amount by $699,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 5, increase the amount by $320,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 9, increase the amount by $116,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 13, increase the amount by $58,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $2,912,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $1,718,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this amendment is to restore funding \nfor function 300 Natural Resources and Environment, and for other \npurposes. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lieberman and Senator \nReed of Rhode Island be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Chair would tell me when 1 minute is left on my \ntime, I would be most appreciative.\n  Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is to restore funding \nfor a number of important environmental programs under function 300. \nThe President's budget request and the chairman's mark on the \nresolution cut funding for water resources, conservation and land \nmanagement, recreational resources, pollution control and abatement, \nand other natural resources and environmental activities by nearly $3 \nbillion from the baseline, or almost 10 percent. This amendment would \nseek to add $2.9 billion to bring the function 300 total back up to \nbaseline. It is offset with revenues from the closing of corporate tax \nloopholes.\n  We have a list of possibilities, many of which have passed the Senate \nbefore and have been strongly supported by very large majorities in \nthis body. Let me just give a few examples of the kinds of programs we \nare trying to at least provide some additional support for, although it \nfalls short of what the need is; but we are trying to get back to \nbaseline.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers civil works program, flood control, \nnavigation, storm protection, environmental restoration--I hardly need, \nin the aftermath of Katrina, to emphasize the importance of such \nprograms. The EPA budget has been sharply cut, including nearly $200 \nmillion from the clean water State revolving loan fund, which is now in \nthis budget at the lowest funding level ever for clean water \ninfrastructure. It has been cut by nearly 50 percent from the 2004 \nlevel because there has been a steady decline, and, of course, this \nimpacts every State's and every community's ability to upgrade their \nwaste water infrastructure and meet Clean Water Act requirements.\n  The National Park Service is being cut. Our National Parks have a \ndesperate need for funding in order to carry out their activities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, the National Park Service is falling \nwell short of what they need in order to sustain the park system. NOAA \nis being cut in this budget, including the National Marine Fisheries \nService. There is a lot of emphasis on our oceans. Two commissions have \nstudied it. Yet the Oceans Commission says we are falling well short of \nany real commitment there. The NOAA budget is cut, the Fish and \nWildlife Service budget, and the Forest Service. This amendment seeks \nto at least bring back this funding to function 300 for all of these \nvery important environmental and natural resource problems to baseline, \nto current funding levels.\n  I very much hope my colleagues will support this amendment and \ncontribute to protecting the environment and health of our Nation's \ncitizens, helping to ensure that we have clean water and that we \nbreathe clean air.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator Dorgan \nfrom North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I support Senator Sarbanes' effort to \nrestore funding for our agencies and programs directed at natural \nresource conservation and management and some of our fundamental \nenvironmental responsibilities. The programs and agencies include the \nClean Water State Revolving Fund, the National Park Service, the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Forest Service, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, and others. I do believe that we must meet \nour stewardship responsibilities and the President's budget simply \ndoesn't cut it.\n  I do, however, want to flag a problem related to the Army Corps of \nEngineers. It is a problem that cripples the Corps: The minute its \nbudget arrives on our doorsteps, Members of Congress scramble for Corps \nearmarks. We must move away from this earmarking and focus on national \npriorities. I will continue working to change the way this agency \noperates.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am going to be offering an amendment. \nI have noticed an amendment dealing with Indian program funding. I \nthink most who understand these issues understand that we have a bona \nfide crisis in Indian health care, Indian housing, and Indian \neducation. We have had hearings. I have had hearings in my State, and \nwe have had hearings in the Indian Affairs Committee, and we have to \naddress these issues. The issue of Indian health care is not an \noptional issue. When there is a young child on an Indian reservation or \nan elder on an Indian reservation who is sick, they need health care.\n  This is interesting. We have trust responsibility for health care for \na couple of groups of Americans. One is Federal prisoners. If they are \nincarcerated, we have a responsibility to Federal prisoners for their \nhealth care. We also have trust responsibility for health care for \nAmerican Indians. That is our trust responsibility. We spend nearly \ntwice as much--twice as much--per person to provide health care for \nFederal prisoners as we do for American Indians. That is wrong.\n  Housing: We have a bona fide crisis in housing. In many cases on many \nof America's Indian reservations we have people living in Third World \nconditions.\n  Education: Do we really want a young child who is 6 or 8 years old to \nbe walking through the doorway of a grade school and receiving an \neducation that is much less of an education than other children are \nsimply because we don't have the money? Shouldn't these young Indian \nchildren be given the opportunity for a good education? I think with \nrespect to education, the GAO report shows quite clearly that \nfacilities in BIA schools are inferior to other schools.\n  My point is this: When we take a look at our priorities, what is \nimportant, what we should be doing, we see that we have Americans \nliving in Third World conditions on many of these Indian reservations. \nWe have a crisis in health care, in education and housing, and we ought \nto do something about it. You can't go to these places and look at \ntheir health care system or look at their schools or look at people \nliving in substandard housing and believe that it is not a priority for \nthis Congress to meet its responsibilities.\n  I have offered this legislation before in the form of an amendment. I \ndo so again today. I have a number of cosponsors I would like to add \nfor the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, although I don't agree with him, I yield \n3\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, might I, with the indulgence of my \ncolleagues, simply read the cosponsors? They are Senators Cantwell, \nMurray, Bingaman, and Johnson are added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The amendment has \nnot yet been offered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                          Debt Limit Extension\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am speaking on an amendment I have \noffered to the debt limit. This amendment would simply require the \nTreasury Department to report on the economic and security implications \nof our debt to foreigners. Massive budget deficits are forcing America \nto borrow heavily. Last year, foreigners bought 96 percent of the \nTreasury bills that our Government sold to finance our debt--96 \npercent. That is an astounding statistic. The debt purchased last year, \nalmost all of it, was purchased by foreigners, 96 percent.\n  Foreigners are becoming our bankers. America is becoming a debtor to \nforeign powers.\n  I think we need to understand this change. This amendment asks the \nTreasury to investigate what the full cost of our indebtedness will be, \nin higher interest rates, the value of a dollar, lower economic growth, \nless power to negotiate trade agreements, and diminished national \nsecurity. We should let taxpayers know how big the cost of this foreign \ndebt really is. This amendment will help to get the answers.\n  Some will make breathless arguments that passing this amendment will \nendanger the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. I say that \nis hogwash. If the Senate passes this amendment, the House of \nRepresentatives could pass it and have the bill on the President's desk \nbefore suppertime, on the President's desk this evening.\n  The real reason some are opposing this amendment is to save the House \nof Representatives from having to vote on the debt limit even once--to \nsave the House of Representatives, to save those folks on the other \nside of the body, on the other side of the Capitol, from having to vote \non the debt limit. That is really what is going on here. I think if \nSenators vote on the debt limit, certainly House Members should vote on \nthe debt limit, too. That is an embarrassingly poor reason to vote \nagainst a study that would help protect America's economic and security \ninterests.\n\n  Last year, foreigners bought 96 percent of the Treasury bills that \nour Government sold--actually 96 percent--just to remind everybody. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment to help find out \nwhat our foreign debt really means for America.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I know the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is coming over, and he may want to speak to this issue, but \nthe time may lapse before he gets here so let me make this point: The \nstudy which the Senator is asking for could occur and would occur--and \nI can't speak for the chairman of the Finance Committee, but I would \ncertainly be willing to sign the letter, and I suspect the chairman \nwould, too. But simply writing the letter down there from the \ncommittees of jurisdiction--I don't happen to be a committee of \njurisdiction, although it is an interesting issue--and then the \nchairman and the ranking member could get the study.\n  The reason this amendment is being put on this bill is to try to send \nit back to the House to delay the process so that the debt ceiling ends \nup with some political votes somewhere along the line. That is just \ngamesmanship and there is no need for it.\n  We should have this amendment taken off this bill. If there is a \ndesire for this information, which we could certainly obtain rather \neasily by sending a letter demanding that they do the study, and then \nhave GAO do the study--a little independence on the study might even be \ngood--do a joint task force and get the information. So the amendment \nreally isn't necessary at all.\n  So I agree with what I think is the leadership's position on this \nside, that this amendment is just dilatory and will end up delaying the \ndebt ceiling legislation, which is a mistake. That is why it is \nopposed.\n  Has all my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I see the Democratic leader, and I will \nyield back my time and let the Democratic leader take leader time.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, President Thomas Jefferson said:\n\n       I place economy among the first and most important \n     government virtues, and public debt as the greatest of the \n     dangers to be feared.\n\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\n\n  That was President Thomas Jefferson.\n  Today the Senate is considering a bill to increase the Nation's debt \nby $781 billion. If adopted, it would be the fourth such increase in \nthe 5 years this administration has been in office. I will be opposing \nthis latest request, and I hope that people on both sides of the aisle \nwill do the same.\n  Any objective analysis of our country's fiscal history would have to \nconclude this administration and this rubberstamping Republican \nCongress are the most fiscally irresponsible in the history of our \ncountry. In fact, no other President or Congress even comes close. When \nthis administration came to office, the Federal Government was running \nlarge annual budget surpluses that were projected to continue as far as \nthe eye could see. These projected surpluses were so large that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated the Federal Government would pay \noff all its publicly held debt by the year 2009. In fact, Alan \nGreenspan, then the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and other \neconomists expressed concern that these surpluses would be so huge they \nrisked unsettling the financial markets.\n\n  Because of the reckless fiscal policies of this President and the \nRepublican-controlled Congress, 2009 will be a year to recognize \nPresident Bush's multitrillion-dollar red-ink special. Over the past 5 \nyears, rather than running record surpluses and reducing record amounts \nof debt, our Nation suffered record deficits and debt increases. In \nfact, when it comes to deficits, this President owns all the records. \nThe three largest deficits in our Nation's history have all occurred \nunder this administration's watch. The deterioration of the Federal \nGovernment's finances is the direct result of the misguided priorities \nof this administration and this rubberstamping Republican Congress.\n  These deficits have resulted in an unprecedented and dangerous \nborrowing spree. The total debt during this spree has grown by \ntrillions of dollars. President Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       As an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon \n     finds his original means devoured by interest and next no one \n     left to borrow from, so must it be with government.\n\n  O, if the Republican President and Republican-dominated Congress had \nfollowed the advice of Abraham Lincoln.\n  The legislation on the floor today will push the Nation's borrowing \nlimit to nearly $9 trillion. Compounding matters, the President's most \nrecent budget--much of which Senate Republicans have placed before the \nSenate this week--would make matters substantially worse, leading to \n$12 trillion debt by 2011, just as the first wave of baby boomers is \nbeginning to retire.\n  Not only is debt exploding at the worst possible time, increasingly \nwe are borrowing from foreign lenders. Since this administration took \noffice, U.S. debt financed by foreigners has more than doubled, \nincreasing by well over $1 trillion. That is more foreign-held debt in \n5 years than the Nation accumulated in the first 224 years of this \nRepublic. By contrast, during the last 3 years of the Clinton \nadministration, we paid off hundreds of billions of dollars of debt, \nincluding $200 billion in debt to foreign lenders.\n  Given the explosion of debt in recent years, it is long past time for \nWashington to change the course and adopt a new fiscal policy. After \nall, the future of our economy and our Nation is at stake. The \nComptroller General of the United States, David Walker, told the Senate \nBudget Committee recently:\n\n       Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually \n     erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of \n     living and ultimately our national security.\n\n  If my Republican friends believe that increasing our debt by almost \n$800 billion today, and more than $3 trillion dollars over the last 5 \nyears, is the right thing to do, they should be upfront about it. They \nshould explain why they believe more debt is good for our economy. How \ncan the Republican majority and this Congress explain to their \nconstituents that trillions of dollars of new debt is good for our \neconomy? How can they explain that they think it is fair to force our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren to finance \nthis debt through higher taxes? That is what will have to happen. Why \nis it right to increase this Nation's dependence on foreign creditors? \nThey should explain this.\n  Maybe they can convince the public they are right. I doubt it, \nbecause most Americans know that increasing the debt is the last thing \nwe should be doing. After all, I repeat, the baby boomers are about to \nretire. Under the circumstances, any credible economist would tell you \nwe should be reducing debt, not increasing it.\n  Again, on debt--Thomas Jefferson. These are his words:\n\n       And to preserve our independence, we must not let our \n     rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty--or profusion and servitude.\n\n  That was President Thomas Jefferson.\n  Democrats will not be making arguments to support this legislation \nwhich will weaken our country. The President often speaks of personal \nresponsibility. In a speech before African-American leaders earlier in \nhis administration, the President stated that a President is judged not \nby the words he speaks but by the work he leaves behind. By that \nbenchmark, the President and this Republican-controlled Congress will \nnot be judged kindly with respect to the stewardship of our Nation's \nfinances.\n  We are being asked to do what should not be asked of us, to increase \nthe debt to almost $9 trillion. I hope everyone walking down to these \ndesks today will understand what they are doing, what they are doing to \nour country. On this side of the aisle, we know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                     Senator Sarbanes 11,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we just completed a vote that is a landmark \nfor one of our Senators. Senator Paul Sarbanes cast his 11,000th vote.\n  It was only a few days ago that we stopped the proceedings of the \nSenate to underline and underscore the voting record of the senior \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Leahy.\n  Senator Sarbanes has decided not to run for reelection, as we all \nknow, but what a legacy he has in the Senate. There is no one with a \nbetter academic record than Paul Sarbanes: Princeton University, summa \ncum laude, Phi Beta Kappa; a Rhodes scholar; he studied, of course, \nbecause of that, at Oxford; Harvard Law School.\n  Those who have had the privilege of working with Paul Sarbanes know \nthat not only does he have this great intellect, he has so much common \nsense. Legislation he works on is detailed, very thorough.\n  He, of course, is our ranking member of the Committee on Banking. I \nhave traveled with the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland. We \nhave traveled various parts of the world. I have fond memories of Paul \nSarbanes and all the things he has done. His wife Chris is a wonderful, \ncaring person, just like Paul.\n  Even though I have a lot of stories, I share one with the Senate. One \nof the things people do not realize about Senator Sarbanes is his \nathletic ability. He is a great athlete. I was told a story about \nSenator Sarbanes that for me is a classic. I love baseball. I follow \nthe history of baseball. In high school, he was a star baseball player. \nHe was selected to play on an all-star team. He was a shortstop. He \ncomes to the all-star team as the shortstop from the Eastern Shore. The \nmanager coach announces the starting lineup and he has Sarbanes at \nsecond base. Paul went up to the coach and said, I am a shortstop. I \nwas selected as an all-star shortstop. The coach ignored him. He went \nback again, and finally the coach said, Kaline is starting shortstop. \nAl Kaline was a better shortstop, at least the coach thought so, than \nPaul Sarbanes. Al Kaline went to the Major Leagues when he was 18 or 19 \nyears old and is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  I know we have a lot of things to do today. People are going to the \nWhite House. There are a lot of places to go and this is a very \nimportant bill, but I could not let the time go by without \nacknowledging one of the great Senators in the history of our country, \nSenator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask to speak not to exceed 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, one of the greatest orations ever uttered \nwas the\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\noration on the Crown. And it can be said that the theme of that oration \nwas a question: Who least serves the State? Demosthenes answered that \nquestion: He who does not say what he thinks.\n  Socrates was asked which great oration of Demosthenes he liked best. \nSocrates answered, ``The longest.'' In other words, he liked the \nlongest oration Demosthenes ever uttered. The Greeks taught the world \nto think.\n  This man who is going to leave us after this term, regrettably, and \nto our great loss, has always impressed me as a thinker, one in the \ntrain of Demosthenes.\n  Paul Sarbanes is a great Senator, a great Senator.\n  I can remember when he went with me and other Senators to Panama. \nThere we talked to Torrijos and the other leaders of Panama, including \nour own people. It was there that I changed my mind about the Panama \nCanal Treaty. Paul Sarbanes was one of those who was there, who walked \nwith us, who talked with us, who was on plane with Torrijos.\n  Paul Sarbanes has not only been a thinker, he has been a great \ninspiration to those who have served with him. He will be missed. He \nwill not be replaced. There are no more Paul Sarbanes. I shall never \nforget him. He leaves a great void when he goes.\n  One might say: Whence cometh another?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, much is being said about my dear and \nesteemed colleague, Senator Sarbanes. He has been the longest serving \nSenator in Maryland's history. And I would put to the Senate, he has \nbeen the best serving Member of the U.S. Senate from Maryland.\n  Sure, he cast 11,000 votes, but each and every one of our colleagues \nwill know that when those 11,000 votes were cast, they were cast with \nthoughtfulness, with due diligence, with the idea of how would that \nvote serve the Nation and how would it help Maryland.\n  If we want to honor Senator Paul Sarbanes, let's make sure every vote \nwe cast brings to it the same kind of integrity, the same kind of \nintelligence, and the same kind of devotion and dedication. That is \nwhat I would like to do as the junior Senator, and say thank you for \nbeing side by side with me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I know we want to proceed with our \nbusiness, but if I could just be recognized for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their very \ngracious remarks and all of my colleagues for their expressions of \nrespect and affection.\n  My colleague, Senator Mikulski, said I was the longest serving \nSenator in Maryland's history. I want you to know, it is a little bit \nlike being like Cal Ripken; every day you go to work, you set a new \nrecord--one more day than the day before.\n  It has been, obviously, one of the great focuses and joys of my life \nto be able to work here in the Senate with all my colleagues. I am \nextremely grateful to all of you.\n  I will just close with this story, because I am still here until the \n3rd of January 2007. So there is still time to go.\n  But I once got an award. My mother was there at this dinner. This was \na few years ago. And they asked her to speak as well. So she got up to \nspeak, and she said how honored she was they had given this recognition \nto her son, and so forth, and how much she appreciated it. And then she \nclosed her remarks by saying: He has been a good boy--so far.\n  I carry that comment with me.\n  Thank you all very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could just briefly say to our good \nfriend from Maryland that Republican Senators, too, join in wishing him \nwell on this extraordinary accomplishment. And if he would like to \nresign any time before January, that would be all right, too. But in \nthe meantime, we are glad to have you around.\n  Congratulations, Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about America's debt \nproblem.\n  The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt \nlimit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. \nGovernment can't pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on \nongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our \nGovernment's reckless fiscal policies.\n  Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 \ntrillion to $8.6 trillion. That is ``trillion'' with a ``T.'' That is \nmoney that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, \nborrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And \nover the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President's budget \nwill increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion.\n  Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may \nwonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government \nwill spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest \non our national debt than we'll spend on Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest \non our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland \nsecurity, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more \nmoney in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated \ngulf coast in a way that honors the best of America.\n  And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in \nthe Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, \nrobbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure \nlike bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children \nof critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing \nour seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.\n  Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to \ninvestment in America's priorities. Instead, interest payments are a \nsignificant tax on all Americans--a debt tax that Washington doesn't \nwant to talk about. If Washington were serious about honest tax relief \nin this country, we would see an effort to reduce our national debt by \nreturning to responsible fiscal policies.\n  But we are not doing that. Despite repeated efforts by Senators \nConrad and Feingold, the Senate continues to reject a return to the \ncommonsense Pay-go rules that used to apply. Previously, Pay-go rules \napplied both to increases in mandatory spending and to tax cuts. The \nSenate had to abide by the commonsense budgeting principle of balancing \nexpenses and revenues. Unfortunately, the principle was abandoned, and \nnow the demands of budget discipline apply only to spending.\n  As a result, tax breaks have not been paid for by reductions in \nFederal spending, and thus the only way to pay for them has been to \nincrease our deficit to historically high levels and borrow more and \nmore money. Now we have to pay for those tax breaks plus the cost of \nborrowing for them. Instead of reducing the deficit, as some people \nclaimed, the fiscal policies of this administration and its allies in \nCongress will add more than $600 million in debt for each of the next 5 \nyears. That is why I will once again cosponsor the Pay-go amendment and \ncontinue to hope that my colleagues will return to a smart rule that \nhas worked in the past and can work again.\n  Our debt also matters internationally. My friend, the ranking member \nof the Senate Budget Committee, likes to remind us that it took 42 \nPresidents 224 years to run up only $1 trillion of foreign-held debt. \nThis administration did more than that in just 5 years. Now, there is \nnothing wrong with borrowing from foreign countries. But we must \nremember that the more we depend on foreign nations to lend us money, \nthe more our economic security is tied to the whims of foreign leaders \nwhose interests might not be aligned with ours.\n  Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and \ninternationally. Leadership means that ``the buck stops here.'' \nInstead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto \nthe backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\nand a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.\n  I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt \nlimit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nfinal passage.\n  Raising the debt limit is necessary to preserve the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government.\n  We cannot as a Congress pass spending bills and tax bills and then \nrefuse to pay our bills.\n  Refusing to raise the debt limit is like refusing to pay your credit \ncard bill--after you've used your credit card.\n  The time to control the deficits and debt is when we are voting on \nthe spending bills and the tax bills that create it.\n  Raising the debt limit is about meeting the obligations we have \nalready incurred.\n  We must meet our obligations. Vote for this bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the spending process in the Congress is \nbroken. Some will argue that now is not the time to debate spending \nreform or budget reform. They will say that now is not the time to have \na debate about our country's spending priorities. They will argue that \nright now we need to just ``pay our bills'' for past transactions and \ndiscuss reforms some time in the future. Raising the debt limit, \nhowever, does not count as ``paying the bills.'' We are not paying our \nbills.\n  Last fiscal year, the real Federal deficit--the amount by which the \nFederal debt increased--was $538 billion. When we raise the debt limit, \nwe are not ``paying our bills.'' We are merely taking out another line \nof credit--another loan--to allow for more spending that we can't \nafford. It is akin to a deeply indebted family getting a loan for a new \ncar or getting a new credit card or line of credit without cutting up \nthe old credit cards that got them in trouble in the first place.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Government \nspent roughly $2.5 trillion during the last fiscal year. Let's look at \nthat amount of spending another way. If the Federal Government spent \n$2.5 trillion last year, that means that on average, $6.8 billion was \nspent each day, or $78,418 was spent per second by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I believe that it is absolutely necessary to have an open and honest \ndebate about our spending priorities. We are getting ready to increase \nthis country's debt limit to almost $9 trillion. Over the past 5 years, \nour national debt has increased by $3 trillion, or nearly $9,000 per \nAmerican. That is a lot of money. In 1990, our total national debt was \nabout $3 trillion. That means that it took our country more than 200 \nyears to accumulate that amount of debt--200 years to increase our debt \nby $3 trillion. We just added that much new debt in only 5 years.\n  In 2001, the share of Federal debt per person in this country was a \nlittle over $20,000. That includes everyone--not just those in the \nworkforce. According to the Office of Management and Budget and the \nCensus Bureau, total Federal debt per American will rise to $29,000 per \nAmerican by the end of 2006. That is an increase of $9,000 per man, \nwoman, and child in this country since 2001. But a lot of people are \nquick to dismiss that figure. They will say that it doesn't matter, \nthat we only need to worry about how debt and deficits compare to \neconomic growth or to the size of the economy. I think a better rule of \nthumb is how Government growth compares to the growth of wages and \nearnings.\n  If regular Americans are tightening their belts, the Federal \nGovernment should do the same instead of engaging in yet another \nspending binge. Since 2001, total Federal debt per American has \nincreased by $9,000. But over that same time period, the average wages \nof American workers have only increased by $4,200. Over the past 5 \nyears, the growth of Federal debt per person has doubled the growth of \naverage wages of American workers. What makes this situation even worse \nis that that $9,000 increase in debt per person is just going to get \nbigger and bigger because we are not doing anything to cut spending or \nprepare for the impending fiscal crisis that will result from the \nretirement of the baby boomer generation. Interest on that debt is just \ngoing to get larger.\n  Last year, interest costs--the costs of Federal debt that the \nGovernment must pay to those who buy U.S. Treasury bonds--were about 8 \npercent of the total Federal budget. In contrast, the average American \nspends roughly 5 percent of his or her income on credit card debt and \ncar loans according to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Government \nspent close to $200 billion on interest costs alone last year. \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, interest \ncosts will consume 25 percent of the entire Federal budget by 2035. \nLet's put that figure into perspective. Twenty-five percent of the \nFederal budget is a huge amount.\n  By way of comparison, the Department of Education's share of Federal \nspending in 2005 was approximately 3 percent of all Federal spending. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services was responsible for \napproximately 23 percent of all Federal spending. Spending by the \nSocial Security Administration was responsible for about 20 percent of \nall Federal spending. Spending on Medicare was about 12 percent of all \nFederal spending. Spending in 2005 by the Department of Defense--in the \nmidst of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and a global war against \nterrorism--comprised about 19 percent of all Federal spending. Thus, if \nwe do not change our current spending habits, GAO estimates that as a \npercentage of Federal spending, interest costs in 2035 will be larger \nthan defense costs today, Social Security costs today, Medicare costs \ntoday, and education costs today.\n  No family in America would ever be able to manage its finances this \nway. No family would be able to build up insane amounts of debt, \nunilaterally increase all of its credit card limits with no ability to \never pay them off, and still be able to spend, spend, spend without any \naccountability. We have some very serious problems to address regarding \nspending priorities in this country.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress \nappropriated $64 billion in earmarks for 2006, the current fiscal year. \nThat doesn't even include the earmarks from the highway bill that was \npassed in 2005. We are going to spend $64 billion on earmarks and pork \nprojects across the country this year even though it is estimated that \nthe real Federal deficit--including the money that is regularly stolen \nfrom Social Security--will again surpass half a trillion dollars.\n  Earmarks are a serious problem because they put parochial interests \nahead of national priorities. They put the interests of the next \nelection ahead of the interests of the next generation. Some, however, \nargue that earmarks are not really a problem because they comprise a \nsmall percent of the budget. They argue that entitlement spending is \nthe problem and that we ought to address that problem instead of \nfocusing on earmarks. These arguments completely miss the point.\n  If entitlements are the real problem and earmarks are not a problem, \nthen why did entitlement savings passed in the last budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2006 only amount to $5 billion? If entitlements are the \nreal problem, why did we spend 13 times more money on earmarks last \nyear than we saved in entitlement programs? At that rate, we will solve \nour country's fiscal problems some time after never. The budget \nresolution we passed last year created entitlement savings of about $40 \nbillion over the next 5 years. We spent more on earmarks in 1 single \nyear than we saved from entitlement programs over 5 years. Over the \npast 3 years--since 2004--we have spent nearly $160 billion on earmarks \nand special interest pork projects according to the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n  Since 1994, the number of individual earmarks has more than tripled, \nincreasing from 4,126 in 1994 to 12,852 in fiscal year 2006. Of those \n12,852 earmarks, over 95 percent were not even included in bill \nlanguage. Instead, they were hidden within conference reports. Many \nnever even saw the light of day until they were snuck into unamendable \nconference reports that were sure to be rammed through at the last \nminute. Earmarking is a very serious problem that needs to be addressed \nbefore we can get our fiscal house in order. However, there are also \nother spending issues that this body should address.\n  The issue of improper payments by the Federal Government is one that\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\ncan and should be fixed. The subcommittee that I chair--the \nSubcommittee on Federal Financial Management--has examined this issue \nin depth. We have uncovered numerous examples of improper payments that \nwaste taxpayer money and harm those who aren't receiving the assistance \nthey need. An improper payment is basically a payment that was either \nmade to the right person in the wrong amount or a payment that was \ngiven to the wrong person, regardless of the amount. Improper payments \ninclude payments that were too high and payments that were too low.\n  According to estimates by the Office of Management and Budget, \nimproper payments last year totaled $37 billion. That figure is larger \nthan last year's expenditures by the Departments of Commerce, Interior, \nState, and Environmental Protection Agency combined. The amount of \nimproper payments just from last year could have completely funded four \nmajor Federal agencies. Improper payments are a very serious problem. \nFor example, 28 percent of all payments within the earned income tax \ncredit program are incorrectly made. Thus, for every dollar we spend in \nthat program, 25 cents are completely wasted. Improper payments within \nthe Social Security Administration totaled nearly $6 billion. And these \nfigures don't even take into account the seven major programs with \noutlays totaling about $228 billion that are not yet even reporting \ntheir improper payments.\n  There are some who wish to make the issue of spending a partisan \nissue, but it is not a partisan issue. Members of both parties are \nguilty of putting short-term interests ahead of long-term priorities. \nLast week, Members of both parties voted to ignore Senate budget rules \nin order to spend an additional $1 billion that is not paid for on \nhome-heating costs even though the month of January was the warmest on \nrecord and winter will be over in less than a week. Both parties appear \nto lack the political courage to make the hard choices to address our \nimpending fiscal crisis. This issue has nothing to do with Republicans \nand nothing to do with Democrats--it has to do with what is best for \nthe American public.\n  Mr. President, the spending process in this body is broken. Our \npriorities are completely out of whack. Earmarking and wasteful \nspending are out of control. It makes no sense to effectively max out \nour credit cards and ask for a higher credit limit when we have no \nintention and no ability to ever actually pay for our debts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the outcome of today's vote on raising the \ndebt ceiling to nearly $9 trillion is not in question, but our future \neconomic security will be if we do not change from our current \ndisastrous course. We will raise the debt limit today so that the \nUnited States does not default on its obligations, but we cannot for a \nsecond think that we have solved the problem or even moved in the right \ndirection.\n  This will be the fourth time in 5 years that we have had to raise the \namount the Government is allowed to borrow. This is a direct result of \nthe fiscal irresponsibility of this administration. These policies have \ntaken the Nation from 2 years of record surpluses just 6 years ago--\nwhen we were paying down our debt--to record deficits and debt. We are \npassing on a crippling burden to our children and grandchildren and \nthreatening our economic security.\n  Since 2002, we have increased the debt limit by an astounding $3 \ntrillion. And unless we make a significant change in our fiscal \npolicies, there are additional increases in our future. The \nCongressional Budget Office forecasts that our gross Federal debt, \nwhich includes debt the Government owes to the public plus funds owed \nto Federal trust funds, including Social Security and Medicare, will \nclimb from its current level of $8.3 trillion to $12.8 trillion by \n2016. Even this extraordinary estimate does not include either the \ncoming costs of military operations in Iraq or the substantial cost of \nfixing the alternative minimum tax, which if left unchanged will impose \nunintended tax increases on middle-income taxpayers, which most agree \nneed to be changed.\n  The burden this massive debt puts on our children is staggering. \nToday, each American citizen's share of the debt is over $27,000, and \nit will rise to over $39,000 by 2016. Paying off this debt will require \neither extraordinary tax increases or significant cuts in critical \nareas such as defense or Social Security. Tragically, it will mean that \nan increasing number of taxpayer dollars will be spent not on moving \nAmerica forward but simply on treading water by making interest \npayments to our creditors. Even under the CBO's conservative estimates, \ninterest payments on the gross debt will rise from $352 billion in 2005 \nto $662 billion in 2016. That means over the next 10 years, we will \nspend an estimated $5.6 trillion on interest payments alone. Making \nthese interest payments means fewer resources are available for our \nnational priorities such as shoring up the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds as the babyboom generation begins to retire.\n  Equally disturbing is what this rampant borrowing will mean for our \neconomic security. As we go deeper into debt to foreign countries we \nare losing control of our own destiny. Over 90 percent of our newly \nissued debt is being purchased by foreigners. By the end of 2004, U.S. \nTreasury debt held by foreigners was close to $2.2 trillion, more than \ndouble the amount that was held at the beginning of this \nadministration. This large amount of foreign debt leaves us vulnerable \nto the priorities of foreign creditors. If foreign investors, including \ncountries, were to decide, for economic or political reasons, to stop \nfinancing our debt, the U.S. economy would be in for a severe shock.\n  Even without a catastrophic event, our unbridled foreign borrowing \nerodes our power by providing other countries with leverage during \ntrade or other negotiations. We cannot delude ourselves into thinking \nwe can maintain our position in the world if we can't even balance our \ncheckbook.\n  We need to turn away from this administration's irresponsible fiscal \npolicies. One of the best steps we could take would be to reinstate \npay-as-you-go budget enforcement rules that require tax cuts and not \njust spending to be paid for. This approach worked during the 1990s to \nhelp bring about the first surpluses in a generation, and it can work \nagain.\n  We should also revisit this administration's irresponsible and unfair \ntax cuts that have driven us so deeply into this deficit ditch. It is \nunconscionable that middle-class Americans will be paying for years for \ntax cuts that went primarily to the wealthiest among us. In fact, the \ntop 5 percent of households in our country, whose average income is \nmore than $250,000 a year, received almost half of the President's tax \ncuts.\n  Today's action to raise the debt limit will hopefully be a reality \ncheck on what Republican fiscal policies have wrought. We need to \nchange course. We need to return to fiscal responsibility. And we need \nto start climbing out of this deficit ditch before we are buried in it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent this morning when \nwe considered Senator Baucus's amendment to the debt limit increase. If \nI had been here, I would have supported the Baucus amendment.\n  The Baucus amendment is clearly needed. The massive scale of other \nnations' accumulation of our debt has added another level of danger and \ncomplexity to our international economic relations.\n  This is a two-way street. The tsunami of debt created by the policies \nof this administration has to go somewhere. China is one of the major \npurchasers of that debt. Japan, Great Britain, and others have major \nholdings, too. In the short term, that has soaked up a lot of our \nbonds, and helped to keep interest rates down. That is a good thing.\n  However, that has kept the Chinese currency artificially low, and \nours artificially high. So they can sell their products at a discount, \nand our exports are more expensive. That is a bad thing.\n  Our trade deficit was a record $726 billion last year; $202 billion \nof that was our trade deficit with China alone.\n  But as the rest of the world copes with the waves of U.S. debt, we \nare now all in the same leaky boat. There is just so much of our debt \nother nations want to hold. The more of it they accumulate, the closer \nwe are to the day when they will not want any more.\n  When that happens, slowly or rapidly, our interest rates will go up, \nthe value of their U.S. bonds will drop, and\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nwe will all have big problems. We need both more awareness, and more \nunderstanding, of this fundamental threat to our economic well being \nand the global economy.\n  But the roots of that threat lie in the disastrous policies of this \nadministration.\n  Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted, because it \nwas foreseeable, because it was unnecessary, because it was the result \nof willful and reckless disregard for the warnings that were given and \nfor the fundamentals of economic management, I am voting against the \ndebt limit increase.\n  In the 5 years he has been in office, President Bush has added more \nto our foreign debt that the 42 Presidents before him. It took 224 \nyears to accumulate $1 trillion of debt to other nations. It took \nPresident Bush just 5 years to more than double it.\n  Over $3 trillion in debt, foreign debt and debt held by Americans, \nhas been piled up by this administration.\n  When he set out on the course that brought us to this sorry state, \nthe President was clearly and repeatedly warned that massive tax cuts \nwould leave us vulnerable to natural disasters, economic slowdown, or \nthreats to our national security. ``Don't worry,'' the President told \nus. ``I know what I am doing.''\n  After 9/11, in the face of what he has himself called the moral \nequivalent of the World War II, or the Cold War, he insisted that while \neverything else had changed, he would not change his economic policies.\n  Facts had changed. His promise to balance the budget, his promise to \npay down the debt, were proved to be false.\n  But he refused to take responsibility for his policies. He refused to \nadmit that a changed world demanded a change of course. His refusal has \npushed us deeper and deeper into the hole.\n  His refusal added $450 billion to the debt in 2002; it added $984 \nbillion in 2003; it added $800 billion in 2004. And here we are again \ntoday, adding another $781 billion. With that addition, our national \ndebt will be $8.6 trillion at the end of this year.\n  The President's budget plans will bring that number to $11.8 trillion \nat the end of the next 5 years.\n  This is a record of utter disregard for our Nation's financial \nfuture. It is a record of indifference to the price our children and \ngrandchildren will pay to redeem our debt when it comes due.\n  History will not judge this record kindly.\n  My vote against the debt limit increase cannot change the fact that \nwe have incurred this debt already, and will no doubt incur more. It is \na statement that I refuse to be associated with the policies that \nbrought us to this point.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Bush administration seeks for the fourth \ntime in 5 years to increase the indebtedness of the United States--this \ntime by $781 billion. This body's consideration of that increase allows \nus a moment to take stock of the abysmal fiscal health of our country.\n  As a Washington Post editorial pointed out yesterday morning, this \nPresident solemnly pledged upon taking office to payoff $2 trillion in \ndebt held by the public over the next decade. It is patently obvious \nthat President Bush has not just failed but failed spectacularly to \ndeliver on his pledge. He has managed to amass more debt than any \nPresident in history, with no end in sight.\n  By the end of this year, our gross Federal debt is expected to \nsurpass $8.6 trillion, or nearly $28,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. This amount represents an increase of approximately \n$3 trillion since President Bush took office.\n  This dramatic runup in the debt has real costs for America's \nfamilies--both today and for future generations. It puts upward \npressure on interest rates for things like student loans, home \nmortgages, and automobile loans. It raises the cost of capital for \nbusiness investment. Each of these, in everything but name, represents \na tax increase on American families and businesses.\n  More directly, instead of investing in America's most important \npriorities--like education, health care, and homeland security--the \ntaxpayers of today and tomorrow must spend more money paying off \nyesterday's debts. In the late 1990s, interest on the debt represented \na declining share of our total budget. Today, that share has begun to \nrise once again, a trend that would continue under the budget put \nforward by the administration and the leadership in this body. For 2007 \nalone, taxpayers will spend $247 billion dollars on interest on the \ndebt instead of American troops and veterans or American families and \nchildren.\n  Our leaders have to be candid with the American public about the \nsources of this unprecedented level of indebtedness.\n  The administration is not incurring these debts in order to invest in \neducation. They are not supporting States and local communities \nstruggling to meet their school funding needs out of property taxes.\n  The administration is not incurring these debts to improve our \ninfrastructure. States, municipalities, and local communities are \nstruggling desperately just to maintain the infrastructure they have--\nroads, bridges, ports. They are struggling to maintain a 20th century \ninfrastructure, let alone build a 21st century one.\n  Certainly, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have had a cost. So have \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and natural disasters. \nThough the President has been quick to blame factors like these, the \ntruth is the tax policies of his administration have played a far \ngreater role in creating the budget deficits accumulated on his watch.\n  Under those policies, this administration has spent close to $125 \nbillion on tax benefits for the few most fortunate households in \nAmerica--those 0.2 percent of individuals making more than $1 million \nper year--while doing little, if anything, for families in the middle \nand those working hard to get themselves in the middle.\n  In a time of war and fiscal and economic strain, this administration \nhas delivered a tax windfall to the most fortunate. Never before has a \nPresident made this choice during a time of war.\n  Regrettably, this kind of shortsighted leadership has been \nrubberstamped repeatedly by the leaders of this Congress on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  I would have hoped, at a minimum, that we as a body could adopt \nmeasures to restore some semblance of fiscal sanity, such as pay-as-\nyou-go budget procedures or a smaller debt limit increase. \nUnfortunately, neither of these common sense reforms was adopted. \nIndeed, the majority even rejected an amendment by the Senator from \nMontana to merely study the impact that foreign-held U.S. debt is \nhaving on our Nation's long-term well-being.\n  We cannot erase what has happened in the past, but we can demonstrate \nto the people of our country going forward that the Senate is willing \nto take commonsense steps to put our Nation back on firmer budgetary \nfooting. That, regrettably, has not happened in the Senate today. \nHowever, many of us will continue the effort to place our nation's \nfiscal house on firmer ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading of the \njoint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Graham of South Carolina be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last year, Congress made some real \nprogress in getting a handle on mandatory spending by passing the \nDeficit Reduction Act. The Deficit Reduction Act will reduce mandatory \nspending by nearly $100 billion over the next decade, and it is the \nfirst time Congress has taken a hard look at how to find savings and \nreduce the budget deficit on the mandatory spending side since 1997.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act is a good first step. My amendment builds \non the savings of the Deficit Reduction Act. My amendment lowers the \nFederal budget deficit, lowers the Federal debt, and does not increase \ntaxes on the American people.\n  Today, the Federal budget, as we all know, is heavily weighted in \nfavor of mandatory spending--entitlement spending, so to speak. As \npeople live longer and the baby boom generation retires, that spending \nwill increase and eat up a larger and larger share of our budget.\n  Just in Medicare and Medicaid alone, in the last 5 years, we have \nseen a 22-percent increase in entitlement spending for those two \nprograms. And if we don't do something in the next 30 years about \nentitlement spending, we won't have a dime of revenue to pay for other \nitems that are important, such as defense, education, NIH research, and \npayments to health care providers to reimbursement under Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  My amendment directs the Senate Finance Committee to find $10 billion \nin additional savings over the next 5 years. One proposal for the \nFinance Committee to consider under this amendment would be to repeal \nthe stabilization fund included in the Medicare Modernization Act. Let \nme explain what that is.\n  This is essentially a bonus provision to preferred provider \norganizations--insurance companies, in other words--over and above the \nregular Medicare share to encourage them to participate in the Medicare \nProgram. There simply is no reason to increase the Federal subsidy for \nthese insurance companies over and above regular Medicare payments. We \nshould eliminate that bonus and use that money, which is not necessary, \nto pay down the debt by $7 billion.\n  There are other good areas I believe for the Finance Committee to \nfind the $10 billion this amendment would require. The problem is this: \nIf we don't do something about the autopilot our budget is on when it \ncomes to the mandatory side of spending, we have only ourselves to \nblame because no one is at the wheel, and I am afraid the plane will \ncrash all too soon. We are feeling the squeeze already. The \nappropriators, I know, are trying to squeeze more and more out of the \ndiscretionary spending portion of the budget because as the mandatory \nand entitlement side rose, there was less and less flexibility for \nspending on important programs that represent America's priorities \nunder the discretionary portion of the budget.\n\n  So I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. It is one \nthat can be done without detracting from current Medicare spending, but \neliminates this bonus provision, this additional cash or Federal \nsubsidy that is provided for under the law that could be saved and be \nput to more constructive use, showing that we are serious about fiscal \nresponsibility and paying down the debt.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. I think \nit is an excellent idea and hopefully it will be successful. \nStabilization money is certainly available. It is walking-around money. \nWe don't need to have it sitting there, and we should use it for \nreducing the deficit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a difficult matter for this \nSenator because I have proposed many times to my colleagues doing away \nwith the stabilization fund. So this amendment puts me in a quandary to \nthe extent that if we can assure that with this amendment we would \neliminate the stabilization fund, I would be with the Senator.\n  The problem we face here is, No. 1, the stabilization fund is $6.2 \nbillion, it is not $10 billion. No. 2, because of the way the budget \nresolution works, we cannot direct the Finance Committee on how to make \nthe reduction. I wish we could, but we cannot.\n  What we would be doing, in effect, by the Senator's amendment is \ntelling the Finance Committee to cut $10 billion out of Medicare. They \ncould do that in any number of ways without affecting the stabilization \nfund at all. In fact, colleagues may recall last year the Senate told \nthe Finance Committee to take out the stabilization fund. I call it the \nslush fund. I think it is an absolute waste of money. I absolutely \nagree with the Senator on that point. But we all know at the end of the \nprocess, the stabilization fund was left intact because the way the \nbudget process works, we give an instruction about how much finances to \ncut, but we cannot tell them how to do it.\n  So I want my colleagues to know that is the circumstance we face with \nthis amendment. I thank the Senator for the good faith of his \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3025\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of my filed amendment \nNo. 3025. I will not formally call it up because some revisions to it \nare still being worked on in conjunction with my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, and many other leaders in the Senate. But \nI will speak on this very important topic, and it has to do with \nmeeting in a positive and responsible way our ongoing needs throughout \nall the coastal areas--not just Louisiana--for hurricane protection and \nother coastal needs.\n  Obviously, we have faced many challenges since Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita. This is a responsible way to help meet those needs and to help \nfuture coastal needs of all coastal States and to do it in a way that \nwe can afford and that we can build into the budget. Rather than having \nto come back here every 2 months, every 3 months for additional \nappropriations, wouldn't it be far better to have a stable revenue \nsource that can help us meet these needs directly? The biggest part of \nthat stable revenue source is royalty share, getting our fair share of \nwhat we produce off our coasts in terms of offshore oil and gas.\n  This amendment is a first vital step in that direction because it \nwould look to excess revenue, not anything built into the budget right \nnow, but excess revenue in three areas to use for those vital purposes, \nnot just for Louisiana\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nbut for coastal needs and coastal States in general.\n  What are these three areas I am talking about? The first would be \noffshore energy production, future revenues that aren't built into the \nbudget now. The second would be the Federal share of ANWR energy \nproduction, should we pass that and say yes to that in the near future. \nOf course, ANWR is the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The third would \nbe DTV revenue that comes in above the current projections for those \nspectrum auctions.\n  Again, this is a vital first step that can get us on this path to \nself-sufficiency, to taking care of these crucial needs without \nconstantly having to come here and look for direct Federal \nappropriations. We continue to work to perfect this amendment No. 3025 \nso it can gain support.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3078\n\n  I formally call up amendment No. 3078, which is a separate amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3078.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund to prevent catastrophic loss)\n\n       On page 43, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 313. RESERVE FUND TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC LOSS.\n\n       If--\n       (1) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the \n     Senate reports a bill or joint resolution, or if an amendment \n     is offered thereto, or if a conference report is submitted \n     thereon, that increases investment in measures designed to \n     prevent catastrophic flood and hurricane damage in coastal \n     areas such that--\n       (A) the measures, when completed, will likely decrease \n     future expenditures from the Disaster Relief Fund;\n       (B) the increases do not exceed $10,000,000,000; and\n       (C) the measures are certified by the President as likely \n     to prevent loss of life and property; and\n       (2) that Committee is within its allocation as provided \n     under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     (2 U.S.C. 633(a));\n\n     the Chairperson of the Committee on Budget of the Senate may \n     make the appropriate adjustments in the allocations and \n     aggregates to the extent that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for the fiscal year 2007 and for the \n     period of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, very quickly, this is a separate amendment \nthat would give us flexibility in the context of the budget to account \nfor future levy and hurricane protection projects should the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee pass out a bill that authorizes \nthese important projects. It builds flexibility into the budget through \na reserve fund without busting the budget, without doing any harm to \nthe budget numbers and the overall caps. I look forward to my \ncolleagues' support of this flexibility.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the two Senators from Louisiana, \nespecially Senator Landrieu, for working with her colleague Senator \nVitter on this important amendment for their home State that has \nobviously been so badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina. I thank Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Vitter for working together in a bipartisan way to \nbegin to rebuild additional resources as their State has been so hard \nhit.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. He and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire have done a fine job leading us through this budget. \nIt is a tough instrument, of course, to negotiate.\n  Senator Vitter and I are pleased to come to the floor to speak about \nthree particular amendments that will be offered later in the day. One \nthat will be discussed in more detail is a small business amendment. He \nand I serve together on the Small Business Committee. It has become \napparent to us there are many issues regarding the slowness in which \nthe applications our small businesses are putting in but not getting \ntheir due checks based on the current law fast enough to get them \nreestablished. So we will be offering an amendment on a small business \nissue which I will be cosponsoring with him later.\n  These two issues we are speaking about this morning on levees are an \nauthorization for an additional $10 billion through the committee \nSenator Vitter serves on to try to get the authorization levels up. Mr. \nPresident, as you know, because you just visited our great State, any \nnumber of levy projects throughout all of south Louisiana, from \nsouthwest to southeast, from the metropolitan area of New Orleans to \nthe metropolitan area of Thibodaux, Houma, Lake Charles, and rural \nareas of Cameron and Vermilion Parish, all are short of the levy \nsystems they need to protect themselves and are short of money to our \ncoastal restoration efforts that serve as the first barrier against \nstorms such as Rita and Katrina.\n  So the second amendment I hope our colleagues will consider is a $10 \nbillion authorization increase in one of the committees Senator Vitter \nserves on, EPW. A critical third amendment we will discuss later when \nthe details are worked out is a gulf coast recovery fund. That fund \nwill take some additional revenues flowing into the Treasury from \nadditional offshore oil and gas revenues, not specified to any \nparticular place in the gulf, but of course the ANWR revenues and some \nothers that may be coming in if this resolution passes, to support \ndirect funding, coastal impact assistance to the Gulf Coast States: \nTexas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. The Gulf Coast States that \nserve as America's only energy coast have been devastated by these two \nstorms. Some smart investments now will save us billions of dollars \ndown the road.\n  Of course, we say from Louisiana and the gulf coast, if it weren't \nfor our Gulf Coast States, we wouldn't even be able to access the great \nmineral revenues off our shores, right off the southern shore of the \nUnited States. So I am pleased to join with my colleague and work \nthrough the better part of today on these three amendments.\n  Then at an additional time later on, with the leadership's go-ahead, \nwe will also hopefully be discussing a defense amendment very important \nto the Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport.\n  I thank my colleagues for their generosity, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan is on the floor. Would the Senator \nfrom Michigan be prepared to present her amendment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes--is that sufficient time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, and then \nnext on our side will be Senator Akaka, and then I think Senator \nCollins is in line, and then Senator Lincoln.\n  Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Senator Conrad. Again, thank you for your \nleadership on the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if it is agreeable to the chairman, I have \na report I am supposed to do at the luncheon that is going on. If I \ncould give the time at this point to people, would that be appropriate?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would suggest that we reach a unanimous consent \nagreement that on the list you identified, everybody be granted 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we do 4 minutes? Because we have a bit of a time \nconstraint, could we do 4 minutes?\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might ask, are we asking for 2 minutes per side?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. It would be 4 minutes for each of the Senators.\n  Mr. GREGG. And that will come off your time when the Democratic \nMembers make offers, and when we make offers, it will come off of our \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nmake veterans health care funding assured and mandatory.\n  Real security means supporting our troops abroad and making sure they \nhave the body armor and the equipment they need, but it also means \nsupporting them when they come home. It means giving our current and \nour future veterans the health care they need and deserve.\n  The amendment I am offering today provides full funding for veterans \nmedical care to ensure that the VA has the resources necessary to \nprovide quality health care in a timely manner to our Nation's sick and \ndisabled veterans.\n  The problem we face today is that resources for veterans health care \nare falling behind demand, and we know this because every year we are \ntrying to address the shortfall.\n  In 1993, there were about 2.5 million veterans in the VA health care \nsystem. Today there are more than 7 million veterans enrolled in the \nsystem, over half of whom receive care on a regular basis.\n  Despite the 160-percent increase in patients over the last decade, \nthe VA has received an average of only a 5-percent increase in \nappropriations during this administration. Some of my colleagues will \nsay this amendment isn't necessary because there have been funding \nincreases over the last several years. They also say we do not need to \ncreate another entitlement program. Over the last 2 years, we have seen \na 500-percent increase in the number of veterans seeking care from the \nVA who have been serving in Iraq and serving in Afghanistan. But the \nadministration's budget projects that the VA will treat 109,191 \nveterans next year, and this falls over 35,000 veterans short of the \nnumber of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans the VA currently treats. So we \nsee a 500-percent increase in the number of veterans coming home after \nserving us bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet their budget \nassumes that there are 35,000 fewer--fewer than last year--fewer Iraq \nand Afghanistan veterans we are going to treat next year. These numbers \ndo not make sense.\n  Last year's budget is also a case study on why we need to have \nassured funding for VA health care. In total, Congress provided an \nadditional $3 billion for veterans health care because the \nadministration grossly miscalculated the need for veterans health care.\n  We need to finally move this into a category where every year those \nveterans coming home who need health care will know that the dollars \nare there based on their eligibility, based on their service, based on \ntheir need--not based on a debate on the floor in the Congress about \nhow much we are willing to spend to address their health care needs. \nThis should not be a year-to-year debate and commitment; this should be \nan assured commitment that the dollars will be there. Just as they are \nfor Medicare, for Medicaid, our veterans ought to know that every year, \ntheir funding for critical health care services will be assured.\n  Today's soldiers are tomorrow's veterans. America has made a promise \nto these brave men and women to provide them with the care they need--\nnot based on a debate on how much we want to spend or calculations year \nto year on the numbers that folks think may or may not seek care. This \nought to be about making sure that every one of our brave men and women \ncoming home, whether it is from the current wars or whether it is our \nWorld War II vets or any other war or conflict in which our soldiers \nhave been serving--when they need health care as veterans, we will \nfulfill our promises to make sure it is there for them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment, \nsupported by all of the major veterans organizations in this country. \nIt is time to get this done and get it done right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3071\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \naccommodating this amendment. I am very grateful.\n  I rise with Senators Clinton, Kennedy, Bingaman, Dodd, Menendez, \nKerry, Lieberman, Cantwell, Schumer, Landrieu, Mikulski, Salazar, \nLincoln, Durbin, and Kohl to offer an amendment to the FY 2007 Budget \nResolution to restore Title I funding within the No Child Left Behind \nAct. Certainly, NCLB has come under fire as schools across the country \nstruggle to comply with its requirements, particularly for higher \nstudent test scores and teacher qualifications. My colleagues and I \nhave gone on record several times about what we need to do to change \nthe NCLB, to respond to the urgent concerns and needs in all of our \ncommunities, including those in my state of Hawaii.\n  However, today, we are not talking about deficiencies in the Act, but \na shortfall in its funding, and about misplaced budget priorities. This \nbudget resolution is similar to the President's budget in its stated \npriorities. It has debt-financed tax cuts that largely benefit the \nwell-off and special interests. It presents a five year plan, which \ndoes not recognize the significant negative impact on revenues that tax \ncuts will have beyond the next five years. It proposes $14 billion in \nnet mandatory spending cuts. It also omits war costs beyond 2007. We \nsomewhat improved the measure by increasing veterans and defense \nfunding, even if I do not fully agree with the budget gimmick that was \nused to offset these increases.\n  However, if we pass this budget as is, we fail our students and \nteachers once again by underfunding education. The President's FY 2007 \nbudget proposed the largest cut to federal education funding in the \nEducation Department's 26-year history, a $2.1 billion reduction. As \napproved by the Budget Committee, the budget resolution did not do much \nbetter, including the same total amount for discretionary spending, \nwith no guarantee that education would be increased. We must not \nunderfund an area that represents the future of this country. As we \ndebate the need to remain competitive in the world, and worry about \nother countries overtaking us in producing scientists, engineers, and \nprofessionals in other areas important to our industries and national \nsecurity, we cannot let education take the hit.\n  The Title I funding shortfall, the amount below authorized levels, is \n$12.3 billion for FY 2007. This increases the cumulative Title I \nshortfall since NCLB's enactment to $43.7 billion. Actual funding has \nbarely increased since 2002, which continued to grow the gap between \nauthorized and actual funding. The rightful amount in FY 2007 for Title \nI, as authorized, should be $25 billion. This budget resolution puts \nthe amount at $12.7 billion.\n  Mr. President, we are being realistic with our amendment, given our \ncurrent budgetary climate. We are asking for a modest, responsible \nincrease of almost $3 billion, which is what the President's initial \nbudget requests sought to do. Let me underscore that point--our \namendment would do what the President said he wanted to do in previous \nyears, which is to secure an additional $4 billion in funding--$1 \nbillion annually--since FY 2004. Actual increases since then add up to \njust over $1 billion. In addition, the amendment is fully offset by \nclosing abusive corporate tax loopholes.\n  If we don't pass our amendment, Mr. President, 3.7 million students \nwill not be served by the Title I program. A total of 29 states stand \nto lose Title I funding, according to the Department of Education, \nincluding Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, \nNebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, \nVirginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  Another 7 states will be level-funded, including Alaska, Delaware, \nNew Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming.\n  The remaining states that gain overall funding will still have many \ndistricts--maybe even a majority of those districts--lose funding. In \naddition, we must not forget history--even if states would gain this \nyear, they likely lost in a previous year. My state of Hawaii is in \nthis last category, for example, having received $47.5 million in FY \n2005, and more than a million dollars less in FY 2006 including across-\nthe-board cuts, at about $46.4 million.\n  To extend this last point further, many states will have cuts a \nsecond year in a row, and some would be cut for four or even five years \nin a row. Twenty-nine states will receive less Title I money than they \ndid two years ago in FY 2005: Alaska, Arkansas, California, \nConnecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, \nVermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  Fifteen states will receive less Title I money than they did three \nyears ago in FY 2004: California, Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, \nMassachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, \nOklahoma, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  Nine states will receive less Title I money than they did 4 years ago \nin FY 2003: Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, New Jersey, and North Dakota.\n  Three states will receive less Title I money than they did 5 years \nago in FY 2002, which is less than they got before NCLB: Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota.\n  The District of Columbia will receive less money than it did in FY \n2004 or FY 2005.\n  The Northern Mariana Islands will receive less Title I money in FY \n2007 than it had received in any of the years since the NCLB's \nenactment.\n  Let me remind my colleagues who we are hurting by failing to \nadequately fund Title I. This comprehensive education program focuses \nhelp on disadvantaged children--those from lower-income families. Title \nI helps these students meet state and local academic standards, with \nscientifically-proven instructional support, in basic subjects such as \nreading, language arts, and mathematics. Title I provides support \nthrough guidance, health, nutrition, and social services. It also \nprovides resources for comprehensive school-wide planning, professional \ndevelopment, curriculum development, parental involvement, and \nacquisition of instructional materials and equipment. Now some may say \nthat federal assistance does not help all schools, only Title I \nschools, but that is not true--the statewide accountability system \nrequired under Title I applies to all public schools. So this program, \nthis central piece of the NCLB, works to meet urgent needs in all of \npublic education.\n  Students, school faculty and staff, parents, and education \nadministrators have been trying, mightily in some cases, to meet the \nchallenges posed by NCLB and raise student academic achievement. We \nneed to do this--to ensure that our citizens have the knowledge and \nskills they need to succeed when they leave school and enter the \nworkforce or other pursuits. However, this is very difficult to do if \nthey lack adequate funding.\n  I can give you concrete examples of how our schools are suffering \nthat I\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\njust heard of this week, when I met with a representative of Hawaii's \nPTSA, our affiliate of national PTA. Some students in Hawaii are having \nbread and water for lunch. Why? Because the schools don't have enough \nresources to ensure that parents know how to apply for reduced and free \nlunch. Parents who have raised funds to install air conditioners in hot \nclassrooms, to allow students and teachers to concentrate on learning, \ncannot do so because the education system cannot afford the additional \nelectricity costs. Students are not receiving extra help through \ntutoring in reading and math because funds are needed for other \nservices that are deemed essential. Hawaii's schools are suffering \nbecause they need a greater infusion of resources, and we need to help \nthem from the federal level, as we said we would when we approved the \nNCLB.\n  Our schools will continue working to serve our kids and achieving the \nbiggest bang for the buck, which is what education has been forced to \ndo all along. I know this to my core, because I know what it's like to \nbe in the shoes of those in education. I spent nearly two decades in \neducation. I taught in several of Hawaii's elementary, middle, and high \nschools. Public and private. In the classroom, in music rooms, and in \nlabs. In administration--as a vice principal and a principal. As a \nrepresentative of Hawaii's principals to a national organization. And \nas a statewide administrator for the Hawaii Department of Education for \nthe Model Cities program. I know what it's like to stretch the \neducation dollar. However, we must stop being behind the curve with \neducation funding.\n  Education funding must be a given, not just a goal. Our Title I \namendment goes partway toward making that happen, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, \nCouncil of State School Officers, and other education organizations \nsupport this increase for Title I. I ask unanimous consent that letters \nof support from the AFT and NEA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Federation of Teachers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2006.\n     Office of the Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the more than 1.3 million \n     members of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), I am \n     writing in support of your Title I amendment to the fiscal \n     year (FY) 2007 budget resolution.\n       Knowing that the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     (NCLB) could only be achieved with accountability and \n     dedicated resources, Congress set a funding authorization for \n     the program each year.\n       In the three years following NCLB's passage, K-12 education \n     programs received average annual increases of $5 billion. \n     However, this steady growth has stalled, as witnessed in the \n     past two appropriations bills (FY 2005 and FY 06). Currently, \n     the gap between authorized and appropriated funds for Title I \n     from FY 02 through FY 06 is $40.3 billion. In addition, the \n     president's budget provides no increase this year for Title \n     I. Given inflation, this would amount to a cut in many \n     districts. It would have a devastating effect on schools that \n     educate large numbers of poor and minority students.\n       It would also exacerbate a problem that has occurred over \n     the past few years as a result of chronic underfunding. The \n     U.S. Education Department projects that 29 states will lose \n     Title I funding and seven states will be level-funded in FY \n     07 if the president's budget request is enacted. The \n     remaining states, those that gain funding overall, will see \n     many of their individual school districts--possibly most of \n     them--lose funding. Also, any gains will not make up for \n     funding shortfalls since NCLB's enactment.\n       Your amendment seeks a relatively modest increase to help \n     us move a step closer toward fully funding Title I. President \n     Bush has acknowledged the need to increase Title I funding by \n     $1 billion in FY 2004 and FY 2005, although actual increases \n     over the past four years have amounted to much less.\n       At a time when schools and teachers are working hard to \n     meet the requirements of NCLB, this amendment will be a boost \n     for students, teachers, and school districts nationwide. \n     Ensuring that all children have highly qualified teachers and \n     that struggling schools have the tools to improve can't be \n     done on the cheap. Research indicates that recruiting highly \n     qualified teachers for hard-to-staff schools requires \n     improving the physical plant, providing up-to-date textbooks \n     and other learning resources, implementing proven curricula, \n     attracting and retaining exemplary administrative staff and \n     providing professional development and financial resources \n     for teachers.\n       The AFT applauds you and your colleagues for making \n     education a top priority in this budget. Securing these \n     resources for the upcoming school year is critical to our \n     collective efforts to support and improve our nation's public \n     schools.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kristor W. Cowan,\n     Director, Legislation Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.8 million members, we would like to \n     express our support for an amendment to be offered by Senator \n     Akaka (D-HI) to the proposed fy07 budget resolution that \n     would allow for an increase of $3 billion for Title I. This \n     amendment would build on the important foundation offered by \n     the just-passed Specter-Harkin amendment, which would \n     replenish key education and health programs recently cut.\n       The Administration has called Title I the cornerstone of No \n     Child Left Behind. The program provides invaluable funds to \n     help close achievement gaps and maximize student learning. It \n     funds supplemental programs to enable educationally \n     disadvantaged students, particularly those attending schools \n     in high-poverty areas, to meet challenging academic \n     standards. It also pays the salaries of teachers and \n     paraprofessionals, funds pre-K, after-school, and summer \n     school programs, and provides for professional development \n     for teachers and paraprofessionals.\n       Unfortunately, Title I continues to be significantly \n     underfunded, denying too many eligible students the full \n     services they need to succeed. The budget proposal before the \n     Senate would shortchange Title I by $12.3 billion below the \n     amount authorized in the No Child Left Behind Act. If enacted \n     as proposed, the budget will reduce Title I funding for 29 \n     states and will flat-fund seven additional states. As a \n     result, the budget would deny essential Title I services to \n     some 3.7 million children.\n       The Akaka amendment would allow for a relatively modest $3 \n     billion increase for Title I, offset by closing abusive \n     corporate tax loopholes. In so doing, it would allow for an \n     important step in the right direction for this critical \n     program.\n       Again, we urge your support for this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3066\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3066, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. DeWine, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n     Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 3066.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that first responder and state and local government \n grant programs key to our Nation's homeland security are funded at no \n less than FY 2006 levels and to provide increases for port security, \nfirst responder programs, rail/transit security, and National Response \n      Plan Training, offset by discretionary spending reductions)\n\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 22, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 1, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 22, increase the amount by $488,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $164,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $227,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $494,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $171,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $158,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $146,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, increase the amount by $19,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $986,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $338,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, decrease the amount by $386,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 5, decrease the amount by $221,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $41,000,000.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment, which is cosponsored by my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman--we would like to add as additional cosponsors \nSenators DeWine, Snowe, Kennedy, and Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an \namendment offered by Senator Collins and myself to the Fiscal Year 2007 \nbudget resolution to strengthen our homeland security efforts--\nparticularly the ability of first responders to prevent, prepare for, \nrespond to, and recover from terrorist attacks or catastrophic natural \ndisasters.\n  I have also filed an amendment that would increase the President's \nGovernment-wide homeland security budget by $8 billion--an amount still \nfar below what the experts tell us we need to be as safe as we should \nbe. I think the Nation would be best served by a healthier investment \nin homeland security, but I am happy to join with Senator Collins to \noffer this smaller $986 million proposal as a way to ensure support for \nfirst responders; rail, transit, port and cargo security, Coast Guard \nresearch and development, and assorted other programs.\n  September 11, 2001, changed our lives forever. We face new and \ndangerous threats from our enemies that we must be prepared to deal \nwith. Furthermore, the Federa1 response to Hurricane Katrina proved \nbeyond a shadow of a doubt that we are still a Nation unprepared for \ncatastrophe. Yet, the Bush administration seems to have turned its back \non the lessons of September 11, 2001, and of August 29, 2005, the day \nHurricane Katrina made landfall. And this budget resolution, which \nlargely reflects the President's budget proposal, does nothing to \nindicate otherwise.\n  We know our first responders lack the training, equipment, and \nfrequently the manpower they need to do their jobs. Most don't even \nhave the basic capability to communicate with one another across \njurisdictional and service lines, and Hurricane Katrina demonstrated \nthat sometimes during a major catastrophe they can't communicate at \nall.\n  Yet, the President's fiscal year 2007 budget proposal eliminates a \nnumber of first responder programs and cuts others, leaving those on \nthe frontlines of the war against terror or on the frontlines of a \nhurricane, struggling to make due with less. Our amendment would add \n$860 million to restore and expand first responder programs.\n  We would restore $400 million for the Law Enforcement Terrorist \nPrevention Program, which the administration would totally eliminate; \n$251 million for the FIRE grants, which provide training and equipment \nto firefighters; $110 million to restore the SAFER Act, which helps \nrecruit, hire and train local firefighters and which the administration \nwould eliminate; $30 million for the Metropolitan Medical Response \nSystem which helps prepare local health officials for mass casualties; \nand $15 million for emergency preparedness grants. We would also add \n$67 million to the primary homeland security grants for States.\n  After first responders, port security would get the second highest \namount of funding under our amendment--for a total of $427 million for \nport security. Perhaps one of the unintended consequences of the Dubai \nPorts World fracas was that it underscored the need for better port \nsecurity. Ninety-five percent of all our trade flows through our ports, \nand a terrorist event at one could cause economic havoc. Security \nexperts have also warned that WMD would most likely be smuggled into \nthe country in a shipping container.\n  Our amendment would commit to strengthening port security by \nreallocating funding for the Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program \nto ensure a dedicated $300 million for port security grants. Another $2 \nmillion would be set aside to audit the grants to ensure the money is \nbeing used properly and efficiently.\n  Furthermore, we would provide $20 million for additional staff for \nthe C-TPAT program--which permits expedited shipping for known \ncompanies that increase their shipping security. Currently, there are \njust 80 people responsible for overseeing 10,000 applications to the \nprogram. We would include $105 million for cutting-edge imaging \ninspection equipment for better cargo security and $4 million the \nadministration cut from the Coast Guard's R program.\n  Because we know our rail and transit system is wide open, vulnerable, \nand appealing to terrorists, and because the President's budget \neliminates rail and transit grants, we would dedicate $200 million \nspecifically for rail and transit security grants, just as we did for \nport security grants. Fourteen million Americans ride mass transit each \nweekday, more than 16 times the number of daily trips taken by \nAmericans on domestic airlines. Let's not fail to learn the lessons of \nattacks on the London, Madrid, Moscow, Tokyo, and Israeli rail and \ntransit systems.\n  Our enemies are ruthless and choose their own battlefields in the \ncommunities where we live and work. Nature, too, can be ruthless and \nwill strike in unpredictable ways year after year. We must have first \nresponders who are trained and equipped not just to prepare for and \nrespond to catastrophes but to work to prevent them, as well. We worked \nwith a real sense of urgency after September 11, 2001, to secure our \nNation. We must summon that same sense of urgency now to close the \nsecurity gaps that remain. I wish there was a cheap way to do that. But \nthere isn't. It takes money--more money than the administration's \nbudget offers and more money than the majority's budget resolution \nwe're debating this week offers. I urge my colleagues to support these \nmodest proposals so that we can make additional headway toward our goal \nof being better able to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover \nfrom the terrorist attacks and natural disasters that are sure to come.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins-Lieberman amendment would \nprovide $986 million to help prevent terrorist attacks and to enable us \nto respond more effectively if one does occur. It enjoys the support of \na wide range of first responder groups, representing our police and our \nfirefighters.\n  Our amendment has two components. First, it restores funding to the \nfiscal year 2006 levels for key grant programs that assist first \nresponders, as well as State and local governments. These are such \nprograms as the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, the \nMetropolitan Medical Response System, emergency management performance \ngrants, the FIRE Act, and SAFER programs.\n  As this chart prepared by the Congressional Research Service \nindicates, the aggregate difference between the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriated amount and the proposed budget request for this year is \n$395 million. Our amendment ensures that none of the programs listed on \nthis chart would be funded at any less than the level that was \nappropriated for fiscal year 2006.\n  Last year, for example, Congress appropriated $550 million for the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program, a key source of assistance to \nState and local governments and first responders. This level, I point \nout, was only half of the fiscal year 2005 enacted level. Communities \nuse these funds for first responder preparation activities such as \nemergency planning, risk assessments, mutual aid agreements, equipment, \ntraining, and exercises.\n  It is important to realize that the biggest single expenditure of \nthese funds is the purchase of interoperable communications equipment. \nTherefore, a vote for our amendment is a vote to increase funding for \ninteroperable communications equipment for first responders.\n  Under the Collins-Lieberman amendment, we would also provide an \nadditional $150 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program \nto create a better national response system that will operate more \nsmoothly at the Federal, State, and local level. Our committee's \ninvestigation into the preparedness for and response to Hurricane \nKatrina clearly demonstrated inadequate response and deficiencies in \nour ability to respond effectively to the\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\ncatastrophic events. This is not the time to reduce the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to national preparedness.\n  The budget also shortchanges first responders in other programs, such \nas the FIRE Act and the SAFER grants. We would take care of that as \nwell as the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, one of the \nprograms that focuses on preventing terrorist attacks.\n  Another important aspect of the Collins-Lieberman amendment deals \nwith port security grants. Unfortunately, the administration's budget \ndoes not dedicate a separate funding stream for port security. Instead, \nit folds port security in with all other transportation and critical \ninfrastructure, thus providing no assurance at all that any money will \nbe provided to strengthen the security of our ports. The estimates are, \nfrom the ports administrators, that we need to have $400 million for \nport security grant funding. Because of budget constraints we don't go \nthat far, but we do include dedicated funding, $300 million in port \nsecurity grant funding. We have proposed an increase to move the \nfunding level to meeting the identified needs and to help us improve \nthe security of our ports.\n  There are so many needs, but we have worked very hard to keep the \ncost of our amendment down. It is fully offset. I hope our colleagues \nwill support this proposal. It also provides funding for a number of \nother critical infrastructure needs, such as our Nation's rail and \ntransit systems.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and send a message to \nour first responders that they are a top priority. The additional \nfunding provided by the Collins-Lieberman amendment is an investment we \nsimply must make to strengthen our ability to prevent, detect, and if \nnecessary respond to attacks on our homeland.\n  I urge support for the amendment, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague from Maine \nfor her conscientious efforts, as well as her fiscally responsible \nefforts. I ask unanimous consent to add my name to her list of \ncosponsors and again tell her how much we appreciate all of the many \nissues that have landed in her lap this year and what an incredible job \nshe has done, working with Senator Lieberman to address those. I ask \nunanimous consent to add my name as a cosponsor, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3047\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3047.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Durbin, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3047.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n To provide $7.8 billion over two years to fund refundable tax credits \ntargeted to small businesses with up to 100 employees so that they may \n help purchase group health insurance for their low-wage workers, paid \n                for by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 24, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 25, increase the amount by $4,500,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 3, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 4, increase the amount by $3,300,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I cannot imagine that the rest of my \ncolleagues in this body are not hearing the same thing I hear, as I \ntravel back each week to Arkansas, from my constituents. Always in the \ntop three issues they bring up in the most passionate of ways happens \nto be how in the world are we in this Nation going to deal with the \nnumber of uninsured in this country, particularly in the small business \narena?\n  Those Americans who are working hard, those trying to provide for \ntheir families, those keeping the framework and the foundation of our \nsmall communities together, those working in small businesses, how are \nwe going to do a better job in this body in helping to provide health \ninsurance for those who are uninsured and their families?\n  I rise today with my good friend Senator Durbin to propose an \namendment to the budget resolution to provide $7.8 billion over 2 years \nto fund refundable tax credits targeted to small businesses with up to \n100 employees so they may help purchase group health insurance for \ntheir low-wage workers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Clinton, Kohl, and Cantwell \nas cosponsors of my amendment, and to take this opportunity as well to \nnote that our amendment is endorsed by the National Association of \nBusiness Owners and the Small Business Majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, my amendment would dedicate funding to \nhelp small businesses that are struggling to provide health insurance \nto their employees, and would do so in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible. My amendment is completely offset by closing corporate tax \nloopholes that have been agreed upon by the Finance Committee as well \nas by this entire body, the Senate. These are ways in which we can make \nfiscally responsible decisions in closing loopholes that exist and pay \nfor something that is absolutely vital to working families.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us doesn't specify either \nan amount to promote expanding health insurance coverage for employees \nof small businesses or a way to pay for it, which leads me to believe--\nas do other Americans out there listening to this debate--that this is \nsimply a priority for us.\n  We cannot continue to act as if this issue doesn't exist. The \nPresident has mentioned it year upon year in his State of the Union \nAddresses, and yet we are seeing increases by the millions of \nindividuals who are finding themselves uninsured. There are nearly 46 \nmillion Americans currently without health insurance, including 456,000 \nArkansans in my home State of Arkansas. Twenty percent of working-age \nadults are uninsured. These are people who are working and playing by \nthe rules to provide for their families. This number is so alarming to \nme that addressing this problem should be a national priority.\n  Those who lack health insurance don't get access to timely and \nappropriate health care. They have less access to important screenings \nand state-of-the-art technology and prescription drugs. Working \nfamilies need our help with this problem--and they need it now.\n  Senator Durbin and I have a bill to help small businesses afford \nhealth insurance, and a refundable tax credit to employers as an \nintegral part of our proposal. Our responsible tax credit is targeted \nto help those who need it the most.\n  Low-wage workers and small businesses are significantly more likely \nto be uninsured than high-wage workers, and firms with a high \nproportion of low-wage workers are much less likely to offer insurance. \nOur tax credits are targeted to the firms and employees who need the \nmost incentives to purchase health insurance coverage. Our tax credit \ngoes to the employer because small employers believe offering health \ninsurance has a positive impact on recruitment, retention, employees' \nattitude, performance, and health status.\n  The budget resolution fails to address this huge problem in our \ncountry. The budget is a blueprint, and it should clearly represent \nAmerica's working families' needs and priorities. It is supposed to \nreflect what our choices will be when it comes time to spending the tax \ndollars of this country. This amendment is about priorities.\n  We must make a priority this growing number of uninsured in our \ncountry. They are working families, playing by the rules, trying \ndesperately to contribute to their great Nation. One of\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nthe things we can do is provide the employers the incentive they need \nto provide the kind of health insurance working families can use and \nneed.\n  The underlying proposal Senator Durbin and I have offered presents \nworking families' ability to have the similar kind of health insurance \nthat I and all of the Federal employees here have access to. What \ngreater opportunity to provide greater choice at a lower cost. This is \nthe tool that can make that happen. Providing a tax incentive to small \nbusinesses to be able to purchase and assist their employees--their \nlow-wage workers--with the ability to engage in the insurance market \nand provide the ability to mitigate against their health care and their \nhealth care costs is absolutely essential, not just for the quality of \nlife of working Americans but also think of what it does for our \neconomy.\n  We have a great opportunity in this budget to set priorities that are \nimportant to the working families of this country. I urge my \ncolleagues, let us come together and do something for our small \nbusinesses and working families--and do something now.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our amendment and look forward to the \nopportunity we have to do something about the escalating costs of \nhealth care and what it means to working families in this Nation.\n  I request the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we will have no trouble getting a \nsufficient second.\n  Perhaps we could give a second to the yeas and nays asked for by the \nSenator from Arkansas at this time. There now appears to be a \nsufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Parliamentarian if he could give \nus a breakdown on the time remaining between now and 1:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes 32 seconds, the \nminority has 15 minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have calls out to two other offices of \nMembers who indicated an interest in offering amendments in this time \nperiod.\n  As we have heard from the Parliamentarian, we only have 15 minutes \nleft on our side. When we put in a quorum call, that time will be \ncharged equally. I alert those Senators whose offices have been called \nthat time is rapidly running through the hourglass. I hope very much \nthose who have been called and who have asked for time will come. Time \nis rapidly evaporating.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 2 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3106\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I come to the floor today to offer an amendment on behalf of rural \nAmerica. If there is anything that has been consistent in this \nadministration's budget, it has been that there has been more asked \nfrom rural America in terms of the burden of cuts that have happened \nand a disproportionate share of the labor-intensive ideas of how we are \ngoing to deal with incredible spending.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of rural America. I thank Senators \nSalazar, Pryor, Harkin, and Kohl for joining me in this effort.\n  I am pleased to ask unanimous consent to add Senators Durbin and \nSchumer as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, our amendment would restore \napproximately $2 billion in discretionary cuts proposed for programs \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in fiscal year 2007. \nTo pay for these investments in rural America, our amendment would \nraise the discretionary cap by $2 billion and offset these expenditures \nby closing corporate tax loopholes which have passed the Senate on \nnumerous occasions.\n  The proposed discretionary cuts for USDA impact a variety of \nconservation, rural development, nutrition, and forestry programs that \nare vitally important to our communities across this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, you and all other Members of this Senate have rural \nareas in your States and know the difficult times they are going \nthrough. They do not have the tax base. They may not have the corporate \ncitizens in those areas that help them build this economy. These \nprograms are vital to them in terms of developing the kind of economy \nthey want and can have. They are not asking to be a major metropolitan \narea. They are simply asking to be the best they can possibly be.\n  The discretionary spending would decline $208 million in fiscal year \n2007 in conservation. Rural development would see a decline of $421 \nmillion less than in fiscal year 2007, and research would see a 14.6 \npercent reduction from the fiscal year 2006 appropriations.\n  I ask all of my colleagues, whether you represent a major \nmetropolitan area or rural America, you know the fabric of this country \ndepends on all of us. Please do not ask for a disproportionate share of \nrural America, and do not devastate the incredible advances they have \nalready been able to make. Let us help them grow with the rest of \nAmerica in their great effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in the WIC Program, the nutrition \nprogram, the conservation program, and all of the others that rural \nAmerica depends on.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3136, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President I call up an amendment at the desk. It is a \nsubstitute on the energy amendment I offered earlier. I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify my previous amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3136), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a reserve fund for bold energy legislation that is \n                            deficit neutral)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.  .

Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this budget \nresolution assumes deep cuts and unprecedented fees for the Small \nBusiness Administration, the SBA. The administration's request of $624 \nmillion is insufficient to meet the needs of small businesses in this \ncountry that need access to capital, counseling, and Federal contracts. \nBy the SBA's own calculation, the request is $18 million less than what \nwas available to the Agency last year when congressional initiatives \nand disaster supplementals are excluded. If this budget is adopted, the \nAgency will have been cut more than 37 percent since 2001. In context, \nthat means it will have suffered the largest cuts of all 24 Federal \nagencies.\n  To address this shortfall, I introduced S.A. 3072 to increase SBA's \nfiscal year 2007 budget of $624 million by $151 million, for a total of \n$775 million. The amendment would have paid for this increased spending \nby closing abusive corporate tax loopholes and would, among other \nthings, have prevented the administration from increasing the cost of \ndisaster loans, from imposing a new fee on SBA's largest loan and \nventure capital programs, from eliminating the SBA's microloan \nprograms, and from weakening business assistance to women, minorities, \nveterans, Native Americans, and those trying to cut through redtape to \ncontract with the Federal Government.\n  This budget resolution comes after 5 years of drastic budget cuts \nwhich have\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\neroded SBA's core programs and left the Agency with one of the worst \nmorale problems in the Federal Government. SBA's largest lending \nprogram, the 7(a) program, is now more expensive than ever for small \nbusiness borrowers and lenders, and the administration is proposing to \nadd new ``administrative fees'' for larger 7(a) loans, 504 loans, and \nSBIC or venture capital deals. These fees are the first time the SBA \nhas attempted to pass along administrative costs to lenders and small \nbusiness borrowers, but the administration is pushing for them because \nthey will generate $7 million in savings. We are told that some 7(a) \nborrowers will pay $625 more per loan, some 504 borrowers will pay \n$1,625 per loan, and the majority of companies that get an SBIC \ninvestment will pay $45,000 more. This is in addition to the excessive \nfees these small business borrowers already pay to cover the loan \nsubsidy cost. This would set a bad precedent. To prevent the \nadministration from imposing a new fee on small business borrowers, my \namendment provided $7 million to the SBA's budget for next year to \noffset this proposal.\n  Deep budget cuts for SBA have also meant less transparency and \naccountability when it comes to the oversight of small business \ncontracting. After pressure from our Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, the SBA hired additional procurement center \nrepresentatives, PCRs--the Government officials responsible for \nmonitoring the bundling of large contracts and for helping small \nbusinesses cut through redtape to compete for Federal contracts--now \nbringing the number of PCRs nationwide up to 58. But many of these are \nnot full-time PCRs. To avoid further reports of contracting abuses, \nlarge businesses receiving small business contracts, and Federal \nagencies missing their small business goals, my amendment provided $10 \nmillion for 100 additional PCRs to ensure robust contracting oversight \nthroughout the Nation.\n  For the fifth year in a row, this budget continues on the path of \nproviding unrealistic funding by cutting critical programs, such as the \nSmall Business Development Centers or SBDCs, Women's Business Centers \nand SCORE, forcing SBA's counseling partners to spend fewer hours with \nclients because the Federal matching grant isn't keeping pace with \ninflation or demand. Despite the budget's failure to account for \ninflation costs, these programs continue to play an integral role in \nhelping entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities. These cuts, \nwhen combined with 5 years of budget cuts for the SBA as a whole, would \nleave the SBA ill-prepared to meet the demands of the growing \nentrepreneurial sector. I strongly oppose flat funding these resources \nfor small businesses and so proposed an additional $23 million in my \namendment to bring Small Business Development Centers from the outdated \n$87.1 funding level to $110 million, proposed $4.95 million to bring \nSCORE funding to $7 million, and $4.7 million to bring the Women's \nBusiness Centers to a level of $16.5 million.\n  All of this pales in comparison to the mismanagement of the response \nto recovery of the gulf coast region. The SBA's disaster loan program, \nessential to the recovery of business owners, homeowners, and renters \nafter a disaster, almost ran out of money twice in February. Instead of \ngetting their fiscal house in order like every American family must do, \nthe President now proposes to raise the cost of disaster loans and no \nlonger guarantee our most vulnerable borrowers fixed interest rates. \nAlthough they could still have up to 30 years to pay off a loan, if \nthey don't pay it off in 5 years, the interest rate will go up. Instead \nof telling us how this will help disaster victims, we are told this \nwill save the SBA an estimated $41 million. We should not be saving \nmoney on the backs of disaster victims. Instead, we should help them to \nrebuild their homes and businesses. To prevent raising disaster loan \ninterest rates, my amendment provided $41 million to the SBA's budget \nfor next year.\n  The $151 million in my amendment would have provided real money to \nour appropriators and to small business programs in desperate need of \nfunding. Unfortunately, this amendment did not garner bipartisan \nsupport. While I am disappointed with this outcome, I am pleased that \nwe were able to work out a bipartisan compromise with Senator Snowe, \nthe chair of the Small Business Committee. Our compromise, S.A. 3134, \nwould increase the SBA fiscal year 2007 budget by $130 million, and \nalthough it would not add any additional funds to the budget \nresolution, it is a bipartisan effort to address many of the issues \nthat my amendment 3072 attempted to address. There is bipartisan \nsupport for the 7(j) technical assistance program and the HUBZONE \nProgram, which Senator Bond from Missouri worked hard to put in place \nand I joined with him in cosponsoring it when he was chairman for SBDCs \nand SCORE and Women's Business Centers; for the Microloan Program and \nmicroloan technical assistance, both of which the President has tried \nto eliminate for several years now. We all support U.S. Export \nAssistance Centers and Veterans Business Development, Small Business \nInnovation Research, and Small Business Technology Transfer Program. \nWhile I would have liked to have seen higher funding levels for the \nPRIME and New Markets Venture Capital Program, I am glad that our \namendment reflects continued funding for these vital programs. We made \na strong bipartisan statement that minority lending numbers must be \nincreased, with about $1 million more toward Native-American outreach. \nAnd we agreed to reject the proposals to raise the cost of disaster \nloans and to impose a new fee on the lending and venture capital \nprograms. Overall, amendment 3134 is sending an important signal to all \nthat there is broad bipartisan support to increase funding for these \nvital small business programs.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Landrieu, Lieberman, \nLevin, Nelson of Florida, Vitter, and Coleman for joining us to \ncosponsor this amendment, the entire Senate for agreeing to the \namendment, and Senators Conrad and Gregg for their help in putting \ntogether a more realistic budget for small businesses.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we get an update on the time \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly. The minority has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Two minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the President's budget proposal includes a \nconcept to increase TRICARE--this is the DOD, Department of Defense, \nhealth care program--fees and copayments for military retirees under \nthe age of 65 and for their dependents.\n  All of us recognize there is this spiraling cost to health care. I \nunderstand that. And it affects everything we are doing in the country. \nThe Department of Defense is, needless to say, no different. It has \nthose increases. But the answer is not found in tripling the fees for \nretired officers, doubling them for senior enlisted retirees, and \ndemanding more from every military retiree under the age of 65 who uses \nthe health care system, when you look at the other costs that are \nalready going up for all of those folks.\n  Most importantly, there are a series of better ways that have been \nrecommended to bring down the cost of health care for those retirees. \nSo you do not have to go immediately to fees and copayments in order to \nsolve the problem of the increase in costs.\n  In successive budget requests, the Bush administration has asked for \nincreased fees and copayments for veterans health care, which is \nincreasingly shifting the burden of that care from some veterans on to \nothers, and it is driving some veterans out of the system altogether, \nwhich is, obviously, not fair.\n  My amendment will restore the funding for TRICARE so that military \nretirees are not saddled with these increased costs and fees. We pay \nfor it by closing a number of tax loopholes. I think by doing so, we \nkeep faith with people who have served our country for 20 years or \nmore.\n  They did not ask to change the terms of their commitment to the \nmilitary when things got tough, and I do not think we should be \nignoring and changing our commitment to them now.\n  Mr. President, I yield back such time as may remain.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are 10 minutes away from the big show, \nwhich may go on for a long time. It may be a big, long show. In any \nevent, I want to alert Members we are going to go to 10-minute votes. \nWe are going to be holding the 10-minute votes as strictly as possible. \nThe first vote will, obviously, not be 10 minutes. And we are going to \nstart voting at 1:30. We have pending so many amendments that we could \nbe here well into the evening. Cooperation is needed if people do not \nwant to be here well into tomorrow morning.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. And I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3127\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3127 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3127.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for a Comprehensive Entitlement \n                           Reform Commission)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RESERVE FUND FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ENTITLEMENT REFORM \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       If--\n       (1) the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill \n     or joint resolution, or if an amendment is offered thereto or \n     if a conference report is submitted thereon, that establishes \n     a Comprehensive Entitlement Reform Commission for the purpose \n     of conducting a comprehensive review of the Social Security, \n     Medicare, and Medicaid programs and making recommendations to \n     sustain the solvency and stability of these programs for \n     future generations; and\n       (2) that committee is within its allocation as provided \n     under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;\n     the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may make the \n     appropriate adjustments in allocations and aggregates to the \n     extent that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     for fiscal year 2007 and the period of fiscal years 2007 \n     through 2011.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nIsakson and Chambliss be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last October, I introduced legislation, S. \n1889, to create a bipartisan entitlement reform commission. Senator \nIsakson cosponsored my legislation, and Representative John Tanner \njoined me in introducing this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In January, the President called on Congress to create such a \ncommission in his State of the Union Address. The amendment I am \noffering today responds to the President's request.\n  My amendment establishes a reserve fund that would allow Congress to \npass legislation later this year forming a bipartisan entitlement \nreform commission. This bipartisan commission would review America's \nthree major entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--and make comprehensive recommendations on how to stabilize \nand keep solvent these programs for future generations.\n  The entitlement course that we are currently on is unsustainable. \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid have been vital components for \nmillions of Americans as they have found a happier retirement. However, \nover the next 75 years, these three programs represent a $42 trillion \nunfunded mandate for the American taxpayer.\n  The Social Security trust fund faces a $4 trillion unfunded \ncommitment and will pay out more money than it takes in beginning \naround 2017. The fund will be exhausted by 2041. The Medicare Part A \ntrust fund--hospital insurance--faces an almost $9 trillion unfunded \ncommitment and will be exhausted by 2020.\n  Where is the money to pay for these commitments going to come from? \nWe must deal with these challenges today while we still have time and \nconstructive options. To leave future generations burdened with paying \nfor huge\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nentitlement commitments when they will be competing in a far more \ncompetitive world than exists today would be dangerously irresponsible.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. This affects us \nall. Most significantly, it affects the most vulnerable in our society. \nCreating this commission will start us down the road to dealing with \nthis problem and will protect the next generation from facing Draconian \nchoices in their future.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment today.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I assume I have no time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The remainder of the time is \ncontrolled by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor 2 minutes so I might offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Dakota 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman again for his \ncourtesy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3148\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from Nebraska that while \non this side we agree that we have long-term challenges, very deep \nlong-term challenges, with the fiscal health of the country, we believe \nthe amendment the Senator from Nebraska has offered is too narrow in \nscope.\n  Mr. President, for that reason, I send an amendment to the desk to be \nconsidered at the same time as the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. Basically, the difference is this: We think everything \nought to be on the table. We think everything ought to be on the table, \nnot just entitlements but domestic discretionary spending, the revenue \nside of the equation, that all ought to be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator briefly allow the clerk to \nformally report.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3148.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for addressing the \nlong term fiscal challenges facing our nation, by creating a bipartisan \n    commission or process to consider all parts of the budget, with \n                everything on the table for discussion)\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR ADDRESSING THE LONG-TERM FISCAL \n                   CHALLENGES FACING THE NATION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \n     levels and limits in this resolution for a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment thereto or a conference report \n     thereon, that would provide for the bipartisan leadership of \n     the House and Senate to work with the President to establish \n     a commission (or other mutually agreeable process) to address \n     the long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation, provided \n     that such commission or process--\n       (1) Addresses these long-term fiscal challenges in a manner \n     in which both political parties are represented equally, and\n       (2) Considers all parts of the budget by putting everything \n     on the table for discussion\n\n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     for fiscal year 2007 and the period of fiscal years 2007 to \n     2011.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed in \nthe Record from AARP in opposition to the Hagel amendment, indicating \nthey agree that the Hagel amendment is too narrow in scope, and that we \nought to have a broader look at all of the problems facing our fiscal \nfuture, not just focus on one part.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                   March 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The Senate will shortly consider an \n     amendment regarding a narrowly focused commission to address \n     the long-term challenges facing Social Security, Medicare and \n     Medicaid. AARP agrees that we must confront the challenges \n     and opportunities posed by the aging of the baby boom \n     generation, but a commission focused primarily on the fiscal \n     impact of our critical health and income security programs \n     overlooks the important role they play in the lives of \n     millions of Americans of all ages.\n       Commissions have been most effective in laying out policy \n     options when they have been balanced, established without \n     preconditions, given a mandate to address the underlying \n     causes of problems, and provided all sides with an \n     opportunity to be heard. A commission to address our long-\n     term fiscal challenges has merit provided it examines the \n     full scope of our budgetary policy, including the revenue \n     needed to ensure the health and income security of all \n     Americans.\n       Most important to AARP and its 36 million members, the \n     commission must recognize that ultimately the solutions must \n     be about people. A commission's recommendations should put us \n     on a path to secure the future ability of Social Security, \n     Medicare and Medicaid to continue to provide a foundation for \n     the health and retirement security of all generations as well \n     as guide the way to sound long-term budget policies.\n       The current amendment offered by Senator Hagel does not \n     meet all of these criteria. Therefore, AARP cannot support \n     this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David P. Sloane,\n\n                                         Senior Managing Director,\n                                  Government Relations & Advocacy.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just for the edification of our colleagues \nbecause it is going to get a little confusing around here with all the \namendments we have, we are going to begin the amendment voting process \nwith the amendment of Senator Lieberman on homeland security. That will \nbe followed by Senator Clinton's amendment, followed by Senator \nSpecter's amendment on education, followed by the amendment of Senator \nReed of Rhode Island on LIHEAP, followed by Senator Lautenberg's \namendment on TSA fees, followed by Senator Sarbanes's amendment on \nfunction 300, followed by Senator Dorgan's amendment on tribal issues, \nfollowed by Senator Cornyn's amendment on reconciliation, followed by \nSenator Stabenow's amendment on veterans, followed by Senator Akaka's \namendment on title I, followed by Senator Collins's amendment on \nhomeland security, followed by Senator Lincoln's amendment on small \nbusiness--oh, we are stopping at Senator Collins's amendment, and then \nwe are going to order the next group of amendments.\n  So that is the basic concept.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might we put in a quorum call? We have a little bit of a \nglitch.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to amend the prior list of how we \nwill proceed with votes. We will begin with Senator Reed and his LIHEAP \namendment. We will follow that with Senator Clinton on health care, \nfollowed by Senator Specter, and then we will go to Senator Lieberman. \nThen the list will continue as outlined in the prior discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that for the amendments which are \npending, there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that no \nsecond degrees be in order, with the exception of the Clinton amendment \nwhich might be subject to a second degree or further side by side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3074\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would raise the allocation \nfor LIHEAP to the statutorily authorized $5.1 billion. It recognizes \nthe fact that energy prices have been going up and that we are likely \nnot to see a mild winter again next year; that we can expect right now \nto need more resources. Just a few weeks ago, we were on the floor of \nthe Senate trying to raise the emergency funding for LIHEAP because of \nthe intersection of cold temperatures and the increased cost of fuel. \nIf we do pass this amendment, it will increase the allocation of \nresources not just to the cold States but to the warm States. This will \nprovide significant resources for those States such as Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Nevada that need the assistance in the summertime for \nair-conditioning.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass my amendment. We know it is going to be \na problem next year. The funds in the President's budget are \ninsufficient. We have to stand up and make sure we take care of the \nvulnerable people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we made a very strong commitment to LIHEAP \na few weeks ago. We passed an additional billion dollars on the Senate \nfloor. In other vehicles, we have passed even more money for LIHEAP. \nThis amendment does not fund LIHEAP because nothing in this bill is \nbinding on the Appropriations Committee. What it does do, however, is \nraise the cap by $1 billion and raise taxes by $1 billion. It will be \nup to the Appropriations Committee to decide whether they are going to \nfund LIHEAP at this year's level or next year's level or last year's \nlevel. The history is pretty strong. LIHEAP gets well funded around \nhere and you can pretty much presume that the Appropriations Committee \nwill do that. But they will do it within the cap, and that is the way \nit should be. Therefore, I hope Members will reject this amendment \nbecause it is basically a tax-and-spend amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be deemed to have been \nordered on all amendments that are proceeding here.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that seconds be deemed to have \nbeen approved for all the yeas and nays for the balance of the \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3074.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 57 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3074) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will now go to the Specter amendment. \nSenator Specter and those in opposition had not expected this amendment \nto come up so quickly.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if we could ask our colleagues, we know \nthe list that has been put in, and if colleagues who have amendments \nabout to be considered will be closely attentive to what is happening \nhere so we don't have dead time, that would be very helpful to the \nprocess.\n  After this amendment, next is the Lieberman amendment. So we alert \nSenator Lieberman and his staff. Then we will have the Lautenberg \namendment. If those Senators can be ready to go.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I see the cosponsor of the amendment is on \nthe Senate floor. Would he like to take the time allocated to him?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I have submitted this \namendment, joined by 27 cosponsors, which would add $7 billion to the \nfund for education, health, and workers' safety. This account has been \ndecimated since fiscal year 2005 with a loss of some $15.7 billion when \nwe consider the cuts and the failure to have an inflationary increase.\n  Health and education are the two major capital assets of the country. \nWe have gone beyond the fat, beyond the muscle, beyond the bone, and \ninto the marrow. This funding will help us a little, not really enough. \nWe ask our colleagues to support it.\n  I yield to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his great \nleadership in the areas of health and education, especially medical \nresearch. This amendment only takes us back to 2005. That is all it \ndoes. It sets the level back to where it was in 2005. It is a very \nmodest proposal.\n  I hope we can have a strong vote on this amendment to get the money \nwe need for Pell grants, for NIH, for the Centers for Disease Control--\nall the programs that are so necessary to our country.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to \nprovide an additional $7 billion for critical health, education, \ntraining and low-income programs. This budget has all the wrong \npriorities. Instead of easing the burden on middle-class families and \nhelping to curb the costs of education and health care, President Bush \nand the Republicans want to cut funding for these programs by more than \n$4 billion and spend billions on tax breaks for multimillionaires. This \namendment would restore cuts to some of the most vital programs in our \ncountry programs like No Child Left Behind, Pell\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\ngrants, NIH, and nursing education. It is my job as a U.S. Senator to \nlook out for the day-to-day needs of Marylanders and the long-term \nneeds of the Nation, and this amendment takes us closer to both of \nthese goals.\n  Our middle-class families are stressed and stretched. Families in my \nState of Maryland are worried--they are worried about their jobs, they \nare terrified of losing their health care, and they don't know how they \nare going to afford to send their kids to college. Families are looking \nfor help and President Bush doesn't offer them much hope. His budget \nwould freeze the maximum Pell grant at $4,050 for the fourth year in a \nrow. Twenty years ago, Pell grants covered 80 percent of average costs \nat 4-year public colleges. Now, they cover only 40 percent. If Pell \ngrants remain the same for another year, many students will be forced \nto take out more student loans and some won't be able to go to school \nat all. Our students are graduating with so much debt, it is like their \nfirst mortgage. The average undergraduate student debt from college \nloans is almost $19,000. College is part of the American dream; it \nshouldn't be part of the American financial nightmare.\n  We need to do more to help middle-class families afford college. We \nneed to immediately increase the maximum Pell Grant to $4,500 and \ndouble it over the next 6 years. We need to make sure student loans are \naffordable. And we need a bigger tuition tax credit for the families \nstuck in the middle who aren't eligible for Pell grants but still can't \nafford college.\n  America needs a public school system that works. I support the goals \nof No Child Left Behind: a good teacher in every classroom, making sure \nevery student is proficient in math and reading, and fighting against \nthe soft bigotry of low expectations. But to do that, schools need help \nfrom the Federal Government. Schools need resources for smaller \nclasses, teacher training, and meeting special needs--like bilingual \neducation or special education. Yet the Republican budget doesn't give \nschools the funds to do the job. It falls $15.4 billion short of what \nwe promised for No Child Left Behind. It shortchanges schools and \nshortchanges our children. That is wrong.\n  I have heard from teachers and parents from all over Maryland. They \nare worried about how they are going to meet all the requirements in No \nChild Left Behind. They all tell me that they are worried about whether \ntheir school will make the grade--especially in this time of budget \ncuts and budget crunches.\n  No Child Left Behind placed the burden on schools to improve. I know \nthe teachers and school officials are doing their best to turn \nstruggling schools around. But they can't do it alone. They need \nencouragement, support, and resources. That is why this amendment is so \nimportant. We must make sure no child is left out of the budget.\n  NIH is a jewel in the Nation's crown. As the Senator from Maryland, I \nam proud that NIH is in my home State. The investments we are making in \nbiomedical research today have the potential to pay priceless returns \nfor people across this country. That is why I strongly supported the \nbipartisan doubling of the NIH budget over 5 years to $27 billion. This \ngoal was met in 2003, but our work is not done. We must continue to \ninvest in biomedical research and support continued increases of the \nNIH budget, so that the research that scientists are doing will \ncontinue to help people live longer, healthier lives.\n  The Republican budget level funds the NIH at $28.3 billion, which is \n$62 million less than in fiscal year 2005. As a result, the total \nnumber of NIH-funded research project grants would drop by 642, or 2 \npercent, below last year's level. The budget would cut funding for 18 \nof the 19 institutes. Funding for the National Cancer Institute would \ndrop by $40 million, and funding for the National Heart, Lung, and \nBlood Institute would drop by $21 million. Over the years, the American \npeople have invested in NIH. It is paying off in improved prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatments for diseases. We must continue to invest in \nbiomedical research.\n  Today, our Nation faces a shortage of nearly 500,000 nurses. As our \npopulation continues to grow and age, the need for nurses will continue \nto increase. The Department of Labor reported in the Winter 2005-2006 \nOccupational Outlook Quarterly that America's demand for new and \nreplacement RN's will grow by 29 percent between 2004 and 2014, to 1.2 \nmillion, in order to accommodate growing patient needs and to replace \nretiring nurses. Yet the Republican budget funds nursing workforce \ndevelopment programs at last year's level of $150 million. Congress \nmust do more to address this crisis.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this amendment and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it. These additional funds are crucial for so many important \nprograms that change lives and save lives. I will keep fighting so that \nthese programs get the funds they need and to ensure that Americans \nhave health care at any age, public schools we can depend on, and \naccess to higher education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.

Mr. President, I spoke to the distinguished majority leader \njust a few minutes ago, and we have lots and lots of amendments. We \nhope we would stick to 10 minutes. On my side, if Senators aren't here \nin 10 minutes, I hope it would be a fair, equal punishment that if \npeople aren't here in 10 minutes, the vote should be closed. Everyone \nknows what the rules are. People have things to do. It is not fair to \nthe Senators. People come straggling in after 16, 17, 18 minutes, and \nit is not fair. So I would hope that we have 10-minute votes. We have \nlots of votes to do.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I also wish to agree with the Democratic \nleader and express a request. We are going to have a long day here. We \nhave a lot of votes lined up, and we have a lot of votes to follow that \nas well. So let's follow the managers' lead, and we are going to leave \nit to their discretion. Right now, we have instructed them to cut off \nthose votes. With that, no complaints. People have to stick close to \nthe floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3034\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Under the previous order, the \nnext amendment is the Lieberman amendment No. 3034 on which the yeas \nand nays have been ordered and for which there will be 2 minutes evenly \ndivided for debate.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could I just alert colleagues, we have now \ndone a vote count. We have over 60 votes pending. We can only do three \nvotes an hour. That would take us 20 hours. I urge colleagues--there \nare other vehicles coming. We have had a lot of votes already on this \nbudget resolution. We have a lot more votes scheduled. I would urge \ncolleagues to come to us and remove some of their amendments from \nconsideration.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On amendment No. 3034, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDurbin be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have said that the budget before us, \nwhen it comes to our homeland security, is shortsighted and short-\nfunded. But I wish to go beyond that, so working with my staff we \nreached out to experts in the various areas that constitute our \nhomeland security in a time of terrorism. This is the result: a \ncomprehensive proposal that would add $8 billion to our homeland \nsecurity. It is, in fact, what is necessary to protect the American \npeople at a time of terrorism and from natural disasters like Katrina. \nThe money will go to first responders, port security, rail transit \nsecurity, FEMA, bioterrorism, chemical security, and aviation security, \nand the Coast Guard.\n  For real homeland security, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have increased the funding for national \ndefense by $30 billion in this bill in the core budget. We have \nincreased it by $40 billion in the ancillary budget which funds \nalongside the core budget, putting it up to $90 billion. We have \nincreased border and port security funding by $4 billion, and we \nalready have in the pipeline something like $5 billion of unspent money \nfor first responders and something like $3.5 billion for \ninteroperability. This amendment is not needed, and it is a tax-and-\nspend amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 3034.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Virginia (Mr. Allen), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nChafee), and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3137\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis the Lautenberg amendment on which the yeas and nays have been \nordered. There will be 2 minutes evenly divided. The Senator from New \nJersey is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my amendment is now being considered. \nThe vote is simple: If you vote yes, you support my amendment to strike \nthis unfair tax increase from the budget. However, if you vote no on \nthis, you are saying to the average family that they should pay more \ntaxes. So the vote is yes. We want to strike this unfair tax increase \nfrom the budget.\n  The average family of four traveling round-trip on nonstop flights \nwill pay $40 in security taxes under the President's budget proposal. \nThe traveling public is already overtaxed. They pay nearly 20 percent \nin total Federal taxes on every airline ticket.\n  To make matters worse, this tax increase will hit families the \nhardest--families and loved ones traveling to be together, whether \nduring holidays or emergencies.\n  The proper vote for the families of America is a yes vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment and eliminate the Bush airline \npassenger tax increase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who seeks \ntime in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. We are willing to accept this amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent the yeas and nays be vitiated and the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays are \nvitiated and the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3137) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3103\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis No. 3103, the Sarbanes amendment, on which the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered and on which there will be 2 minutes evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment raises the function 300 \nback to baseline. I have a letter here. I ask unanimous consent to have \nit printed in the Record. It is from a number of the leading \nenvironmental organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 16, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our millions of members and \n     supporters, we write to urge you to vote for the amendment to \n     the budget resolution proposed by Senator Sarbanes. It will \n     provide $31.1 billion for environmental protection and \n     restoration in function 300 of the Fiscal Year 2007 budget. \n     This amendment will restore funding in function 300 to the \n     baseline level taken from Fiscal Year 2006 and stop the \n     proposed back slide in environmental protection. The \n     environment is not only important for public health, but it \n     is also a critical asset to the nation providing \n     recreational, cultural, economic, and ecological capital to \n     our society.\n       The cuts proposed in the Senate budget resolution would \n     undermine the progress that has been made on protecting our \n     natural resources. Funding for drinking water and clean water \n     infrastructure has been cut to dangerous levels; clean up of \n     toxic sites around the country will continue to slow down; \n     species and land preservation for future generations will \n     struggle forward; the condition of our national parks would \n     continue to deteriorate; our ocean resources would linger on \n     the brink of collapse; and farmers and ranchers seeking \n     assistance to improve environmental quality will be turned \n     away.\n       Unfortunately, the federal government in the past several \n     years has not provided the support that these resources need \n     to protect local communities and the natural ecosystems. In \n     addition, past budget resolutions have proposed Arctic \n     drilling--an old, tired idea that would further devastate the \n     environment--as a way to pay for other important programs. \n     Though on paper there have been increases in funding for the \n     environment, inflation has outstripped those increases \n     leading to cut backs in critical environmental programs. \n     Adjusted for inflation the cuts have amounted to almost $2 \n     billion in the past two years. We ask that you stop this \n     trend and reinvigorate the federal government's role as a \n     leader in investing in our country by providing at least \n     $31.1 billion for environmental protection and restoration in \n     the Fiscal Year 2007 budget.\n           Sincerely,\n         Cindy Shogan, Executive Director, Alaska Wilderness \n           League; S.

I will quote one paragraph:\n\n       The cuts proposed in the Senate budget resolution would \n     undermine the progress that has been made on protecting our \n     natural resources. Funding for drinking water and clean water \n     infrastructure has been cut to dangerous levels; clean up of \n     toxic sites around the country will continue to slow down; \n     species and land preservation for future generations will \n     struggle forward; the condition of our national parks would \n     continue to deteriorate; our ocean resources would linger on \n     the brink of collapse; and farmers and ranchers seeking \n     assistance to improve environmental quality will be turned \n     away.\n\n  Don't let these things happen. Support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say to my friend Senator Sarbanes, \nthere is no stronger supporter of our State revolving funds than I am, \nas chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. But I wish \nto say this is a $2.9 billion tax increase. There are ways of doing it \nby eliminating some unnecessary programs.\n  Regarding the portion also affecting the Corps of Engineers, I \nunderstand they are underfunded at this time and we are working right \nnow in our committee to see what we can do to come up with some money \nby striking some of the less important, less necessary programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Sarbanes amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nUnder the previous order, this will be again a 10-minute vote.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

We want you \nto make votes but at the same time we have to stay on schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  This is an amendment which I offered last year. It adds $1 billion to \nthe account dealing with American Indians.\n  All of us in this Chamber know there are neighbors among us in this \ncountry who live in Third World communities. We have a bona fide \nFederal crisis in health care, education, and housing on Indian \nreservations. We have a trust responsibility for the health care of \nAmerican Indians.\n  Did you know we also have a responsibility for Federal prisoners' \nhealth care? We spend twice as much per person for the health care of \nFederal prisoners as we do to meet our trust responsibility for the \nhealth care of American Indians.\n  We all know we underfund these accounts. This adds $1 billion to a \nmultitude of Indian accounts dealing with health care, housing, and \neducation. It is funded by closing some tax loopholes.\n  I hope this Senate will decide this is the right set of priorities.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment doesn't guarantee that any \nmoney goes to the tribal authorities. All it does is raise the cap by \n$1 billion--increases taxes by $1 billion. It is entirely up to the \nAppropriations Committee how they spend money. We have no control over \nthat. The practical effect of this amendment is simply tax and spend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto voting on the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment directs the Senate Committee \non Finance to find $10 billion in additional savings out of the \nMedicare Program and builds on the work done in the Deficit Reduction \nAct where we\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nreduced the rate of growth for mandatory spending by nearly $100 \nbillion over the next decade.\n  As all Members know, there is increasing pressure on discretionary \nspending on important priorities because of the growth of Medicare, \nSocial Security, and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid alone grew by 22 \npercent over the last 5 years. This will allow the Committee on Finance \nto take the stabilization fund, for example, that is used to supplement \npayments to preferred provider organizations which participate in the \nMedicare Program, which is available to be recouped to help pay down \nsome of the debt in the amount of $10 billion, as well as other sources \nof revenue that they can gain out of the Medicare Program.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the time to the ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, colleagues, this is deja vu all over \nagain. This is the reconciliation cut bill of $11 billion which barely \npassed the House all over again. It is added on, on top of that again. \nThat was a net $11 billion cut for Medicare and Medicaid in the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Finance, and this is $11 billion yet \non top of that. That will come out of you know whose hides. You know \nhow unpopular that will be back home.\n  This is not the way to cut entitlement spending or put a limit on it. \nThe better way is an all-encompassing way when everyone is in it \ntogether, not directed to the Committee on Finance jurisdiction which \nwill cut more out of Medicaid, cut more spending out of Medicare.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues, just remember, this is deja vu all \nover again. It is a repeat of what happened last year. That was \nextremely unpopular.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the approval of Senator Landrieu, I \nask unanimous consent that her amendment No. 3112 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the edification of our colleagues, when \nwe complete the Collins amendment, the next five amendments after \nthat--we have pending the Stabenow, Akaka, and Collins amendments--and \nthe next five amendments after that will be the Lincoln amendment No. \n3047; Grassley, an unnumbered amendment; Inhofe, No. 3093, I believe; \nLincoln, No. 3106; Kerry, No. 3143.\n  We are now on to Senator Stabenow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, my amendment is about guaranteeing that \nevery veteran in America has the health care they were promised and \nthey deserve. Over the last 2 years, we have seen a 500-percent \nincrease in the number of veterans seeking care from the VA who served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan alone. But this budget falls over 35,000 \nveterans short of the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans whom the \nVA currently treats. And remarkably, the President's budget projects \nfewer vets will seek mental health care, which is absolutely incorrect. \nIf you believe, as I do, the men and women who have fought for our \ncountry should not have to fight every day, every year, for the health \ncare they need, I urge you to vote yes on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief, but it is important I have \nthe attention of my colleagues.\n  Yesterday, with the Burns amendment, we increased veterans funding \nover last year by 14 percent, so we have already increased veterans \nspending by 14 percent. The Senator from Michigan wishes now to \nincrease it by 36 percent. That is 104 billion new dollars over a 5-\nyear period. And it is taxed for. At least she has the courtesy of \noffering something that is paid for.\n  But even the Veterans Administration, with the Burns amendment, by \ntheir best guesstimation--and I use the word ``guesstimation''--would \nsuggest that veterans' care next year will grow by less than 2 percent. \nThere is absolutely no justification for increasing veterans health \ncare budgets by a grand total of 36 percent in 1 year.\n  This Senate has been progressively generous to America's veterans, as \nwe should be. It is now one of the most rapidly growing health care \nbudgets in our country, with the Burns amendment, not the Stabenow \namendment. Please vote no on the Stabenow amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

There will now be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote on the Akaka amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield time to the Senator.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Boxer \nand Johnson be added as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this amendment restores $3 billion to title \nI in No Child Left Behind educational programs. The amendment was \noffered because this budget resolution underfunds title I by more than \n$12 billion. You should know that a $3 billion increase would bring \ntitle I up to what the President requested since fiscal year 2004. \nWithout this increase, 29 States could lose title I funding, and \nanother 7 States would be level funded.\n  Vote aye on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment increases funding by $3 \nbillion and will be offset by closing tax loopholes, which means \nraising taxes, which would require a separate effort, anyway. The \nresolution we have before us already provides $12.7 billion in 2007 for \ngrants to local education agencies, the largest component of No Child \nLeft Behind. That represents a 45-percent increase from 2001.\n  The Federal investment in education will have grown by $12.2 billion, \nor 29 percent, since fiscal year 2001. In addition, the resolution \nprovides an additional $1.5 billion for funding for function 500, which \nincludes No Child Left Behind, and those funds can be used for that. \nEducation is and should be one of our highest priorities, but this \namendment is paid for by increasing taxes and busts the discretionary \nspending cap. I ask that you vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the Inhofe \namendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3093.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . TO CONTROL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING\n\n       ``Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all non-\n     defense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not \n     exceed the previous fiscal year's levels, for purposes of the \n     congressional budget process (Section 302 et al of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974), without a 2/3 vote of \n     Members duly chosen and sworn.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time is divided on this \namendment? I didn't get that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute for each side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is kind of a litmus test amendment. \nWe have had it up a couple times before. We do intend to pick up votes \neach time. It is an amendment to get into some of the big spending we \ndo around here. With the exception of trust votes and national defense, \nit says that any vote on appropriations that exceeds the previous year \nhas to have a two-thirds majority.\n  This amendment is endorsed by a number of groups, including the \nAmerican Conservative Union, Christian Coalition, and other groups. It \nwill be a scored vote. It is a very significant vote. I think it is \nreally the only meaningful vote to do something about curbing spending \nthat we will have the entire day.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is truly a sweeping amendment. I hope \ncolleagues are listening. This amendment seeks to lock in the current \nlevel of discretionary spending, not just for this year but \npermanently. I hope colleagues are listening. This seeks to lock in the \ncurrent level of spending for homeland security, for veterans health, \nfor NIH, not just for 1 year but permanently because it would take 67 \nvotes to increase it.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment. This is an amendment \nwhich goes against every democratic impulse of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the five \namendments we have put in order, the yeas and nays be deemed to have \nbeen granted, along with the seconds of those yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that being in order? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3093. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), the Senator from Mississippi \n(Mr. Lott), and the Senator from Arkansas (Ms. Murkowski).\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are also prepared to withdraw Lincoln amendment No. 3047. \nWe have managed to work out an understanding on all of these matters, \nso I ask unanimous consent to have those amendments withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is also our understanding that Senator \nGrassley would not offer his amendment that was the matching amendment \nto the Lincoln amendment that has now been withdrawn.\n  Mr. GREGG. Under the previous agreement, Mr. President, we are now \ngoing to turn to the Lincoln amendment No. 3106, followed by the Kerry \namendment No. 4103, followed by the DeMint amendment No. 3087.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3106\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in this administration's budget, time \nand time again rural America has been asked to give disproportionately, \nwhether it is to deficit reduction, the war in Iraq, or anything else. \nQuite frankly, I think it is important for us to look seriously at the \npriorities of this budget but, more importantly, to look at rural \nAmerica and what it means to the fabric of this country.\n  There are cuts in this budget to supplemental nutrition programs for \nwomen, infants, and children. USDA's rural housing program is cut by \n$259 million, resource conservation and development council, world \nbusiness enterprise grant, telemedicine, State and private forestry \nprograms, cooperative agriculture and food safety research units--all \nof these issues are critical to rural America. They don't have the \ncorporate tax base or corporate citizenry out there that is going to \nsupport them.\n  If we want the way of life in this country to be maintained with both \nthe fabric of this country being built by our urban areas and our rural \nareas, it is essential that we support the people and the working \nfamilies in those areas.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at conservation, WIC, all of these \nprograms and how important they are in your State.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I regrettably rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. The Senator from Arkansas and I normally agree on every \nissue involving agriculture. Philosophically, I am with her. But the \nproblem is it raises the cap a little over $2 billion. It is simply not \npaid for. The things she is seeking to add money for such as research, \nnutrition, various rural development programs, all are great programs, \nbut the time to handle that is in the appropriations process, not in \nthe budget process. This means we would either have to raise taxes or \nincrease the deficit, and now is not the time to have that debate. I \nthink it should be in the appropriations process. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, the Bush budget triples the fees for \nofficers who are retired under the age of 65 who put in their 20 years \nof service, and doubles the fees and copays for senior enlisted folks, \nagain, after their 20 years of service to the country.\n  There are several other ways to cover the costs of increased health \ncare under TRICARE. We could stimulate the use of lower cost mail-order \npharmacies. We could negotiate with drug manufacturers who secure \ndiscounts under TRICARE, which we don't do. You don't have to take it \nout of the hide of the retirees themselves.\n  We pay for this. It is paid for by closing a number of tax loopholes \nand it is fully paid for so we do not have to raise copays on retirees \nwho put in 20 years of service in uniform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor highlighting an issue that is important to the Armed Services \nCommittee, the authorizing committee. A lot of work is already going on \nto deal with this problem. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Peter \nPace, said rising health care costs are the No. 1 issue when he spoke \nto our committee.\n  This amendment would cost $10.4 billion over 5 years and result in an \nincrease in taxes by that amount. The authorizing committee does need \nto focus on it and is focusing on this issue.\n  I ask the amendment be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution, or an amendment is offered thereto, or a \n     conference report is submitted thereon, that provides changes \n     to the Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n     Benefits Program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), by--\n       (1) requiring that the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust \n     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are used \n     to finance expenditures to provide retirement and disability \n     income of future beneficiaries of such program;\n       (2) ensuring that there is no change to current law \n     scheduled benefits for individuals born before January 1, \n     1950;\n       (3) providing the option to voluntarily obtain legally \n     binding ownership of at least some portion of each \n     participant's benefits; and\n       (4) ensuring that the funds made available to finance such \n     legislation do not exceed the amounts of the Chief Actuary of \n     the Social Security Administration's intermediate actuarial \n     estimates of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as published in \n     the most recent report of the Board of Trustees of such Trust \n     Funds,\n     the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \n     make the appropriate adjustments in allocations and \n     aggregates to the extent that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for fiscal year 2007 and for the period \n     of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk adds \na reserve fund to the budget resolution for Social Security that would \nallow Congress to begin saving Social Security surpluses for future \nSocial Security recipients.\n  If the Finance Committee does not report back, then nothing happens. \nThe amendment does nothing to change Social Security--no privatization, \nno stock market investment, and it does not add to the deficit.\n  The amendment only creates a budget mechanism to allow Congress to \nconsider ways to begin saving the Social Security surplus.\n  I suspect most Members of this body, Republican and Democrat, are on \nrecord on the Senate floor or in a campaign saying that it is wrong to \nspend the Social Security surplus on other Government programs.\n  While we don't yet agree on how to fix Social Security, every Member \nand I believe every American knows that it is wrong to continue to \nspend Social Security taxes on other Government programs.\n  This amendment would open the door to consider ways to stop spending \nSocial Security money.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the time on this side to the \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President my colleagues are not being fooled. This is \nprivatization of Social Security. Turn to page 29, paragraph 3. It so \nprovides.\n  We have already gone down the road on privatization of Social \nSecurity.\n  The so-called surplus that the Senator referred to is just to \nprivatize Social Security.\n  The American public said no to privatizing Social Security. The \nPresident has realized that it is a bad idea. The Congress should \nrealize it. It is a bad idea. The AARP sure knows it is a bad idea. I \nhave a letter from the AARP. Let me read from it. They say:\n\n       AARP strongly opposes this attempt to resurrect a proposal \n     that the American public has soundly rejected.\n\n  This is privatization of Social Security, pure and simple. The Senate \nshould reject it as the American people have rejected it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          AARP\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, Capitol Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Senate will vote on an amendment to \n     S. Con. Res. 83 offered by Senator DeMint to use annual \n     Social Security surpluses to create private accounts. AARP \n     strongly opposes this attempt to resurrect a proposal that \n     the American public has soundly rejected.\n       AARP believes this proposal has serious consequences for \n     our nation's overall fiscal health and Social Security's \n     long-term outlook. Ostensibly designed to ``stop the raid on \n     the surplus'', the proposal would still result in the \n     Treasury Department receiving the money to spend on its \n     needs, but the federal deficit and debt would increase by \n     over $700 billion over the next ten years. Our nation cannot \n     afford this unnecessary increase in its already large federal \n     debt, and we should not ask future generations to pay for the \n     added cost.\n       Social Security faces a long-term financial shortfall that \n     we should address in a timely manner, but private accounts do \n     nothing to address long-term solvency. AARP believes it is \n     time to put aside polarizing ideas that do not work and get \n     serious about securing Social Security so future generations \n     can count on these important benefits.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David P. Sloane,\n        Senior Managing Director, Government Relations & Advocacy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I understand the Senator from Nebraska will offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3116 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, many of our colleagues would \nbe surprised to learn, as I was, that some agencies are skimming off \nthe top a portion of some of the congressional appropriations and \nkeeping money in that agency without authorization.\n  This amendment is simple. It says if it has been determined that a \nconstituency warrants a direct appropriation,\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\none that has gone through the scrutinizing process and is supported by \nthe House, Senate, and signed into law, that constituency should \nreceive the full amount. Bureaucrats at the agencies, who are not the \nfourth branch of Government, should not be unilaterally determining \nthat some sort of surcharge should be charged against these projects. \nIt amounts to a tax on our constituents, and it usurps the authority of \nCongress by circumventing the legislative process and giving nameless, \nfaceless bureaucrats the authority to alter legislation after it has \nbeen signed into law.\n  We have every right to expect that what we appropriate will be 100 \npercent provided when we determine that is the way it is, unless we \ndetermine otherwise. And in the situation where our constituents \ndetermine that the full amount of the earmark is not needed and turns \nback some of the funding to the government--this amendment says that \ninstead of going to bureaucrats in the agencies to spend as they wish--\nit should instead go towards deficit reduction.\n\n  I am withdrawing my amendment at this time for the sake of time. But \nwe will all see this amendment again because I will bring it back.\n  Mr. GREGG. We turn to the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3097\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment numbered 3097 and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent Senators Menendez and Clinton be \nadded as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment is a unique concept. It \nsays the Senate will fulfill a 29-year-old commitment to fund 40 \npercent of the costs of special education. I appreciate the amendment \nof the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, which was adopted by the \nSenate to bring us to 20 percent, which is half of that goal. That is \nan improvement.\n  But if we were to say the Defense Department was half funded, or \nnational security or homeland security were half funded, we would find \na reason to immediately increase that funding. So I respectfully submit \nthat closing tax loopholes for corporations that are not paying taxes \nnow and providing that money for special education for our students \nacross this country is a worthy goal.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. I will accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield back time in opposition and ask \nthat we proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3097) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the yeas \nand nays were ordered on that amendment they would be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were not ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Good.\n  Mr. President, we will now turn to the Boxer amendment, No. 3105; \nfollowed by the Bingaman amendment, No. 3121; followed by the Nelson \namendment, No. 3001; followed by the Feinstein amendment, No. 3067; \nfollowed by the Stabenow amendment, No. 3118; followed by the Santorum \namendment, No. 3052; followed by the Domenici amendment, No. 3128. And \nwe reserve the right to offer an amendment after the Nelson amendment \nbut before the Feinstein amendment relative to the same topic as the \nNelson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3105\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3105 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3105.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the 21st Century Community Learning \n   Center program; paid for by rolling back tax cuts for those with \n                        incomes over $1 million)\n\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, increase the amount by $435,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $435,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $ 435,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $435,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 8, increase the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 12, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 1, increase the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 53, line 2, increase the amount by $15,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call this amendment the ``Gucci \nafterschool amendment'' because we are asking millionaires to give up \none Gucci jacket or $2,000 out of their $114,000 tax cut they are going \nto get in 2007 so we can offer 716,000 additional children an \nafterschool program.\n  This amendment begins to fulfill the promise this President and this \nCongress made to our children. It will mean a big difference in every \nSenator's children's lives. In other words, I am looking at Senators \nall across this country. Every one of their States will see an increase \nof eligible children: in Alaska, 3,000 more children; in Florida, \n33,000 more; in Indiana, 9,000 more; in Maine, 3,000 more--and it goes \non--in New Hampshire, 3,000 more; in Ohio, 20,000 more; in \nPennsylvania, 27,000 more; in Texas, 68,000 more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I think the people earning $1 million can give up a \nGucci jacket to send more children to afterschool. I urge an ``aye'' \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, we have already approved an extra $7 \nbillion for these accounts here this\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\nevening. In addition, in the budget we brought forward, we added $1.5 \nbillion for these accounts.\n  This amendment is very much in the tradition of tax and spend. As the \nSenator from California openly admits, she wants to raise taxes \nsignificantly to pay for this new spending. But we have already \ncommitted significant dollars into these accounts, and I do not think \nit is necessary. So I hope we vote this amendment down.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3105) was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is one Senator Smith and \nI are offering to delete section 406 from the budget resolution. \nSection 406 does for direct spending legislation exactly what the \nSenate determined not to do with discretionary spending about an hour \nand a half ago on the Inhofe amendment. It says that for any bill that \ncontains direct spending, a 60-vote point of order can be raised \nagainst it. That includes the Defense bill, the farm bill, a tremendous \nnumber of bills that we try to pass through the Senate every year. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment and delete that section \nfrom the budget resolution.\n  I yield the rest of my time to Senator Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, with reluctance I rise in opposition to \nthis particular provision, but my reluctance vanishes when I consider \nthe programs this would automatically affect--not just Social Security, \nMedicaid, and Medicare but the farm program, county payments, Indian \nwater rights, all the things that are dealt with under entitlements. I \nthink we need to deal with those eventually as Republicans and \nDemocrats and as Americans. We should not do it on the basis of this \nparticular formula.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from New Mexico offered the \namendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do offer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 3121.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To strike the direct spending limitation)\n\n       Strike section 406.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the characterization of this amendment has \nbeen totally inaccurate. In fact, I haven't heard as inaccurate a \ncharacterization of an amendment today, and we have heard a lot of talk \ntoday. This amendment doesn't do what was just represented. What this \namendment does is, it says that for any 2-year period the trustees of \nthe Medicare trust fund tell us that over 45 percent of the cost of \nMedicare or another entitlement--but it would probably be Medicare--is \ncoming out of the general fund. Remember, Medicare is supposed to be an \ninsurance fund; this is part A. Then at that point, there is an \nopportunity to raise a point of order against new entitlement spending. \nIt specifically excludes Social Security.\n  The fact is, this is a point of order which will probably not come \ninto play for many years, but it is an attempt to address what is a \nlooming problem, which is that Medicare is taking more and more assets \nout of the general fund rather than being paid through the insurance \nprocess. It is good budget discipline.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3121.

Mr. President, am I allocated 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is the widows or orphans \namendment. You have already voted on this, 92 to 6, last fall. It is \neliminating the offset between two different programs taking care of \nwidows and orphans. It is a cost of war, just as providing equipment \nand ammunition. It is a cost of war to take care of our widows or \norphans.\n  On the one hand, the service member pays for taking care of the \nsurvivors in the survivors benefit plan. On the other hand, the \nVeterans Department takes care of the dependents indemnity \ncompensation. But those two are offset in current law. This eliminates \nthe offset. I urge you to support the widows and the orphans.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, would the Senator agree to a voice vote?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator will agree to a voice vote as long \nas it passes favorably. I expect the Senator is being advised that \nsince the Senate is on record with a 92-to-6 vote, there will be a \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we do a voice vote.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is acceptable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Florida.\n  The amendment (No. 3001) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund to allow for deficit-neutral \nlegislation that would provide seniors with a prescription drug benefit \noption that is affordable, user-friendly, and administered directly by \n              the Secretary of Health and Human Services)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. RESERVE FUND TO ALLOW FOR DEFICIT-NEUTRAL \n                   LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE SENIORS WITH A \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT OPTION THAT IS \n                   AFFORDABLE, USER-FRIENDLY, AND ADMINISTERED \n                   DIRECTLY BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate \n     levels and limits in this resolution for a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment thereto or conference report \n     thereon, that would--\n       (1) provide all Medicare beneficiaries with a Medicare-\n     administered prescription drug plan option, while preserving \n     the private prescription drug plan options;\n       (2) ensure that Medicare beneficiaries pay the lowest \n     possible prescription drug prices by directing the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services to negotiate with pharmaceutical \n     manufacturers with respect to the purchase price of covered \n     part D drugs on behalf of beneficiaries enrolled in the \n     Medicare-administered prescription drug plan;\n       (3) improve the part D standard prescription drug benefit; \n     and\n       (4) guarantee that Medicare beneficiaries receive the FDA-\n     approved drugs they need by preventing prescription drug \n     plans and MA-PD plans from ending coverage of drugs, or \n     imposing restrictions or limitations on coverage of drugs, \n     that were covered when the beneficiary enrolled in the plan \n     until the beneficiary has the opportunity to switch plans, \n     with an exception to such guarantee for brand name drugs for \n     which there is a generic drug approved under section 505(j) \n     of the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act that is placed on the \n     market during the period in which the guarantee applies;\n     by the amount provided in such measure for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this amendment would create a deficit-\nneutral reserve fund to provide seniors with the one prescription drug \nchoice that they want, which they don't currently have, and that is an \naffordable prescription drug benefit administered directly through \nMedicare.\n  As you know, the current system has a lot of headaches right now. \nThere are a lot of private plans--over 70 in Michigan--and there has \nbeen mass confusion. A lot of folks are actually paying more for drugs \nunder this Part D program than they were before.\n  My amendment would give our seniors a new option, a Medicare-\nguaranteed option. Seniors today can get their Part A and Part B \nbenefits either through a private plan or a traditional Medicare \nbenefit plan. But they don't have that choice for their medicine. This \nwould give them that choice. It would also direct the Secretary of HHS \nto negotiate drug prices on behalf of seniors choosing to get their \nmedicines through Medicare.\n  This amendment simply gives seniors and disabled persons the real \nchoice they want, which is a Medicare prescription drug benefit, where \nyou go to Medicare and you can sign up and you know the copay and the \npremium. You go to the pharmacy and get your medicine. I ask for your \nsupport.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is beyond my understanding when the \nargument is made that this program is too confusing because there are \ntoo many plans, and then you add yet another plan. That is what this \namendment does. They say there is too much confusion and there are too \nmany plans, and they want to add another plan.\n  This amendment is going to destroy the competitive incentives and \nreplace them with a Government-controlled regime. It puts the \nGovernment into the full-time business of setting drug prices and \ndetermining what drugs are covered. Strong competition has led to lower \ncosts. The average premium is $25. That is 20 percent less than we \nexpected.\n  This amendment would result in higher premiums. This amendment would \nalso have a drug safety issue with it. This amendment would force plans \nto keep unsafe drugs in the formulary because what is on at the first \nof the year has to stay on through the whole year. So if Vioxx was on \nin January 2004 and was found unsafe in September 2004, it would still \nhave to be on the formulary for another 3 months.\n  This is a Government-run plan. It increases costs and has price \ncontrols and unsafe drugs. This is just not a good amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator's time has expired. \nThe question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3164.\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These veterans fought \nalongside American troops and were commanded by General MacArthur. \nThere was no question when they were fighting that they would be \ntreated the same as American troops. Congress betrayed these veterans \nby enacting the Rescission Act which deemed the service of soldiers of \nthe Commonwealth Army of the Philippines not to be service in the \nUnited States military. This was after they already served with the \nU.S. military. These veterans have been waiting for 60 years to have \ntheir benefits reinstated.

UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO GLOBAL HIV/AIDS, \n                   TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached staggering \n     proportions. Over 40,000,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS \n     worldwide, and 5,000,000 more people become infected each \n     year. HIV/AIDS is estimated to kill 3,000,000 men, women, and \n     children each year.\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\n       (2) The United States was the first, and remains the \n     largest, contributor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis and Malaria (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Global Fund'').\n       (3) The Presidential Administration of George W. Bush \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Administration'') has \n     supported legislative language that links United States \n     contributions to the Global Fund to the contributions of \n     other donors, permitting the United States to provide 33 \n     percent of all donations, which would match contributions on \n     a 1-to-2 basis.\n       (4) As of the date of the approval of this Resolution, \n     Congress has provided \\1/3\\ of all donations to the Global \n     Fund since its inception.\n       (5) The Global Fund currently estimates that during fiscal \n     year 2007, it will renew $1,600,000,000 worth of effective \n     programs that are already operating on the ground, and the \n     Administration and Global Fund Board have said that renewals \n     of existing grants should receive priority funding.\n       (6) The Global Fund estimates that during fiscal year 2007, \n     it could award $1,000,000,000 in funding to proposals \n     submitted for Round 6.\n       (7) For fiscal year 2007, the President has requested \n     $300,000,000 for the United States contribution to the Global \n     Fund.\n       (8) The Global Fund is an important component of the United \n     States efforts to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and \n     supports approximately 350 projects in 130 countries.\n       (9) Through a mid-year review process, Congress and the \n     Administration will assess contributions to date and \n     anticipated contributions to the Global Fund, and ensure that \n     United States contributions, at year end, are at the \n     appropriate 1-to-2 ratio.\n       (10) Congress and the Administration will monitor \n     contributions to the Global Fund to ensure that United States \n     contributions do not exceed \\1/3\\ of the Global Fund's \n     revenues.\n       (11) The United States will need to contribute $566,000,000 \n     more than the President's fiscal year 2007 request for the \n     Global Fund to--\n       (A) fund \\1/3\\ of renewals during fiscal year 2007;\n       (B) support at least 1 new round of proposals in fiscal \n     year 2007; and\n       (C) maintain the 1-to-2 funding ratio.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Santorum and I come to the floor \ntoday to offer our amendment to increase funding for global AIDS by \n$566 million, raising the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, TB, and Malaria for fiscal year 2007 to $866 million. This \namendment would raise the U.S. contribution to the fight against global \nAIDS to $4.8 billion in total for bilateral and multilateral programs \ncombined.\n  This money is desperately needed.\n  This year we mark the 25 anniversary of the discovery of AIDS.\n  A generation has been born and come of age since then.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Centers for Disease Control published what \nturned out to be one of the first descriptions of acquired immune \ndeficiency syndrome in a short article in a weekly report. That article \ndescribed five cases of pneumonia. It stated that these five cases \n``suggest the possibility of a cellular-immune dysfunction.''\n  AIDS did not yet have a name, but it had an identity.\n  In the quarter century since those first cases were diagnosed, \nroughly 70 million people have been infected with HIV.\n  More than 22 million have died.\n  More than 12 million children in Africa alone have been orphaned.\n  Last year, 3 million people died, and 5 million people were newly \ninfected.\n  Every 60 seconds, there are five more deaths from AIDS and nine more \ninfections.\n  Over the next decade, an estimated 50 million more people will \ncontract HIV.\n  Those numbers are devastating.\n  But the trajectory of destruction that AIDS has followed over the \nlast quarter century can be changed. It is changing. In the last \ndecade, new research and new international efforts have begun to alter \nthat deadly equation.\n  Antiretrovirals mean that an HIV/AIDS diagnosis is no longer a death \nsentence, if one can get access to the drugs. Successful programs in \nAfrica and elsewhere have convinced doubters that you can administer \nARVs under extremely difficult circumstances. Effective prevention \nstrategies in countries such as Uganda offer hope that the epidemic's \nrelentless spread can be slowed.\n  But millions who are infected receive no treatment, and tens of \nmillions more remain at risk.\n  The United States is a world leader in the battle against global \nAIDS. And the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria is one of the \nmost effective and widest reaching weapons in our arsenal.\n  The amendment that Senator Santorum and I are offering today seeks to \nensure that we maintain that leadership and maintain the extraordinary \nleveraging potential of our contribution.\n  For every dollar that the United States has provided to the Global \nFund, the rest of the world has contributed two more.\n  The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act \nof 2003 linked U.S. contributions to the fund to those of other \ncontributors.\n  We believe that the United States must live up to the commitment we \nhave made to reach our one-third match. We also believe that it is very \nmuch in our interests to do so.\n  As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has stated, ``HIV/AIDS is not \nonly a human tragedy of enormous magnitude; it is also a threat to the \nstability of entire countries and to entire regions of the world.''\n  I strongly support fully funding the President's request for \nbilateral HIV/AIDS programs. These programs are vitally important.\n  The Global Fund is a complement to our other HIV/AIDS programs, not a \ncompetitor with them. The Global Fund offers unique leveraging \nopportunities. It also expands our reach, well beyond PEPFAR focus \ncountries, thus giving our assistance breadth and depth. The Global \nFund reaches 130 countries around the world. It provides one-quarter of \nall donor HIV/AIDS spending, two-thirds of all donor TB spending, and \nhalf of all donor spending on malaria.\n  As of December 2005, the Global Fund was providing voluntary \ncounseling and testing to 3.9 million people. The Global Fund is \ncurrently supporting community outreach efforts to 7 million people. It \nis providing antiretrovirals--ARVs--for 384,000 people.\n  The fund has also provided 7.7 million bed nets to prevent malaria \nand treated 1 million cases of TB through directly observed therapy. \nMalaria and TB kill 3 million people a year. There are proven, cost-\neffective solutions to prevent and treat these diseases, and the Global \nFund helps provide them.\n  The President's request included $300 million for the Global Fund. \nBut this level of funding falls far short.\n  It falls short of our previous contributions, it falls short of our \ncommitment, and it falls far short of the actual need.\n  First, $300 million is less than what the United States has \ncontributed to the Global Fund last year, and the year before that. \nLast year, the United States provided $550 million. To cut that level \nalmost in half would have a devastating effect.\n  As the AIDS crisis grows ever greater, our funding should be \nincreasing, not decreasing.\n  Second, funding at that level will either fall well short of the one-\nto-two match from the international community or, even worse, will \nencourage other donors to lowball their own contributions.\n  Just as our generosity has been matched by the rest of the world, the \nreverse may also be true.\n  Third, the President's request falls far short of what is needed.\n  This year, the fund estimates that it will need $1.6 billion just to \nrenew current grants. That would require a $533 million contribution \nfrom the United States. This figure is based on the assumption that \nabout one in six grants will not be renewed, as part of the fund's \nscreening mechanism. The programs that will be renewed are already on \nthe ground, providing care and treatment. Three hundred million dollars \nwill not come close to funding renewals of proven, lifesaving programs.\n  That is where we must begin, with $533 million for renewals.\n  However, the need for expanded prevention, care, and treatment of \nthese terrible diseases does not stay stable: it grows.\n  Our potential to help also increases, through proven interventions \nand demonstrated best practices and through the elimination of programs \nthat do not meet standards of effectiveness or honesty.\n  The Global Fund must not remain static in the face of an expanding \nepidemic: it must grow to meet it.\n  Therefore, Senator Santorum and I believe that the United States must\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\nalso make a one third contribution to a new round of grants, at $333 \nmillion.\n  That would mean a total contribution of $866 million for the Global \nFund from the United States.\n  On average, every $100 million contribution to the Global Fund will \ngenerate the following results: The Fund can provide 630,000 bed nets \nto fight malaria; it can deliver 150,000 treatments for malaria; it can \nprovide 80,000 highly-effective DOTS treatments for TB; it can supply \n370,000 people with HIV tests; and it can provide 11,000 people with \nlifesaving AIDS treatment.\n  Lives hang in the balance. We must not shortchange this vital \nprogram, which dramatically extends the reach of U.S. foreign \nassistance.\n  Our amendment offsets the $566 million increase in global AIDS funds \nwith the 920 function, administrative allowances. This offset asks \nappropriators to find $566 million in savings across all budget \nfunctions.\n  We do not believe that this money should come at the expense of other \ninternational humanitarian programs.\n  Out of a discretionary budget of $873 billion, I don't think $566 \nmillion is too much to ask in the global fight against these diseases.\n  Senator Santorum and I will be working together through the \nappropriations process to make sure we find these savings.\n  We believe it is important to set the U.S. mark now for the Global \nFund at $866 million.\n  This sends a clear signal to other donors that they need to step up \ntheir contributions to match this U.S. level.\n  I know there are many budgetary pressures, but this is literally a \nmatter of life and death.\n  Twenty-five years ago, doctors first began to diagnose AIDS cases, \nbut they could do almost nothing to save people. Then they began using \nAZT, which could slow the disease and, 10 years ago, ARVs, which could \ngive people their lives back.\n  Sadly, for the first 10, even 20 years of this pandemic, the response \nof the international community to the tragedy unfolding before them was \ndreadfully slow.\n  Jan Eliasson, President of the U.N. General Assembly, has rightly \ndeclared that our slow response marks a scar ``on the conscience of our \ngeneration.''\n  Eliasson continues, ``We cannot turn back the clock. We must ensure \nthat, when historians look at the way the world responded to HIV and \nAIDS, they see that 2006 was the year when the international community \nfinally stepped up to the mark the year when . . . the world began to \n`keep the promise.' ''\n  In 25 years we have made enormous strides, and yet the disease has \nmoved faster.\n  I urge you to join me in supporting this amendment to ensure that the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria can both renew ongoing, \nproven programs and expand its lifesaving efforts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this amendment adds $566 million for the \nGlobal AIDS Fund. This is a fund that historically the United States \nhas participated at one-third funding level. It is an encouragement and \nincentive for the rest of the world to contribute to end the scourge of \nHIV/AIDS, particularly on the continent of Africa. To be able to meet \nthat requirement for this funding year required an additional $566 \nmillion above the President's request of $300 million. That will fund \n85 percent of the renewals that are coming due this year, in addition \nto round six of new funding for this initiative by the Global Fund.\n  This is a commitment that the United States has made. We have been a \nleader on this. We need to continue to lead in an area that does cry \nout for humanitarian support and compassion by the people of the United \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss S.A. 3111 to the fiscal \nyear 2007 budget resolution which I sponsored with my colleague, \nSenator DeWine. This amendment, which helps our Nation's firefighters \nperform their critical duties more safely, was adopted by unanimous \nconsent. I thank the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg, \nand the committee's ranking member, Senator Conrad, both for their work \non the budget resolution and for their consideration of this important \nissue.\n  I would imagine that this amendment, which creates a special reserve \nfund to pay for the assistance to firefighters grants, is not the way \nthat everyone would choose first to provide critical resources to the \nFIRE Act and SAFER Act grants. However, this amendment does demonstrate \nthe commitment of the Senate to increase conditionally funding for our \nfirefighters in a manner consistent with the need to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Clearly, the need for these grants is irrefutable. Across our \ncountry, fire departments are in desperate need of obtaining updated \nequipment and more expensive firefighter training--two activities that \nare crucial to ensuring that firefighters can carry out their expanded \nresponsibilities safely and effectively in this post-9/11 world.\n  In fiscal year 2002, there were over 19,000 FIRE grant applications \nseeking almost $2 billion in support for eligible activities. In fiscal \nyear 2005, there were over 27,000 FIRE grant applications seeking over \n$4 billion for such activities. The manmade and natural hazards that \nfirefighters are expected to face today have strapped the ability of \nmunicipalities and States to provide for their needs. Therefore, it is \nimperative that the Federal Government expand its commitment to support \nour firefighters.\n  I think that very few people who are not firefighters stop and think \nabout how much we ask of our firefighters in today's world. They still \nperform their traditional duties of extinguishing fires, delivering \nemergency medical services, and ensuring that fire codes are inspected. \nHowever, many firefighters have also taken on new homeland security \nresponsibilities that include responding to and handling hazardous \nbiological and radiological agents.\n  According to a national needs assessment study of the U.S. Fire \nService published in December 2002, most fire departments lack the \nnecessary resources and training to properly handle terrorist attacks \nand large-scale emergencies.\n  More specifically, the study found that, first, using local \npersonnel, only 11 percent of fire departments can handle a rescue with \nemergency medical services at a structural collapse of a building with \n50 occupants. Nearly half of all fire departments consider such an \nincident beyond their scope. Second, using local personnel, only 13 \npercent of fire departments say that they can handle a hazardous \nmaterial incident involving chemical and/or biological agents with 10 \ninjuries. Only 21 percent have a written agreement to direct the use of \nnonlocal resources to handle the situation. Third, an estimated 40 \npercent of fire department personnel involved in hazardous material \nresponse lack formal training in those duties. And finally, the study \nfound an estimated 60 to 75 percent of fire departments do not have \nenough fire stations to achieve widely used response-time guidelines. \nMany fire departments are often stretched so thin that they cannot \nrespond to fires with sufficient personnel to initiate an interior \nattack on a structural fire safely.\n\n  Moreover, the need for additional firefighters--both paid and \nvolunteer--on our Nation's streets is great. According to National Fire \nProtection Association standards, a minimum of four firefighters is \nrequired to initiate an interior attack on a house fire. The study goes \non to conclude that 73 percent of fire departments serving populations \nbetween 10,000 and 25,000 lack such personnel, 82 percent of \ndepartments serving populations between 25,000 and 50,000, 76 percent \nof departments serving populations between 50,000 and 100,000, 56 \npercent of departments serving populations between 100,000 and 250,000, \n41 percent of departments serving populations between 250,000 and \n500,000 people, 40 percent of departments serving populations between \n500,000 and 1 million people, and\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nzero percent of departments serving populations at least 1 million \npeople.\n  Over the past 5 years, FIRE and SAFER grants have been highly \nsuccessful in enabling fire departments to acquire the resources they \ndemand and hire the people they need. Over $3 billion in assistance as \nbeen provided to well over 20,000 fire departments in all 50 States \nthus far. Yet the job of ensuring that all communities receive the \nassistance they need and deserve is far from done.\n  America's firefighters are always the first ones in and the last ones \nout. They risk their own lives to save the lives of others. They stare \ndanger in the face every single day because they know they have a duty \nto fulfill. We must recognize their contribution to our domestic safety \nto see to it that they have the necessary equipment and personnel they \ndemand in order to perform their critical duties safely.\n  I look forward to working with Senator DeWine and my colleagues \nduring the appropriations season to help ensure that the maximum amount \nof aid is delivered to all of our firefighters.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the budget \nresolution with Senator Biden to significantly restore funding for \njuvenile justice programs. Our amendment will increase funding for \nthese programs funded by the Department of Justice by adding $380 \nmillion to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention--\nOJJDP--budget. The amendment accomplishes this by raising the \nfunctional total for the justice allocation by $380 million offset in \nfunction 920--which gives the Appropriations Committee the flexibility \nto design the exact offsets.\n  Let me briefly illustrate why we must put money back into these \nprograms. Following the administration's lead, the Senate Budget \nCommittee allocated $176 million to the OJJDP budget, which is about \n$167 million less than what we appropriated last year and $380 million \nless than the fiscal year 2002 appropriation. I am particularly \ndisturbed that the Senate budget resolution assumes complete \nelimination of the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program--JABG--\nwhich received a little less than $50 million last year. JABG provides \nfunding for intervention programs that address the urgent needs of \njuveniles who have had run-ins with the law. Positive intervention and \ntreatment at this early stage of delinquency can prevent further \nviolent behavior and steer a young person in the right direction before \nit's too late.\n  That said, the Budget Committee seems to feel that the JABG program \nis ineffective. An example from my homestate of Wisconsin proves \notherwise. Using Federal dollars from the JABG program, the Southern \nOaks Girls School, a juvenile detention center outside of Racine, WI, \nbuilt a new mental health wing to provide much-needed counseling \nservices for the girl inmates. The administrator of this school cites a \n56-percent drop in violent behavior since the new mental services have \nbeen offered. This is just one example of JABG's many successes--a \nrecord that supports keeping JABG alive and well-funded.\n  The same is true of title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program, the \nonly Federal program solely dedicated to juvenile crime prevention. \nTitle V programs include preschool and parent training programs, youth \nmentoring, afterschool activities, tutoring, truancy reduction, \nsubstance abuse prevention and gang prevention outreach. Nonetheless, \nthe Senate budget assumes a 50-percent cut to title--V penny pinching \nnow that will cost us dearly in the future. According to many experts \nin the field, every dollar spent on prevention saves $3 or $4 in costs \nattributable to juvenile crime. And who can put a dollar value on the \nhundreds, even thousands of young lives turned from crime and into \nproductive work and community life by the juvenile crime prevention \nprograms supported by title V?\n  The downward spiral of juvenile justice funding is a disturbing \nbudget trend with ugly real world implications. Juvenile crime is an \nongoing challenge and it is not a problem that is going to solve \nitself. Boosting funding for successful juvenile justice programs is \nthe first step in addressing this challenge. Just a few short years ago \nin fiscal year 2002, juvenile justice programs received $556 million. \nOf that amount, more than $94 million went to the title V program and \nnearly $250 million was dedicated to JABG. We need to restore these \ninitiatives to those robust levels and our amendment will do just that \nby adding $380 million to the OJJDP budget for juvenile justice \nprograms.\n  We have a choice in this Congress of where we want to invest our \nmoney. We can choose to address the roots of crime and invest in our \nchildren by preventing a life of criminal behavior. We can choose to \nintervene in a positive manner to work with those teens that have \nfallen through the cracks and have had a few scrapes with the law--we \ncan turn many of those kids around. I urge my colleagues to make the \nright choice this year and support our amendment which will increase \nfunding for juvenile justice programs. We can and must do better.\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 3167, 3168, and 3169 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know Senator Vitter wants to be heard on \nhis amendment and Senator Domenici wants to be heard on his amendment. \nThere was a prior order that said Senator Domenici would occur after \nSenator Santorum--not an order but sort of a collegial understanding--\nso we will go to Senator Domenici, then Senator Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3128\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last year the Senate by an overwhelming \nmajority--74 Senators voted to support the Energy Policy Act. A number \nof programs, projects, and activities within that act were not \ncontained in the President's budget.\n  What this does, it supports an energy reserve fund paid for by ANWR \nreceipts. In other words, ANWR is in the bill, and we allocate part of \nthe receipts in a reserve fund to the Secretary of Energy to pay for \nvarious projects that were already voted on by the Congress that we \nthought were good projects. Therefore, this would fund $150 million a \nyear for 5 years from the ANWR receipts.\n  I think we should do it. I urge the Senate to adopt this. It is a \ngood way to use the funds, an appropriate way, and I believe it would \nadd to the validity of our Energy Policy Act and make those things \nhappen more quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by \nthe Senator from New Mexico. This is a debate we have been through over \nand over again. There are some who believe that drilling for oil in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is the answer to America's energy \nchallenge. This amendment says the proceeds from that drilling will \nfund all the other energy policies in our Nation.\n  This makes no sense whatsoever. There is no possible way that in the \nnext fiscal year, even if we approved the drilling in ANWR, there will \nbe proceeds that can be contributed to the Energy Policy Act funding.\n  Yesterday, this body had a chance to vote for real money to fund the \nEnergy Policy Act when Senator Bingaman offered the amendment, and it \nwas defeated by opposition from the other side of the aisle.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment. This is no way to fund energy \npolicy, and ANWR is not the answer to our energy prayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3128.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for implementing the Energy Policy Act of \n                            2005 from ANWR)\n\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $151,593,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $156,269,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $162,937,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $69,093,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $133,769,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by $155,437,000.\n       On page 5, line 23, decrease the amount by $69,093,000.\n       On page 5, line 25, decrease the amount by $133,769,000.\n       On page 6, line 2, decrease the amount by $155,437,000.\n       On page 6, line 12, increase the amount by $69,093,000.\n       On page 6, line 14, increase the amount by $202,862,000.\n       On page 6, line 16, increase the amount by $358,299,000.\n       On page 7, line 2, increase the amount by $69,093,000.\n       On page 7, line 4, increase the amount by $202,862,000.\n       On page 7, line 6, increase the amount by $358,299,000.\n       On page 13, line 4, increase the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 5, increase the amount by $67,500,000.\n       On page 13, line 8, increase the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 9, increase the amount by $127,500,000.\n       On page 13, line 12, increase the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 13, line 13, increase the amount by $142,500,000.\n       On page 41, strike lines 8 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``ate may make the adjustments described in subsections (b) \n     and (c).\n       (b) Adjustment for Implementation of Energy Policy Act of \n     2005.--If the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate \n     reports a bill or joint resolution, or if an amendment is \n     offered thereto or a conference report is submitted thereon \n     that makes available a portion of the receipts resulting from \n     enactment of the legislation described in subsection (a) for \n     programs to implement the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-58), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may \n     revise committee allocations for that committee and other \n     appropriate budgetary aggregates and allocations of new \n     budget authority and outlays by the amount provided by that \n     measure for that purpose, but the adjustment may not exceed \n     $150,000,000 in new budget authority in each of fiscal years \n     2009 through 2011.\n       (c) Adjustment for the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Programs and Additional Land Conservation Programs.--If the \n     Committee on Appro-* * *\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are very close to being able to move \ntoward final passage, but we still have a number of amendments to \ndispose of. If we can just have the patience of the body for a few more \nminutes, we can dispose of these final amendments and move toward final \npassage.\n  First of all, I think it is important to thank colleagues--dozens of \ncolleagues--who have given their amendments in the last hour--we \nappreciate it very much--and others who were able to work with us to \nget their amendments agreed to as the chairman has just reviewed.\n  The next amendment is Senator Ensign. We ask colleagues to give the \nSenator from Nevada their attention.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3166\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3166.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To deny funds in FY2007 for the United Nations Human Rights \n Council, which the United States just voted against because countries \n   found complicit in sustained human rights abuses are eligible for \n       Council membership. Savings redirected to border security)\n\n       On page 10, line 20, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 21, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, just very briefly, this amendment has to \ndo with funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council which I \nbelieve is worse than the discredited United Nations Commission on \nHuman Rights.\n  Members will not be selected primarily on the basis of their \ncommitment to human rights, even countries under Security Council \nsanctions for human rights violations or terrorism.\n  The United States has been a member of the United States Commission \non Human Rights since 1947, with one exception. That will no longer be \nthe case. Due to a rotating membership, the United States will be \nineligible for the Human Rights Council membership every 6 years. So \nour country, which has been at the forefront of promoting human rights, \nwould periodically lose its seat but still be required to cover 22 \npercent of the United Nations Human Rights Council cost.\n  I am proud of the United States and how we have stood firm and \nopposed creation of this fatally flawed council. We need to make sure \nwe are not funding this council, and that is exactly what our amendment \ndoes. It takes away the funding from the Human Rights Council and puts \nit toward border security.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment reduces the international \naccount by $4 million. That is what it does. We have no assurance that \nit will actually take money from the Human Rights Council, although \nthat is the intention of the Senator. The fact is, it reduces the \ninternational account by $4 million and increases the 750 account by a \nlike amount.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment. The United States did not get all the changes it wanted \nmade with respect to the Human Rights Council, but very significant \nchanges were made. And under Secretary Burns, they have indicated that \nthe administration intends to work with those changes to try to improve \nthat situation. We have a real problem with respect to that Human \nRights Council. But changes are being made. They are being made in the \nright direction.\n  I very much oppose this amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I want to begin by complimenting my \nfriend from New Hampshire and the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee on a job well done. He has taken a difficult situation and \nproduced the budget resolution before us today. Congratulations.\n  I would like to raise the issue of mental health parity as the Senate \ndebates the fiscal year 2007 Senate budget resolution.\n  It is my understanding the resolution before us assumes the revenue \nimpact of enacting a mental health parity law at a cost of $1.5 billion \nover 5 years. I want to make sure that it is indeed the case that the \noverall revenue number is such that it assumes Congress will pass a \nmental health parity bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the interest of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico regarding mental health parity legislation and \nI would concur with my colleague's assessment. S. Con. Res. 83 does \nassume the revenue impact of enacting a mental health parity bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished chairman for his \nconsideration and explanation of this important matter.\n\n\n                        border patrol challenges\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as the chairman may know, I recently took \na trip with Senator Coleman to the U.S.-Mexican border to look at the \nchallenges facing our Border Patrol agents as they work to secure the \nborder against illegal immigration. One of our stops was at Fort \nHuachuca, AZ, where we saw, in operation, the lone UAV Predator B that \nthe Customs and Border Patrol has in service. I was tremendously \nimpressed with this technology and saw its usefulness in assisting our \nCBP agents in locating and interdicting illegal immigrants as they \ncrossed the border. In fact, Mr. Chairman, while at Fort Huachuca, CBP \ncaught 13 illegal immigrants using the Predator B right before our \neyes.\n  In our discussions with the CBP officials at Fort Huachuca, we \nlearned that with a squadron of UAVs the CBP could provide 24-hour-a-\nday, 7-day-a-week, coverage on the Mexican border. These MQ-9 UAVs \nwould have satellite command, control, and communications which would \nallow them to be operated anywhere in the world from anywhere in the \nworld, as well as an updated sensor suite to assist in finding illegals \ncoming across the border. It is my belief that this body should make a \nsignificant investment in unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  We also learned that there is an issue surrounding critical spares \nfor the lone UAV in operation. I understand the CBP is scheduled to \nreceive a second Predator B this year; however, we need to fund the \ncritical spares CBP needs to keep these UAVs up and flying.\n  Through conversations that I and my staff have had with FAA, I \nunderstand they are working out the issues surrounding the flying of \nUAVs within U.S. airspace. I would like to take this opportunity to \nencourage the FAA to continue to work with other Government agencies as \nwell as the private sector to mitigate the problems surrounding the use \nof UAVs in U.S. airspace.\n  Mr. Chairman, the chairman has been a leader in this body on so many \nissues but in particular on homeland security issues. I look forward to \nworking with you in this effort and on this issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my good friend and colleague from Georgia for \nhighlighting this issue. Protecting U.S. borders is a basic Federal \nfunction; it is national security. I also believe these unmanned aerial \nvehicles can enhance our capabilities, as they have for our military as \ndemonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am in the position of being \nboth the chairman of the Budget Committee and manager of this budget \nresolution, and also the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nthat oversees the Department of Homeland Security both our \ncounterterrorism and border security programs.\n  The distinguished Senator from Georgia is known as a real leader in \nthis area, and we appreciate his counsel. I might note that this budget \nresolution proposes increases of some $4 billion for border security \nfocused on improving infrastructure and giving our men and women on the \nfront lines\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nthe tools to do the job. We will have to see how much of these funds \nsurvive the Appropriations Committee's 302(b) allocation process and \nthe administration's transmittals of emergency spending. But I can \nassure the Senator we will take a hard look at the UAV program as a \ncomponent of a border security infrastructure program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I would like to take a few \nminutes to speak about the tax gap. Before I get started, I first want \nto thank my colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, for their interest in the tax gap. As chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I too have a great interest in this topic. It is my \nintention to close the tax gap, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Gregg and Senator Conrad to achieve this important goal.\n  The tax gap, as we all know, is the difference between the amount of \ntax owed by taxpayers from legal activities and the amount voluntarily \npaid on time. Today, specifically, I want to clarify the facts and the \nfiction regarding the possible solutions to this $350 billion problem.\n  Under my chairmanship, the Finance Committee has held at least eight \nhearings to address the tax gap:\n  No. 1, Oversight of the Internal Revenue Service, ``Taxpayer Beware: \nSchemes, Scams, and Cons,'' April 5, 2001; No. 2, Tax Code Complexity: \nNew Hope for Fresh Solutions, April 26, 2001; No. 3, Taxpayer Alert: \nChoosing a Paid Preparer and the Pitfalls of Charitable Car Donation, \nApril 1, 2003; No. 4, Tax Shelters: Who's Buying, Who's Selling, and \nWhat's the Government Doing About It?, October 21, 2003; No. 5, \nBridging the Tax Gap, July 21, 2004; No. 6, Charities and Charitable \nGiving: Proposals for Reform, April 5, 2005; No. 7, The $350 Billion \nQuestion: How to Solve the Tax Gap, April 14, 2005; and No. 8, Social \nSecurity: Achieving Sustainable Solvency, May 25, 2005.\n  During these hearings, we learned a lot about the tax gap, including \nseveral good ideas for closing it. We heard from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. We heard from the Treasury Department, including IRS and \nTIGTA. We heard from the Comptroller General and GAO. We heard from the \nJustice Department. We heard from the Taxpayer Advocate. We heard from \nCBO. We heard from the States. We heard from the private sector, both \nnonprofit and for-profit. And, of course, we heard from the American \ntaxpayer.\n  From the testimony of all these hearings, and the expertise of all \nthese witnesses, we identified several truths about the tax gap:\n  No. 1, the tax gap is a huge problem for the tax system; No. 2, it is \neasy to discuss in the abstract; No. 3, there is no easy solution to \nthe problem; No. 4, there is no one silver bullet; the tax gap can only \nbe solved through many small steps; No. 5, enforcement is important, \nbut any real solution to this problem will require legislative changes, \nthe most important being Tax Code simplification; No. 6, closing the \ntax gap should not place an undue burden on honest taxpayers; and No. \n7, taking concrete steps to close the tax gap will require a lot of \npolitical will and bipartisan cooperation.\n  In the spirit of bipartisan cooperation, I look forward to working \nwith Senator Conrad and others to solve the tax gap problem. Before we \ncan reach a bipartisan solution, however, we first need to get on the \nsame page regarding the facts and fiction of this issue.\n  A common misperception by some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle is that the only thing we need to do to close the tax gap is give \nthe IRS more money for enforcement. This myth asserts that if the IRS \ngets more funding for enforcement, both the $350 billion tax gap and \nthe budget deficit will magically disappear. This myth is even being \nused as an offset for new spending.\n  The Finance Committee's tax gap hearings have emphasized the \nimportance of IRS enforcement. In fact, this budget will provide the \nIRS additional resources to get the job done. However, our best \nestimates suggest that enforcement alone could account for only 10 \npercent of the tax gap, not 100 percent as purported by Senator Conrad. \nBut even this possible 10 percent is misleading, because it doesn't \naccurately reflect the reality of expanded enforcement. To achieve \nthese kinds of returns from enforcement alone would, I fear, require us \nto backtrack to a time when there was serious concern about the IRS \noverreaching and stepping on the rights of taxpayers. We must always \nkeep a balance between taxpayer rights and enforcement.\n  So yes, while I support additional enforcement, we need to keep our \nfeet on the ground and our rhetoric in check as to how much can be \nachieved through enforcement and the level of enforcement that can be \nsupported.\n  We must also remember that it is vital that enforcement resources be \ntargeted properly. We need to be smart in our use of enforcement. Too \noften the IRS has ``no-change'' audits. That is, they have spent a lot \nof time going through the shoebox of receipts belonging to some person \nand found out there were no problems. This is a waste of IRS resources \nand takes up the time of honest taxpayers. I been pleased to work with \nSenator Baucus to encourage the IRS to do the research and review that \nwill allow them to focus their attention on the bad actors and get more \nbang for the buck on audits and enforcement.\n  Let me note, too, from my work on the Commission on Restructuring the \nIRS that the Commission found that taxpayer service and clarity of law \nare vital in encouraging compliance. So many folks want to abide by \ntheir obligations as a citizen, but they can't because the law is too \nconfusing, and they can't get the right answer. Service and \nsimplification must be part of any effort to deal with the tax gap. I \nwill return to simplification later in my comments.\n  So if enforcement can't solve the $350 billion problem, what are our \nother options? Well, a little over a year ago, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, at the Finance Committee's request, issued a report.\n  This is the report right here. It is titled ``Options to Improve Tax \nCompliance and Reform Tax Expenditures,'' otherwise known as the \n``White Book.''\n  This report provided about $190 billion over 5 years with some very \ncontroversial items. Let me give you some examples:\n  Repeal the mortgage interest deduction for home equity loans. Subject \nState and local workers to the Medicare tax. Apply the payroll tax to \nmost fringe benefits. Allow the offshore activities of U.S. companies \nto be exempt from U.S. tax.\n  These are clearly controversial proposals, and I am sure there are \nnot many in the Senate who would line up to endorse them today.\n  Some other ideas came out of the Finance Committee's examination of \nthe payroll tax gap last spring. The Joint Committee on Taxation and \nthe Treasury Department testified on the leakage in the payroll tax \nsystem. To fix this leak, we heard some of the following ideas:\n  Modify the determination of amounts subject to employment tax for \npartners and S Corporation shareholders. Provide consistent FICA \ntreatment of salary reduction amounts. Remove the employment tax cap.\n\n  Again, many of these and other comprehensive payroll tax proposals, \nall which would have improved Social Security solvency, were too \ncontroversial to stand on their own.\n  With the lack of bipartisan cooperation on Social Security, we did \nnot have an environment to consider these important, but controversial \nproposals. Perhaps, if there had been bipartisan cooperation on \naddressing the Social Security problem, we could have made headway on \nthe payroll tax gap.\n  In addition, no discussion of methods to close the tax gap can be \ncomplete without identifying the single most important one, which is \nTax Code simplification. Our tax code is just too complex. Complex laws \nlead to inadvertent errors as well as opportunities for intentional \nnoncompliance. Complexity in the Tax Code also contributes heavily to \ntaxpayer confusion and real or perceived unfairness in the tax system. \nAnd studies have shown that if taxpayers feel they are being treated \nunfairly by the tax system, they are less likely to be compliant. Any \nreal effort to close the tax gap cannot be taken seriously unless Tax \nCode simplification is part of the proposal.\n  Finally, I also want to alert my colleagues to the fact that we have \nmeasures in the tax relief reconciliation bill that aim at some aspects \nof the tax gap. In particular, some of these are\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\ndealing with problems we are seeing in tax-exempt entities--charitable \ndonations and abuses of tax-exempt organizations. We have reforms of \ntwo types of charitable entities--donor advised funds and supporting \norganizations. Too often, people have been making donations to these \norganizations but retaining control and seeing an inappropriate benefit \ngoing to themselves and their family, rather than to the community and \nthose in need.\n  Let my colleagues understand, the issues of donor advised funds and \nsupporting organizations are not minor as it relates to the tax gap. \nThe IRS recently released its ``dirty dozen'' tax scams for 2006, and \nthroughout the thousands of pages of Tax Code and regulations, abuse of \ndonor advised funds and supporting organizations was targeted as one of \nthe top dozen problems.\n  Two years ago, the Commissioner of the IRS, in a letter to me, \nhighlighted the abuse of donor advised funds and supporting \norganizations as the No. 1 problem IRS was seeing in tax-exempt \nentities.\n  I think the public would view the Finance Committee as neglecting its \nwork if it didn't seek to shut down such abuses. The Finance Committee \ndidn't turn a blind eye; we worked on addressing these problems and \ndrafting reforms. These reforms of donor advised funds and supporting \norganizations have been drafted on a bipartisan basis and with \nsignificant comment and input from the charity sector, particularly the \nNonprofit Panel. I am pleased that these measures are now in tax \nreconciliation and conference. I think it is important that we take \nsteps in addressing these problems here and now.\n  But my point is that here is something--problems of donor advised \nfunds and supporting organizations--labeled as one of the most dirty \nabuses in the entire Code, and yet I still have a few colleagues who \ncome to me with this complaint, this change, this concern about what we \nare doing to stop the abuses. If the road is so full of potholes on \ndealing with these areas of clear abuse and relatively small dollars, I \nthink we need to recognize the real problems ahead in dealing with the \nbig issues in the tax gap. Unfortunately, all too often I find that the \ntax gap is an issue in which everyone shouts for solving in the \nabstract, while many of those same voices are stilled when it comes to \nthe particulars.\n  In closing, I want to re-emphasize the importance of this debate. \nToday, I have just scratched the surface on this topic. I praise the \nTreasury and IRS for taking some initial steps. I applaud the chairman \nand ranking member of the Budget Committee for their interest in \nclosing the tax gap, and I welcome input from other Senators as well. I \nwill eagerly entertain any specific ideas to close the tax gap as long \nas they go beyond ``more money for IRS enforcement,'' and as long as \nthey do not place an undue burden on honest taxpayers. The solution to \nthis problem needs to be bipartisan, and it needs to be legislative. \nLet's sit down at the table, separate the facts from the fiction, and \nwork together to solve this tax gap problem.\n  But, the bottom line for the discussion today is that the minority's \npoint that closing the tax gap can be done just through enforcement \njust doesn't have merit. And, the $35 billion--and that is stretching \nit--that may be gotten through enforcement doesn't come close to paying \nfor the over $100 billion in new spending that the Democrat leadership \nis pushing.\n  Mr. President, virtually all Democratic Members have had a common \ntheme in their purported offsets for their amendments to this \nresolution--they would close tax loopholes to pay for whatever popular \nspending program is proposed. Closing corporate tax loopholes is the \ncommon refrain to pay for spending. Several Members have referred to \nthe raisers in Senator Conrad's substitute amendment to the tax relief \nreconciliation bill--and they keep trying to spend that same money over \nand over again.\n  Of the raisers in Senator Conrad's substitute amendment, $30 billion \nof those are included in the Senate tax relief reconciliation bill that \nis now in conference between the House and Senate. Many of the \nproponents of these amendments that have been offered on the other side \nof the aisle, using tax loophole closers, were among the small minority \nof Members who opposed the tax relief reconciliation bill that \ncontained offsets.\n  This brings me then to the amendments that have been proposed. The \nsponsors say they have offset the costs of the amendments by closing \ntax loopholes. Senator Conrad's amendment contains the known universe \nof revenue raisers supported by those on the other side. If we assume \nthat the raisers in Senator Conrad's amendment would have raised \napproximately $89 billion over 10 years that is still a far cry from \nthe cumulative demands of the amendments that have already been offered \nfrom the other side. The amendments that have been offered that propose \nto use those tax loophole closers as offsets total $319 in new \nspending. That total is as of 3:30 p.m. this afternoon. We don't have a \ntally for all of the additional amendments that have been proposed \nsince then. That new spending, by the way occurs over the budget \nperiod--5 years. That means we will have to find $319 more in revenue \nraisers just to cover those new spending items.\n  Now, if you use a loophole closer that is already called for in the \ntax relief package that is in conference, we will also need to find \nanother $30 billion in raisers to cover the tax reconciliation bill \nunless my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided that \nthey are no longer interested in the tuition deduction and the low \nincome savers credit and the work opportunity tax credit and the \ndeduction for teacher expenses and small business expensing and, oh \nyes, AMT relief for nearly 20 million Americans. The Finance Committee \nstaff hopes to use the full $30 billion that is already in conference \nin the Senate tax relief reconciliation bill for those important tax \nrelief provisions.\n  So, if we leave the $30 billion in raisers that are in tax \nreconciliation out of it, we will have $59 billion in net new revenue \nraisers available that are supported by those on the other side. Keep \nin mind, I'm giving the other side a break here because I'm using 10 \nyear numbers for the offsets. The 5 year numbers are probably less than \nhalf of the net $59 billion they could claim they are raising. If you \nsubtract the $59 billion from the $319 billion in new spending \nproposed, it means the other side's amendments were short by $260 \nbillion. That's $260 billion, Mr. President.\n  Now, that $260 billion needs to come from some place. It wipes out \nall the tax relief in the package. That means no extension of the child \ntax credit, marginal rate relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement \nsecurity relief, or education tax relief when those provisions expire \nin 2011.\n  It also means no extension of the Alternative Minimum Tax relief \n``patch'' and other extenders like the research and development tax \ncredit.\n  You can't have it both ways, Mr. President.\n  Either the other side, if they had prevailed, would have added $260 \nbillion in deficit spending or they would've gutted the tax relief they \nclaim to support.\n  Budgets are about choices. In this case, the choices are clear. If \nthe Democratic leadership were in control of the Senate, we would have \nno tax relief left in this budget or we would have added $269 billion \nin deficit spending. That deficit spending would be $269 billion higher \nthan the deficits in the budget that the other side criticizes. Neither \nchoice would be the right choice for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The President's budget proposal fiscal year 2007 includes \na plan to change, through issuance of a new administrative ruling, the \nway Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, retires its debt to the \nFederal Treasury. The plan would require BPA to use excess revenues to \nretire long-term debt more quickly. Because the change would be made \nthrough the rulemaking process, congressional approval would not be \nneeded for the rule to go into effect. Analysts believe the proposed \nrule would result in 10-percent rate increase that BPA would be forced \nto pass on to ratepayers.\n  This rate proposal is not acceptable. The Northwest is a region that \nis growing very rapidly, and our economy is built on hydropower. That \nmeans each year is different, depending on what\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nkind of water year we have had. This proposal would limit BPA's \nflexibility to deal with the bad water years by taking advantage of the \ngood ones.\n  According to a February 8, 2006, analysis by the Northwest Power and \nConservation Council, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, \nproposal will result in a retail rate increase of at least 6.6 percent, \nraising power rates $145 million a year, costing retail customers an \nadditional $26.13 a year, decreasing personal income in the Northwest \nby $109 million, and resulting in the loss of 1,120 jobs. The Pacific \nNorthwest economy is only beginning to rebound from the recent \nrecession, and increasing energy costs will only serve to slow that \nrecovery. Surely, it is preferable to foster longer-term economic \ngrowth in the region rather than focus on a short-term revenue stream \nfor the U.S. Treasury.\n  Some assert that this proposal is good business practice because it \nprepays BPA's Federal debt. I disagree because the full story is not \nbeing told. While it is not unusual to prepay debt, it is certainly \nunusual for the Government to require this. In fact, this proposal is \none-sided. It takes excess revenues away from BPA during good water \nyears but does not assist BPA in bad water years.\n  BPA has been prepaying debt for more than 20 years, even when our \nNorthwest States had the second and third highest unemployment in the \ncountry. Power rates were not raised to do this. So why is the \nGovernment requiring prepayment of debt and an increase in power rates \nwhen the Northwest has been successful in prepaying debt without \nimpacting rates? This does not make sense unless there is another \nreason for the proposal.\n  According to the Department of Energy, DOE, the main purposes of the \nproposal are to allow more financial flexibility for BPA and to help \nbuild more transmission infrastructure. We agree with these goals but \nthink the individuals in the region can better decide how to accomplish \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, it seems this proposal would result in the \nestablishment of BPA as a revenue raiser for the Treasury--a \nquestionable precedent and one BPA will not always be able to achieve. \nThis proposal must be stopped.\n  Senators Crapo, Wyden, and Murray have successfully inserted section \n312 into S. Con. Res. 83, which relates to requiring BPA to use excess \nrevenues to prepay long-term debt. I commend my colleagues for their \neffort and support their provision, but this is just the first step in \nmaking sure that this proposal does not go forward. Our work is far \nfrom over.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to put this issue to rest.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Levin-DeWine amendment would provide \n$140 million to the Advanced Technology Program to support cost-shared \nindustry-led research and development of cutting-edge high-risk \ntechnology with broad commercial potential and societal benefits. The \namendment is fully offset with reductions in function 920.\n  The Senate has voted twice recently in support of this program. Last \nyear the Senate voted to adopt a Levin-DeWine budget amendment to \nprovide for the Advanced Technology Program, ATP. The Senate defeated \nan amendment that would have eliminated the ATP Program during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2006 Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill.\n  We have lost nearly 2.8 million manufacturing jobs since January \n2001. We should be doing all we can to promote programs that help \ncreate jobs and strengthen the technological innovation of American \ncompanies and produce the systems that are defending our national \nsecurity. This budget resolution includes $28 billion for agriculture \nbut includes very little for manufacturing.\n  In fiscal year 2006 the Senate funded ATP at $140 million, but \nbecause the House zeroed out the program, ATP ended up with only $80 \nmillion in conference. The Senate needs to again provide $140 million \nfor ATP to help ensure this program has at least last year's level of \nfunding.\n  The ATP is a very modest program which, according to the Department \nof Commerce, has had a result eight times more in technologies \ndeveloped than the amount of money we have put into the program. This \nis an eight-time return on investment in advanced technologies which is \nachieved when the Department of Commerce partners with industry through \nthe ATP. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a statement of priorities and a vision of \nwhere we want our nation to be in the years to come, this budget fails \nthe test of responsible leadership. Instead of correcting the mistakes \nof the past few years, this budget repeats and compounds those \nmistakes. It adds to record levels of national debt. It favors the \nfortunate few over everyone else who is working hard and playing by the \nrules. It does far too little for the most vulnerable and needy \nAmericans--our children, our seniors, our veterans. Unlike China, \nIndia, and other countries, it invests only a minute fraction of our \nresources in research and development. We've seen where this agenda has \nled us--it represents a stunning failure to address any of the major \nchallenges of our era, like globalization, security, stagnant incomes, \nand rising income inequality.\n  America has always been blessed with great natural resources. But in \nspite of these physical resources, our greatest strength has always \nbeen our human ones--the American spirit of ingenuity, creativity, and \nold fashioned hard work. Regrettably, the budget before this body fails \nto make the necessary investments to build and maintain the strength of \nour human capital, America's greatest asset. This may not be \nintentional; I presume that President Bush and my colleagues across the \naisle believe just as strongly in boosting our nation's economic \ncompetitiveness. But regardless of their intentions, the fact is that \nmismanagement, misplaced priorities, and misguided faith in outdated \neconomic ideologies continue to set us back.\n  On Friday of last week, an article appeared on an international news \nwire that is rather stunning in its implications for the budget \nresolution now pending before the Senate. The headline of this article, \nMr. President, reads, ``China to Boost Science, Tech Spending by Nearly \n20 Percent.'' The story continues:\n\n       ``China will increase its spending on science and \n     technology by nearly 20 percent this year in a move to remain \n     competitive in the face of international challenges, the \n     government said . . . The State Council, or cabinet, last \n     month said 2.5 percent of China's gross domestic product \n     (GDP) would be allocated to spending on research and \n     development over the next 15 years, up from 1.23 percent in \n     2002.''\n\n  ``The government,'' the article goes on to say, ``will not only \nallocate more money but also encourage all segments of society, \nincluding companies, to put emphasis on research and development \nthrough measures including tax incentives.''\n  Finally, it quotes the Minister of Science and Technology as telling \nthe National People's Congress, ``Without progress on science and \ntechnology, it would be very hard to reach our target of becoming a \nwell-off society.''\n  On one level, we as Americans should welcome the decision by \nvirtually any country to invest more in science and technology. In \nfact, if more nations were to make a similar decision, the world as a \nwhole would greatly benefit by peaceful advances in commerce and in \nfinding solutions to some of the planet's most intractable problems.\n  But this news from China should also serve as a reminder to \nAmericans, as we consider our budget priorities for the upcoming year \nand our vision for the future, of the commitment it takes to remain a \nleader in the global economy. Even with the passage of the amendment to \nincrease Labor, Health, and Human Services funds offered by Senators \nSpector and Harkin, of which I was a cosponsor, this budget regrettably \nfalls short.\n  The average American family over the last few years has been working \nharder and harder just to tread water. A household earning the median \nincome made $1,600 less in 2004 than they did 4 years earlier. \nMeanwhile, during the same period, the average family's health \ninsurance premiums have risen by $3,600, or 57 percent. Their energy \ncosts continue to rise--even though many parts of the country had \nwarmer than usual weather this winter, families can still expect to pay \nmore than $250 extra this year to heat their homes. If they have a \nchild attending a public 4-year college, that bill has gone up by 57 \npercent since 2000, as well.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this budget \nsets us\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\non a path to fiscal responsibility. But as the Senator from North \nDakota, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, has pointed out \ntime and again before this body, that is anything but the case. Instead \nof saving for the retirement of the baby boomers--which is already \nbeginning--we're borrowing like there's no tomorrow.\n  In 2000, we had a budget surplus of $128 billion; in 2006, largely as \na consequence of the fiscal recklessness of this administration and the \nmajority party in the Congress, the Federal Government is expected to \nrun a deficit of $371 billion. Under this administration, the president \nand his allies will have added $3 trillion to our national debt by the \nend of this fiscal year. That would put America's public debt at more \nthan $8.6 trillion, or around $28,000 for every man, woman, and child \nin America. Further, under the current administration, the share of \nthat debt held by foreign creditors has more than doubled.\n  And it's not just the Federal Government that's borrowing, but the \neconomy as a whole. Our personal savings rate in January was negative \n0.7 percent, the 10th consecutive month for which it was effectively \nzero or below. Our current account deficit continues to set new \nrecords; it was an unprecedented $805 billion in 2005.\n  This dramatic run-up in the debt has real costs for America's \nfamilies--both today and for future generations. It puts upward \npressure on interest rates for things like student loans, home \nmortgages, and automobile loans. It raises the cost of capital for \nbusiness investment. Rising interest rates, caused by America's growing \nindebtedness, represent a de facto tax increase on American families \nand businesses.\n  This administration's fiscal recklessness has also hurt our ability \nto address our nation's most important priorities, like education and \nhealth care, that strengthen our economic competitiveness and allow \nmore Americans to share in greater prosperity. This budget provides a \nclear illustration of this failure, with the drastic cuts it would make \nin these areas.\n  The budget proposed by the Bush administration and my colleagues \nacross the aisle would make the largest cut in our Nation's commitment \nto education in the 26-year history of the Education Department. These \ncuts will adversely affect students at all levels of learning. \nInvestment and competitiveness begin with our children. As I have said \nmany times before, education may be expensive, but ignorance costs \nmore.\n  As I noted earlier, college tuition and fees have increased 57 \npercent for a public 4-year college. They have risen 32 percent for a \nprivate 4-year college since 2000. Yet instead of helping middle class \nfamilies meet these skyrocketing college costs, this budget proposes to \nonce again freeze the maximum Pell grant award at $4,050. In 1975, a \nPell grant covered 80 percent of the cost of a public, 4-year college \neducation; today, it covers only 40 percent. Surely we can do better \nthan this for America's families. A college education should be a \ngateway to a better life for anyone willing to work for it, not just a \nprivilege for those who can afford it.\n  This budget also continues to underfund K-12 education. The president \nand my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tout their commitment \nto education in the No Child Left Behind law. But this law is \nunderfunded by $15.4 billion this year. The budget also cuts Head \nStart, afterschool programs, and child care, all of which prepare our \nchildren to learn better and help parents keep their kids in school and \noff the streets.\n  While countries like China are increasing their investments in \nscience and technology, this budget would make a commitment in these \nareas that is little more than cosmetic. President Bush has talked a \ngreat deal about his so-called ``American Competitiveness Initiative,'' \nbut under the budget he sent to the Congress, he would actually cut \noverall R funding in real terms for the first time since 1996. As a \nshare of the economy, total Federal R funding would fall below 1 \npercent for the first time since fiscal year 2003.\n  One of the casualties would be biomedical and cancer research through \nthe National Institutes of Health. Just two months ago, President Bush \nsigned into law the first cut to NIH funding since 1970. Now, he has \nproposed further cutting funding for 18 of the 19 institutes in Fiscal \n2007, including the ones conducting research on two of America's \nleading causes of death: cancer and heart disease.\n  The administration's proposals are reflected in the budget before \nthis body today, which carries the same low level of overall \ndiscretionary spending. So while countries like China are setting goals \nlike boosting R funding to 2.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product by \n2020, we have nothing but a catchy slogan and cuts in the kinds of \ninvestments we need to stay strong.\n  This budget increases costs for entrepreneurs and small businesses. \nPresident Bush likes to say that his high- income tax breaks have \nbenefited small business owners, but in reality, the distribution of \nbenefits to small business owners has followed the same pattern as it \nhas for everyone else--those with the highest incomes have received the \nmost, and everyone else has been stuck with the bill. Among Americans \nwith small business income, more than half of the benefits of the 2001 \nand 2003 tax breaks have been spent on those making more than $200,000 \na year, or less than 8 percent of all small business owners, according \nto the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. So while few \nsmall businesses have gained anything meaningful from the tax breaks, \nthe administration this year is proposing to increase their cost of \ncapital by charging a new fee for Small Business Administration loans. \nThis would be a direct tax increase on one of our most important \nengines of growth. For an administration that claims to value small \nbusiness, the record fails to live up to the rhetoric.\n  This budget fails the test of economic leadership not only by cutting \ninvestments in American competitiveness, but by abandoning our most \nbasic American values. As Americans, we proudly look out for the least \nfortunate among us. Unfortunately, this budget fails to do this. It \nasks struggling parents to work more hours, but cuts the child care \nthat helps them do it. It cuts funding for children's hospitals, like \nHartford's Connecticut Children's Medical Center in my home state. \nChildren's hospitals like CCMC train 30 percent of the Nation's \npediatricians and more than 50 percent of the nation's pediatric \nspecialists. This budget cuts food aid for senior citizens, pregnant \nwomen, and children. It cuts housing assistance and freezes funding \nthat helps homeless veterans find work.\n  By adopting this budget, the president and his allies in the Congress \nwould continue to walk away from one of America's bedrock principles: \nthat everyone in our nation should have an equal opportunity to live a \nfree and meaningful life.\n  While some of the amendments considered by this body appear on the \nsurface to rectify some of the cuts this budget would make to vital \npriorities, they in reality fail to live up to their billing. The \namendment offered by Senator McConnell, for example, claimed to support \nport security, which should be one of our nation's highest priorities. \nIt would have done so, however, through a budgetary gimmick that would \nresult in an across-the-board cut to other areas, including, \nironically, homeland security and national defense. It also would have \nprovided no new funds beyond the already specified discretionary \nspending cap. Instead, it would have offered nothing more than non-\nbinding instructions to the Appropriations Committee about how to \nallocate the funds under its jurisdiction. For this reason, I supported \nthe port security amendment offered by Senator Menendez instead of the \nMcConnell amendment. The Menendez amendment would have provided the \nfunds we need for this critical priority without making other cuts, and \ndone so in a fiscally responsible manner by shutting down tax shelters \nand closing corporate tax loopholes, measures that have already passed \nthis body on a bipartisan basis but which have not become law.\n  In the last few years, the American economy has weathered the storm \nof terrorist attacks, a downturn in the business cycle, natural \ndisasters, and war. This is a testament to the strength and resiliency \nof the American people. But I wonder how much more our Nation can take \nof mismanaged economic policies and wrong priorities; of \nunderinvestment in people, ideas, and innovation; and of an\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nagenda that increases the burden on the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety rather than lightening it, before we do irreparable harm.\n  If we want to continue to increase living standards and expand the \ncapabilities of our society so that all may benefit, we must continue \nto invest in people, ideas, and innovation. We need a budget that will \nmake our Nation stronger and more vibrant. We need more than just \ncosmetic solutions to the major challenges of our era. Above all, we \nneed our government's priorities to reflect the values of the American \npeople, like opportunity and responsibility, and the American vision of \nshared prosperity, expanding freedoms, and a just society. Regrettably, \nthe budget offered by the President and by my colleagues across the \naisle fails to accomplish these goals and fails to make the changes \nnecessary to put our Nation back on the right course.\n  Mr. President, I have filed an amendment that will restore crucial \ninvestments to support our children and families in the fiscal year \n2007 budget. I am joined on the amendment by Senators Kennedy, Clinton, \nHarkin, Mikulski, Murray, Durbin, Lieberman, Cantwell, Kerry, Salazar, \nBaucus, Schumer, Lautenberg, Kohl, and Lincoln. It is important that we \nshift priorities and resources toward young children and families, to \ncreate an environment for healthy development and to help parents give \ntheir children the best possible start in life. Children represent one-\nquarter of our population but 100 percent of our future. We must \nnurture their growth and education as they provide the human capital \nthat will determine our Nation's success in the global economy.\n  Today our families are working harder to pay for basic needs such as \nhousing, fuel, health care, and childcare. At the same time, real \nincome has decreased over the past 4 years. As a result, many hard-\nworking families are finding it more difficult to make ends meet.\n  If our Nation is going to compete with the rest of the world, we must \nprepare our children for this challenge. It is essential that we \ncultivate the potential of each and every child. How can we know who \nmay be a Nobel laureate, who may take us further into space, or who may \nbe our future President, if we do not give them all an equal chance to \nthrive?\n  We all agree that we should not burden our children and grand \nchildren with great debt. Nor should our Nation abandon their need for \nhealth care, education, and other necessities.\n  As I said earlier, the amendment focuses on crucial assistance to \nchildren and families. The amendment is very simple. It takes several \ninitiatives which have bipartisan support and restores the investments \nto a level that the Congress has already agreed to--in previous \nauthorization or spending measures.\n  This amendment would increase resources by $3.3 billion in the fiscal \nyear 2007 budget resolution for five programs: the childcare and \ndevelopment block grant by $540 million; Head Start by $520 million; \n21st Century Community Learning Centers by $1.5 billion; Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act programs by $105 million; and the \ncommunity services block grant by $650 million. In addition, it reduces \nthe Federal deficit by $3.3 billion and pays for itself by closing \ncorporate tax loopholes that were passed by the Senate in the tax \nreconciliation bill in February.\n  This amendment attempts to renew investments that have failed to keep \npace with our Nation's needs. This proposal will restore the community \nservices block grant to $650 million, the level Congress appropriated \nin fiscal year 2002; the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \ninitiatives to $200 million for the level authorized for fiscal year \n2004; and restore funding to the level of $7.2 billion for Head Start \nto keep pace with inflation and recent across-the-board cuts.\n  In addition, the amendment brings the investment in afterschool up to \n$2.5 million, the level authorized for 21st century community learning \ncenters in the No Child Left Behind Act. The childcare and development \nblock grant investment will reach a level of $2.66 billion from its \nprevious level-funding of $2.06 billion, if the amendment passes.\n  We must invest in our children and improve their lives. Each day, 12 \nmillion children ages 0 to 4 spend much of their day in out-of-home \nchild care while their parents work. In a majority of cases, having \nboth parents work is a necessity, not a choice.\n  Currently, about one in seven children who are eligible for childcare \nand development block grant--CCDBG--subsidies are receiving assistance. \nWith childcare costing between $4,000 and $10,000 a year, many families \nsimply can not afford to pay for the care they need. Average child care \nfees for a year exceed 10 percent of the median household income in \nmost States. Not only is childcare an essential support for hard-\nworking families, it is an important early education opportunity for \nchildren.\n  With respect to Head Start, only 50 percent of eligible children are \nenrolled in Head Start classes. Costs are rising for transportation, \nheating, and cooling, health insurance, and supplies. Some centers have \ncut back hours and days of service to children and let teachers go. Our \nchildren deserve a high-quality opportunity to learn and thrive through \nHead Start, and we should give more children that chance.\n  As they struggle to reach their own potential and achieve financial \nstability, working families require support. Community services block \ngrant initiatives serve 15 million individuals, 6 million families and \n3.7 million children. Forty-four percent of those receiving funds are \ngainfully employed, but they may still have trouble affording the cost \nof heating their home, putting food on the table, or sending their \nchildren to a quality childcare program. While each Federal dollar \nspent leverages more than $5 in State, local and private funding, the \nFederal investment is still essential to helping hard-working people \nget ahead.\n  At the very least, we must keep children from harm. Each year, nearly \n3 million cases of child abuse and neglect are reported, and nearly 1 \nmillion of these cases are substantiated. States lack the resources \nnecessary to investigate suspected cases, to protect children, and to \nprevent abuse and neglect from occurring. The Child Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act--CAPTA--helps communities maintain and expand efforts \nto improve children's lives. The amendment seeks to increase this \nimportant investment.\n  All of our children and families deserve a fair start. We know that \ninvestments in children pay dividends later in life. But it takes \nfinancial commitment and an understanding that we cannot waste a day of \na child's life, leaving that child to play catchup later.\n  Families are asking for our help. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nheeding their call and supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every year the Senate considers a budget \nresolution that sets forth the blueprint for the Government's spending \nand revenues. Unfortunately, the budget we are considering this year \ncontinues the administration's policies that have led to the deepest \ndeficits and debt in American history. It also reflects the wrong \npriorities by cutting important programs like education and Medicare to \nfund large tax cuts which mostly benefit the richest among us.\n  The result of these irresponsible fiscal policies is that we are \npassing on a huge burden to our children and grandchildren and \nthreatening our economic security. Our Nation is currently $8.2 \ntrillion in debt--that's over $27,000 per person--and this astounding \nnumber is only getting worse. Earlier today the Senate voted to raise \nthe Federal debt limit for the fourth time in 5 years, meaning we've \nincreased our debt by $3 trillion since 2002. A sensible budget \nresolution would try to curb this unsustainable trend; unfortunately, \nthis budget moves in the wrong direction. Under this budget, the \nnational debt would grow to $11.8 trillion in the next 5 years.\n  Continued deficits will mean rising long-term interest rates and \nslower economic growth. Continued deficits will make it more expensive \nto buy a house, pay for college, or pay off credit card debt. Alan \nGreenspan recently warned that, if left unchecked, deficits ``would \ncause the economy to stagnate or worse.'' Continued deficits will also \nmean the continued use of the Social Security Trust Fund to cover the \nfunding shortfalls.\n  Instead of changing course, however, this budget proposes to make the \nadministration's tax cuts permanent.\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nOver 10 years, the cost of making tax cuts permanent would be \napproximately $2.8 trillion, or $3.3 trillion when the added interest \npayments on the debt are included. Although the cost of the President's \ntax breaks are as large as the entire budgets of the Departments of \nAgriculture, Labor, Education, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, \nJustice, Interior, Energy, State, HUD, and EPA combined, his budget \ncuts critical programs which are a small percentage of the deficit \nproblems his tax breaks create.\n  On a positive note, I was able to get an amendment included in this \nbudget to provide $140 million to the Advanced Technology Program to \nsupport cost-shared industry-led research and development of cutting-\nedge high risk technology with broad commercial potential and societal \nbenefits. America has lost nearly 2.8 million manufacturing jobs since \nJanuary 2001. We should be doing all we can to promote programs that \nhelp create jobs and strengthen the technological innovation of \nAmerican companies and produce the systems that are defending our \nnational security.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate agreed to my amendment to add $6 \nmillion to the budget for the establishment of new Northern Border Air \nWing sites. Northern Border Air Wings have been operational in New York \nand Washington since 2004 and I look forward to the opening of \nadditional sites in Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana in the coming \nyears. These sites will help improve critical air and marine \ninterdiction capabilities along our Northern Border.\n  I am also pleased that the budget includes an important amendment \nthat Senator Stabenow and I offered that will improve inspections of \ntrash trucks entering the U.S. from Canada. These trucks pose a threat \nto our security and the environment, and this amendment is a critical \nstep towards reducing these risks.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment to the budget \nresolution to fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP, at its full authorized level of $5.1 billion. This amendment \nwould increase the LIHEAP funding for 2007 by $3.318 billion and offset \nthe increased spending by closing corporate tax loopholes. The Senate \nhas voted on five previous occasions to support full funding for the \nLIHEAP program, and I hope that this time the conferees on the budget \nresolution will retain this amendment. Full funding for LIHEAP will \nensure that States are able to serve more people in need of assistance \nduring both the cold winter months.\n  While there are certainly some positive inclusions in this budget \npackage, it is entirely too fiscally irresponsible and short-changes \ntoo many important programs for me to vote to support it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I have serious reservations about this \nbudget and will vote against it.\n  At their best, budgets ought to embody discipline, vision, and \naccuracy. Not so for this budget. While it claims fiscal discipline, \nthat claim is belied in the budget's bloated bottom line. While it \nclaims strategic vision, that vision is a blurred blend of wasted \ndollars, missed opportunities, and neglected priorities. While it \nclaims financial accuracy, that accuracy is of the quality found in an \nEnron balance sheet.\n  The tax portion of the budget resolution is remarkable, not for what \nit contains, but for what it omits. It fails to account for the \nexpiration of alternative minimum tax relief at the end of 2006. The \nAMT currently captures approximately 4 million, mostly middle-class, \nfamilies and individuals in its high tax trap--a trap meant to catch \nonly high-income taxpayers who take advantage of complicated loopholes \nto avoid paying their fair share. That number would swell to more than \n34 million people in 2011 under this budget.\n  Instead of AMT reform, this budget contains $228 million to \naccommodate tax cuts that were included in the House and Senate passed \nreconciliation bills currently in conference. I voted against the \nSenate tax reconciliation bill because I could not support unnecessary \ntax cut extensions at a time of burgeoning deficits. The deficits are \nstill burgeoning, and I still oppose those unneeded and unjustified tax \nbreaks for our highest income taxpayers.\n  The budget's generosity to high-income taxpayers is offset by its \nmiserly treatment of our Nation's educational system. The budget \nproposes the largest cut to federal education funding in the 26-year \nhistory of the Education Department. Students, educators, parents, and \nadministrators all lose out. Under this budget, funding for No Child \nLeft Behind and special education will still fall far short of their \nauthorized levels. The same holds for Career and Technical Education, \nSafe and Drug Free Schools, and TRIO programs. I commend Senators \nSpecter and Harkin for their successful amendment to restore some of \nthese deeps cuts, and hope their provision will survive conference with \nthe House.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am also \ntroubled that some of the most painful cuts in this budget would fall \non important programs at the Administration on Aging. The meager \nfunding levels in this budget would put Meals on Wheels and Family \nCaregiver Support Services on the chopping block. That means that, \nwhile Wisconsin's senior population continues to grow from 705,000 \nsenior citizens in 2000 to 730,000 seniors this year, and is projected \nto grow to 1.2 million seniors by 2025, this budget will not keep pace \nwith needed services in Wisconsin or any other State.\n  Funding for geriatric health professions is also likely to suffer. \nTitle VII funding for geriatrics training is the only Federal program \nthat specifically develops academic geriatricians at a time when more \nare needed. In prior years, Congress has demonstrated its strong \nsupport for the program through continued and increased appropriations \nover the past five years, including $31.5 million in fiscal year 2005. \nI was disappointed that the fiscal year 2006 Labor, HHS bill eliminated \nthis program, and I am even more concerned that the budget before us \nmakes it difficult, if not impossible to restore it in fiscal year \n2007. Delegates to the recent White House Conference on Aging ranked \nincreased training in geriatrics among their top ten resolutions at the \nonce in a decade meeting in December of 2005. Clearly, this budget does \nnot adequately prepare for our aging population.\n  Nowhere is that more clear than in the budget resolution's \ntreatment--or lack thereof--of the Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nDuring consideration of this budget, many of us worked to improve that \nbenefit. The launch of the drug benefit has been confusing and \ncomplicated for too many seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare \nbeneficiaries who do not choose a plan by the May 15 deadline and \nenroll at a later date will face a substantial and permanent penalty. I \ncosponsored an amendment to extend the enrollment period through all of \n2006 to give people additional time to make the best plan choice for \nthem. This amendment would have also allowed a one-time change in plan \nenrollment at any point in 2006.\n  Enrolling in drug plans has been challenging and confusing for too \nmany beneficiaries, and it makes sense to give them a chance to correct \nan initial mistake made during this difficult first year of \nimplementation. Unfortunately, our amendment failed by one vote and the \nSenate instead gave Medicare managers discretionary authority to decide \nto extend the enrollment deadline for the drug benefit. While I voted \nfor that amendment because I believe it is important to send a strong \nsignal, I am concerned by recent comments made by the President and \nMedicare officials. Those comments clearly show their resistance to \ngiving seniors more time to make a careful decision about what drug \nplan they will be locked into for the remainder of the year.\n  In addition, under current law, prescription drug plans can change \nthe drugs they cover as many times as they want--while seniors are \nprohibited from changing drug plans except during the annual open \nenrollment period. This means that after seniors complete their \nresearch and choose the drug plan they believe is the best plan for \ntheir needs, they have no guarantee that their drugs will continue to \nbe covered all year. That is why I cosponsored an amendment that would \nprohibit Medicare prescription drug plans from removing a drug from \ntheir approved list until the beginning of each plan year. This would \nensure that seniors will not lose coverage of the drugs\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nthey take without being allowed to also change their plan.\n  Finally, one of the most troublesome features of the new law is that \nit prohibits the Government from utilizing the tremendous purchasing \npower of the Medicare program to reduce prices. I cosponsored an \namendment to repeal this provision and allow the Federal Government to \nnegotiate directly with drug companies for lower drug prices for \nseniors. I am pleased the amendment passed and I hope this provision \nwill remain in the final resolution.\n  The budget was also improved by an amendment, of which I was an \noriginal sponsor, on the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, \nMEP. The amendment, which was unanimously accepted, would fund the MEP \nat $106 million for fiscal year 2007. I am a long-time supporter of the \nMEP program and believe manufacturing is crucial to the U.S. economy. \nBy offering resources, including organized workshops and consulting \nprojects, to manufacturers, MEP allows them to streamline operations, \nintegrate new technologies, shorten production times, and lower costs. \nAt a time when we want to increase economic activity and strengthen the \nmanufacturing base of our nation, the MEP is a fiscally sound \ninvestment.\n  I am similarly pleased that this budget was amended to include \nadequate funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I \nvoted to include $5.1 billion in order to fund this valuable program at \nits fully authorized level. Just a few months ago the Congress passed \nan energy bill, which I supported, which funded LIHEAP at $5.1 billion. \nThis was a sorely needed update to a program where the funding has been \nfrozen at an inadequate amount for years. There was bipartisan support \nfor the Energy Bill, and I am pleased the Congress met the commitment \nwe made in that bill.\n  But even those improvements--important as they are to me--fail to \nmake up for one of the central and most disturbing inadequacies of this \nbudget. This budget simply fails to provide adequate resources to take \ncare of our returning troops. Once again the President's budget \nrequires the Veterans Administration to charge veterans an enrollment \nfee and increases the co-payments for veterans receiving medical care \nthrough the VA system. These charges add insult to injury when veterans \nare also being forced to wait for months before they are able to see a \ndoctor at the local VA hospital. Senator Akaka's amendment tried to \nremedy this situation by adding an additional $1.5 billion to the \nbudget, but his responsible approach was rejected.\n  We face unprecedented challenges in our Nation today. War and \nterrorism demand our resources and attention. An aging population \nstruggles to find the money to educate the next generation while \nbattling sky high health care costs. Our powerful economy fights to \ncreate high quality jobs in a world market of constant technological \ninnovation and fierce international competition.\n  We need a budget that that sees and meets these challenges clearly--\nvision. We need a budget that faces the difficult realities of our \nworld today with honest proposals and precise numbers--accuracy. And we \nneed a budget that does what we should and must and no more--\ndiscipline. We have a budget that does none of that, and so I will vote \n``no.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3116\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, some of my colleagues may be \nsurprised to learn--like I was--that some agencies are skimming off the \ntop a portion of some of the congressional appropriations and keeping \nthat money in that agency.\n  My amendment is simple. It says: If it has been determined that a \nconstituency warrants a direct appropriation--one that has gone through \nthe scrutinizing process and is supported by the House, Senate and then \nsigned into law--then that constituency should receive the full amount.\n  Bureaucrats at the agencies should not be unilaterally determining \nthat some sort of ``surcharge'' should be assessed to these projects. \nIt amounts to a tax on our constituents. And it usurps the authority of \nCongress by circumventing the legislative process and giving nameless \nfaceless bureaucrats the authority to alter legislation after it is \nsigned into law.\n  And in the case where our constituents determine that the full amount \nof the earmark is not needed and turns back some of the funding to the \ngovernment--this amendment says that instead of going to bureaucrats in \nthe agencies to spend as they wish--it should instead go towards \ndeficit reduction.\n  I offer this amendment because long before some started discussing \nconcerns about the appropriations process, I identified--with the \nassistance of the Congressional Research Service--and have made an \neffort to investigate this practice of skimming from Congressional \nappropriations. Let's just say our efforts thus far have been less than \nsuccessful: almost half of the agencies that have been contacted for \ninformation have not bothered to respond.\n  Each year, I invite Nebraskans--including community officials and \nnonprofit groups--to propose investments that help ensure some of their \ntax dollars are returned to the state. I am often approached by \nNebraskans seeking help with a project that has been identified as a \npriority by local officials or others in the community. I support these \ndirect investments only after they have been proposed by Nebraskans and \nbeen subjected to reviews to ensure they are both necessary and \nresponsible.\n  In the absence of a full accounting of how the agencies handle this \npractice, I am working with the information that has thus far been \nshared with me. I plan to continue my efforts to seek out information \non this practice by the agencies. I can assure this body that as the \nbudget process moves forward this year, I will continue in my efforts \nto crack down on this practice by agencies to skim some off some of \nthese funds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this budget. This \nadministration has chosen to continue down an unsustainable economic \npath. They have put forth an irresponsible budget that does not take \nconstructive steps toward righting our Nation's fiscal course. I \nstrongly urge my Senate colleagues not to follow suit.\n  Our Nation is going in the wrong direction. The signals grow more \nevident each day.\n  Deficits are at record levels. The debt is reaching astronomic \nheights. And we have fewer resources available for important domestic \nprograms.\n  Under President Clinton, we had 4 years of budget surplus. And, when \nhe left office, we had a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion.\n  But the economic policies of the past 5 years have produced a \ncatastrophic turnaround. Record budget surpluses have given way to \nrecord deficits--projected at $1.6 trillion over the next decade. And \nthe debt is projected to exceed $11 trillion.\n  This budget resolution assumes that the deficit will decline from \n$359 billion in FY 2007 to $177 billion in FY 2011. Unfortunately, \nthese numbers don't tell the whole story.\n  This is a 5-year budget. This clouds the full impact of the \nadministration's policies. The debt and deficit are set to explode in \nthe out years--the end of the 10-year window. And, this does not even \ninclude the costs of ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan beyond 2007 and reforming the alternative minimum tax \nbeyond 2006.\n  When all costs are included, this budget proposal will contribute \n$1.14 trillion to the Federal budget deficit over the next 5 years.\n  In this year alone, our national debt is slated to increase by $654 \nbillion. This is a far cry from the President's goals for deficit \nreduction, and deeply troubling to those who value fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  As a result, we are now again confronted with raising the nation's \ndebt limit. The increase--from $8.2 trillion to roughly $9 trillion--\nwill be the fourth major hike in the last 5 years.\n  In 2000, our national debt was at $5.8 trillion. Today, this figure \nstands at $8.27 trillion. And, at this rate, with all costs included, \ndebt will more than double to $12 trillion in 2011.\n  Additionally, more and more of our debt is being held in foreign \nhands. We now owe Japan $685 billion and China over $250 billion. It \ntook 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of foreign held \ndebt. In only 5 years, President Bush has more than doubled that \namount.\n  Contrast this with the last 3 years of the Clinton administration, \nwhere we\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\npaid off more than $200 billion in debt to foreign countries.\n  These staggering figures represent a great burden for future \ngenerations who will have to pay the bill. They also keep interest \nrates high, limit economic growth, and slow job creation.\n  This President has the worst record of private sector job growth \nsince Herbert Hoover. And the jobs that are created are largely minimum \nwage and temporary work. Americans are working harder, for less money. \nAverage household income for working families decreased by $1,669 \nbetween 2000 and 2005, when adjusted for inflation.\n  By almost every indicator, American families are facing tough times: \nHousing affordability, a big problem in California, is at a 14-year \nlow; Health care costs are up 50 percent since 2000; Gas prices are up \n60 percent; College costs at public universities are up 57 percent; 45 \nmillion people are going without health care, including 6.6 million in \nCalifornia; and 37 million Americans are living in poverty, a number \nthat has increased each year under this administration, U.S. Census \nBureau.\n  You'd think that this budget would attempt to provide relief for most \nAmericans. Instead middle-class families are asked to do more with \nless.\n  At the same time, the President is proposing to make tax breaks \npermanent for the wealthiest Americans--at a cost of $1.3 trillion over \nthe next decade. And, when you combine the cost of the tax cuts with \ncosts of war in Iraq--currently totaling $370 billion--the inevitable \nresult is that critical domestic programs are squeezed.\n  The budget before the Senate today reflects these constraints by: \nCutting food stamps, by $272 million; Cutting food assistance for \nseniors and children, by $111 million; Reducing the effectiveness of \nour police officers in cutting COPS by more than $407 million, 15,000 \nofficers nationwide; Cutting $244 million from firefighter grants; \nFailing to reimburse state and local governments for the Federal \nresponsibilities in paying for the incarceration of illegal immigrants; \nCutting funding for 18 of the 19 National Institutes of Health, \nincluding those conducting research on cancer and heart disease; And, \nNo Child Left Behind, the President's signature education program, \nwould be underfunded this year by more than $15 billion and $55.78 \nbillion since it was enacted.\n  These are vital priorities that must be funded.\n  Because of record federal deficits and debt, money that could have \nbeen available for education, healthcare, defense, infrastructure, job \ndevelopment, and homeland security, must now go to interest payments.\n  In 2006, interest costs alone on the national debt will total nearly \n$400 billion. And, this figure will grow to nearly $600 billion over \nthe next 5 years. Total non-defense discretionary spending--$416 \nbillion in this budget--is only modestly larger than this interest \npayment.\n  This could have been prevented.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that last year, economic \nproblems caused only about 8 percent of the deficit. The rest resulted \nfrom policy choices by Congress and this administration--largely tax \ncuts for the wealthiest among us.\n  The time has come to chart a different course, and make the tough \nchoices that the President and this resolution avoid.\n  We must adopt a balanced approach to both taxes and spending and \nreturn to a program of fiscal sanity.\n  When I first came to the Senate, over a decade ago, a small, \nbipartisan group decided to get our fiscal house in order. Democrats \nworked to bring spending under control. And Republicans pledged not to \npush for additional tax cuts.\n  I have no problem holding the line on spending, but believe that it \nmust be done in the context of a more responsible approach to tax \npolicy.\n  We must consider rolling back the tax cut for the wealthiest \nAmericans, to bring the income tax rate from its current 35 percent \nback to 38.6 percent.\n  This will affect those earning more than $312,000 per year--less than \none percent of taxpayers--but will save nearly $130 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  Finally, we need to work together to begin addressing some of the \ndeeper structural problems with Social Security and Medicare--before \nthese programs fall into crisis.\n  These are not easy answers. But, we must change the direction in \nwhich this nation is moving. We cannot afford to continue down this \npath of fiscal irresponsibility. Americans work hard to balance their \ncheckbooks and live within their budgets. They deserve a Government \nwilling to do the same.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I cannot support this budget resolution. It \nclosely mirrors the President's budget which projects the largest \ndeficit in history for 2006 $423 billion. We are on an unsustainable \npath. We cannot continue year after year to pass budget resolutions \nthat increase the deficit, rather than put us on a course of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Not only should we be concerned about growing deficits, we should be \nconcerned about the debt. Under this budget, the deficit will increase \nto $371 billion for 2006, and the debt will increase by $654 billion a \nyear. The Senate has just passed a $781 billion increase in the debt \nceiling, the fourth largest debt limit increase in our Nation's \nhistory. This is the fourth time that the Bush administration has \nrequested an increase in the debt. These increases now total $3 \ntrillion.\n  The service on the debt alone for this year is $220 billion. This \nmoney could be put to better use. With the approaching retirement of \nthe baby boomers, we should not be increasing the debt.\n  The budget being debated today is not based in reality. It leaves out \nthe full 10 year numbers. Without these numbers, the budget hides the \nfull cost of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. The budget \ndoes not include funding for the ongoing war costs beyond 2007. Relief \nfrom the individual alternative minimum tax, AMT, is only addressed for \n2006. It does not include the President's Social Security privatization \nproposal.\n  This budget is incomplete. If the missing items were added back, the \ndebt would increase every year by more than $600 billion. The deficit \nand debt will continue to explode because the budget will continue a \ncourse of spending more than the amount of revenue raised.\n  It is not right to vote on budget that is incomplete. In his budget, \nthe President only chose to address the AMT for 1 year--2006--and chose \nnot to address it for the current budget year. The administration's \nbudget deliberately leaves out a more permanent solution for the AMT \nfor two reasons: first, the AMT would add additional costs to the \nbudget; and second, the AMT masks the true costs of the 2001 and 2003 \ntax cuts.\n  This budget resolution follows the administration's lead. It chooses \nto only address the AMT for 2006 and to extend tax provisions that do \nnot expire until the end of 2010. The budget does not address the 23 \nmillion families that will be impacted by the AMT in 2007, but the \nbudget makes sure that the tax cuts that are skewed to those making \nmore than $1 million are extended through 2011.\n  This budget continues the repeated pattern of choosing tax cuts for \nthe wealthy rather than investing in our future. The tax cuts going to \nthose who on average earn over $1 million a year cost $41 billion for a \nsingle year. In contrast, the President's budget cuts education by $2.2 \nbillion--the biggest cut ever for education. This budget shortchanges \nveterans. There are reductions in law enforcement, firefighter grants, \nand essential air services. These are just a few of the many examples \nhow the budget's priorities are misguided.\n  The budget does not adequately address healthcare. Access to quality, \naffordable health care continues to be a challenge for most Americans \nand the Bush budget only exacerbates the problems. And what about the \nuninsured? There is nothing in this budget to help them. Sure, there \nare some recycled, stale proposals the administration has been trying \nto advance for 5 years now but nothing really new. Nothing that will \nhelp any families gain access to coverage that is quality, affordable, \ncomprehensive care. It's high time we have a real debate and discussion \nin the Congress on real reforms necessary to address the health needs \nof our nation.\n  The budget resolution assumes the deep cuts and unprecedented fees \nfor the Small Business Administration, SBA. The administration's \nrequest of\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\n$624 million is insufficient to meet the needs of small businesses in \nthis country that need access to capital, counseling and Federal \ncontracts. By the SBA's own calculation, the request is $18 million \nless than what was available to the Agency last year when congressional \ninitiatives and disaster supplemental appropriations are excluded.\n  I proposed an amendment to increase the funding shortfall by $151 \nmillion and it was offset by closing abusive corporate tax loopholes. \nUnfortunately, this amendment did not garner bipartisan support. \nHowever, we were able to reach a bipartisan agreement that would \nincrease SBA funding by $130 million.\n  This budget is another example of how the Republican controlled \nCongress continues to misuse the reconciliation process. The \nreconciliation process was designed to make it easier to pass difficult \nlegislation that would provide fiscal discipline. It is now being used \nto ram through tax cuts and pet priorities that do not have the support \nof 60 Senators.\n  I am vigorously opposed to the inclusion in the budget of assumed \nrevenues and a reconciliation instruction for the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee linked to opening the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge to oil and gas leasing and development. I object to the \ninclusion of drilling in the refuge for two primary reasons. First, it \nis irresponsible to base our budget on the highly speculative \nprojection of lease revenues from the Coastal Plain. Second, I oppose \nusing the reconciliation process to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling \nbecause it would limit consideration of this highly controversial \nissue.\n  The reconciliation process is being used to address only one Senate \ncommittee's jurisdiction, and is clearly intended to authorize oil and \ngas leasing in the Arctic Refuge. This underscores that the real \nobjective of the process is not deficit reduction, but rather to \ncircumvent normal Senate process and procedure with respect to this \ncontroversial subject.\n  On the whole this budget reflects no new ideas and recycles bad \npolicies. This budget fails to address reality, and I therefore cannot \nsupport it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I filed an amendment that would \nincrease funding for basic research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, and restore cuts made under the President's budget to critical \nR programs. It would have been fully offset by closing tax loopholes. \nBut I faced opposition from my Republican colleagues and it was not \naccepted.\n  This budget and the President's American Competitiveness Initiative \nmake no new serious commitments to invest in R The President would \nhave you believe that he is increasing our investment in R when it \nbarely keeps pace with projected inflation. To fund the increases at \nthe National Science Foundation and other increases, every other R \nagency will see real cuts for the next 5 years. It just creates winners \nand losers.\n  In fact, this budget keeps our R investment stagnant--it has \nalready flat-lined at 1.1 percent of our GDP.\n  If America is going to compete and win in the global economy, we must \ninnovate and support basic research in all areas. We want the new \ninventions and new technologies and new cures to be made in the U.S.A. \nAnd that means supporting the basic research that is the foundation of \nnew discoveries that will create the good jobs of the future.\n  But this budget cuts funding for basic research. The National Academy \nof Sciences, the Council on Competitiveness, and Nobel prize winners \nlike American physicist Steven Chu say that is wrong for America's \nfuture.\n  When Dr. Chu testified before the Senate last year, he said ``There \nare growing signs that all is not well . . . We call for an increased \nfederal investment in long-term, basic research.''\n  The Internet, the laser, MRIs, and the mapping of the human genome \nall came about from basic research at DOD, NIH, and other Federal \nagencies. Think of the millions of jobs that these innovations have \ncreated.\n  I intend to continue my efforts in the Senate to ensure that American \ninnovation will continue. It is critical to our growth and our future \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment to \nthe fiscal year 2007 budget resolution, which would have provided \nimmediately for a $4,500 Pell grant for needy students. My amendment \nwould have redirected the savings generated by the HELP Committee as \npart of reconciliation back to student aid, as originally intended and \npassed by the committee and the full Senate.\n  Last year, through Chairman Enzi's leadership, the HELP Committee \ndrafted a bipartisan Higher Education Act reauthorization and \nreconciliation instructions. The committee was instructed to find \nsavings of $13.7 billion--$7 billion of which was to be generated from \neducation programs. The committee developed reconciliation instructions \nthat included savings of over $20 billion. As a member of the HELP \nCommittee, I can say that we purposely generated additional savings \nwith the intent that a portion of the savings would be returned to \nstudents in the form of grant aid.\n  Accordingly, the committee created two programs for Pell-eligible \nstudents. We allocated $2.25 billion for SMART grants to target aid to \nstudents who study math, science or a critical foreign language. We \nalso allocated $6 billion to the Provisional Grant Assistance Program, \nor ProGAP. These increases in the Pell grant program are critical, \ngiven that tuition has increased rapidly.\n  This year alone, tuition rose by 7.1 percent at public colleges and \n5.9 percent at private universities. Yet students and families have \nseen no growth in the Pell grant program in the past 4 years; the \nmaximum Pell award has been stagnant at $4,050 since fiscal year 2003. \nProGAP would have immediately provided current Pell recipients with a \n$4,500 maximum grant.\n  However, when the Deficit Reduction Act returned to the Senate from \nconference with the House, ProGAP had been eliminated and was replaced \nby Academic Competitiveness grants. The majority will claim to have \nincreased grant aid for needy students through Academic Competitiveness \nand SMART grants.\n  However, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that less than \n10 percent of Pell-eligible students will be able to take advantage of \nthe Academic Competitiveness and SMART grants in 2006. The percent of \neligible students rises slowly, from 10.3 percent in 2007 to a paltry \n13.5 percent in 2010. Given the existence of both Academic \nCompetitiveness and SMART grants in the conference bill, adopting my \namendment would have allowed us to help both needy Pell students and \ntarget math and science programs.\n  The intention of the committee was for the savings generated from \nchanges to the student loan programs go towards deficit reduction and \nstudent aid. Not only did the final bill significantly reduce the aid \ngoing to students, the savings are clearly going for tax cuts that will \nnot help the families we sought to help in the bill we passed in the \nSenate. In fact, even with the savings generated through the Deficit \nReduction Act, the tax cuts cost more than the savings we generated. \nThe newest tax cuts yet again result in an increase to the deficit.\n  Currently only one-third of the U.S. workforce has a postsecondary \neducation, but it is estimated that 60 percent of new jobs in the 21st \ncentury will require a college education. Workers who have attended \ncollege on average have higher incomes and lower rates of unemployment \nthan those who don't. And those with a college education also are more \nlikely to have jobs with benefits like health care, retirement and \npensions plans.\n  My amendment would have restored our original intent of the Senate by \nredirecting the savings generated by the HELP Committee into the \npockets of needy students, not the pockets of the wealthy benefiting \nfrom the tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, I withdrew my amendment after we had a huge victory \nfor education--the overwhelming passage of the Specter-Harkin amendment \nwhich would provide $7 billion in increased funding to health and \neducation programs. As an appropriator, I know first hand how critical \nthat funding will be for education programs in fiscal year 2007. But we \nmust all fight to retain that funding when the budget resolution is \nconferenced with the House. We should not accept a final budget \nresolution that does not contain the funding provided through the \nSpecter-Harkin amendment.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n  While I withdrew my amendment today, I will continue to fight for \nincreasing Pell grants and student aid. We can do better than level \nfunding for our nation's needy college students.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as many of you know, I am co-chair of the \nSenate Rural Health Caucus and have worked on rural hospital and \nprovider equity issues for a long time. Of course, the Senate does not \nalways agree on every issue especially when it comes to health care. \nOver the years, however, the Rural Health Caucus has proved to be a \nbipartisan forum for Members on both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether and work on real solutions to help rural Americans have access \nto the same affordable, quality health care services as folks living in \nurban areas.\n  There are now over 80 members of the Rural Health Caucus, and \ntogether we remain committed to making sure the unique health care \nneeds of rural and frontier areas are met. We all shared the success of \npassing landmark rural Medicare equity provisions in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. This legislation included the most \ncomprehensive attempt to put rural providers on a level playing field \nwith their urban counterparts. Clearly, this was a significant victory, \nbut there is much more still to do.\n  As most of you know, the President's fiscal year 2007 budget \neliminated or severely reduced several effective and efficient rural \nhealth programs. Now, I have long believed that we need to hold Federal \nagencies and programs accountable for the taxpayer dollars they spend. \nI also believe the Federal Government cannot be all things to all \npeople. Congress must take the necessary, and often difficult, steps to \nensure we put this country on a solid path toward reducing the deficit. \nOf course, we all have different ideas on how to achieve that goal. I \nagree with Chairman Gregg that we can start by slowing--and in some \ncases--eliminating wasteful spending. The budget before us focuses, \nprimarily, on cutting spending and encouraging growth. If programs are \nnot meeting their intended purpose, or are not performing well, then it \nis fair to look at eliminating the program. Many of the programs \nCongress funds are duplicative in nature. We have a responsibility to \nidentify reasonable ways to root out waste, streamline program creating \nand spending, and manage our limited resources so that we can serve \nfolks better.\n  While it is important to identify and eliminate wasteful and \ninefficient programs, I also believe that we must support government \npolicies that work. Rural health care programs operate on a shoestring \nbudget. Current spending for all rural health discretionary programs is \nrelatively small, but it plays a critical role in solidifying the \nfragile health care infrastructure common in rural communities. There \nare several important rural health programs such as: rural hospital \nflexibility grants, rural outreach program, trauma care, small hospital \nimprovement program, health professions training, and rural access to \nemergency devices which all play a key role in delivering services to \nour medically underserved rural areas. The importance of these programs \nshould not be undervalued. They meet our unique rural health needs by \nimproving emergency medical service networks, developing chronic \ndisease management programs, implementing quality improvement \ninitiatives, and helping small rural hospitals unable to keep their \ndoors open convert to Critical Access Hospital, CAH, status.\n  In Wyoming, rural health programs have made a real difference in the \nquality, access, and affordability of care available in our frontier \ncommunities. That is why I am extremely pleased to see the budget \nbefore us today assumes a $235 million increase for the Health \nResources and Services Administration, HRSA, over the President's \nrequest. Chairman Gregg's mark clearly states this $235 million \nincrease is primarily intended to support rural health programs. I want \nto take this opportunity to thank Chairman Gregg for his hard work and \nsupport of this important issue. These increases will go a long way \ntoward helping rural hospitals and providers deliver essential health \ncare services to many remote and medically underserved areas.\n  I also want to especially thank my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, for consistently partnering with me to ensure fair and \nequitable rural health treatment in the budget process.\n  I now look forward to working with all members of the Senate Rural \nHealth Caucus as we fight to ensure adequate funding for rural health \nprograms during the fiscal year 2007 appropriations process.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, to speak out against the \nadministration's proposal to fund the Secure Rural Schools Program with \na fire sale of our public land. It is vital to rural Montana and rural \nAmerica that we reauthorize and fully fund the Secure Rural Schools \nProgram, but we should not do it by putting a ``for sale'' sign on our \nprime hunting and fishing lands.\n  The administration's padlock proposal to sell public lands to \nreauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Program sells rural America short. \nMontana and Oregon like many other States are outdoors States. We hunt. \nWe fish. We take our kids hiking and camping. Our public lands are part \nof our recreational heritage as Americans. We should be increasing \naccess for hunters and anglers, not putting more padlocks on more \ngates.\n  The administration's land grab proposal is bad for sportsmen, an it \nis bad for our schools. Back in 2000, I was proud to be a cosponsor of \nSenator Wyden and Senator Craig's secure rural schools bill. The Secure \nRural Schools Act has given counties more money, more certainty, and \nmore flexibility. I would call that a pretty good solution. We should \nnot be abandoning 6 years of success. It is vital to our rural \ncommunities that we reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Act, and I \nwill fight tooth and nail with Senator Wyden to protect our public \nlands, reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools Act, and stop the \nadministration's misguided land grab.\n  Mr. WYDEN, Mr. President, I am in full agreement with my friend and \ncolleague from Montana. The idea to sell public lands to fund the \nsecure rural schools reauthorization is a fundamentally flawed one. It \npushes the debate over public lands and forestry back into the \npolitical briar patch despite the power of the legislation to bring \ntraditional enemies together all across rural America in over 40 States \nand over 700 counties. It is because of the good work by my friend from \nMontana that this faulty idea is not assumed as part of this budget we \ndebate today.\n  As Senator Baucus and I continue our exhaustive search in the next \nweeks for offsets to pay for the reauthorization of the county payments \nlegislation, he and I will continue our work to defeat the ill-\nconceived and divisive idea of selling off public lands to pay for the \ncontinuation of such a collaborative and locally successful program. \nFrom his position as the ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, on which I am privileged to serve with him, I feel sure that \nhe will come up with the winning solution to offset the costs of \nreauthorizing this vital national program.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, last year when the Senate was considering \nthe national intelligence reform bill, we adopted several \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  One of those recommendations was to hire an additional 2,000 new \nCustom and border protection agents each year for the next 5 years. \nThis body agreed with the recommendation. We agreed that our national \nsecurity depended on such an investment, and we enacted that \nrecommendation into law.\n  We are now considering a budget resolution that will determine \nwhether Congress will keep the promise we made to the American people \nto protect our Nation's borders. There are many provisions in this \nbudget that demonstrate a commitment to border security. I thank and \ncongratulate Chairman Gregg for those provisions. But the budget that \nwas reported out of committee includes funding for only 1,500 new \nagents in the coming year.\n  My amendment would provide $153 million to ensure that we hire 2,000 \nnew agents next year. This amendment is fully offset. Let's face it--\nthe threat of illegal border crossing by people who wish to kill us is \nvery real. In order to prevent another terrorist attack on American \nsoil, we must improve every aspect of our Nation's security. Our \nsecurity is truly only as strong as our weakest link.\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\n  For too long, the lack of funding for border agents has been a weak \nlink. By funding additional agents, we protect both our southern and \nour often neglected northern border. This will make it harder for \nterrorists to enter the United States and attack us.\n  There have been several news reports recently that I want to bring to \nmy colleagues' attention.\n  Last year, intelligence officials confirmed that the terrorist, \nZarqawi, plans to infiltrate America through our borders. He plans to \nattack targets such as movie theaters, restaurants, and schools. My \namendment commits the resources to make sure that this does not happen.\n  Just last summer, in Detroit, a Lebanese national named Mahmoud \nYoussef Kourani, who was in the United States illegally, pled guilty in \nFederal court to conspiring to raise money for a recognized terrorist \ngroup. He was in the United States raising money to fund terrorists. \nThat is outrageous. But what is equally outrageous is how he came into \nthe United States in the first place.\n  Kourani took advantage of our porous border. Kourani paid a Mexican \nconsular official in Beirut $3,000 for a visa to enter Mexico. Once in \nMexico, he snuck across the U.S.-Mexican border in 2001 and settled in \nMichigan.\n  According to Federal prosecutors, Kourani and another member of his \nfamily are heavily involved with the same group that killed 214 marines \nin Beirut in 1983 and which is also responsible for bombing two U.S. \nEmbassies.\n  While in the United States, Kourani also helped harbor other illegal \nimmigrants. Thankfully, he was prosecuted before he could inflict any \ndirect harm on any American.\n  Given how easy it is for people like Kourani to enter the United \nStates, I believe that my amendment is imperative to our national \nsecurity.\n  My amendment does not require any additional spending. It is \ncompletely offset. This amendment is paid for.\n  Homeland Security spending must be based on priorities. The fact that \nterrorists would use our borders to gain access to the United States to \nattack us is a real threat. So we must provide funds for Customs and \nborder protection.\n  Four and a half years ago it only took 19 to change the course of \nthis country. We must do everything that we can to prevent another \nterrorist attack on American soil.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 9/11 when the terrorists \nused our open and trusting society against us. We can not allow a \nrepeat of that tragedy.\n  This amendment will help those who guard our frontiers by providing \nthe necessary, and I stress necessary, tools to ensure the safety of \nour citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the budget \nresolution, I wanted to raise an important issue with my colleagues. \nThe budget for fiscal year 2007 that was proposed by the administration \nwould discontinue all activities of the National Children's Study or \nNCS.\n  This important study which was authorized as part of the Children's \nHealth Act of 2000, provides for the development and implementation of \nthe largest longitudinal study of children ever conducted in the United \nStates. The goal of the study is to improve the health and well-being \nof children. The information from this study will be used to determine \nand affect the major causes of childhood illness such as premature \nbirth, asthma, obesity, preventable injury, autism, developmental \ndelay, mental illness, and learning disorders.\n  These disorders, among many other high-frequency diseases that \nafflict children, result from the interaction of multiple biologic, \ngenetic, chemical, social and behavioral factors that combine to \ndetermine health. Researchers will analyze how these elements interact \nwith each other and what helpful and/or harmful effects they might have \non children's health. By studying children through their different \nphases of growth and development, researchers will be better able to \nunderstand the role of these factors on health and disease.\n  The National Children's Study will follow a representative sample of \nAmerica's children in order to identify causes and develop treatments \nof specific diseases, and develop population-based intervention \nstrategies to prevent illness and ameliorate the impacts of poverty and \nsubstandard environments on children's growth, development, and mental \nhealth. This will include approximately 100,000 children from over 100 \nlocations throughout the United States.\n  Since 2000, over 50 million has been spent planning the study. Over \n2,500 scientists and community members from across the country have \ndeveloped a study plan that defines research question, hypotheses, and \ncritical exposure and outcome measures beginning before pregnancy and \ncontinuing throughout the life cycle of children. In 2005, the Study \ndesignated seven Vanguard pilot centers throughout the United States, \nincluding sites in California, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, \nSouth Dakota, Utah, and Wisconsin to begin the study with over 100 \nadditional sites planned across the Nation.\n  It is unfortunate that funding for the study was zeroed out the \nPresident's budget and would be extremely shortsighted to put off this \nstudy. While there are upfront costs to conduct a study of this size, \nthey are dwarfed by the cost of treating the diseases and conditions it \ncan be expected to address. The National Institute of Child Health and \nHuman Development, NICHD estimates that the major chronic diseases the \nstudy will address directly cost American $269 billion per year. If the \nstudy were to result in only a 1 percent reduction in those costs, the \nexpense of the entire 20-plus year study could be recouped in a single \nyear.\n  The environment in which our children grow up has changed \nsignificantly over the past 50 years, resulting in increases in rates \nof diseases such as asthma, obesity, and learning and other \ndevelopmental disabilities. In order to overcome these challenges, we \nneed to invest in the National Children's Study, in addition to other \nresearch efforts to improve our understanding of how to prevent disease \nand improve the environments in which our children live.\n  As a parent of three children, and now a grandparent of three, I know \nhow important it is to provide a healthy environment for our youth. I \nhope the future will be brighter for future generations, and one way we \ncan make that happen is by finding the answers to many health questions \nthat plague us today. The National Children's Study will be one of the \nrichest information resources available to children's health and \ndevelopment and will form the basis of child health guidance, \ninterventions, and policy for generations to come.\n  It is my hope that this body will do all it can to restore the cuts \nto the NCS and keep this critical work moving forward, and I will work \nwith my colleagues through the Appropriations Committee to make that \nhappen.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my amendment No. 3154 to the budget \nresolution would restore much-needed funding to the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Program. The administration's budget slashes this program \nby $20 million, which amounts to a 63-percent cut to a program that \nhelps save the lives of law enforcement officers nationwide by \nproviding State and local law enforcement agencies with the resources \nto help buy body armor for their officers.\n  My amendment supports the allocation of $41 million in funding for \nbulletproof vest partnership grants to fully fund it at the authorized \nlevel of $50 million in fiscal year 2007. The increase in funds is \noffset by discretionary spending reductions.\n  Our former colleague Senator Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof \nVest Grant Partnership Act of 1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega \nshootout in 1997 on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which two \nState troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. The federal \nofficers who responded to the scenes of the shooting spree were \nequipped with life-saving body armor, but the State and local law \nenforcement officers lacked protective vests because of the cost.\n  We have successfully reauthorized this program three more times: in \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the State \nJustice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\nmost recently as part of the Violence Against Women and Department of \nJustice Reauthorization Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 \nmillion per year through fiscal year 2009.\n  Year after year, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program saves the \nlives and spares injuries of law enforcement officers nationwide by \nproviding more help to State and local law enforcement agencies to \npurchase body armor. Since its inception in 1999, this highly \nsuccessful DOJ program has provided law enforcement officers in 16,000 \njurisdictions nationwide with nearly 350,000 new bulletproof vests. In \nVermont, more than 150 municipalities have used this partnership help \nto purchase 1,400 vests. Without the assistance this program offers, I \ndaresay there would be close to that number of police officers without \nvests in Vermont today.\n  Compounding the ongoing funding needs to help purchase vests, \nconcerns from the law enforcement community over the effectiveness of \nbody armor surfaced nearly 2 years ago when a Pennsylvania police \nofficer was shot and critically wounded through his relatively new \nZylon-based body armor vest. In August 2005, the Justice Department \nannounced that test results indicated that used Zylon-based vests may \nnot provide the intended level of ballistic resistance. Unfortunately, \nan estimated 200,000 of these faulty vests have been purchased--many \nwith vest partnership funds--and now need to be replaced.\n  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests \nout of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program \nmakes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few \nthings mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and \nthey tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible \nbecause of this program. This is the least we should do for the \nofficers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every \nday.\n  I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof \nvest gets one. If the Senate approves this amendment to fully fund this \nprogram at $50 million, then we will be on our way to helping ease the \nburden faced by officers and their families and to further our mission \nto provide every police officer who needs a safe vest with the means to \npurchase one.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee, I am \ndeeply disappointed that the budget we are considering and the one \nproposed by the President last month will make finding adequate funding \nfor so many of our Nation's domestic priorities exceedingly hard to \nachieve.\n  Budgets are about priorities--hard-working South Dakota families know \nthat because they have to make priorities in their family budget every \nday. Unfortunately, the President and the Republican leadership in \nCongress fail to make investments in key programs that assist average, \nhard-working Americans.\n  Federal education mandates are woefully underfunded. Yet the \nPresident's budget proposed the largest cut to Federal education \nfunding in the Department of Education's 26-year history. Further, for \nthe second year in a row, the administration proposed a 5-percent \nacross-the-board cut to crop and dairy payments for producers. As well, \nthe President's budget included $16.9 billion in cuts to Medicaid and \nabout $35 billion in cuts to Medicare over 5 years. While I am pleased \nthe Senate budget resolution does not contain all of the President's \nbudget cuts, we cannot continue to try to balance the budget on the \nbacks of students, farmers and ranchers, and seniors.\n  While the administration is advocating cuts to important domestic \nprograms, it is estimated that the cost of the Bush tax cuts for those \nmaking over $1 million annually will be more than $41 billion in fiscal \nyear 2007 alone.\n  Despite what the leadership likes to say about their budget, this is \nnot a fiscally responsible budget. I think it is time we put our \nNation's finances back in order. This budget assumes that the deficit \nfor fiscal year 2007 will be $359 billion, and decline to $177 billion \nin fiscal year 2011. However, these assumptions omit items like the \ncost of extending expiring tax cuts, fixing the alternative minimum \ntax, AMT, the ongoing war costs, and the spending of the Social \nSecurity and other trust funds. When these costs are included, the \nNation's debt will increase by more than $600 billion every year over \nthe next 5 years.\n  To put this in perspective, consider how much U.S. debt is held by \nforeigners. It took 224 years and 42 Presidents--all of our Presidents \nfrom Washington to Clinton--to have $1 trillion in debt held outside \nour country. In just 5 years, that foreign debt level has more than \ndoubled.\n  I believe one of the best ways we can restore fiscal responsibility \nis to reinstate the pay-as-you-go rules that were in effect from 1991 \nto 2000. The pay-go rule simply means that if you want additional \nmandatory spending or tax cuts, you have to pay for them by offsets or \nobtain a supermajority vote to pass them. Unfortunately, the Senate \nfailed to adopt a pay-go rule to the budget resolution yesterday on a \ntie vote of 50-50.\n  Instead, we are being asked to support a budget that I don't think \nreflects the values and priorities of a majority of South Dakota \nfamilies, and does not restore fiscal responsibility. I will continue \nworking in a bipartisan manner to make improvements in the fiscal year \n2007 budget and restoring our Nation's fiscal strength.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as we debate the Senate budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2007 and the bill before us now to raise the debt \nceiling, I want to talk for a moment about the broader issue of fiscal \nresponsibility and honesty.\n  We are about to significantly raise the limit on our national debt \nfor the fourth time in the past 5 years, this time to nearly $9 \ntrillion. With deficits as far as the eye can see, we are on an \nunsustainable budgetary path that threatens not only to severely \nrestrict our Government's ability to provide critical services but to \ncause irreparable damage both to our economy and our influence in the \nworld community.\n  Alan Greenspan articulated our situation clearly in his last months \nas Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Greenspan said, ``our \nbudget position will substantially worsen in the coming years unless \nmajor deficit-reducing actions are taken . . . crafting a budget \nstrategy that meets the nation's longer-run needs will become more \ndifficult the more we delay.''\n  Even more troubling, our deficits are worse than they seem. While the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated the size of this year's \ndeficit at $371 billion, that figure does not account for the tens of \nbillions of dollars of emergency supplemental spending that we can all \nanticipate to address needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also does not \ninclude the $180 billion we are raiding from the Social Security trust \nfund, nor does it take into account the interest we will need to pay on \nthe additional debt. As Senator Conrad has pointed out, we anticipate \nthe national debt will increase by $654 billion this year.\n  Six years ago, we were running a budget surplus. While the national \ndebt was $5 trillion, for the first time in almost 20 years, we found \nourselves in a position where we could start to pay off some of that \ndebt. We knew we would soon face the demographic pressures associated \nwith the retirement of the baby boom generation, but we had the \nresources at our disposal to begin preparing for those pressures.\n  Now, just 6 years later, the circumstances that gave us a reason to \nbe optimistic have all but dissolved in a sea of irresponsible fiscal \npolicies, dishonest accounting, and partisan opportunism.\n  To be sure, not everything that brought us to this point was within \nour control. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, shook our \neconomy, gave rise to new and unexpected costs, and rightly caused us \nto shift our national focus to the threat of international terrorism--\nsometimes, unavoidably, to the detriment of our ability to sufficiently \nfocus on our looming fiscal challenges.\n  Having said that, much of what led to our current crisis was within \nour control. The fairness of the multiple tax cuts that Congress passed \nin the last 5 years was certainly within our control.\n  Whether or not those tax cuts were paid for was certainly within our \ncontrol.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n  And whether or not we are honest about including the costs of the \nongoing military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the need to provide \ncontinuing relief for middle-class families from the alternative \nminimum tax, and the inevitable costs associated with any proposal to \naddress the problems faced by our entitlement programs is certainly \nwithin our control.\n  We must be more responsible and more realistic.\n  First, we must begin working today to prepare for the retirement of \nthe baby boomers. While the situation is not as dire as some would have \nus believe, the Social Security system cannot support itself in its \ncurrent form forever. We need to make tough decisions in order to \nrestore that program to a path of solvency.\n  In addition, with health care costs skyrocketing, we need to take a \nhard look at Medicare and Medicaid in order to ensure they can continue \nto provide high-quality care for the elderly and the poor. Again, the \nproblems associated with these programs will only grow with the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, and we need to act now to avert \na full-fledged fiscal disaster.\n  Second, we must be more realistic about aligning our tax policies \nwith our spending policies. American families understand the simple \nfact that you cannot spend more than you take in. Yet this fact seems \nto escape this administration and the current congressional leadership. \nYear after year, we see massive spending reductions in vital programs \nfollowed up by even bigger tax cuts.\n  Contrary to what some seem to believe, the tax cuts of the past 5 \nyears are not going to pay for themselves. While I support many of \nthose tax cuts-- particularly those that benefit middle-class \nfamilies--it is undeniable that they have resulted in lower revenue for \nthe Federal Government and will continue to do so in the long run. This \nis especially in light of the fact that they were not paid for and will \ntherefore add to the national debt and increase the associated interest \ncosts.\n  Third, we cannot afford to be dishonest about costs we know we will \nface. The President's budget contained no funding for the military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond next year. Yet the \nCongressional Budget Office has said we should expect to pay $312 \nbillion in war-related costs for the period between 2007 and 2016.\n  Furthermore, we know we will need to provide relief from the \nalternative minimum tax for middle-class families. The Senate recently \npassed legislation that would contain a 1-year fix of the AMT at the \nprice tag of $30 billion. The cost of providing AMT relief for the next \ndecade is estimated at $1 trillion. Yet neither the President's budget \nrequest nor the proposal before the Senate includes the cost of \nproviding any AMT relief beyond this year.\n  And this is to say nothing of how costly it would be to make \npermanent the President's 2001 tax cuts, which is something we all know \nhe will try to do. A recent estimate by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities indicated that the cost of extending the President's tax \ncuts through 2016 would be nearly $2 trillion.\n  This debate is as much about honesty as it is about crunching \nnumbers. How can we expect to be adequately prepared for the looming \ninflux of Americans into the Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nprograms if we are not honest about costs we know we will have to deal \nwith--and not just over the long term but this year?\n  Yet another troubling symptom of our current misguided policies is \nthe growing percentage of our debt that is being purchased by foreign \ninvestors. As Senator Conrad has repeatedly pointed out in recent \nweeks, the level of debt purchased by foreign investors under President \nBush is more than twice the amount purchased by foreign investors under \nthe previous 42 Presidents combined. Foreign investors--whether it be \nthe central banks of foreign countries or private investors--now own \nnearly half of all publicly issued U.S. debt.\n  I was astounded by the following statistics. According to the \nEconomic Policy Institute, if foreign lenders keep buying U.S. debt at \ntheir current rate, the Federal Government will owe $3.8 trillion to \nforeign lenders by 2011, an amount equivalent to 23 percent of expected \ngross domestic product for that year. We will owe those lenders $181 \nbillion in interest alone.\n  To provide some context, that amount is 2\\1/2\\ times the size of the \nentire fiscal year 2007 budget for the Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n  I realize that we cannot fix all of these problems this week, or even \nthis year. But we can start to bring some sense to our Nation's fiscal \npriorities by going on record in support of our most critical programs \nand by embracing fiscal responsibility.\n  It is why I have consistently cosponsored classic pay-go proposals, \nwhich aim to ensure that both spending increases and tax cuts are fully \npaid for.\n  There is much more that is wrong with the Government's fiscal \npractices and priorities than what I have discussed today. Among other \nthings, I do not believe that our budget goes far enough in supporting \nrural America; I do not believe it does enough to provide resources to \nState and local law enforcement; and I do not believe it does enough to \npromote community development.\n  More than anything, however, the debate on the Senate floor this week \nis about our broader priorities as a nation. It is about whether we \nvalue candor and responsibility over partisan opportunism. If we do not \nact soon to reverse our direction, we will have made our decision, and \nit will have been the wrong one.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Humphrey Hawkins Act of 1978 specifies \nthat time should be set aside in the consideration of the budget \nresolution for debate on economic goals and policies. As the ranking \nmember of the Joint Economic Committee, I rise today to talk about how \nthe budget submitted by President Bush and the version of that budget \nwhich we are debating this week in the Senate embody the wrong goals \nand policies to address the challenges facing the American economy.\n  If you listen to the President and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, you would get the impression that the economy is in good \nshape and that their policies have been successful. But if you listen \nto the American people you know that there is considerable anxiety \nabout the economy and considerable disapproval about how the other side \nhas managed economic policy.\n  The American people are right. All is not well with the Bush economy \nand the President's economic policies. President Bush likes to cite \nstatistics on how fast the economy is growing and how much \nproductivity--the output a worker produces in an hour--has increased. \nWhat he doesn't mention is that on his watch the economy went through \nthe most protracted jobs slump in decades; that there is still \nconsiderable evidence of lagging labor force participation and hidden \nunemployment; and that the benefits of productivity growth have been \nshowing up in the bottom lines of companies rather than in the \npaychecks of workers.\n  The President doesn't mention that disparities in wages and incomes \nare growing wider. Those who are already well-to-do are continuing to \ndo very well. But the typical American family is struggling to make \nends meet in the face of rising costs for energy, health care, and a \ncollege education for their children.\n  The administration and its supporters will not take responsibility \nfor the failure of their policies. They say that their tax cuts are \nworking and that all the American economy needs is more tax cuts. But \nthe Bush tax cuts have not created an economy that works for ordinary \nAmericans and they have mortgaged our future. Responsible analysts have \nshown that the President's tax cuts for the rich were poorly designed \nfor generating jobs and putting people back to work in the wake of the \n2001 recession. They had very low ``bang-for-the-buck'' in terms of job \nstimulus in the short run, but they were so massive that they created a \nlegacy of large budget deficits and mounting debt that will be a drag \non the economy in the long run.\n  President Bush has squandered the hard-won fiscal discipline achieved \nin the 1990s. He inherited a 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion \nand turned it into a stream of deficits.\n  This year's budget gives the illusion that we will be making \nsubstantial progress in reducing the deficit over the next few years. \nBut that is not\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\nwhat responsible analysts say. They point out that a realistic budget \nassessment shows continuing structural deficits over the next several \nyears and a potential explosion of the deficit once the costs of the \nbaby-boom generation's retirement kick in fully.\n  With a $5.6 trillion 10-year budget surplus now a deficit of at least \n$2.7 trillion, this administration has turned us into a nation of \ndebtors, relying on the rest of the world to finance our budget \ndeficits and the rest of our excessive spending. Yesterday we learned \nthat the current account deficit--the broadest measure of our \ninternational payments imbalance--was $805 billion last year, an amount \nequal to 6.4 percent of GDP. That is a record both in dollar terms and \nas a share of GDP.\n  The ballooning international trade and budget deficits dramatize the \nmisplaced fiscal priorities of the President and the Republican \nCongress. The administration's large Federal budget deficits and \nmounting Federal debt are putting enormous pressure on the trade \ndeficit and the dollar. We are mortgaging our future to foreign \ninvestors and foreign governments instead of getting our fiscal house \nin order and boosting our own national saving.\n  And we are not investing in people here at home the way we should be. \nA new analysis of the President's budget by the Democratic staff of the \nJoint Economic Committee shows that the President's policies would add \nto the deficit and reduce investments that aid moderate- and lower-\nincome families in order to pay part of the cost of tax cuts going \ndisproportionately to those with very high incomes.\n  The JEC Democratic staff analysis shows that the burden of cuts in \nthose programs that provide benefits to individuals would be borne \ndisproportionately by families in the bottom 40 percent of the income \ndistribution. The share of spending cuts borne by those families would \nbe disproportionate to their share of aggregate family income and to \nthe share of any benefits they could expect to receive from the \nPresident's proposed tax cuts.\n  Families in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution would \nabsorb 32 percent of the cuts in payments for individuals, even though \ntheir share of aggregate family income is only 3 percent. Families in \nthe next lowest fifth of the income distribution, with 8 percent of \naggregate family income, would bear 23 percent of the budget cuts in \npayments for individuals.\n  Disparities in the impact of the President's budget proposals on \nfamilies in different parts of the income distribution are even more \npronounced when the tax cuts are taken into account. Families in the \nbottom 40 percent of the income distribution would receive only 6 \npercent of the benefits from tax cuts while bearing over half the \nburden of the spending cuts. In contrast, families in the top 20 \npercent of the income distribution would receive over 70 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax cuts while bearing only 14 percent of the burden of \nthe spending cuts.\n  The net impact of those cuts would leave families at the bottom of \nthe income distribution shouldering nearly all of the pain while \nfamilies at the top of the income distribution would reap nearly all of \nthe net benefits.\n  A budget resolution that echoes the President's budget neither meets \nthe pressing needs of the American people nor addresses the long-term \nchallenges that lie ahead. Clearly, we're in for another year of \npolicies that do little to help the average family or bring down the \ndeficit.\n  A long-term budget and economic disaster looms if we don't restore \nfiscal discipline. The President's large and growing Federal budget \ndeficits leave us increasingly hampered in our ability to deal with the \nhost of challenges we face. We need policies that address the problems \nfacing the country's most disadvantaged citizens and help ordinary \nworking families deal with job and retirement insecurity and the rising \ncosts of energy, health care, and education for their children.\n  We can and should do better.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget \nresolution.\n  A budget is about choices. It is about tradeoffs. It is about \nweighing competing priorities and conflicting objectives and figuring \nout what matters most for Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the budget we have before us makes the wrong choices. \nInstead of tackling Federal deficits and rising debt, this budget \nworsens them. Instead of strengthening our schools so America can be \ncompetitive in a global economy, this budget weakens them. Instead of \ntaking bold action against poverty as the President promised after \nKatrina, this budget cuts important services that Americans depend on.\n  Budgets matter because the tradeoffs we make matter, and this budget \nmakes the wrong tradeoffs. It extends tax breaks aimed at millionaires \nwhile doing nothing to expand opportunity for working Americans. It \nclaims to be fiscally responsible while ignoring billions of dollars of \nGovernment spending for ongoing military operations overseas.\n  At a time when we have maxed out our borrowing, this budget has us \nborrowing more. At a time when we have already cut certain programs \nbeyond the level of efficiency, this budget cuts them some more. At a \ntime when we have already lavished tax breaks on the wealthiest people \nand corporations, this budget lavishes even more.\n  As I talk to families in Illinois--farmers and small businesspeople, \nteachers and veterans, salespeople and service workers, doctors and \nsenior citizens, people prospering and those struggling at the \nmargins--I see people dealing with real issues and real problems. I see \npeople concerned about our national security and our domestic security. \nI see people worried about what they see and what they don't see \nhappening here in Washington.\n  Unfortunately, this budget that we are debating today gives Americans \nlittle reason to have confidence in their Government. This budget gives \nthem little reason to think that their elected leaders are paying \nattention.\n  Many of my Democratic colleagues and I have been offering amendments \nover the last few days. Together we are troubled by this budget and \ndoing our best to ensure that it reflects at least some of America's \ncherished values. A few of my Republican colleagues have also joined us \nin trying to improve this bill.\n  I was disappointed on Tuesday by the failure of the Senate to pass \nthe Pay-go amendment to restore discipline to our budgeting process. \nThat vote was bipartisan and very close, and I hold out hope that this \nbody will soon restore budget rules that work to reduce deficits and \nrestrain debt. But there are still opportunities to make this \nresolution more responsive to the needs and concerns of the people in \nIllinois.\n  For example, I appreciate the willingness of Senator Gregg and \nSenator Conrad, as the managers of this bill, to accept an important \namendment of mine that addresses the problem of homeless veterans.\n  Each and every night, more than 200,000 of our Nation's veterans are \nhomeless. More than 400,000 will experience homelessness over the \ncourse of a year. In my hometown of Chicago, as many as 38,000 veterans \nspend a night homeless over the course of a year.\n  It is one the great tragedies of this Nation that brave men and women \nwho risked their lives for us have no place to turn to and no place to \ncall home.\n  There is no single cause for homelessness among veterans. Homeless \nvets are men and women, single and married. They have served in every \nconflict since World War II. Many suffer from posttraumatic stress \ndisorder or were physically and mentally battered in combat. A large \nnumber left the military without job skills that could be easily \ntransferred to the private sector. Regardless of the cause, we know \nthat there are ways to combat this crisis.\n  My amendment devotes a small amount to begin addressing this problem \nby building on existing proven programs. For nearly 20 years, the \nHomeless Veterans Reintegration Program has helped get veterans off the \nstreets with intensive services that are unavailable elsewhere and \nreally get to the heart of the causes of homelessness.\n  HVRP grant recipients provide clothing and food to help stabilize \nveterans, they provide mental health and substance abuse counseling, \nand they provide employment services and housing assistance to allow \nthem to reenter society. Some HVRP programs even employ formerly \nhomeless veterans to serve as counselors and role models to other \nveterans. HVRP offers specialized\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nsupport for veterans who are turned away from other programs. In short, \nHVRP is a cost-effective and proven way to help veterans who have no \nplace else to turn.\n  The budget currently flatlines spending for the HVRP at $22 million, \nwhich is only 44 percent of the authorized level. At this amount, we \nwill only be able to serve 16,250 veterans next year.\n  My amendment increases HVRP to its full authorized amount, an \nincrease of $28 million. This will help us reach approximately 36,820 \nhomeless veterans. This is still less than 10 percent of the total \nneed, but it is an important start. My amendment will also devote an \nadditional $12 million to the Department of Labor to improve jobs \nservices for hard-to-place veterans. This is a modest increase of 6 \npercent over last year.\n  Every day, we walk past men and women on street corners with \nhandwritten signs like ``Homeless Veteran--Need Food.'' Sometimes we \ngive a dollar, sometimes we just keep walking. These are soldiers who \nfought in World War II, Vietnam, and Iraq.\n  We cannot allow the proud shoulders that have carried the weight of \nliberty to be broken by the terrible burden of homelessness and \nhopelessness. We owe our veterans more than an emergency shelter cot or \na cardboard box beneath an overpass. We owe them a chance to enjoy the \ndignity and respect they earned fighting for our freedom.\n  These men and women served us without fail when we needed them, and \nnow we must do the same for them.\n  I thank Senators Gregg and Conrad for accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can continue to improve this budget. But, \nuntil we have a fiscally responsible budget that makes the right \nchoices for America, I owe it to the people of Illinois to reject it.\n  I hope it won't be too long before this body can get serious about \nsolving the real problems we face as a country and preparing for the \nnew challenges and opportunities we will face in the years ahead.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote in \nsupport of Senator Lieberman's amendment 3034 to the fiscal year 2007 \ncongressional budget resolution. It is critically important to protect \nthe American people from terrorist attacks. This amendment would have \ndone so by providing $8 billion in additional funds for homeland \nsecurity. These funds would have come from restoring cuts to vital \nfirst responder programs in the Departments of Homeland Security and \nJustice. It also would have provided an additional $1.2 billion for \nfirst responders, $1.7 billion for the Coast Guard and port security, \n$150 million for chemical security, $1 billion for rail and transit \nsecurity, $456 million for FEMA, $1 billion for health preparedness \nprograms, and $752 million for aviation security.\n  At the time of this vote I was meeting with a group of Montana's high \nschool students from Project Close-Up. This program introduces young \npeople to Washington, DC and to the U.S. Government. I believe it is \nvery important to give these students the unique opportunity to meet \nwith their State's Senators in person--it is a tradition I have \nmaintained for years. It is unfortunate that this vote to support \nhomeland security occurred at the same time as the visit. For this \nreason, I must make it clear that I firmly believe in properly funding \nhomeland security. I was one of the first Senators to visit New Orleans \nand the gulf coast after Hurricane Katrina and I recognize that FEMA \nneeds more funding to improve their mission and ability to properly \nrespond to disasters.\n  Most importantly, our first responders in Montana are the backbone of \nemergency services in our State. We are a rural State, and our police \nand fire departments and hospitals call upon them to react across many \nmiles to keep Montana's citizens safe. I have always voted in favor of \nthese efforts in the past and I pledge to do so in the future.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Senator Conrad and I are fortunate to have \nan outstanding staff serving the members of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. These professionals work long hours and take great pride in \nthe work of the committee and the institution of the U.S. Senate.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes today to single out two of \nthese talented individuals who work on the majority side or Republican \ncommittee staff.\n  David Fisher serves as our health policy director on the committee. \nAs Willie Sutton said, ``You rob banks because that's where the money \nis,'' and with respect to the Federal budget, the money is in health \ncare. Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are three programs that \nDavid handles for our team, and these three programs are on a glidepath \nto consume over 20 percent of this Nation's gross domestic product in \nabout 30 years. If we do not find a way to control the growth of \nspending for these programs, there simply will not be resources \navailable for all other priorities, from national defense to homeland \nsecurity to science and research.\n  David came over to the Budget Committee from the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee in 2005. David holds a master's in public \npolicy degree from Georgetown University. He has held a number of key \npositions in both the Senate and the House of Representatives having \nserved as both a chief of staff and legislative director.\n  David is one of those rare individuals who can drill into specific \nprogrammatic detail and simultaneously understand the broader policy \nand political context in which programs operate. He is a perfectionist. \nDavid has a complete top-to-bottom understanding of medical and health \ncare programs and has staffed me with distinction with such issues as \nbioterrorism, medical liability reform, and FDA drug approval. Most \nrecently, he has been working tirelessly on Avian flu preparedness.\n  David Fisher has earned a reputation around town, here in Congress, \nand down at the White House as an expert on health issues. Few people \nwho have worked with David have not been impressed with intellect and \ndedication. I am proud to have him on my team.\n  For many people, the budget resolution is just a compilation of \naccounts and dollar levels. But the budget is much more. The budget is \na framework, a blueprint for the Federal Government and fiscal policy. \nMaybe good public policy states that policy drives budgets, but it is \nno secret that in Washington budgets often drive policy. The budget and \nour resolution have a real impact on the financial markets and economy.\n  When I took over the committee, a number of people advised me to make \nsure that we employed a talented economist. We are fortunate in Dan \nBrandt to have just that.\n  Dan Brandt serves as our Committee chief economist, and he also \nserves as analyst for a number of budget functions, such as what we \ncall function 370 or commerce and housing credit. Dan is our expert who \nkeeps on top of what the economy is doing, what is happening at the \nFederal Reserve, at the Securities and Exchange Commission, at the \nstock exchanges, and international finance. Dan is our ``go to guy'' \nfor understanding the latest GDP and employment statistics, inflation, \nand other economic data. He is our expert on tax policy and works \nclosely with the Finance Committee in ensuring that we are advocating \nprogrowth tax policies. He works closely with the Banking Committee on \na number of issues affecting financial institutions and the lending \nindustry.\n  Dan's academic background is in business administration and economics \nat the Johns Hopkins University, the American University, and the Frei \nUniversitat in Berlin, Germany. Prior to joining the committee, Dan \nworked in the House of Representatives, at Solomon Smith Barney, and at \nthe International Trade Administration in the U.S. Department of \nCommerce. During 2004, Dan Brandt worked on President George W. Bush's \nreelection campaign where he handled tax and economic issues.\n  Dan is a workhorse for the committee. Few people could serve as a \nguide through the intricacies of economic forecasts and the budget \nrules--Dan can do both. The technical accuracy and effectiveness of his \nwork products is a matter of personal pride. I have learned that he is \na professional staff member in every sense of the word. I will conclude \nby just saying that Dan Brandt is a real credit to the Senate, and we \nare fortunate to have him here on our Budget Committee and as part of \nmy team.\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\n  Mr. President, we are now able to go to final passage. Before we go \nto final passage, I wish to begin by thanking Senator Conrad and his \nextraordinary staff.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3081 Withdrawn\n\n  Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the pending \namendment No. 3081 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now able to go to final passage. \nBefore we go to final passage, I wish to begin by thanking Senator \nConrad and his extraordinary staff, led by Mary Naylor. They have been \nincredibly cooperative. They are always extraordinarily professional. \nThere is no question but we would not have been able to complete this--\nin what may not seem timely to most folks because we have been here all \nday but is--quite honestly we could have been here into tomorrow or \nSaturday without the extraordinary cooperation of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and his team. I thank him for his professionalism and \ntheir team.\n  I also thank my Committee on the Budget staff. They have worked \ntirelessly and continuously on this budget for the last 6 weeks. They \nliterally have gotten very little sleep, especially, of course, Scott \nGudes, my budget leader, and Denzel McGuire, his top assistant. They \ndid a great job of organizing, especially today, the amendments.\n  Jeff Turcotte, Dave Myers, and Sam Donoghue of our communications \nteam, who has tried to compete with the chart machine on the other side \nof the aisle, they have come close. They have done a great job. Jim \nHearn and Cheri Reidy, David Pappone and Gail Millar, are the \nspecialists who make this place work. The cornerstone of the great \nteam, John Mashburn, and Vas Chrisopoulos, my AA who keeps everything \nhumming along and does an incredible job on my personal staff, and I \nthank the leadership staff. There are an awful lot of good people \nworking for the leadership around here. They should be acknowledged for \ntheir tremendous work.\n  Let me thank the clerks and all the Senate staff. They have worked \nall day with virtually no break, along with the Reporters of Debates. I \nthank everyone for an extraordinary amount of commitment to making this \nplace work correctly.\n  This budget is now on the verge of being passed. It is the first step \nin the process. As I have said before, it is the responsibility of \ngovernance to pass a budget. That is our responsibility as \nSenators. This is a responsible budget. It is not everything I wanted, \nobviously, but it is a step in the right direction. It is a step on the \nroad, and it is a positive step on the road.\n\n  Rather than prolong the discussion, because we have had a lot of \ndiscussion on it, I will now yield the floor to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I want to indicate that we may have \none matter to conclude before we end.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3023, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 3023, as modified, \nand ask unanimous consent that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3023), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strengthen homeland security by adding $10 million to \n National Defense for an interoperable and survivable mobile wireless \n communications network enabling clear, reliable communications among \n  DoD and first responders for the military homeland defense command)\n\n       On page 9, line 20, increase the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 21, increase the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $10,000,000.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to go to final passage. We \ncannot do that without first thanking people. This has been a marathon, \nand people--many people--have worked around the clock to get us to this \nposition.\n  Let me thank a colleague because we would not be finishing at 7:15 \nwithout the extraordinary work of Senator Patty Murray.\n  Thank you, Patty.\n  She convinced literally dozens of our colleagues to drop amendments \ntonight; otherwise, we would have been here until 2 o'clock in the \nmorning. So special thanks to her.\n  And thanks to my staff director, Mary Naylor; and John Righter, my \ndeputy staff director; Lisa Konwinski, my counsel; and, most of all, my \nchart master, Kobye Noel.\n  And thanks to the staff of Senator Gregg: Scott Gudes and Denzel \nMcGuire, outstanding professionals.\n  Of course, my personal thanks to the chairman of the committee, who \nhas been so decent to deal with, and so honorable to deal with.\n  On our side, Mr. Chairman, we thank you for your courtesies.\n  With that, let me conclude on the budget itself.\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Oh, yes.\n  Borrow and spend--that is what this budget represents.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, as shown on this chart, this is what is \ngoing to happen to the debt under this budget. It is up, up, and away. \nA vote for this budget is a vote for more debt, higher interest rates, \na weaker economy, the export of American jobs, the selling off of \nAmerica, piece by piece.\n  Colleagues, we could do a whole lot better than this.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not make at \nleast a short statement on the budget we just passed. I agree with \nthose who believe that government is simply out of control. We just \npassed a budget that promises a budget deficit in the vicinity of $400 \nbillion, a truly staggering amount of money. Our Federal Government is \nborrowing in excess of a billion dollars a day to fund the awesome \namount of obligations that we have authorized. While I would have \npreferred\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\na vastly smaller budget today, I know it is simply not politically \nfeasible to do so at this time. I pledge to work toward creating an \nenvironment where we can achieve responsible spending and fiscal sanity \nwhile meeting our obligations. The budget we have just passed does \nrepresent a step, albeit a small one, toward fiscal responsibility. \nGetting our entitlement spending under control, reining in earmarks and \nother wasteful discretionary spending, and maintaining the conditions \nnecessary for strong, stable economic growth are all necessary to \nachieve a balanced budget, and it will take the concerted efforts of \neach and every one of us to achieve this in the future.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the Senate allowed its budget \nprocess to be hijacked by those seeking to move a policy issue that has \nbeen rightly rejected so many times. I opposed the manipulation of \nprocess in the Budget Committee and I opposed final passage this \nevening. Using the reconciliation process to advance a single \ncontroversial policy--a policy that should be considered through the \nappropriate legislative channels--is shameless.\n  We debated drilling in the Arctic last spring. We debated it again \nlast fall, and at that time, a number of House Republicans shot the \nidea down. Then, in December, we wasted more time on the issue. This \nyear, nine members of the Budget Committee reached out ahead of time to \nChairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad asking that the budget process \nnot be used to revisit drilling in the Arctic Refuge, and yet, it was. \nI ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Budget Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Budget Committee\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: As members \n     of the Budget Committee, we write to express our opposition \n     to the inclusion of any language or mechanism in the fiscal \n     year 2007 budget resolution that assumes revenues from \n     drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or allows for \n     the insertion of any provision that opens the Coastal Plain \n     of the Refuge to oil and gas drilling and exploration. We \n     also strongly oppose the inclusion of any Arctic Refuge \n     reconciliation instructions for the Energy Committee in the \n     budget resolution.\n       It is irresponsible to base the country's budget on highly \n     speculative and dubious projections of lease revenues for the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The \n     reality is that leasing portions of the Arctic Refuge would \n     likely not bring in the assumed levels of revenue to the \n     federal treasury, and yet, the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) assumes $6 billion in revenue from leasing of the \n     Arctic Refuge, and the President's fiscal year 2007 budget \n     proposal presupposes $7 billion in revenue from a 2008 Refuge \n     lease sale. Previous drilling proposals called for leasing \n     between 400,000 and 600,000 acres of the Arctic Refuge. The \n     Administration proposal would therefore require that industry \n     bid at least $11,667 per leased acre. The facts of oil and \n     gas leasing on Alaska's North Slope and elsewhere in the \n     country show that such a proposal is far out of touch with \n     reality:\n       Since 1991, 38 leases on the North Slope and in near-shore \n     waters have brought in an average of only $64.38 per leased \n     acre. The Administration's projection is 181 times this \n     historic average.\n       Last year, the oil industry bid $161.55 per acre for areas \n     offshore of the Arctic Refuge--an amount that is nearly an \n     order of magnitude lower than the Administration's \n     projections.\n       The CBO acknowledged in December 2005 that higher oil \n     prices do not necessarily result in higher lease bids when it \n     wrote that other factors, such as operating and capital costs \n     and the attractiveness of competing projects elsewhere, \n     influence bid amounts.\n       The North Slope leasing history demonstrates CBO's point. \n     In the last five years, when North Slope crude averaged \n     $33.60 a barrel, the average price per acre was $48.15. In \n     the five years prior to that, when North Slope crude averaged \n     $19.60, the average price per acre was $93.58. Additionally, \n     preliminary analysis of two lease sales held on March 1, 2006 \n     reveals an average per acre price of less than $40 on a day \n     when North Slope crude was selling for $59.11.\n       This kind of budget charade will simply not help reduce our \n     huge and growing federal deficit.\n       As we all know, the President acknowledged our addiction to \n     oil during his State of the Union address. As with any \n     addiction, recognition of the problem is the first step \n     toward change. Thus, now more than ever, instead of looking \n     to drill to the past in areas such as the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, we should truly dedicate ourselves to a \n     cleaner energy future. The American people expect Congress \n     and the Administration to stop wasting their time on dead-end \n     drilling schemes and to instead chart an energy vision \n     reflective of the 21st century.\n       Again, we encourage you to reject any requests that are \n     intended to misuse the budget process to open the Refuge to \n     oil and gas drilling and exploration and we thank you for \n     your consideration of this matter.\n         Russ Feingold, Patty Murray, Tim Johnson, Bill Nelson, \n           Robert Menendez, Paul S. Sarbanes, Ron Wyden, Robert C. \n           Byrd, Debbie Stabenow.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, but if we are going to debate this policy, we should \ndo so openly--not through a backdoor budget maneuver. My colleagues who \nwant to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling should go through the \nregular legislative process that the rest of us use to advance policy \ninitiatives. After all, what message do you send when you manipulate a \nprocess simply because the normal procedure does not give you the \noutcome you want? That is not a message this body should endorse.\n  Proponents will say that using the budget process is the only way \nthey can get an up-or-down vote. My response is simple. I know how hard \nit is to be very close to having the votes to pass legislation, but not \nquite being there. Senator McCain and I worked very hard on our \ncampaign finance reform legislation to get the votes needed to move \nforward--it took years--but we stuck with it until we could get the \nlegislation passed. We fought hard but we fought fair. We did not--and \nwe would not have--tried to advance our legislation by manipulating the \nbudget process. This single reconciliation instruction opening up the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is simply out of bounds.\n  My concerns, however, go beyond the obvious abuse of process. The \nbottom line is that the revenue assumptions are highly speculative and \nin no way reflect reality. For a second, let's ignore the fact that \nlast year a Bush adviser was quoted as saying that ``even if you gave \nthe oil companies the refuge for free, they wouldn't want to drill \nthere'' and let's look at the numbers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office assumes $6 billion in revenues while \nthe President's budget puts the number at $7 billion. Based on past \nproposals, 400,000 to 600,000 acres in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge would be on the leasing block. Therefore, to achieve the \nadministration's estimate, companies would have to pay between $17,500 \nand $11,667 per acre to make it to the $7 billion level. To get to \nCBO's estimate, they would have to pay between $15,000 and $10,000 per \nacre to get to a total of $6 billion. Now let's consider these numbers \na bit more closely to see how they line up with reality:\n  Since 1991, 40 lease sales on the North Slope and in near-shore \nwaters have brought in an average of only $60.47 per leased acre in \nreal 2006 dollars. CBO's projections are 165 times greater than the \ninflation-adjusted average during the last 16 years.\n  Think that higher gas prices will mean higher lease bids? Think \nagain. In December of 2005, CBO said that higher gas prices at the pump \ndon't directly translate into higher lease bids by oil companies, and \ncited other factors--such as operating and capital costs and the \nattractiveness of competing projects elsewhere--that influence bid \namounts.\n  Additionally, the reconciliation instruction assumes $3 billion in \nFederal revenues, based on a 50/50 split between the State of Alaska \nand the U.S. Treasury. Given public statements by members of the Alaska \ndelegation, as recently as last December, this 50/50 split is, at best, \nspeculative.\n  Some may argue that oil company activities in the Arctic Refuge could \nbe done in an environmentally safe manner. I would point out to them \nthat earlier this month the largest crude oil spill in the history of \noil and gas operations was discovered on Alaska's North Slope. To quote \nan employee of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, \n``Hopefully, the tundra will recover. It's never going to be perfect.'' \nI don't think anyone wants to contemplate the possibility of such an \naccident occurring within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  During his State of the Union Address, the President acknowledged our\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\naddiction to oil. I hoped that this would mean we could move forward to \ndiscuss real energy solutions, solutions that protect our national \nsecurity, our citizens, and our environment, as I continue to believe \nthat we can do all three. In fact, there are bipartisan bills out there \nto move our transportation sector to renewable sources of energy and \nsadly we spend our time talking about this issue, an issue that divides \nus. When are we going to move past this divisive debate to discuss real \nenergy solutions for the 21st century?\n  If we do not stand against misuse of the legislative process, then \nevery member of this esteemed body is at risk. Today, I cast a vote \nagainst abuse and in favor of the integrity of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2293-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JACK ZOUHARY TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate considers two more \nlifetime appointments to U.S. courts. These confirmations will bring \nthe total number of judicial appointments since January 2001 to 234, \nincluding the confirmations of two Supreme Court Justices and 43 \ncircuit court judges. Of course, 100 judges were confirmed during the \n17 months when there was a Democratic majority in the Senate. In the \nother 45 months, 134 judges have been confirmed. Ironically, under \nDemocratic leadership, the Senate was almost twice as productive as \nunder Republican leadership.\n  It is most regrettable that this President has not fulfilled his \npromise to the American people to be a uniter. Nor has he fulfilled his \npledge to complete his work in advance of vacancies and to make \nnominations promptly. Judicial vacancies have grown to more than 50 and \nthe White House has failed to send nominees for more than half of \nthose. Some of those vacancies have been sitting empty for more than a \nyear. Over and over the White House has missed the deadline the \nPresident established for himself, and today, more than half of the \njudicial vacancies, 27, are without nominations. One-third of those \nvacancies are already more than 180 days old, and one-third of the \njudicial emergency vacancies are without nominees.\n  If the White House would eliminate its partisan, political, and \nideological litmus tests from the judicial nominations process and its \nemphasis on rewarding cronies and focus only on qualifications and \nconsensus, the job of selecting nominees and our job of considering \nthem for confirmation would be much easier.\n  Jack Zouhary, the nominee from Ohio, has the support of his \nRepublican home State Senators, and Stephen G. Larson, the nominee from \nCalifornia, has the support of his Democratic home State Senators. They \nare the kind of qualified consensus nominees who are confirmed \nrelatively easily.\n  Recently we have seen the President withdraw a circuit nomination \nafter information became public about that nominee's rulings in a \nnumber of cases in which he appears to have had a conflict of interest. \nThose conflicts were pointed out not by the administration's screening \nprocess or by the ABA but by online journalists.\n  At a minimum that case and other recent revelations reinforce a point \nabout this White House's poor vetting process for important \nnominations. A number of nominations by this President have had to be \nwithdrawn. Among the more well known are Bernard Kerik to head Homeland \nSecurity, Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, and Claude Allen to be a \nFourth Circuit judge. It was, as I recall, reporting in a national \nmagazine that doomed the Kerik nomination. It was opposition within the \nPresident's own party that doomed the Miers nomination. Democratic \nSenators resisted the nomination of Allen, a Virginian, because the \nPresident was seeking to appoint someone from another State to a \nMaryland seat on the Fourth Circuit. When we are considering lifetime \nappointments of judicial officers who are entrusted with protecting the \nrights of Americans, it is important to be thorough. Unfortunately, all \ntoo often this White House seems more interested in rewarding cronies.\n  The Senate now considers two more lifetime appointments to U.S. \ncourts.

Unfortunately, all \ntoo often this White House seems more interested in rewarding cronies.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nthe nomination of Judge Jack Zouhary, whom the President has nominated \nto be United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of \nOhio. Judge Zouhary currently is serving on the Lucas County Common \nPleas Court. His service there has been outstanding and is an excellent \nindication of the type of judge he will be on the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n  I'd like to share with my Senate colleagues just a few of the \nnumerous admirable qualities that make Judge Zouhary such an \noutstanding nominee. Both as a professional and as a person, he is \nexactly the sort of individual we want to be serving on the Federal \nbench.\n  Judge Zouhary grew up in Toledo. He is a first-generation American, \nwhose parents immigrated from Lebanon to the United States and \ninstilled in their son a respect for the values of education, religion, \nand community service. After graduating as the valedictorian of his \nhigh school, he attended Dartmouth College, where he received his \nundergraduate degree before returning to his hometown to earn his law \ndegree from the University of Toledo College of Law. Judge Zouhary then \nembarked on what would become a long and accomplished legal career--a \ncareer with 30 years of legal experience that has given him the \nbackground and understanding of our legal system to successfully take \non the role of a Federal judge.\n  He began his legal career with the law firm of Robison, Curphey & \nO'Connell, where he worked as an associate and then as a partner. \nDuring his 23 years there, he had a varied practice, representing \nindividuals and businesses on a range of legal issues, with an emphasis \non civil trial practice and corporate matters. In 2000, Judge Zouhary \nbecame the Senior Vice President and General Counsel for S.E. Johnson \nCompanies, Inc., a large highway contractor and asphalt producer.\n  In 2004, Judge Zouhary accepted a position as ``Of Counsel'' with the \nlaw firm of Fuller & Henry. He remained with Fuller & Henry until 2005, \nwhen Ohio Governor Bob Taft appointed him to the Lucas County Common \nPleas Court. In Ohio, the Common Pleas Court is the highest state trial \nbench and hears all major civil and criminal cases.\n  During his time as an attorney in private practice, Judge Zouhary \ndistinguished himself as an excellent litigator and was honored by \nbeing selected as a member of the prestigious American College of Trial \nLawyers. Membership in the American College of Trial Lawyers is by \ninvitation only and is limited to the best of the trial bar.\n  Judge Zouhary has long been committed to the ideals of civility and \nprofessionalism in the legal field. Friends and colleagues often \ndescribe him as ``a gentleman.'' I agree with that assessment. He is \nwell regarded for his honesty, his integrity, and his intelligence, and \nthose who have known and worked with him through the years speak warmly \nof his even-temper and cordial demeanor.\n  Not surprisingly, given his interest in preserving a less combative \napproach to the law, Judge Zouhary frequently has presented lectures \nfocusing on legal ethics and civility in the practice of law for \nContinuing Legal Education Seminars. His commitment to serving the \ncommunity as a professional also is exemplified by his membership in \nthe Toledo Rotary Club, as well as his participation in a broad array \nof other charitable activities, ranging from pro bono work for a local \nchurch to service at a community soup kitchen.\n  Although he has been a Common Pleas judge for only a relatively short \ntime, Judge Zouhary already has distinguished himself on the bench. He \nhas worked diligently to clear a very large backlog of cases from his \ncrowded docket and has made a good deal of headway in that effort. Most \nimportant, attorneys who have appeared before him--criminal and civil, \nprosecution and defense--speak in glowing terms of his talent, \nfairness, and excellent judicial temperament.\n  With Judge Zouhary's impressive record as a legal professional and \ncommunity leader, it should come as no surprise that the American Bar \nAssociation was unanimous in giving him its highest rating of ``well-\nqualified.'' Judge Zouhary is in every way an outstanding nominee, who \nwill serve the people of Ohio and of this country well.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Judge Jack Zouhary as a Federal \nDistrict Court Judge for the Northern District of Ohio.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated on the nomination of Judge Stephen Larson so that it \ncan be done by voice vote. I see the distinguished leaders on the \nSenate floor. I don't think there is any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is my St. Patrick's Day gift to the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jack Zouhary, of Ohio, to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio?

LARSON TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                   THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now consider Executive \nCalendar No. 548, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stephen G. Larson, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe nomination of Magistrate Judge Stephen Larson to a seat on the \nFederal District Court for the Central District of California in \nRiverside, CA.\n  Judge Larson comes to this nomination with a strong background of \npublic service.\n  Since October 2000, Judge Larson has served as a magistrate judge for \nthe Central District of California in Riverside. In the 10 years before \nbecoming a magistrate judge, Larson served the public as an assistant \nU.S. attorney in the Central District of California, where he was chief \nof the U.S. Attorney Office's Organized Crime Strike Force and \ncoordinator of its Russian Organized Crime Unit.\n  Judge Larson attended college here in Washington, at the Georgetown \nUniversity School of Foreign Service, from which he received a \nbachelor's of science in 1986. Judge Larson returned to California for \nlaw school, graduating from the University of Southern California Law \nSchool in 1989.\n  The American Bar Association has unanimously declared Judge Larson to \nbe ``well qualified,'' the ABA's highest rating.\n  Judge Larson has the strong support of California's Inland Empire. I \nhave received endorsements of Judge Larson's nomination from a diverse \ncross-section of the Inland Empire's legal community: from judges and \nlaw professors, from government attorneys and private practitioners, \nand from Democrats and Republicans.\n  In these letters, Judge Larson is praised for his ``legal \nknowledge,'' ``fairness,'' ``integrity,'' ``hard work,'' \n``temperament,'' ``intelligence,'' ``patience,'' and ``sense of social \njustice.''\n  Judge Larson was nominated through the bipartisan judicial selection \nprocess that we developed in California, a process which I believe is a \nmodel for the Nation. Under this system, a committee of lawyers \nincluding Democrats and Republicans recommends qualified, non-\nideological applicants to the President.\n  Judge Larson's nomination through this process, along with his \nimpressive record of public service, gives me confidence that he comes \nto the bench without an agenda and that he will serve the people of \nCalifornia and the Nation with wisdom, integrity, and humility.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic support of the \nconfirmation of Judge Stephen Larson to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California, one of the Nation's busiest Federal \ncourts, serving seven of Southern California's most populous counties.\n  Judge Larson is a model of hard work, fairness, moderation and \njudicial independence. Judge Larson is skilled at bringing all sides \ntogether. He is a Republican with broad local, bipartisan support and \nrespect from lawyers, judges and Federal practitioners in Riverside and \nSan Bernardino Counties, where he currently serves.\n  Judge Larson has had a distinguished legal career and a sterling \nreputation within the California legal community. He was sworn in as \nmagistrate on September 25, 2000. Prior to this position, Judge Larson \nwas a Federal prosecutor and chief of the Organized Crime Section of \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  Judge Larson is a nationally known expert in organized and \ninternational crime. He was heavily involved in fighting Russian gangs \nand helped form the Russian Organized Crime Program in Los Angeles.\n  Judge Larson earned his undergraduate degree from the Georgetown \nUniversity School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, he served as \na teaching assistant to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. \nHe earned his law degree from the University of Southern California in \n1989. He worked as an associate at O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles \nuntil 1991, when he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  I congratulate Judge Larson on his confirmation vote. And I look \nforward to what I hope will be many years of service to the people of \nCalifornia and the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Stephen G. Larson, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2295-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Monday, March 20, marks the vernal equinox \nand the first day of spring. On Monday, night and day are equal in \nlength, marking the midpoint of our climb out of the dark winter into \nthe glorious long days of spring.\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\n  Lovely, lovely spring. It takes a cold heart indeed not to love the \nspringtime.\n\n     Spring is the morning of the year,\n     And summer is the noontime bright;\n     The autumn is the evening clear,\n     That comes before the winter's night.\n\n     The Golden Rod, by Frank Dempster Sherman.\n\n  Though most of the United States has enjoyed an unseasonable winter \nwith mild temperatures and even thunderstorms in February, it is \ncomforting to see the plants and animals around us heeding the \ncelestial timetable even if the mercury in the thermometer is not. \nRight on schedule, this year as last year and in all the years before, \nthe crocus and the daffodil burst through the leaf mold and lawn \nthatch, staining the subdued winter landscape with vibrant color, like \nEaster eggs hidden in the grass. In time for Saint Patrick's day, the \ngrass put on a deep cloak of Irish green.\n  Day by day, the skeletal tree limbs and branches are swelling and \nbudding with soft, new leaves whose iconic color can only be named \n``spring green.''\n  Next week, the Nation's Capital will be celebrating the Cherry \nBlossom Festival. These lovely trees, a gift from the Government of \nJapan, delight jaded commuters as well as visitors with the ethereal \nbeauty of their graceful blooms reflected against the dark water of the \nPotomac River or framing the elegant marble columns of the Jefferson \nMemorial.\n\n     Oh, fair to see\n     Bloom-laden cherry tree,\n     Arrayed in sunny white:\n     An April day's delight,\n     Oh, fair to see!\n\n     Oh, Fair to See by Christina Rossetti.\n\n  Deep within the earth, the soil warms, ready for priming for the \ngermination of crop and flower seeds. The ageless cycles of agriculture \nand horticulture are rumbling into action across West Virginia and the \nNation.\n  The Bible says, ``The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth \nitself, And herbs of the mountains are gathered.'' I know that I am not \nalone in appreciating the rhythmic patterns of a freshly plowed field \nwhile anticipating the mouthwatering goodness of the crops to come. For \n2,000 years and more, mankind has rejoiced in the promise of spring. \nEven now, home gardeners are sowing early spring crops of peas and \nstarting more tender shoots under lights. Fertilizer and weed killer \nare in short supply at garden stores, while bedding plants are starting \nto arrive.\n  And it is not just the farmers and gardeners among us who revel in \nthe signs of emerging springtime. All of God's creatures feel the pull \nof the warming sun, the warming of the waters, the melting of the snow \nand ice. The penciled Vees of Canada geese hew to the seasonal \ntimetable as their formations power their way northward, honking to \nannounce their passing as they drive to their northern nesting grounds. \nThe dainty goldfinches that mob our winter feeders are changing, too, \nshedding their drab winter garb for brilliant springtime yellow as they \nchatter and flit about. As the longer, warmer days advance, more and \nmore birds appear, and the sky fills with their vernal songfest. The \npoet, Percy Bysshe Shelley, famously captured the beauty of birdsong in \nhis poem, ``To a Skylark:''\n\n     Hail to thee, blithe spirit!\n     Bird thou never wert,\n     That from heaven, or near it,\n     Pourest thy full heart\n     In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.\n\n     Higher still and higher\n     From the earth thou springest\n     Like a cloud of fire;\n     The blue deep thou wingest,\n     And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.\n\n     In the golden lightning\n     Of the setting sun\n     O'er which clouds are brightening,\n     Thou dost float and run\n     Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.\n\n  Deer, once a common sight along the roadsides and fields in the later \nafternoon dusk, are retreating into the woods, nibbling new shoots as \nthey seek out hidden coverts in which to secret their wobbly-legged \nfawns. The deer's place along the road seems, alas, to have been taken \nover by amorous skunks seeking their springtime love.\n  In cities as well as rural areas, the spring shows itself. In the \nstone flower beds around the Capitol, the tulip bulbs are sending green \nspears up through the soil as the squirrels race about in an exuberant \ndisplay of spring energy. The spring sunshine and warmth energize us \nall. Parks and playgrounds are welcoming young shoots of humankind to \nplay among the swings and slides while contented parents keep watch. \nEven our dogs affect a more jaunty air as they soak up the fresh scents \nand nibble on the green shoots of new grass. Later, as the summer heat \nsaps our energy and lawn chores become more tiresome, as the children \nget sweaty and the dogs pant in the shade, we may long for the dark \ncold days of winter. But now, in the gentle warmth of spring sunshine, \nit seems as if our prayers are answered with the blooming of the \nflowers. Winter is passing, and spring is here. Welcome, welcome \nspring.\n  Mr. President, I close with another poem about spring. This one from \nRobert Frost, one of the 20th century's leading American poets. His \npoem, ``A Prayer in Spring,'' beautifully captures the ephemeral \npleasure of an early spring day with a word of thanks to the Creator of \nit all.\n\n                           A Prayer in Spring\n\n     Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;\n     And give us not to think so far away\n     As the uncertain harvest; keep us here\n     All simply in the springing of the year.\n\n     Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,\n     Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;\n     And make us happy in the happy bees,\n     The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.\n\n     And make us happy in the darting bird\n     That suddenly above the bees is heard,\n     The meteor that thrusts with needle bill,\n     And off a blossom in mid-air stands still.\n\n     For this is love and nothing else is love,\n     The which it is reserved for God above\n     To sanctify to what far ends He will,\n     But which it only needs that we fulfill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2296-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2296-S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY ON ITS CENTENNIAL YEAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding institution of higher learning in my home State, Western \nKentucky University. Next Tuesday, March 21, 2006, marks Western's \n100th year of fulfilling its mission to ``prepare students to be \nproductive citizens of a global society'' and to ``provide service and \nlifelong learning opportunities for its constituents.''\n  Located in Bowling Green, KY, Western Kentucky University has not \nalways been known by its current name. On March 21, 1906, the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly approved legislation establishing two teacher-training \ninstitutions. Bowling Green was selected as one of the sites, and the \nWestern Kentucky State Normal School was established. With a mission to \ntrain teachers, the newly created institution selected Henry Hardin \nCherry as its first president.\n  Five years after its founding, the school moved to its current site \non ``the Hill,'' a scenic location overlooking the city of Bowling \nGreen. This move would later lend itself to an appropriate school motto \nthat is proudly used today, describing Western Kentucky University as \n``the home of the Hilltoppers.'' In 1922, the school was renamed and \nbecame known as Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers \nCollege; at this time, it was also authorized to grant 4-year degrees. \nIn 1924, the first such degrees were earned and awarded.\n  In the years that followed, Western continued to expand its \ncurriculum and shorten its name. While many ``Hilltoppers'' have \nfollowed the school's early roots and pursued degrees in education, the \ninstitution now offers a broader set of degree programs. On June 16, \n1966, Western underwent its final name change and became known simply \nas Western Kentucky University. The university now has an enrollment of \nover 18,000 students and offers 88 academic majors and 57 academic \nminors. It also offers 18 associate degrees and graduate studies.\n  I always enjoy visiting Western and spending time with its students, \nfaculty, and staff. I am proud to have partnered with the university to \nsecure over $48 million in Federal funding for worthwhile projects such \nas the Western Mobile Health Unit and the ARS Federal research lab. \nUniversity president Gary Ransdell, the institution's\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nninth president, is a great leader, and we work well together. He has \nbeen successful in advancing the university and winning accolades from \nstudents, faculty, and educators nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating \nWestern Kentucky University on its centennial year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2297-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am encouraged by reports regarding \nprogress the Judiciary Committee made on the immigration bill today. I \nunderstand that the committee has scheduled a meeting for Monday, March \n27 when we return from our break to try to conclude work on the bill.\n  It is very important that we allow this process to continue. The \ncommittee should be given the opportunity to report out a consensus \nbill on a bipartisan basis. I want to commend Senators Specter, Leahy, \nand Kennedy, among others, for their efforts to draft a comprehensive \nimmigration bill and I hope that the Leader will give them the time \nthey need to complete their work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters that \nwere sent to Senator Frist today from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Restaurant Association and the National Roofing Contractors \nAssociation that express a similar desire.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2006,\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, I am writing \n     to request that you allow the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     additional time to develop and report out an immigration \n     reform measure for consideration by the full Senate.\n       While we fully appreciate that the Senate floor schedule is \n     very crowded, and that you must adhere to a schedule to move \n     important legislation through the process, it is apparent \n     that more time is needed by the Committee to adequately \n     consider the many complex issues surrounding immigration. \n     Hundreds of amendments have been introduced by Senators \n     sitting on the Committee, and it would seem that those \n     actually offered should be given due consideration.\n       Unfortunately, it has now become clear that this will be \n     impossible under a deadline of March 27, with the result that \n     the Committee will not be able to report out a bill by that \n     deadline. The Committee has an obvious expertise to bring to \n     bear on the many difficult, and frankly, controversial issues \n     involved and it should be given an adequate opportunity to \n     shape legislation before consideration by the full Senate.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R.

We fully appreciate the \n     breadth of business placing demands on the Senate calendar, \n     but given the paramount economic and national security \n     concerns addressed in this legislation, it is imperative that \n     the Committee have adequate time to consider the complexities \n     of immigration reform in a full and reasoned fashion.\n       Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the nation's oldest \n     trade associations and the voice of roofing contractors \n     worldwide. It is an association of roofing and waterproofing \n     contractors, material manufacturers, distributors, \n     architects, consultants and engineers. NRCA has over 5,000 \n     member companies from all 50 states and 54 countries and is \n     affiliated with 105 local, state, regional and international \n     roofing contractor associations.\n       As you are aware, hundreds of amendments have been \n     submitted by Committee members. Unfortunately, it has become \n     clear during the markup process that your March 27 deadline \n     will not be met given the sheer volume of amendments to be \n     considered.\n       We commend you for your commitment to bringing immigration \n     reform before the full Senate. The topic is one of our most \n     pressing public policy challenges and ripe for discussion. \n     Toward that end, NRCA looks forward to a vigorous and \n     comprehensive debate on the Senate floor that addresses \n     America's national security needs, while ensuring the long-\n     term health of our economy.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                Craig S.

Since 1994, more than \n970,000 people have called your National Sexual Assault Hotline. More \nthan 5,300 of them were Nevadans. Your work makes an incredible \ndifference in people's lives.\n  But too many victims are still suffering in the shadows. We need to \ndo more to strengthen laws to fight sexual assault, to provide law \nenforcement with the tools and funding they need, and to support \nvictims.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women \nAct. As you probably know, VAWA was landmark legislation that expanded \nthe Federal Government's commitment to eliminating violence against \nwomen. I was a cosponsor of the original act back in 1990, and I have \nvoted for it every time it has come up for reauthorization.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have worked to \nget funding for sexual assault prevention programs and victims aid \nprograms in Nevada and around the country.\n  I was also happy to work with RAINN last year to get funding to help \nvictims. I hope some of this money will be used specifically to help \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. We set aside \n$500,000 in last year's Federal budget. I think it should have been \nmore the Senate approved more, but the House did not--but I am happy we \nwere able to get the funding.\n  I know there is a lot more work to be done, and I look forward to \nworking with all of you in the future. Thank you again for this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2297-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2297-S2298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUPPORT HOMELAND SECURITY AND EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleges to \nsupport the Homeland Security Education Act. This bill encourages \ninitiatives to increase the number of Americans trained in science, \ntechnology, engineering, math, and foreign languages.\n  Our security and economic future depends on the next generation of \nworkers and their ability not just to keep up, but to innovate. Science \nand technology are the engines of economic\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\ngrowth. We must invest in our students and our educational system by \nproviding the training and resources needed in science, technology, \nengineering, mathematics, and foreign languages.\n  The United States graduates some of the world's best engineers, \nscientists and mathematicians; however, China, India, South Korea, and \nJapan are educating a higher proportion of their people in technology, \nscience, and math. According to the National Science Board, in 2004, 59 \npercent of undergraduates in China and 66 percent of Japanese \nundergraduates received a degree in science and engineering. In the \nUnited States, only 32 percent of the undergraduate degrees awarded \nwere in science and engineering. In 2004, China and India graduated \nover 600,000 and 350,000 engineers, respectively, while the United \nStates graduated about 70,000 engineers.\n  In an increasingly global economy and an atmosphere of heightened \nsecurity, we also need people who can speak a foreign language, \nparticularly less commonly taught languages such as Arabic, Farsi, \nChinese, and Korean. Al-Qaida operates in more than 75 countries where \nhundreds of languages and dialects are spoken. Half of all European \ncitizens speak another language. In contrast, only 9 percent of \nAmerican students enroll in a foreign language course in college. Even \nthough enrollment in Arabic classes has increased, it represents less \nthan 1 percent of all foreign language enrollments in institutions of \nhigher education.\n  According to the National Education Association, while student \nenrollments in education are rising rapidly, more than a million \nveteran teachers are nearing retirement. Almost a third of our new \nteachers leave the profession after only 3 years. About half exit after \nfive. We will need more than 2 million new teachers in the next decade. \nWe are feeling this teacher recruitment challenge most acutely in high-\nneed subject areas such as special education, math, science, \nengineering, and critical foreign languages.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act encourages the smart and eager \nstudents in our country to seek degrees in science, technology, \nengineering, math, and foreign languages by providing $5,000 \nscholarships to undergraduate students who obtain such degrees. \nScientists, engineers, technology professionals and those fluent in \nforeign languages are encouraged to return to the classroom through \n$15,000 scholarships. New grant programs encourage educational \ninstitutions, public entities, and businesses to enter into \npartnerships that improve math and science curricula, establish \nprograms that promote students' foreign language proficiency along with \ntheir science and technological knowledge, and create and establish \nforeign language pathways from elementary school through college.\n  The technological challenge to our country has been explored from \nmany different angles--from the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and \nthe chairman of Intel, Craig Barrett, to the journalist and writer Tom \nFriedman and the National Academies of Science. The need to strengthen \nour students' proficiency in science, technology, engineering, math, \nand foreign languages is well documented. We can't afford not to invest \nin thoughtful Federal initiatives that foster the kind of technological \ninnovation this country has grown up on. Research and development is \ncritical, but it all starts in the schools. The Homeland Security \nEducation Act will help put our resources where they are needed most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2298-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2298-S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NEW COMPREHENSIVE COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have spoken on the floor several times \nabout the administration's ill-conceived, poorly executed, and self-\ndefeating strategy in Iraq. Today, I intend to talk about how the war \nin Iraq is having a far-reaching and negative impact on our ability to \nconduct an effective fight against international terrorism. I saw this \nfirsthand during a recent visit to Thailand and Indonesia, two valuable \npartners in the fight against terrorism in a strategically critical and \noften underappreciated region. I visited these two countries to gain a \ndetailed understanding of the radical Jihadist networks that are \nproliferating throughout the region and of what it will take to \neffectively confront this threat.\n  I bring back from the trip both good news and bad news. The good news \nis that we have a significant opportunity in Thailand, Indonesia, and \nin Southeast Asia in general, to get our counterterrorism strategy \nright. It is not too late to stem the relationship between \ninternational terrorist networks and local extremist organizations. Nor \nis it too late to tackle the root causes of extremism in the region.\n  Unfortunately, there is bad news. Unless we develop a truly \ncomprehensive, global strategy to counter terrorist threats, we will \nmiss the opportunity to gain the upper hand in the fight against \nterrorism in Southeast Asia at what couldn't be a more critical time. \nAnd changing our misguided policies in Iraq must be a central element \nof this strategy.\n  First, international terrorist networks are alive and well in \nSoutheast Asia. During my visit, I examined the current nature of a \nleading regional terrorist organization, al-Jesmaah al-Islamiyah, or \n``JI'', and its affiliates--the threat it continues to pose to \ncountries throughout the region, how it has survived the deaths and \narrests of some of its key leaders, and its ties with al-Qaida. Most \nimportantly, I gained a more detailed understanding of the conditions \nthat have provided JI with a recruitment base and operational space.\n  JI takes advantage of vast areas of ocean, isolated islands, weak or \ncorrupt local and provincial governments, the absence of rule of law, \nand marginalized Islamic populations to develop its strength. JI has a \npresence throughout the region. And while arrests of prominent JI \nleaders in the last few years have helped shed light on the \norganization, it continues to operate in loosely formed cells, in \nregionally oriented entities, and in partnership with other terrorist \norganizations like the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines.\n  That said, according to a number of sources, including the \nInternational Crisis Group, Congressional Research Service, and the \nState Department, JI and al-Qaida have developed a symbiotic \nrelationship. There is some overlap in membership. They have shared \ntraining camps in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Mindanao, and often help \none another with supply chain systems and transportation. Al-Qaida has \nalso provided JI with considerable financial support\n  JI and al-Qaida also exploit similar ground as they seek safe haven \nand new recruits. These groups feed on anti-United States and anti-\nWestern sentiment, fueled in part by discontent and anger about United \nStates policies in Iraq. Unfortunately, the administration's refusal to \nprovide a flexible timeline for withdrawing United States troops from \nIraq allows these groups to portray us as occupiers of a Muslim \ncountry. Until we show that we are truly committed to redeploying \nUnited States troops from Iraq, terrorist organizations will continue \nto find recruits in otherwise moderate Muslim communities, and we will \ncontinue to make it harder to win the full backing of potential \npartners and allies in the fight against terrorist networks.\n  It is in this light that I would like to lay out some of my key \nobservations from my recent trip. I will talk about the political and \nsecurity dynamics in both Thailand and Indonesia, and will argue that a \nnew counterterrorism strategy in the region must incorporate respect \nfor human rights, the rule of law, and the need to hold our friends and \nallies accountable for making necessary democratic reforms.\n  I would like to begin with Thailand. Thailand is a critical strategic \npartner of the United States in, among other things, the fight against \nal-Qaida and its affiliates. Our close political and military \nrelationship goes back decades and is a vital component of United \nStates national security policies in the region. The 1954 Manila Pact, \ntogether with the 1962 Thanat-Rusk communique, forms the basis of the \nlongstanding United States-Thai security relationship. Thailand's \nairfields and ports play a particularly important role in United States \nglobal military strategy, including having served as the primary hub of \nthe relief effort for the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n  Thailand has also shown its willingness to stand by the United States \nin\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nrecent military campaigns. Thailand sent 130 soldiers, mostly \nengineers, to Afghanistan to participate in the reconstruction phase of \nOperation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, Thai forces are responsible \nfor the construction of a runway at Bagram Airbase, medical services, \nand some Special Forces operations.\n  Thailand also contributed to reconstruction efforts in Iraq by \ndispatching over 450 troops, including medics and engineers, to the \nsouthern city of Karbala. The deployment proved unpopular with the Thai \npublic, however, particularly in the volatile southern provinces, and \nin September 2004, Thai troops were withdrawn from Iraq.\n  While Thailand has been and will continue to be a strong ally, my \nvisit occurred during a politically fragile time for the government. \nPublic demonstrations and significant political pressure on the Prime \nMinister highlighted the challenges of conducting an effective and \nresponsible counterinsurgency campaign while managing domestic \npolitical pressures. The Thai Government has also struggled to account \nfor over 2,000 extrajudicial killings over the last few years, the \nkidnapping of a prominent human rights lawyer by Thai police and his \ndeath in police custody, and overly aggressive and heavy-handed tactics \nused in the counterinsurgency campaign that in one case resulted in the \nkilling of over 70 detained suspects.\n  At the same time, though, preparations for national celebrations of \nthe King's 60-year reign underscored the underlying stability of \nThailand's constitutional monarchy. It is this stability that has \npermitted the United States to pursue close counterterrorism and other \nstrategic ties with Thailand that transcend individual politicians and \nparties. It also provides the foundation of a partnership that can and \nmust be based not only on an understanding of a common threat, but on a \nshared commitment to finding solutions to the conditions that breed \nextremism and terrorism.\n  My visit to Thailand focused primarily on Thailand's counterterrorism \nrole in the region. As I mentioned, longstanding tensions in the mostly \nMuslim southern provinces of Thailand have recently exploded into \nviolent unrest that has claimed hundreds of lives. The unrest, which \nhas elements of a separatist insurgency, included brutal attacks on \ncivilians. Insurgent tactics have sometimes suggested the influence of \ninternational terrorism, but Thai, United States Government, and \nindependent experts believe that neither al-Qaida nor its Southeast \nAsian affiliates have been behind the violence so far. Thai officials \nhave noted publicly, however, that there has been evidence that many of \nthose involved in the unrest in the south had received militant \nschooling or training outside of Thailand. It is possible that in the \nnear future international terrorist organizations like JI could exploit \nthe continuing unrest in Thailand's southern provinces.\n  The United States needs to have a clear understanding of what is \nhappening in Thailand in order to formulate an appropriate policy \nresponse. With our Thai partners, we must remain vigilant to the \npossibility that international terrorist organizations could take \nadvantage of unrest among disaffected Muslim populations in the south.\n  When I met Prime Minister Thaksin and a number of his key advisors \nand cabinet members, I stressed the need for the Thai Government to \nconfront the root causes of this unrest before it becomes an \ninternational security concern. This means promoting human rights and \naccountability for abuses that have been committed by Thai security \nforces and have helped fuel the unrest, as well as increasing \nopportunities for disaffected or marginalized communities to join \nregional and international economies. It also means promoting civil \nsociety, economic development, transparency and increased political \nparticipation of the Muslim community.\n  I was pleased to learn of the progress being made by the National \nReconciliation Council to address grievances stemming from the \ngovernment's policies in the South. I urged the Prime Minister to take \nseriously the recommendations that the NRC will be delivering in the \ncoming months, and to emphasize the value of honoring the NRC as a \nmechanism for strengthening dialogue between the Thai people and the \ngovernment.\n  I would like to shift to Indonesia now. After 3 days of meeting with \nsenior Indonesian Government officials including the President, the \nForeign and Defense Ministers, the new Chief of the Indonesian \nmilitary, and the police chief, I have a new sense of optimism about \nUnited States-Indonesian relations. But while I am optimistic about \nprogress being made there, limited progress in areas such as military \nreform and accountability for past crimes against humanity could \nundermine further democratic reforms and counterterrorism efforts.\n  Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, and it is a critical \nplayer in the global fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates. The \nterrorist organization al-Jamaah al-Islamiyah and associated groups in \nthe region pose a serious threat to Indonesia and to the interests of \nthe United States, our allies, and our friends. In response to this \nthreat, we need a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy and a \nbilateral relationship with Indonesia aimed at fighting terrorism while \nsupporting that country's efforts at democratization. Fighting \nterrorism and supporting democratization are not incompatible--in fact, \ndemocratic reforms and the growth of civil society in Indonesia have \ngone hand in hand with expanded counterterrorism efforts, providing a \nclear indication that Indonesia's political reforms do not come at the \ncost of the government's ability to fight terrorism.\n  While the United States-Indonesia relationship has never been more \nimportant, Indonesia's effectiveness in countering terrorist networks \nand other emerging threats hinges on its ability to reform its \ngovernment, address past crimes and abuses, and improve both the \ntransparency and the effectiveness of the central and provincial \ngovernments.\n  We cannot forget that the Government of Indonesia has had a poor \nhuman rights record. The Indonesian military in particular has long \nbeen a perpetrator of human rights abuses as well as a serious obstacle \nto democratization. In recent years, efforts to reform the military, \nwhile commendable, have produced mixed results. The greatest \nimprovement has been an increase in civilian control of the military \nand the withdrawal of the military from active politics.\n  Ridding the Indonesian military of its private business holdings and \nproviding greater transparency have been harder to achieve. In some \nareas, the military's treatment of civilian populations has improved, \nbut abuses still occur and there has been virtually no accountability \nfor past human rights violations. There is still a considerable amount \nof distance to travel for the government and the military to become \n``reformed,'' and while progress is being made, more needs to be done.\n  Serious tensions continue in Papua, the remote easternmost province \nof Indonesia. Serious unrest due to repressive government policies, \npoverty, and recent abuses by the Indonesian military and police forces \nhas created an environment of distrust, and I urged the Government of \nIndonesia to address the abuses that are taking place and immediately \nopen up Papua to journalists and human rights organizations. Doing so \nwould be an important step toward making transparency and justice the \nnew norm for Indonesia.\n  United States policy toward Indonesia, including the implementation \nof the administration's decision to resume military assistance, must \ntake these ongoing concerns into account. We must ensure that our \nassistance promotes reform and human rights, we must remain vigilant to \nany backsliding, and we must develop clear benchmarks for progress.\n  Carefully circumscribing any new military assistance is critical to \nformulating an effective bilateral counterterrorism relationship. There \nmay be areas where the Indonesian military's role is warranted, such as \nmaritime security in the Strait of Malacca. But any resurrection of the \nmilitary's historical role in domestic security would be \ncounterproductive to the fight against terrorism, not least because it \nwould likely alienate much of the population. We must therefore make \nclear that such a development would undermine our bilateral \nrelationship.\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\n  We must also be alert to the risk that military assistance could \noverwhelm other elements of a larger counterterrorism strategy. If \nIndonesia is going to effectively fight terrorism, it must develop a \nprofessional, capable, and honest police force and strong judiciary. An \nimbalanced United States assistance program could harm reform efforts \nand undermine Indonesia's nascent efforts to coordinate the \ncounterterrorism roles of its various military, police and civilian \nagencies.\n  Finally, we must expand assistance programs in the areas of \neducation, economic development and the promotion of civil societies. \nNo counterterrorism strategy can succeed unless the political, social \nand economic conditions that breed terrorism are confronted head on.\n  I do believe that we have an opportunity to create and execute a \ncomprehensive and effective counterterrorism strategy in Southeast \nAsia. This strategy needs to take into account the unique nature of \neach of our partners in the region and their internal political, \nsocial, and economic dynamics, while addressing the root causes of \nextremism and the conditions that fuel or support the growth of \nterrorist networks.\n  The United States can take a leadership role in the region and can \nhelp friends and allies like Thailand and Indonesia engage as full \npartners in the fight against terrorist networks. In many cases, the \nUnited States should push strongly for ending abusive or heavy-handed \ngovernment policies, addressing past human rights abuses, and opening \npolitical space that allows the freedom to express political discontent \nor dissatisfaction with government leaders or policies.\n  Unfortunately, our policies in Iraq are making it increasingly \ndifficult to execute such a strategy effectively. Public opinion in \nSoutheast Asia is critically important if we are to dry up potential \nhavens and recruiting grounds for terrorists. In Thailand, neither \nanti-American nor anti-Western sentiment has taken root. At the same \ntime, however, Thai officials have stated that the withdrawal of Thai \ntroops from Iraq was motivated in part by the Iraq war's unpopularity \nin the Muslim community. Indonesians' views on United States policy in \nIraq are harsher still, ranging from indifference to deep suspicion. At \nbest, Iraq is seen as ``America's problem;'' at worst, people question \nour motives for being there. These widely held views make the \ncritically important work of engaging our friends and allies in the \nfight against al-Qaida and its affiliates that much more difficult.\n  There are also opportunity costs to our narrow focus on Iraq. The war \nin Iraq has drained precious resources away from what must be a global \ncounterterrorism strategy, one that addresses the dangers of weak \nstates and regions. The war also undercuts critical elements of this \nstrategy. Widespread global skepticism about our policies in Iraq makes \nit all the more difficult for us to promote human rights and the rule \nof law while seeking partners against extremism and violence.\n  The President's misguided, Iraq-centric foreign policy is both \nsymptom and cause of an alarming failure to conduct a comprehensive, \nglobal war on the terrorist networks that threaten us. Southeast Asia \nis but one of the regions that requires more focused attention. We \ncannot afford to continue treating threats in this and other parts of \nthe world as secondary to an Iraq-focused national security strategy. \nThe time has long since come for the President to set a flexible \ntimeline for withdrawal from Iraq, and to develop a comprehensive, \nglobal strategy to fight terrorist networks and the conditions that \nbreed them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2300-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Specialist Joshua Hill\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nFowlerton. Joshua Hill, 24 years old, died on March 12 when a roadside \nbomb went off as he was clearing a route in eastern Afghanistan with \nother members of his battalion. With his entire life before him, Joshua \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2002 graduate of Madison-Grant High School in Fairmount, Joshua \njoined the Army when his wife Alexis was expecting their first child \nJalin, who is now 6 years old. The couple also has a 1-year-old \ndaughter, Ariana. On the day Joshua was killed, he was only 30 days \naway from returning home. Prior to his time in Afghanistan, Joshua had \nalso done a tour in Iraq, and was studying nursing at the Indiana \nBusiness College. He had one more semester to complete to earn his \ndegree. His parents recalled to a local newspaper the pride they had \nfor their son and how much they would miss his sense of humor and love \nof laughter. His mother, Susan Hill, said, ``I was proud of him, I \ndidn't want him over there, but I'm very proud he went. I loved him \nwith all my heart, he was a good kid, and I'm lucky to have had him for \n24 years.''\n  Joshua was killed while serving his country in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. He was a member of the Ashville-based Company A of the 391st \nEngineering Battalion. This brave young soldier leaves behind his \nmother Susan Kay Hill; his father Terry Kay; his wife Alexis; his son \nJalin; and his daughter Ariana.\n  Today, I join Joshua's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Joshua, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Joshua was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Joshua will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Joshua's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Joshua's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Joshua Hill in the official \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Joshua's \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Joshua.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2300-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2300-S2301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, this year we celebrate the 45th \nAnniversary of the Peace Corps. It is with immense pride that I send my \ncongratulations to Peace Corps volunteers as they commemorate this \nanniversary throughout the year with events across the country and \nthroughout the world.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps to \npromote world peace and friendship. Since then, more than 182,000 Peace \nCorps volunteers have made significant contributions to the cause of \npeace and human progress in 138 countries around the world.\n  Today, we are at a 30-year high in terms of the number of Peace Corps \nvolunteers in the field. In 2005, there were nearly 8,000 volunteers \nserving 75 countries, in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, \nEastern Europe and Central Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and the \nPacific Islands.\n  Throughout its illustrious history, the Peace Corps has been \ncommitted to\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nhelping the people of interested countries train their men and women to \nwork in education, community development, agriculture, health care, and \npublic works. Peace Corps volunteers are also unofficial ambassadors of \ngoodwill, promoting both a better understanding of America throughout \nthe world, and a better understanding here at home of the world around \nus.\n  Today, the Peace Corps' mission is more important than ever. Peace \nCorps volunteers are a critical part of the global fight against HIV/\nAIDS. The Peace Corps was also part of America's response to the \ntsunami, deploying Crisis Corps volunteers to Sri Lanka and Thailand to \nassist with rebuilding tsunami devastated areas. And when Hurricane \nKatrina hit here at home, some 272 Crisis Corps volunteers answered the \ncall to assist with relief efforts along the gulf coast in partnership \nwith the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.\n  It is with great pleasure that I join with Peace Corps volunteers, \npast, present and future, to congratulate the Peace Corps on its 45th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2301-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few brief comments \non the National Security Agency eavesdropping program.\n  The truth is that we don't know what is going on under this program. \nAnd we have an obligation to find out and a committee set up to do just \nthat.\n  Senator Rockefeller has been correct from the beginning to call for a \nfull and thorough Intelligence Committee investigation. I couldn't \nagree more with my colleague from West Virginia and was deeply \ndisappointed his March 7 motion calling for a full committee \ninvestigation failed along party lines.\n  I have been arguing consistently since we found out about this \nprogram in December that we need to do here what we did when we \noriginally crafted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA.\n  For several years preceding the enactment of FISA in 1978, the \nJudiciary and Intelligence Committees conducted extensive public and \nprivate hearings and staff investigations that built the record for the \nact.\n  FISA was a bipartisan product; in the Senate, the original version \nwas sponsored by Senators across the ideological spectrum--including \nBirch Bayh, Ted Kennedy, Mac Mathias, James Eastland, and Strom \nThurmond.\n  The Senate ultimately adopted the bill on April 20, 1978, by a strong \nbipartisan vote of 95 to 1. At the time the bill was approved in the \nSenate, I stated that it ``was a reaffirmation of the principle that it \nis possible to protect national security and at the same time the Bill \nof Rights.'' I was also a member of the conference committee that \nproduced the final version of the law that was enacted with broad \nsupport in October 1978.\n  I was proud of what we were able to accomplish then and sincerely \nhoped that we could undertake the same serious, thoughtful, bipartisan \nprocess here. And the first step is to undertake a full Intelligence \nCommittee investigation, just as my colleague Vice Chairman Rockefeller \nhas been pushing for months.\n  It is essential that such a carefully considered record be developed \nso we don't act precipitously either to legislate or not to legislate. \nIssues concerning the core privacy rights of U.S. citizens, whether we \nare fighting an effective war on terrorism, and the fundamental \nstructure of our separation of powers are directly involved here and \ndeserve a full and thorough examination.\n  At present, our knowledge of the National Security Agency program is \nseverely limited. We need to know much more, for example: No. 1, the \nnature and scope of the program or programs; No. 2, the extent of the \nimpact on U.S. citizens; No. 3, why the administration did not seek \namendments to FISA; No. 4, why some high Justice Department officials \nwere hesitant to approve the program; No. 5, the actual value of the \ninformation gathered; No. 6, how decisions are made on whom to target; \nand No. 7, any procedures followed to protect civil liberties. Senator \nRockefeller understands that we need to know the answers to our \nquestions.\n  But politics and protecting the President seem to be the order of the \nday. I am told one of the committee Republicans went so far as to say \nthat some of the committee Democrats ``believe the gravest threat we \nface is not Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, but rather the president of \nthe United States.'' That is totally uncalled for; it is ridiculous.\n  I understand a special subcommittee has now been created to conduct \nat least some oversight over the NSA surveillance program going \nforward. But this just isn't enough--the whole committee should be \nundertaking an investigation, and it should be a full and thorough \ninvestigation, just as Senator Rockefeller has called for.\n  It also is a grave mistake to put forward legislation authorizing the \nNSA program outside of the FISA system and in advance of actually \nknowing anything about the program, as some of my colleagues are \nproposing. Talk about putting the cart before the horse.\n  So I would hope we learn from history and listen to Senator \nRockefeller. Let's go back to what worked so well in the past when we \nall worked together to craft FISA. Let's first hold a full and thorough \ninvestigation in the Intelligence Committee.\n  Then, and only when we know what is going on, should we make a \njudgment about whether FISA needs to be updated. If additional changes \nneed to be made, this Senator stands ready and willing to engage in \nthat exercise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2301-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2301-S2302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor \nof National Agriculture Day and to discuss a couple of important \nagricultural issues. My home State of Nebraska has a proud agricultural \nheritage. The rural way of life is something we are proud of and we \nbelieve it needs to be preserved.\n  As we begin to analyze the success and failures of the last farm \nbill, we need to thoroughly review that information in order to make \nimprovements to the next farm bill. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I am looking forward to working on this bill \nnext year. I believe there is a lot of work to be done for the American \nfarmer and our rural communities. I have started to call this next bill \nthe Food and Fuel Security Act of 2007 because I believe its focus \nshould be on securing a safe, healthy food supply as well as investing \nin the production of biofuels so as to substantially improve our fuel \nand energy security. I think the focus should be on crafting a bill \nthat is more effective for the majority of farmers and rural \ncommunities and with an emphasis on the opportunities presented by \nbiofuels production.\n  I look forward to listening to the concerns and recommendations of \nfarmers, ranchers and businesses in the coming months as the Senate \nAgriculture Committee begins consideration of this bill. I also look \nforward to reviewing the findings and analysis from Secretary Johanns \nand the USDA as a result of their listening sessions. I will be \nevaluating all of this and other available information and will look to \nwork with the other members of the committee and the Senate to put \nforth an effective Food and Fuel Security Act.\n  One area that will certainly warrant consideration is payment limits \non production subsidies and efforts to transition current production \nsubsidies towards a system more focused on ``green payments'' modeled \nafter programs like the Conservation Security Program, CSP, and the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP. We should also look to \nsignificantly expand those and similar programs to compensate farmers \nfor the environmental and conservation benefits they provide.\n  I believe we must also seriously consider improving our rural \ndevelopment efforts in the next bill. There are opportunities to help \nrural communities by encouraging entrepreneurial investments and \nhelping these communities capitalize on their unique advantages, \nresources, and qualities.\n  Our focus on rural development and improving rural communities must \nalso include addressing the problems young farmers face in choosing the \nfarming way of life. As the current generation of farmers approaches \nretirement, it is imperative that we provide opportunities to those \nmembers of the next generation who are interested in\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nfarming. The daunting obstacles for young farmers, from the price of \nland, equipment and inputs to the low margins from farming, must be \naddressed in a sound manner so that we can help secure this profession \nand America's food security for future generations. Doing so is \nimportant for the rural communities that would otherwise lose these \ntalented young people and the economic activity associated with \nfarming. But this is also important for the future of our Nation's food \nsecurity. I often tell people that if they like importing about 60 \npercent of their fuel now, they are really going to love importing 60 \npercent of their food in the future. Helping a new generation of young \nfarmers get started in farming and helping them work toward successful \ncareers as farmers is vital to securing a safe, healthy, and affordable \nfood supply. We should make this a priority in the Food and Fuel \nSecurity Act.\n  There is another important component of the next bill that has gained \nmuch welcomed attention lately: biofuels. In order to improve our \nenergy and fuel security situation we must make it a priority to invest \nmore into research, market development, and infrastructure development, \nas well as feedstock development, for biofuels. I have long believed \nthe only way to break the cycle of our dependency on foreign oil is to \ninvest in alternative and renewable fuel technology.\n  As a Nebraskan, my focus has been on the role agriculture can play in \nthe development of alternative sources of energy. Agriculture is \npositioned to supply the Nation with an abundant source of clean, high-\nquality energy that will reduce our destructive reliance on foreign \noil.\n  Biofuels production can be the catalyst for a new wave of American \ninnovation in a continuing search for better energy solutions. The \nvirtue in producing cleaner, more sustainable fuels derived from our \nown fields rather than extracted from distant lands could help spur new \ntechnologies, new jobs, and new growth in our national and rural \neconomies.\n  We in Nebraska know the value of ethanol. We know the benefits it \nholds for the environment and our farmers and we know that it is \ncritical in lessening our dependence on foreign oil. We currently have \n11 ethanol facilities in Nebraska that have the capability to produce \n534 million gallons of ethanol annually. These facilities represent \nmore than $700 million of capital investment and have a net value of \nproduction that tops $1 billion annually. Plus, more than six thousand \nNebraskans are now employed directly or indirectly in Nebraska ethanol \nproduction, and we have more facilities and jobs on the way.\n  I believe a national emphasis on biofuels production represents an \nimportant investment in the proud tradition of the American farmer, \nAmerican ingenuity, and American productivity. There is not an area of \nthe country that does not have some agricultural product that can be \nused as an alternative energy source, whether it is corn in Nebraska; \nforestry wastes in the Northeast and Northwest, sugar cane in Hawaii, \nLouisiana, and Florida; or the potential of dedicated energy crops like \nswitchgrass that can be grown throughout the country. So in honor of \nNational Agriculture Day today, I want to emphasize the importance of \nbiofuels for agriculture and for our Nation. We must make increased \nproduction and usage of biofuels a national priority.\n  Today we honor those who work so hard to feed not only the people of \nour Nation but also people around the world. One day is not enough. I \nam thankful for our farmers and agricultural producers every day, but I \nam pleased to pay them a special tribute today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2302-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN AT AND BELLSOUTH\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The proposed merger between AT and BellSouth is \ncontroversial. The proposal should trigger a serious evaluation by both \nthe Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.\n  A recent column in the March 20 issue of Business Week by Leo Hindery \ncaught my eye, and I want to share it with my colleagues. I don't \nnecessarily share all of his conclusions, but I think his perspective \nis an interesting one. I hope that others will weigh in as we try to \nmake a judgment about whether this proposed merger is in the interest \nof the American people.\n  For me, it remains an open question whether this merger should be \nallowed. In the meantime, it is useful to hear many different \nperspectives about it and I wanted to share Leo Hindery's column with \nmy colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the column in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, Mar. 20, 2006]\n\n                           IdeasOutside Shot\n\n                          (By Leo Hindery Jr.)\n\n       Watch This Hookup Closely. Who says you can't put Humpty \n     Dumpty together again? With AT's acquisition of BellSouth, \n     Ma Bell will (almost) be back. The stated justifications for \n     this huge new merger are to save $2 billion a year in \n     expenses on a $120 billion combined revenue base and, says \n     Chief Executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr., to enable the \n     combined company to ``have more products, better services, \n     and better prices.''\n       Unfortunately, neither justification is likely to pan out, \n     and there is not one product or service that AT will have \n     with BellSouth that it could not have had without it. Not \n     one. So the only real advantages from this merger for AT \n     shareholders are a clarified management structure at the two \n     companies' Cingular cellular joint venture and probably \n     slightly faster rollout of wireless Internet calling. Those \n     two changes are certainly important, but they're not nearly \n     desirable enough to allow this merger to proceed without \n     regulators imposing some very tough conditions.\n       I'm so skeptical because every time a major cable-systems \n     merger was proposed in the past, the justifications were \n     essentially the same: modest cost savings that would fuel \n     more services and better prices for consumers. But those \n     never materialized. Why not? Once a telco or major cable \n     company has achieved scale, and they all have by now, these \n     purported justifications become ludicrous, especially when \n     (as with AT and BellSouth) there is little or no \n     preexisting overlap of their service areas.\n       As a businessman and former cable operator, I can \n     appreciate Mr. Whitacre's desire to bulk up to better compete \n     in both traditional telephony and newer growth areas like \n     broadband video distribution. Not only is he battling stiff \n     competition in voice-over-Internet telephony from the likes \n     of Vonage, Google, and Skype, but he also faces an array of \n     newer delivery technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and \n     broadband over power lines. Then there are the major cable \n     companies, which are deeply entrenched in video distribution \n     and have the huge advantage of vertically owning much (in \n     fact, way too much) of the nation's programming.\n       But the telcos and cable already have virtual strangleholds \n     over wire-line access. (A combined AT and BellSouth would \n     control 71 million local phone customers in 22 states.) So \n     this proposed megamerger will be devastating for consumers \n     unless some strong limitations are put on the merged company \n     in two areas: bundling and pricing practices and ``Internet \n     neutrality.''\n       Indeed, with broadband soon to be AT's (and all other \n     significant distributors') major offering, the Bush \n     Administration and the Federal Communications Commission must \n     stand up for consumers and insist that AT, Verizon, Qwest, \n     and cable operators not layer on to their broadband services \n     unreasonable user surcharges and ``speed controls'' that \n     favor one service provider over another. Such acts would \n     crimp consumers' access to the Net and give distributors \n     unwarranted monopoly-like profits and controls. Likewise, \n     regulators must restrict discriminatory bundling and \n     predatory pricing, which limit consumer choice, in both \n     services and content.\n       That's not to say that regulators should crack down only on \n     telcos. Washington should give AT, Verizon, and Qwest \n     nationwide video-transmission rights so they can compete \n     sooner and better with cable in video distribution. And it \n     must end the vice grip of vertical integration that allows \n     programming owned by a distributor (especially cable \n     operators) to be treated more favorably than independent \n     programming. Such vertical integration, when abused; is a \n     fraud on consumers and an impediment to competition. It needs \n     to be restrained, and Mr. Whitacre should demand that as a \n     quid pro quo for the limits that are sure to be imposed on \n     his proposed deal.\n       So let Mr. Whitacre have his merger--heck, the \n     Administration and the FCC let Comcast acquire AT Broadband \n     in 2002 without blinking an eye. But let's hold him to his \n     promise of ``more products, better services, and better \n     prices.'' Given the grave potential for abuse to consumers by \n     those with quasi-monopoly power, the Administration, the FCC, \n     and Congress must impose appropriate restrictions on the \n     AT merger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2302-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2302-S2303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL SUNSHINE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week our country is celebrating the \nsecond annual National Sunshine Week, established last year by an \nextraordinary coalition of print, radio,\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\ntelevision, and online media associations and outlets. And yesterday \nwas national Freedom of Information Day--celebrated every year at a \nnational conference held at the Freedom Forum's World Center in \nArlington, VA, on James Madison's birthday.\n  As we celebrate National Sunshine Week, it is an appropriate time to \nevaluate the significant progress of the past year toward reforming the \nFreedom of Information Act. But we must also recognize that we can--and \nshould--certainly do more to preserve the open-government principles on \nwhich our great country was founded.\n  At a time when Americans reportedly know more about the television \nshow ``The Simpsons'' than they do about the five provisions of the \nfirst amendment--freedom of press, speech, religion, assembly, and \npetition for redress of grievances--or can name the three ``American \nIdol'' judges more readily than three first amendment provisions, \nCongress must do its utmost to preserve these protections while also \neducating the public about reform efforts.\n  The Declaration of Independence makes clear that our inalienable \nrights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness may be secured \nonly where ``Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just \npowers from the consent of the governed.'' And James Madison, the \nfather of our Constitution, wrote that consent of the governed means \ninformed consent--that ``a people who mean to be their own Governors, \nmust arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''\n  As attorney general of Texas, I was responsible for enforcing Texas's \nopen government laws. I have always been proud that Texas is known for \nhaving one of the strongest, most robust freedom of information laws in \nthe country, and I have enjoyed working with my colleagues here in \nWashington to spread a little of that ``Texas Sunshine''.\n  I would specifically like to express my gratitude to Senator Leahy \nand to his staff for all their hard work on these issues of mutual \ninterest and national interest. And I would like to thank and to \ncommend Senator Leahy for his decades-long commitment to freedom of \ninformation. He has been a strong ally and valuable advocate in this \nprocess, and he and I have both noted that openness in government is \nnot a Republican or a Democratic issue. Any party in power is always \nreluctant to share information, out of an understandable--albeit \nultimately unpersuasive--fear of arming its enemies and critics. But \nregardless of our differences on various policy controversies of the \nday, we should all agree that those policy differences deserve a full \ndebate before the American people.\n  While much of the FOIA reform efforts, to date, have focused on \nproviding access generally, more can be done to improve the process \nspecifically. Access to information is certainly essential, but so is \naccelerating the rate at which these requests are fulfilled. Access is \nof little value when requests for information are subjected to lengthy \ndelay.\n  Open government is one of the most basic requirements of a healthy \ndemocracy. The default position of our Government must be one of \nopenness. If records can be open, they should be open. If good reason \nexists to keep something closed, it is the Government that should bear \nthe burden to prove that need--not the other way around.\n  Back in December, President Bush signed an Executive order that \nenhances current FOIA policies. That move was just one important step \ntoward more sunshine in government.\n  But the President's directive moves the country forward toward \nstrengthening open government laws and reinforcing a national \ncommitment to freedom of information in several important ways that I \nwill discuss here just briefly:\n  It affirms that FOIA has provided citizens with important information \nabout the functioning of government;\n  It directs FOIA officials to reduce agency backlogs, create a process \nfor everyday citizens to track the status of their request, and \nestablishes a protocol for requestors to resolve FOIA disputes short of \nfiling litigation;\n  It creates a FOIA service center where people seeking information can \ntrack the status of their requests;\n  And one very good step is that it creates a FOIA public liaison who \nacts as a supervisor of FOIA personnel. This person will be available \nto resolve any disagreements that might arise between people seeking \ninformation and the Government. It also requires each chief FOIA \nofficer to review his or her agency's practices, including ways that \ntechnology is used, in order to set concrete milestones and timetables \nto reduce backlogs and carry out its FOIA responsibilities.\n  Other important progress was made throughout 2005. In June, the \nSenate passed the legislation Senator Pat Leahy and I authored, and \nhopefully the House of Representatives will quickly pass this important \nlegislation. This particular reform creates additional legislative \ntransparency by requiring that any future legislation containing \nexemptions to requirements be ``stated explicitly within the text of \nthe bill.\n  In addition, we introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our \nNational Government Act of 2005--OPEN Government Act, S. 394--in \nFebruary and a separate bill in March to establish an advisory \nCommission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays. A hearing \nheld in March examined the OPEN Government Act. And I urge Congress to \npass this law as quickly as is possible.\n  But, as I said, more remains to be done to ensure that American \ncitizens have access to the information they need. One way we could do \nthat, and something I believe would be a positive and welcome step in \nthis area, would be to provide additional, dedicated funding for FOIA \nresources, to address request backlogs. I believe this could be \naccomplished much in the same way Congress offered assistance to local \nlaw enforcement through providing additional funds so they could \naddress their DNA backlogs or the assistance it provided to the FBI to \naddress its backlog of untranslated intercepts of terrorists' telephone \ncalls. Additional funding dedicated to this problem will speed the rate \ninformation is given to the requestors. Working toward these goals \nmeans that we continue to ensure the public's access to information.\n  Our Founders understood that a free society could not exist without \ninformed citizens and open, accessible government. And as our country \ncelebrates National Sunshine Week, Congress must continue its work to \nrestore and strengthen its commitment to open government and freedom of \ninformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2303-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2303-S2305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RAIL CAPACITY PROBLEMS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an Issue that has \ngreat importance, not just to my home state of South Dakota, but to our \nentire Nation. On the front page of yesterday's Wall Street Journal, a \ncopy of which I will ask to have printed in the Congressional Record, \nthere was an extensive article that highlighted the significant rail \ncapacity problems that exist in the Powder River Basin coal fields of \nWyoming.\n  These rail capacity problems are starting to have a negative impact \non electric utilities and rate payers around the country. The Wall \nStreet Journal article highlighted an Arkansas power plant that ``can't \nget enough coal to run its power plants because the trains that serve \nas its supply line aren't running on time'' and went on to note: \n``Snags in railroad service are fueling fears that railroads won't be \nable to meet the growing demand for coal, casting a cloud over a goal \nset by President Bush and key members of Congress to make America \nenergy independent.''\n  I bring this article to the attention of my colleagues as a reminder \nthat we need to be doing more to address the significant rail capacity \nproblems that exist, not just in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, but \nacross the country. My colleagues will be interested to know that the \nU.S. Department of Transportation projects that there will be a 55-\npercent increase in freight rail transportation demand by 2020.\n  While major railroads such as Union Pacific, Burlington Northern and \nSanta Fe, and Norfolk Southern are making significant improvements to \ntheir rail systems, these investments can't keep up with the demand \nthey face--even though U.S. railroads are slated to invest a record $8 \nbillion in capital expenditures this year. Just to\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nshow how expensive rail infrastructure is, it costs private railroads \nanywhere from $1 million to $3 million per mile to lay new track, not \nto mention the costs associated with ongoing maintenance.\n  While the larger Class I railroads are in a much better financial \nposition to make infrastructure investments, the smaller Class II and \nIII railroads are not as capable of making large-scale infrastructure \nimprovements--even though they are responsible for roughly 30 percent \nof the 140,000 miles of rail that exist in our country.\n  In an effort to assist the smaller Class II and III railroads as they \nwork to make much needed improvements to their rail infrastructure, \nCongress passed the short line railroad tax credit as part of the 2004 \nFSC/ETI tax bill. This tax credit has started to bolster rail \nimprovements among smaller railroads across the country. However, it is \nslated to expire in 2007.\n  There is also an additional Federal rail program that seeks to \nimprove the overall condition of our Nation's rail system. In the \n1970s, Congress created a loan program to spur rail improvements among \nClass I, II, and III railroads. This loan program, the Railroad \nRehabilitation Improvement Financing Program, commonly referred to as \nRRIF, was dramatically improved as part of the Transportation \nReauthorization bill, SAFETEA-LU, that was signed into law last year. \nThese RRIF improvements not only increased the program's overall \nlending authority from $3.5 billion to $35 billion, but a number of \nmuch needed improvements were made to ensure that the RRIF Program \nfunctions as Congress originally intended it to.\n  The RRIF Program is unique because it allows a railroad to receive a \nloan for infrastructure improvements at the Government lending rate. \nThis assists small railroads in particular because they don't have the \nfinancial wherewithal that their large Class I counterparts have. RRIF \nloans must be paid back with interest by qualifying applicants who are \nalso required to provide full collateral to protect the Federal \nGovernment and the American taxpayer against the risk of default. Since \nthe program's creation in 1976, there has been only one default, which \nunderscores the overall success of the program.\n  The Wall Street Journal article I am submitting for the Record went \non to describe the fact that a railroad based in my home State of South \nDakota, the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, DM, has recently \nreceived approval from the Surface Transportation Board for their \nexpansion project that would add much needed rail capacity to the \nPowder River Basin of Wyoming. When completed, this project will not \nonly add rail capacity, but it will dramatically reduce shipping costs \nfor agricultural products, ethanol, coal, and other commodities.\n  As a result of the RRIF improvements in last year's Transportation \nBill, this is just one example of how smaller railroads across the \ncountry are working to address a serious need that if left unmet will \ndrive utility rates up and hamstring our Nation's ability to \nefficiently move finished goods and raw materials across the country \nand in the global marketplace.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Taking Lumps: As Utilities Seek More Coal, Railroads Struggle to \n                                Deliver\n\n                (By Rebecca Smith and Daniel Machalaba)\n\n       During the past 10 months, Arkansas Electric Cooperative \n     Corp. has been forced to do things that power generators hate \n     to do: It cut electricity production at plants that are the \n     cheapest to operate and ran its costliest units harder than \n     ever. At times, it even bought electricity on the open market \n     at top prices.\n       The electricity co-op made these moves because it is afraid \n     of running out of coal. That's surprising in a country with \n     such vast domestic reserves that some dub it the ``Saudi \n     Arabia of coal.'' But Arkansas Electric has a problem that is \n     a growing concern for many U.S. utilities: It can't get \n     enough coal to run its power plants because the trains that \n     serve as its supply line aren't running on time. Delays in \n     coal shipments to the Arkansas generator began last May with \n     rail disruptions in Wyoming and forced the utility to burn \n     more natural gas, lifting its 2005 power-generation costs by \n     21%, or $100 million.\n       Nearly a year after problems began, ``coal deliveries still \n     aren't back to normal,'' says Steve Sharp, head of fuel \n     procurement for Arkansas Electric, which furnishes power to \n     17 utilities. That, in turn, inflated power bills by about \n     $20 a month for residential electricity consumers across much \n     of Arkansas. For big industrial energy users, the hit was \n     even greater. Matt Szymanski, general manager of Green Bay \n     Packaging Inc., which operates a paper mill in Morrilton, \n     Ark., says he ``freaked out when I saw the power bill for \n     December,'' which was double that from a year ago.\n       At a time of surging prices for petroleum and natural gas \n     and rising anxiety about U.S. reliance on overseas energy \n     sources, coal more than ever is seen as the U.S.'s dirty, but \n     reliable, ace in the hole. With 27% of the world's proven \n     reserves, the U.S. in recent years has seen stable coal \n     prices relative to other fuels used for power generation. But \n     the ability of railroads to get coal to power plants when \n     it's needed is suddenly no sure thing.\n       Consolidation has left the rail industry with just a half-\n     dozen major operators, which have been cutting rail routes \n     and costs since the industry was deregulated in 1980. That \n     can cause paralyzing bottlenecks when something goes wrong. \n     Last year, a series of derailments dramatically delayed coal \n     shipments from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, one of the \n     nation's most important coal-producing regions. The delays \n     have cut into fuel supplies at many coal-fired power plants \n     around the country. In some cases, supplies are perilously \n     low.\n       Now, the utilities are pouncing on the delays and a \n     longstanding beef over concentrated ownership of rail routes, \n     which crimps competition. Major utilities are asking members \n     of Congress to hold hearings on the coal-delivery problems. \n     They may ask Congress to direct the federal regulator, the \n     Surface Transportation Board, to establish reliability \n     standards for railroad deliveries and enforce them if \n     necessary. In the past, Congress hasn't shown much interest \n     in imposing new regulations on the railroads. But the fact \n     that coal-delivery problems in some cases could threaten the \n     reliability of power supplies pushes the contest to a new \n     level. Meanwhile, the railroads are seeking a 25% federal tax \n     credit on investments that expand railroad capacity.\n       For decades, coal was the No.1 commodity moved over the \n     rails. Lately it has been displaced in the rankings by \n     consumer goods, with much of that cargo pouring into West \n     Coast ports from Asia. The utilities recently have been \n     required to pay sharply higher rail rates. As their old \n     negotiated contracts expire, the utilities are forced to pay \n     the railroads' standard rates, pushing up fees by 20% to \n     100%.\n       Railroads are strained by a surge in freight of all types--\n     from coal to containers--and rail rates are going up across \n     the board. But the utility industry is complaining loudest. \n     Snags in railroad service are fueling fears that railroads \n     won't be able to meet the growing demand for coal, casting a \n     cloud over a goal set by President Bush and key members of \n     Congress to make America ``energy independent.''\n       The big rail carriers stress that the industry, after years \n     of overcapacity and dismal profits, finally is in good enough \n     shape to invest heavily. Meddling by the government now, says \n     Chris Jenkins, a vice president of CSX Corp.'s railroad \n     subsidiary, is ``the surest way to wreck the railroad system \n     and prevent us from making the types of investments that are \n     necessary.''\n       Matthew Rose, chairman, president and chief executive of \n     Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., estimates that the \n     railroad has spent about $2.7 billion since 1994 to maintain \n     and expand capacity for moving Powder River Basin coal. He \n     says that when the Clean Air Act of 1990 kicked off the \n     demand for low-sulfur Western coal, the railroads stepped up. \n     They have increased the amount of coal hauled from the Basin, \n     including a section in Montana, to about 400 million tons a \n     year from half that in 1990. The area now accounts for about \n     40% of the U.S. coal mined.\n       ``We have provided just incredibly reliable transportation \n     and have allowed tremendous growth of the basin since 1990,'' \n     he says, calling the problems in Wyoming last year an \n     ``episodic event'' that's unlikely to be repeated.\n       Big utilities, until recently, have shied away from a \n     public confrontation. But Michael Morris, chief executive of \n     American Electric Power Co., Columbus, Ohio, warned Congress \n     in mid-February that ``railroads have put the electric \n     industry in a potential crisis situation this winter and next \n     summer.''\n       Bringing the matter to Congress, rather than trying to work \n     things out quietly, shows how much the level of frustration \n     has grown. Some utilities, backed by state regulators, are \n     clamoring for more federal review of rail rates and the \n     creation of national service-quality standards, backed by \n     penalties for infractions.\n       One reason for hope in the long term: Rail regulators this \n     year approved an application of the Dakota, Minnesota & \n     Eastern Railroad Corp. to build a new line out of the Powder \n     River Basin. Although it would take three years or more to \n     construct, a new line could shake up the dominance of Union \n     Pacific Corp. and Burlington Northern by adding 25%, or 100 \n     million tons, of new capacity. The railroad is seeking a $2.5 \n     billion loan\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\n     from the Federal Government and commitments from utilities to \n     use the new route.\n       In the short run, utilities are worried that a shortage of \n     coal this summer, when air-conditioning use pushes \n     electricity demand to its peak, could force them to buy power \n     on the expensive spot market. The utility industry estimates \n     that the cost of substituting more expensive fuels for the 20 \n     million tons of Powder River Basin coal held up in Wyoming \n     and Montana last year topped $3 billion.\n       ``We're going to have a really huge problem if railroads \n     aren't held accountable for reliable deliveries and \n     reasonable prices,'' says Sandra Hochstetter, chairwoman of \n     the Arkansas Public Service Commission, who wants the Federal \n     Government to exercise more forceful control.\n       The deteriorating relationship comes as the power sector \n     heads for greater reliance on coal, which long has been used \n     to create about half the nation's electricity. For the last \n     10 years, the industry has been building natural-gas-fired \n     plants almost exclusively because the fuel is cleaner and the \n     price was attractive. As natural-gas supplies and prices have \n     become a problem, the power industry is shifting to coal in a \n     big way, with plans to build more than 100 coal-fired power \n     plants in coming years at a potential cost of more than \n     $100 billion. The federal Energy Information \n     Administration forecasts that the electric-power industry \n     will produce 3% more electricity from coal in 2007 than in \n     2005. Production from natural gas is projected to drop by \n     2% over the same period.\n       Unlike natural gas, which flows smoothly and silently \n     through thousands of miles of underground pipelines, coal \n     must be loaded onto trains of 100 cars or more and hauled \n     across hundreds or thousands of miles of prairie, towns and \n     farmland to where it's burned.\n       Although one unit of gas is nearly indistinguishable from \n     another, coal types vary greatly and utilities have \n     incentives to acquire it from more sources than in the past. \n     One big reason is tighter air-pollution rules. Many \n     Midwestern and Eastern utilities want more of the Western \n     coal in their mix because it's ``low sulfur'' and therefore \n     less polluting. But Eastern coal burns hotter, which means a \n     given volume will make more electricity. The various types \n     also carry different prices: A survey Feb. 17 by the EIA \n     found Powder River coal selling for $16.85 a short ton versus \n     $58.25 for Central Appalachian coal and $45 for Northern \n     Appalachian coal. The trade-offs complicate railroad \n     logistics since many utilities want to burn a mix of coals \n     now.\n       Railroads say the power industry's sudden interest in coal \n     over natural gas caught them by surprise. Now, the railroads \n     are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build new \n     double- and triple-track stretches and buy additional \n     locomotives.\n       Wall Street investors, for the most part, want railroads to \n     keep their capacity tight, so as not to erode their newfound \n     pricing power.\n       The recent coal-delivery problem has its roots in something \n     fairly mundane. Last spring, an accumulation of coal dust \n     that had fallen or blown from moving cars in Wyoming \n     prevented track beds from draining properly. Amid the spring \n     thaw and heavy rain, the poor drainage left the water with no \n     place to go. That resulted in derailments and track damage \n     along stretches of the major railroad line that takes coal \n     trains that are more than a mile long out of the Powder River \n     Basin. As a result, the railroads sharing the line--Union \n     Pacific and Burlington Northern--failed to meet their coal-\n     delivery commitments. Shipments picked up late last year, but \n     it takes a long time to make up for lost loads, given how \n     taxed the rail system is already.\n       The consolidation has left little backup capacity and fewer \n     options to reroute freight when there are floods, derailments \n     or other service breakdowns. Some of the biggest bottlenecks \n     are in major rail hubs such as Chicago. When trains get \n     backed up in one place, the effects ripple through the \n     system.\n       Consider Laramie River Station, a big power plant in \n     southeastern Wyoming that is owned by six utilities and \n     furnishes power to consumers in nine states. At this time of \n     year, the plant would normally have 700,000 tons of coal on \n     hand. But it's now down to 140,000 tons even though the plant \n     is only 170 miles from the Powder River Basin. At 125,000 \n     tons, which it may reach in the next few days, the plant \n     likely will cut production. ``Already, the bulldozers are \n     scraping up dirt with the coal,'' says Shelly Sahling-\n     Zart, assistant counsel of the Lincoln Electric System, a \n     member of the consortium.\n       Representatives of the Laramie River consortium say the \n     delivery problems began soon after a long-term contract with \n     Burlington Northern--the railroad serving the plant--expired \n     in late 2004 and have gotten progressively worse. Adding to \n     the sense of injury was the fact that rates were doubled. \n     Burlington Northern spokesman Richard Russack says the \n     railroad committed a train of its own in February, \n     supplementing the three trains owned by the utilities. Trains \n     used in the area tend to have 125 to 135 coal-carrying hopper \n     cars. But, given that the facility is short the equivalent of \n     5,833 hopper cars, it's doubtful the plant can catch up in \n     its reserves very fast. The utilities say they're paying \n     $70,000 a month for the extra train.\n       For utilities, the problem is that the road to relief--\n     either for service-quality problems or high rates--runs \n     through the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency \n     that reviews railroad mergers, rates and service. Utilities \n     generally feel the board favors railroads over their \n     customers. Board Chairman W. Douglas Buttrey says his tiny \n     agency, created in 1995 to replace the once-huge Interstate \n     Commerce Commission, has an obligation to ``balance the \n     interests.'' But the board's power over railroads is limited. \n     The industry is exempt from some aspects of antitrust law and \n     the board can only rule on whether its prices are reasonable.\n       Otter Tail Power Co., a small Minnesota utility, recently \n     concluded it had had enough of rising rail rates at the hands \n     of Burlington Northern, which provides the only rail service \n     to Otter Tail's power plant in Big Stone City, S.D. The first \n     step in filing its protest with the Surface Transportation \n     Board: paying the board's $102,000 filing fee.\n       Under an arcane procedure required to make its case, Otter \n     Tail created a virtual railroad on paper--complete with \n     hypothetical routes, equipment, freight and customers--to \n     show that even a brand-new rail line would be able to serve \n     Otter Tail's coal needs at a lower cost than Burlington \n     Northern. But in February, after a four-year case that \n     ultimately cost $4.5 million, the board told Otter Tail that \n     its arguments came up short and the higher rates would stand.\n       A growing group of members of Congress is worried about \n     deteriorating rail service and the high cost to consumers. \n     Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, introduced a bill \n     that would slash fees for rate challenges to $150, require \n     faster action by the board and eliminate the ``virtual \n     railroad'' economic modeling. Others are looking at a host of \n     remedies, including reimposing some antitrust rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2305-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2305-S2306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to decry the failure of the \nUnited Nations to create a human rights body that deserves U.S. \nsupport. I regret that the United Nations, tasked with the solemn duty \nto craft a Human Rights council that would be beyond reproach, has \nfailed in its mission. It has created a council that in its essential \ncomponents has the same failings as its predecessor, the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights.\n  The U.N. Commission on Human Rights is an embarrassment. The U.N. \nSecretary General admitted as much in March 2005 when he said that, \n``the Commission on Human Rights suffers from declininq credlibility \nand professionalism, and is in major need of reform'' and that a \nfundamental problem is that, ``States have sought membership . . . not \nto strengthen human rights but to protect themselves against criticism \nor to criticize others.''\n  Just look at the current Members of the Commission on Human Rights, \nthe U.N.'s primary human rights body. They include some of the world's \nworst human rights violators, such as China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, \nVenezuela, and Zimbabwe.\n  The United States and other countries quite rightly called for the \nabolition of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and its replacement \nwith a new Human Rights Council. The Secretary General endorsed the \nneed for a smaller body that would be less likely to include countries \nfound complicit in massive and sustained human rights abuses would be \nable to serve.\n  Unfortunately, true reform was not embraced by the U.N. The Council \nwill have 47 members instead of 53. That's far above the 20 member \nlevel proposed by the United States. And members will not be selected \nprimarily on the basis of their commitment to human rights. In fact, \nthere are no real criteria for membership. Even countries under \nSecurity Council sanctions for human rights violations or terrorism are \nnot categorically excluded from membership on the Council.\n  The protection of human rights is of fundamental value to the United \nStates. The United States has become used to having a presence on the \nU.N.'s primary human rights body. The US has been a member of the \ncommission every term since 1947, with one exception. That will no \nlonger be the case. Due to a rotating membership on the new council, \nthe United States would be ineligible for Human Rights Council \nmembership every six years. So our country, which has been at the \nforefront of promoting human rights would periodically lose its seat \nbut still be required to cover 22 percent of the Human Rights Council's \ncosts. Mr. President, in my book this makes this new U.N. Council worse \nthan the discredited U.N. Commission on Human Rights.\n  President Bush noted in his remarks before the U.N. General Assembly \nin\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nSeptember 2005, ``When this great institution's member states choose \nnotorious abusers of human rights to sit on the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission, they discredit a noble effort, and undermine the \ncredibility of the whole organization. If member countries want the \nUnited Nations to be respected--respected and effective, they should \nbegin by making sure it is worthy of respect.''\n  Mr. President, I am proud that the United States stood firm and \nopposed the creation of this fatally flawed Human Rights Council. Our \ncountry understood that to affirm this new council with our vote would \nhave granted it legitimacy. The United States should be consistent. We \nshould decline to participate on the council and fund the council for \nthe very same reason we voted against it. Our country should not \nsupport a U.N. Human Rights Council which permits countries found \ncomplicit in sustained human rights abuses to be eligible for \nmembership.\n  Mr. President, I am embarrassed to say that some in the State \nDepartment are suggesting that even though we voted against the \ncreation of the council we should take a wait-and-see approach and \nsupport it in the interim. That makes no sense. If this council had a \nchance to work, then the U.S. should have voted for it.\n  Mr. President, other nations may not like what we stand for--but they \nknow where we stand. U.S. human rights policy needs to be consistent \nand clear. We need to take a different wait-and-see approach. No \nparticipation and no funding until the U.N. proves that member states \nwill not elect human rights violators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2306-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PROBLEM WITH KITCHEN-TABLE GUN DEALERS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, the Violence Policy Center, VPC, \nreleased a report which analyzes statistics related to basic Federal \nFirearms License, FFL, holders in the United States since 1992. The \nreport warns of a large group of current FFL holders it calls \n``kitchen-table dealers.'' The VPC defines this group as ``individuals \nwho conduct business out of their homes and offices and do not operate \nactual gun or sporting goods stores'' and estimates that more than half \nof current FFL holders fit into this group. Disturbingly, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, ATF, found in 2000 that 23 \npercent of its illegal gun trafficking investigations involved \n``kitchen-table dealers'' who were responsible for the illegal \ntrafficking of more than 40,000 guns.\n  According to the VPC, many ``kitchen-table dealers'' have no interest \nin actually selling firearms, but they obtain an FFL because of the \nexemptions it provides from Federal requirements including background \nchecks, waiting periods, and limits on the number of guns that can be \npurchased. Under current law, an FFL holder must be a person who \n``devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a \nregular course of trade or business with the principal objective of \nlivelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of \nfirearms.'' However, a February 2000 ATF report found that 31 percent \nof FFL holders had not reported selling a single firearm in the \nprevious year. Unfortunately, rather than allowing the ATF to work \nwithin the law to revoke illegitimate FFLs and help to eliminate a \nsource of illegally trafficked firearms, opponents of commonsense gun \nsafety laws inserted a provision in the fiscal year 2006 Department of \nJustice Appropriations bill which prevents the ATF from denying the \napplication or renewal of a FFL due to a lack of business activity.\n  In its report, the VPC calls on Congress to rescind this provision \nand proposes a number of other ideas to help eliminate the abuse of \nFFLs. Among other things, the VPC proposes that all FFL holders be \nrequired to operate from a storefront business devoted primarily to the \nsale of firearms, rather than a residence, and securely store \ninventories of firearms. Additionally, the VPC suggests an expansion of \nATF's ability to inspect FFL businesses for compliance with record \nkeeping and safety requirements.\n  We must do more to eliminate the abuse of FFLs in order to reduce the \nnumber of guns that are illegally bought and sold in our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2306-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2306-S2307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KENYA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to bring attention to troubling \npolitical developments in Kenya. Earlier this week, Kenyans witnessed \nthe most aggressive assault on media since the country's independence \nin 1963, when elite police and paramilitary commandos armed with AK-47s \nstormed the offices of the Standard Group's TV station, Kenya \nTelevision Network and the Standard newspaper. Internal Security \nMinister John Michuki ordered the event in an apparent attempt to \nprevent the newspaper from publishing a story on a sensitive political \nmatter. Saying little more than ``when you rattle a snake you must \nprepare to be bitten,'' President Kibaki has failed to take swift and \nsufficient action to condemn this event.\n  Unfortunately, this event, while deeply troubling in itself, is but \nthe latest manifestation of a larger problem in Kenya today. Over the \nlast year, President Kibaki and senior members of his government have \npresided over a growing level of turmoil concerning corruption charges, \nmismanagement of public funds, insufficient anti-corruption efforts, \nand political favoritism. Particularly troubling are allegations that \nsenior members of Kibaki's government have been involved in a number of \nlarge, illegal business dealings with public money. The most visible of \nthese allegations--which Mr. Kibaki apparently knew about more than a \nyear ago--came to light in a report written by the man who was \nappointed by the president himself to help expose corruption. He is now \nin London in exile after receiving death threats.\n  I am concerned that Kenya may be backsliding. Just 4 years ago, the \nKenyan people went to the polls and marked an historic event in the \ncountry's political history. Kenyans unambiguously rejected years of \nmismanagement, corruption, and declining economic growth experienced \nunder previous regimes. The opposition National Rainbow Coalition, \nNARC, was overwhelmingly elected to power, ending more than 40 years of \nrule by the Kenya African National Union, KANU. Now, only 4 years after \nthese elections, President Kibaki's government is beginning to revert \nto strong-man tactics as evidenced in this week's raid. It also \napparently unwilling to take seriously the significant corruption \npresent throughout senior levels of Kenya's government and in the \npresident's own cabinet.\n  While these are discouraging developments, I am heartened that the \nKenyan people have responded with such passion. Kenyans are rightfully \noutraged. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets of Nairobi on \nTuesday, and a range of media sources denounced the raid as \n``thuggish'' and ``corrupt.'' Radio programs, TV shows, and newspapers \nare devoting significant attention to the government's inept management \nof corruption charges and the recent raid. Resignations of key \nministers, new court cases, and active opposition parties are all \ntestaments to the positive political developments Kenya has made. It is \nessential that Kenyans do not lose this progress.\n  We have an opportunity to send a firm message to President Kibaki \nthat this type of behavior does not benefit his government or the \nKenyan people. Kenya is a critical partner in a particularly important \nregion. It has served as a leader in the region and in Africa, and will \ncontinue to be a friend to the United States. But if Kenya's government \nwants to maintain its credibility as a government representative of the \nKenyan people and a leader in the region, it must take immediate \nactions to address recent developments and renew its pledge to fight \ncorruption.\n  In conclusion, the international community must condemn in the \nstrongest manner possible the Kenyan government's use of security \nforces to limit political discussion and the freedom of the press. The \ninternational community must also support efforts of Kenyan citizens to \nhold their government accountable for weeding out corruption and \npolitical favoritism. As the country turns its attention toward the \n2007 general elections, the international community must help Kenyans \nstrengthen democratic processes, advance political freedoms, and fight \ncorruption--and perhaps most importantly, signal to President Kibaki \nthat\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\ntoo much progress has been made in Kenya to allow for a reversion to \nold, corrupt, violent political practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2307-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nIndianapolis police officer Peter Alfred Koe for his extraordinary \nvalor above and beyond the call of duty. Today, in honor of his \ncourageous service, Officer Koe received the Public Safety Officers \nMedal of Valor from President Bush. Officer Koe is one of only five \npublic safety officers selected nationwide to receive the medal, and I \ncould not be more proud that a Hoosier like Officer Koe is the \nrecipient of such a prestigious award.\n  On August 18, 2004, Officer Koe of the Indianapolis Police Department \nreceived information that several fellow officers had been shot by a \nviolent gunman. He and other officers responded immediately to the \nscene, where a hidden gunman shot and wounded Officer Koe. He suffered \na gunshot wound to his left leg and additional injuries to his face and \nbody from flying glass and debris. However, rather than succumbing to \nhis own injuries, Officer Koe charged the gunman to prevent him from \nfurther harming any of the other wounded officers. Despite his own \ncritical injuries, he exchanged fire with the attacker and effectively \nsubdued him. When medical personnel responded to the scene, Officer Koe \nurged them to assist the other officers, selflessly deflecting \nattention from his own serious wounds.\n  Throughout this encounter, Officer Koe displayed remarkable valor and \ncomposure under fire. For this, I commend him and offer my sincere \ngratitude on behalf of Indiana for his outstanding service to the \ncitizens of our state.\n  While the events of August 18 demonstrated Officer Koe's abilities, I \nalso want to thank him for his day-to-day work that may not generate \nthe same headlines as a shoot-out or enjoy the glamour of an award but \nis equally crucial to the safety of Indianapolis residents.\n  Officer Koe and all of his colleagues at the Indianapolis Police \nDepartment make daily sacrifices to ensure the safety of our \nIndianapolis streets, keeping our families safe and our neighborhoods \nsecure. In an increasingly dangerous world, we depend on our first \nresponders to defend us against violence and other threats to our \ncommunities, and I know that many Indianapolis families sleep better at \nnight knowing that people like Officer Koe are protecting them.\n  Officer Koe and countless others like him dedicate each day to \njustice as they protect and serve all Hoosiers. I am sure I speak for \nmany Indianapolis area residents when saying thank you to Officer Koe. \nHe went above and beyond the call of duty, and we are forever indebted \nto him for the lives that he has saved.\n  On behalf of the State of Indiana, it is my honor to enter this \ntribute in the official record of the Senate in recognition of Officer \nKoe's award and his many years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2307-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMEMORATING DR. JOE AGUILLARD\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Dr. Joe \nAguillard, who will be inaugurated as the eighth president of Louisiana \nCollege on March 23. Dr. Aguillard has been serving as president of \nthis Christian liberal arts school since January of 2005.\n  Joe Aguillard has been on faculty at Louisiana College since 2000, \nbut his personal history with the college is a long and storied one. \nBoth of Dr. Aguillard's parents attended Louisiana College and met at \nthe liberal arts school. He and his wife also met at Louisiana College, \nand all three of their children have attended their parents' alma \nmater.\n  On top of having a close connection to Louisiana College, Dr. \nAguillard also has a proven academic track record. In addition to a \nbachelor's degree from Louisiana College, he also has two master's \ndegrees from McNeese State University, as well as a doctorate in \neducation from Nova Southeastern University. Dr. Aguillard previously \nheld the positions of chair of the Division of Education, coordinator \nof the Department of Teacher Education, and Associate Professor of \nEducation.\n  Joe Aguillard is a top notch educator whose ability is sure to lead \nLouisiana College to its greatest days. Under his leadership the \nTeacher Education Department has consistently received high marks from \nthe Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. He also led a group of \nLouisiana College education students in researching and writing the \ncurriculum for the Heart of Spain art exhibit at the Alexandria Museum \nof Art in 2003, and that curriculum was used by teachers and their \nstudents around the world.\n  Dr. Aguillard has maintained a lifetime commitment to learning and \neducating, and his contribution to the state of Louisiana is greatly \nappreciated. I come to the Senate floor today to join the students and \nfaculty of Louisiana College in personally commending Dr. Joe Aguillard \nand wishing him great success in his new post.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2307-4", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO ROBERT E. BAUTE, M.D.\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay special tribute \nto Dr. Robert E. Baute of Warwick, RI.\n  Since 1970, Dr. Baute has tended to the needs of Rhode Islanders in \nvarious capacities, specializing in internal medicine and pulmonary \ndiseases. For the past 10 years, he has served with distinction as the \nPresident and CEO of Kent County Memorial Hospital in Warwick, RI. On \nMarch 30, 2006, Dr. Baute will retire after 36 years as a member of the \nKent medical staff, and nearly 20 years as an administrator.\n  A graduate of Yale University in 1959, Dr. Baute went on to serve \nwith distinction in the U.S. Navy and received his degree from the \nHahnemann University School of Medicine in 1966. Following in the \nfootsteps of his father, he engaged in a private medical practice for \n18 years, and simultaneously emerged as a leader in the administration \nat Kent County Hospital. Throughout his distinguished administrative \ncareer, Dr Baute served as chief of internal medicine, vice president \nand medical director, and as a member of the board of trustees. In \n1995, he was named as president and chief executive officer.\n  In all of these capacities, Dr. Baute fought tirelessly to further \nthe scope and quality of care provided by Kent Hospital, and \nsuccessfully brought new services and modern treatments to the \ncommunity, while holding himself and his staff to the highest standards \nof quality, safety, and patient satisfaction. His support for the \ncreation of the Care New England Health Care System was instrumental in \nits success, and his lifelong pursuit of quality, affordable, and \naccessible health care services has been nothing short of remarkable.\n  I join with all Rhode Islanders in expressing gratitude for Dr. \nBaute's efforts to advance the scope and quality of medical treatment \nin our State, and I congratulate him for the many achievements in his \noutstanding career.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2308-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n                 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOODYEAR BLIMP\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Company, based in Akron, OH, upon the 80th \nanniversary of the operation of its Goodyear Blimps. Since 1925, the \nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Company has operated its blimps throughout the \ncountry, providing aerial coverage of sporting events and other major \npublic gatherings. Over time, the Goodyear Blimp has become one of the \nmost readily recognizable corporate symbols in the United States and \nthroughout the world. I wish Goodyear the best, as it celebrates the \n80th anniversary of the Blimp, and ask that the following proclamation \nhonoring this occasion be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n   A Proclamation Honoring the Goodyear Blimp on Its 80th Anniversary\n\n       Whereas, the Goodyear Blimps have been operating in the \n     skies of America since 1925; and\n       Whereas, from 1941 to 1944, Goodyear built airships for the \n     United States military to help protect America and its troops \n     by escorting convoys safely across the Atlantic during World \n     War II; and\n       Whereas, for 45 years, the Goodyear Blimps have provided \n     aerial television coverage of America's most-watched sports, \n     entertainment and news events, including Super Bowls, World \n     Series, Final Four Tournaments, college football bowl games, \n     and political conventions; and\n       Whereas, the Goodyear Blimps have responded to requests \n     from the American Red Cross and other emergency response \n     agencies and used their aerial electronic signs to help \n     victims of hurricanes and earthquakes by communicating with \n     victims to let them know where to find help, food, water, and \n     medical aid; and\n       Whereas, the Goodyear Blimps annually support non-profit \n     and public service groups through promotional programs and \n     rides donated to the charities, which are then auctioned off \n     helping to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars every year; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Goodyear Blimps are celebrating their 80th \n     Anniversary as the world famous icon for America and the \n     Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.\n       Now, therefore, I, Mike DeWine, United States Senator from \n     the Great State of Ohio, join with the residents of Ohio and \n     the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in honoring the Goodyear \n     Blimp on its 80th Anniversary.\n       On this, the Sixteenth of March, Two Thousand and \n     Six.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2308-2", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE LIFE OF SAMUEL M. SHARKEY, JR\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Sam \nSharkey, who died on Tuesday at the age of 90. Mr. Sharkey, who joined \nthe New York Times in 1945 as a copy editor on the foreign desk, was \none of the founding executives of its International Air Edition, now \nthe International Herald Tribune, in 1948, and in 1950 he became head \nof the national news desk. Five years later, he moved to the National \nBroadcasting Company as its first editor of NBC News, a position \ncomparable to the editor of a newspaper, and was one of a triumvirate \nof executives who in 1956 put together the Huntley-Brinkley news \nprogram.\n  While working at the Times, he had become frustrated with the \nslowness with which the two major wire services reported national \nelection returns--one relayed all returns from west of Kansas City \nthrough that city and the other through Chicago, both producing delays. \nIn 1956 at NBC, he invented a system based at the start on buying the \nfastest Associated Press State wires in every State and funneling their \nreturns electronically through 10 centers around the United States, \nthence to computers in Studio 8-H in New York, where they were \ndisplayed immediately, beating all competition by substantial margins. \nHis system for collecting votes in national elections is still used \ntoday by broadcasters, wire services, and newspapers.\n  In 1958, Mr. Sharkey expanded the system and turned to volunteer \nteams of members of the League of Women Voters in every State who \nstaffed every polling place and phoned in results to State \nheadquarters, where the data were sent electronically directly to \ncomputers in the studio. In 1960, CBS News and the ABC News were added \nto form the Network Election Service, a cooperative. That was expanded \nwith the addition of the A.P. and United Press International to form \nthe News Election Service, which continues to this day. At NBC, Mr. \nSharkey also headed an internal NBC News Service at national political \nconventions linking reporters at various locations with Chet Huntley \nand David Brinkley at the anchor desk.\n  Born March 26, 1915, in Trenton, NJ, he began covering sports on a \n``stringer,'' free lance, basis for the Trenton State Gazette at the \nage of 13. He attended Rutgers University in the class of 1937 but was \na Depression dropout. He then worked for the State Gazette as sports \neditor, columnist, reporter, music and theater critic, and acting city \neditor. Among the stories he covered were the kidnapping of the \nLindbergh baby and the trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the crash of \nthe Hindenburg at Lakehurst, and the burning of the Bermuda cruise \nliner Morro Castle off Asbury Park, NJ.\n  He was a copy editor on the Saratoga Springs, NY, Saratogian and \nforeign editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer during World War II. He \nalso was a contributing editor to Printing News. At NBC, he was a \nmember of the FCC National Industry Advisory Committee that created the \nEmergency Broadcast System, and he wrote the broadcast closed-circuit \nradio advisories from every location to which a President could be \ntaken in time of national emergency--in the air, on land, at sea, under \nthe sea.\n  In 1963, Mr. Sharkey moved to Seattle as managing director of news \nfor the King Broadcasting Company's stations there and in Spokane, WA, \nand Portland, OR. While at KING-TV, he won two local Emmys for news and \ndocumentary programming. When Bonneville International Corporation \npurchased KIRO-TV-AM Seattle in 1964, he was appointed corporate \ndirector of news for all Bonneville stations nationwide.\n  In 1965, Mr. Sharkey was named Newhouse National Service economics \nand labor columnist, based in Washington, DC, later adding the news \neditor role. He entered government in 1972 as public information \ndirector for the then-new Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, OSHA, moving to the same position at the FCC in 1975.\n  Mr. Sharkey also taught at the Columbia University Graduate School of \nJournalism for 9 years and taught economics and public affairs at the \nTobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers in New York. Known as a witty \nspeaker, he lectured widely for the Times and NBC News. He also was a \nchoral singer, a private airplane pilot, an automobile and outboard \nmotorboat race driver, a motor yachtsman, and even a clown in the \nAquacade at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Mr. Sharkey was a life \nmember and former vice commodore of the Capital Yacht Club here in \nWashington, DC.\n  Sam Sharkey was a pioneer in journalism for over 70 years, and he \nleft an indelible mark, especially in the field of broadcast \njournalism. I extend my condolences to his wife Marilyn and the rest of \nhis family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2308-3", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES OF \nAMERICA--PM 44\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947, as \namended (50 U.S.C. 404a), I am transmitting a report prepared by my \nAdministration on the National Security Strategy of the United States.\n                                                      George W.

Among those 25 powers are:\n       (1) To develop and maintain a continuing, comprehensive and \n     coordinated transportation planning process.\n       (2) To develop programs designed to foster efficient and \n     economical public transportation services in the State.\n       (3) To prepare plans for the preservation and improvement \n     of the commuter railroad system.\n       (4) To prepare and develop plans and programs for all modes \n     of urban transportation, including in addition to commuter \n     rail and motor bus, rapid rail; trolley coach, surface rail, \n     corridor rail and other innovative modes of urban \n     transportation.\n       (5) To coordinate the transportation activities of the \n     department with those of other public agencies and \n     authorities.\n       (6) To superintend, supervise and control the work of \n     constructing, reconstructing, maintaining and repairing State \n     designated highways and other transportation facilities and \n     rights-of-way;\n       Whereas, the PENNDOT Strategic Agenda adopted in July 2004 \n     stated a vision that promotes ``customer driven, intermodal \n     transportation system and services that enhance the quality \n     of life in Pennsylvania'' and a mission statement that says: \n     ``Through the active involvement of customers, employees and \n     partners, PENNDOT provides services and a safe intermodal \n     transportation system that attracts businesses and residents \n     and stimulates Pennsylvania's economy''; and\n       Whereas, the PENNDOT Strategic Focus Areas adopted by the \n     Rendell Administration include safety, quality of life, \n     mobility, management and productivity and system \n     preservation. This document seeks innovative management of \n     our transportation system and services and improved access \n     and mobility, ensuring that people and goods can move \n     efficiently, and it guides the management of our assets and \n     processes with funding and resources prioritized for the \n     preservation and betterment of all systems and services; and\n       Whereas, revenue for local matching funds for the \n     CORRIDORone project has been received from Cumberland County, \n     Dauphin County, Lancaster County and 12 boroughs, 11 \n     townships and more than 50 businesses throughout the region; \n     and\n       Whereas, the local Municipal Planning Organization (MPO)--\n     Harrisburg Area Transportation Study (HATS)--has endorsed and \n     funded the CORRIDORone project and has included the project \n     in its 30-year plan; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives support the \n     continued planning efforts for the CORRIDORone proposal as it \n     could provide a needed regional linkage for economic \n     development efforts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives encourage the \n     Governor and the Secretary of Transportation to do everything \n     possible to preserve the CORRIDORone right-of-way options and \n     future extensions as provided in the preliminary Engineering \n     and Environmental Analysis; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Governor, to the Secretary of Transportation, to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania and to the President of \n     Norfolk Southern Railroad Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-282. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to taking steps to improve access to \n     fertility preservation options for cancer patients; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 72\n\n       Whereas, approximately 130,000 people under the age of 45 \n     are diagnosed with cancer each year. At least 90 percent of \n     patients within this age group will undergo potentially \n     sterilizing treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or \n     radiation; and\n       Whereas, survivorship rates have dramatically increased \n     over the years expanding the life expectancy of 71 percent of \n     cancer patients by at least five years beyond the diagnosis \n     of their disease. The long-term consequences of cancer \n     treatment, such as infertility, are of increasing concern to \n     patients since they are highly likely to survive their \n     cancer. The diagnosis of infertility can be as devastating \n     for many patients as the cancer diagnosis itself; and\n       Whereas, successful fertility preservation options for men \n     and women include sperm banking, oocyte (egg) freezing, and \n     ovarian and testicular tissue freezing. Many cancer patients \n     are given the option of taking steps to preserve their \n     fertility before their potentially sterilizing cancer \n     treatment begins. However, many others do not take these \n     steps because they were not informed by their health care \n     professionals that their fertility is at risk, or, if they \n     are informed of the risk, they are generally not counseled on \n     their fertility preservation options; and\n       Whereas, unrelated factors such as marital status or poor \n     prognosis should not preclude certain patients from being \n     informed about their fertility risks and options. The 2003-\n     2004 President's Cancer Panel Report recognized that \n     comprehensive written and verbal information regarding \n     fertility side effects and fertility preservation options for \n     all reproductive-age patients should be provided before \n     treatment; and\n       Whereas, the great state of Michigan has an active, \n     productive cancer survivor population, demonstrating that a \n     cancer diagnosis is no longer a death sentence. We should do \n     everything possible to make fertility preservation options \n     available for cancer patients: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress and the United States Department of Health \n     and Human Services to take steps to improve access to \n     fertility preservation options for cancer patients by \n     endeavoring to:\n       (A) encourage research that will strengthen fertility \n     preservation options for cancer patients;\n       (B) continue to consider ways to improve access to \n     fertility preservation options for cancer patients; and\n       (C) raise awareness about the fertility side effects and \n     fertility preservation options for cancer patients; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Michigan \n     Congressional delegation and the United States Department of \n     Health and Human Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-283. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to enact \n     legislation to change ZIP codes in Jefferson Parish and to \n     assign the new ZIP codes to the main post office in Metairie; \n     to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 67\n\n       Whereas, when the United States Postal Service first \n     instituted the ZIP code system, Old Jefferson was designated \n     as 70121, a New Orleans ZIP code number; and\n       Whereas, then when the city of Harahan built a post office \n     in its city hall, it was assigned the 70123 ZIP code, another \n     New Orleans ZIP code number; and\n       Whereas, the 70123 ZIP code, as expanded, now covers the \n     area of River Ridge as well as the city of Harahan; and\n       Whereas, when the new post office was built on Citrus \n     Boulevard in Jefferson, it was also assigned the 70123 ZIP \n     code; and\n       Whereas, the ZIP code directory issued by the United States \n     Postal Service and used by businesses nationwide reports all \n     ZIP codes beginning with ``701'' as having a New Orleans \n     address; and\n       Whereas, this misidentification and confusion of the \n     locations of businesses in ZIP\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\n     codes 70121 and 70123, including the businesses located in \n     Elmwood Industrial Park which employ more than thirty-five \n     thousand people, have caused numerous mailing and taxation \n     problems for these companies; and\n       Whereas, many insurance companies impose higher premium \n     rates attributable to properties in New Orleans on residents \n     of Jefferson Parish in the ZIP code areas 70121 and 70123; \n     and\n       Whereas, mail addressed to homes and businesses having ZIP \n     code 70121 or 70123 was held up for more than a month in the \n     aftermath of Hurricane Katrina because of the effect that the \n     storm had on the operations of the United States Postal \n     Service in New Orleans: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary, due to the many problems that have occurred \n     in Jefferson Parish with the ZIP codes 70121 and 70123, to \n     enact legislation to change the ZIP code in Jefferson Parish \n     in the area currently covered by the United States Postal \n     Service ZIP code 70121 to 70021 and to change the ZIP code in \n     Jefferson Parish in the area currently covered by the United \n     States Postal Service ZIP code 70123 to 70023 and also to \n     assign the new ZIP codes to the main post office in Metairie; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-284. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to reduce by \n     twenty-five percent the amount of outstanding federal student \n     loan debt of any college graduate who resides in certain \n     areas of Louisiana most affected by Hurricane Katrina or \n     Hurricane Rita for at least five consecutive years \n     immediately following graduation and to memorialize congress \n     to provide for the establishment of conditions and \n     requirements for such debt reduction; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 48\n\n       Whereas, certain areas of Louisiana that were impacted by \n     Hurricane Katrina or Rita or both have suffered a great loss \n     in population due to the ravages of these catastrophic \n     storms; and\n       Whereas, it is imperative that people from Louisiana and \n     beyond are provided with incentives to reside in the great \n     state of Louisiana, and one such incentive could be the \n     reduction of certain student loan debt; and\n       Whereas, drawing college graduates to the hurricane-\n     affected areas of Louisiana would be one step toward \n     restoring the areas' populations, and populating these areas \n     with college-educated citizens could bring positive impacts \n     to the areas due to their ability to use the skills and \n     knowledge acquired through their educations to help the areas \n     to rebuild; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate to ask congress to establish \n     such a loan forgiveness program as part of a collective \n     effort to restore the population of certain areas of \n     Louisiana following the historic hurricanes of 2005: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to reduce by twenty-five percent the amount \n     of outstanding federal student loan debt of any col1ege \n     graduate who resides for at least five consecutive years \n     immediately fol1owing graduation in any parish in Louisiana \n     which has been designated pursuant to the Robert T.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to revising the requirement that \n     applicants for hunting and fishing licenses provide their \n     Social Security numbers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 461\n\n       Whereas, Section 5536 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     (Public Law 105-33, 111 Stat. 251) amended Federal law to \n     require each state to have in place laws requiring applicants \n     for recreational licenses (hunting and fishing) to provide \n     their Social Security numbers; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has inplemented \n     this Federal mandate through the amendatory act of December \n     16, 1997 (P.L. 549, No.58), to 23 Pa.C.S.; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly supports \n     all effective mechanisms to encourage payment of child \n     support obligations; and\n       Whereas, requiring applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses to provide their Social Security numbers does not \n     appear to enhance effective enforcement of child support \n     obligations inasmuch as hunting and fishing license records \n     are not retrievable by reference to the Social Security \n     numbers; and\n       Whereas, the vast majority of hunting and fishing licenses \n     are not sold by government agencies but are sold by private \n     businesses ranging in size from large department stores to \n     small bait and outdoor shops; and\n       Whereas, Imposing the requirement to collect Social \n     Security number information on the businesses that sell \n     hunting and fishing licenses unduly complicates the license \n     issuance transaction; and\n       Whereas, many purchasers of hunting and fishing licenses \n     object to disclosure of their Social Security numbers to the \n     private businesses that sell these licenses; and\n       Whereas, the legitimate privacy concerns expressed by many \n     purchasers of hunting and fishing licenses from private \n     businesses need to be addressed; and\n       Whereas, collection of Social Security numbers from \n     applicants for hunting and fishing licenses does not aid in \n     effective enforcement of child support obligations but does \n     unduly inconvenience both the sellers and purchasers of these \n     licenses and raises legitimate concerns about protection of \n     personal information: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     Congress of the United States to eliminate the requirement \n     that states must require applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses to provide their Social Security numbers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-286. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to amend the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to recognize state law \n     authorizing legal continuances for members of the legislature \n     during legislative sessions and to adopt a substantially \n     similar rule in federal court; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 29\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana R.S. 13:4163 provides that during \n     sessions of the legislature, if the presence of a member of \n     the legislature is required in any criminal case, civil case, \n     or administrative proceeding, his service shall constitute \n     peremptory cause for the continuance of any type of \n     proceeding upon the timely filing of a motion for \n     continuance; and\n       Whereas, this statute dates back over one hundred years and \n     was devised as a way to satisfy the compelling demands and \n     responsibilities incumbent upon a part-time legislator, who \n     usually must have a career outside of public service in order \n     to make a living; and\n       Whereas, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not have such \n     a provision for a continuance, but many state legislators \n     have business before federal courts which may significantly \n     interfere with their responsibilities as representatives of \n     the people during legislative sessions; and\n       Whereas, during this time of statewide emergency due to \n     Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the duties and responsibilities \n     on legislators have been especially demanding: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to amend the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure to recognize state law authorizing legal \n     continuances for members of the legislature during \n     legislative sessions and to enact substantially similar rules \n     for federal court; and be if further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2311-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 598.

A bill to facilitate the protection of minors using the \nInternet from material that is harmful to minors, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on March 1, 2006 Evert Meiners of \nBillings, MT pled guilty to distributing child pornography over the \nInternet. A search of his computer by the FBI turned up more than \n12,000 images of child pornography.\n  Mr. Meiners had the child pornography images on his website, which he \noperated from his home in Billings. But authorities across the world \nwere able to access the pictures. Law enforcement in New York, \nIllinois, Maryland, and even Germany, reported that Mr. Meiners \ndistributed and solicited pornographic images in their jurisdictions.\n  The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for both good and evil. \nCriminals operating from around the world can now prey on children in \nour own backyards. We used to worry what could happen to our kids on \ntheir way home from school. Now parents have to worry about their kids \neven in the safety of their own homes.\n\n  Since 1995 the FBI has tracked down over 11,000 unique web addresses \nthat solicit and market child pornography.\n  The danger posed by these graphic web sites to our children demands \naction. That is why I will introduce the ``Cyber Safety for Kids Act'' \ntoday. As a general matter the legislation seeks to create a zone for \nall sexually explicit material that parents can easily block their \nchildren from visiting.\n  Specifically, the bill would do the following: First, the Cyber \nSafety for Kids Act would require the Internet Corporation for Assigned \nNames and Numbers to designate a top level domain name for web sites \nwith sexually explicit materials harmful to minors. The domain name \nwould be titled dot XXX, rather than dot Com.\n  Next, within six months of the launch of the .XXX domain name, all \nweb sites that contain sexually explicit materials harmful to minors \nwould be required to adopt the dot XXX domain name.\n  Finally, if a web site that contains sexually explicit material \nharmful to minors fails to use the dot XXX domain name, the web \noperator would be subject to civil penalties set by the Department of \nCommerce.\n  I know that some people believe that my legislation goes too far. \nOthers believe that it does not go far enough. For example, some argue \nthat all pornography over the Internet should be banned. That would \ncertainly be effective, but would unquestionably be overturned by the \nSupreme Court. On numerous occasions, the Supreme Court has struck down \nlaws that prohibit the broadcast of pornographic images.\n  On the other hand, I have heard from some that believe my legislation \nis too restrictive. I am a strong defender of the Constitution's \nprotection of speech. But we cannot bury our heads in the sand and \npretend that the problem of children viewing harmful material over the \nInternet will go away.\n  We must do what we can do to help parents protect their kids. My \nlegislation aims to follow the successful efforts by States and \nlocalities to zone adult book and movie theaters in one part of a city \nor town.\n\n  In Renton v. Playtime Theaters the Supreme Court specifically upheld \na city zoning ordinance that prohibited adult motion picture theaters \nfrom locating within 1,000 feet of any residential zone, single- or \nmultiple-family dwelling, church, park, or school.\n  Likewise, my legislation creates a zone for all sexually explicit \nmaterial that is harmful to minors on the Internet. Parents could \neasily install filters on their computer to keep their kids from \nvisiting the dot XXX neighborhood.\n  There is no silver bullet that will stop sick adults from trafficking \nand\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nsoliciting child pornography. But my legislation offers an important \nfirst step.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nforward. I am also appreciative of Senator Pryor's leadership on this \nissue in the Commerce Committee. I am glad to say that Senator Pryor \nhas agreed to be the lead co-sponsor of my legislation.\n  I urge Congress to support my legislation, and have it on the \nPresident's desk as soon as possible. American parents have asked for \nour help, it's our duty to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 2427. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for progressive indexing and longevity indexing of social \nsecurity old-age insurance benefits for newly retired and aged \nsurviving spouses to ensure the future solvency of the social security \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the \nresolution for providing me with a few minutes to discuss my \nintroduction today of the Sustainable Solvency for Social Security Act. \nIn introducing this legislation, I am under no illusion that there will \nbe a rush to enactment, but do believe this is an appropriate time to \ndraw attention to this issue and the broader issue of entitlement \nspending as we consider the budget resolution for fiscal year 2007.\n  Yesterday, we had a close vote on an amendment to reinstitute pay-as-\nyou-go rules for spending increases and tax reductions. I opposed that \namendment because a vote for it was, in essence, a vote for automatic \ntax increases on the American taxpayer. A more honest approach would \nhave been to ask the Senate to adopt an amendment that required 60 \nvotes to pass any legislation that would prevent the expiration of any \ntax provision that would, if allowed to expire, result in a tax \nincrease on individual taxpayers.\n  I mention this because I do believe that we need fiscal discipline. \nWe do need to collect higher revenues, but collecting higher revenues \ndoes not mean that you need to impose higher tax rates on capital or \nlabor. Even if the sponsors of pay-go had prevailed, the real issue \nwould be--once again--ignored.\n  The loaded gun held to the heads of American taxpayers is entitlement \nbenefits that have been promised, but cannot be paid for under any \nrealistic scenario. Economic growth can help solve or mitigate many \nfiscal challenges, but it cannot overcome the twin realities of \ndemographic destiny or benefit structures that are simply \nunsustainable.\n  Today, four items--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest--\nconsume just under 10 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. If we do \nnothing we will see expenditures for the three programs increase to \nalmost 20 percent of GDP. That is simply unsustainable.\n  Over the past year, I spent a great deal of time talking to members \non both sides of the aisle, as well as the administration, about ways \nto begin addressing this looming crisis. 'started with Social Security. \nSome asked, ``Why start with the smallest problem?'' The answer was \nsimple. If we can't come together on a problem that can be fixed by \naligning benefits with program income, how can we ever expect to come \ntogether on more difficult issues like Medicare reform.\n  In the case of Social Security, we can quibble about exactly when, \nbut at some point between 2042 and 2052, the program will be unable to \npay benefits called for under current law and benefits will be reduced \nautomatically to match program income with program outlays.\n  As I said, I have no illusion that the legislation I am introducing \ntoday will be enacted this year, but I offer it for my colleagues' \nexamination and suggestions.\n  This legislation does not include personal accounts of any shape or \nform. It focuses exclusively on the goal of making Social Security \nsolvent. And it does so without any increases in taxes or increases in \nthe payroll cap.\n  Presently, the Social Security system faces an actuarial deficit of \n1.92 percent of payroll. According to the Chief Actuary at Social \nSecurity, 1.60 percent of this deficit is related to the Old Age and \nSurvivors Insurance (OASI) program--what we traditionally think of as \nSocial Security. The remaining 0.32 percent is attributable to the \ndisability insurance program. As I discussed this issue with many of my \ncolleagues and with others, it was clear that there was a broad \nconsensus that the disabled should be held harmless. It was also clear \nthat there was little or no support for the proposition that retirement \nprogram beneficiaries should subsidize the disability program. \nTherefore, this legislation does not touch the present disability \nprogram and leaves open the question of how to address the disability \nprogram deficit. Additionally, there was broad agreement that current \nretirees and those nearing retirement, born before 1950, should not \nhave their benefits affected.\n\n  This legislation focuses solely on the 1.60 percent actuarial deficit \nin the OASI program. It achieves sustainable solvency for Social \nSecurity's OASI program through two primary policy tools: progressive \nprice indexing and longevity indexing. Those reforms would slow the \nprojected real rate of increase in future retirement benefits to a more \nsustainable level, while protecting low-wage-earners, the disabled, and \ntheir dependents. It also modestly accelerates the timetable for the \ntransition under current law to a normal retirement age of 67, and it \nensures sufficient backup general revenue funding to maintain a \ncontingency reserve in the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance \n(OASDI) trust fund.\n  My proposal for sustainable solvency has been scored by the office of \nthe actuary at the Social Security Administration. The effects of its \nprovisions affecting retirement benefits, progressive indexing, \naccelerated NRA 67, and longevity indexing, would eliminate entirely \nthe OASI program actuarial deficit of 1.60 percent of payroll that is \nprojected under current law.\n  Progressive indexing would not begin until 2012. First, it is \nimportant to note the beneficiaries, and Social Security programs to \nwhich progressive indexing would NOT apply. It would not apply to any \ncurrent or future retiree born before 1950. Its provisions also would \nnot apply to any worker in the future whose Social Security earnings \nhistory was in the lowest 30 percent of career earnings for workers \nbecoming eligible to retire in a given year.\n  Progressive indexing essentially slows the future growth rate of \nbenefits for higher-earning workers. Their initial retirement benefits \nwill grow more In line with price growth, rather than the even-higher \nrate of increase pegged to wage growth under current law.\n  Under current law, retirement benefits are calculated under a ``wage \nindexing'' formula that will help propel them to levels significantly \nhigher than the payroll tax revenue available to pay for them. The \nformula uses the average rate of growth of wages within the economy, \nrather than changes in the cost of living, to adjust, or ``index'', the \npast earnings of a worker that are used to determine the worker's \ninitial benefit level at retirement. Because average wages generally \ngrow faster than prices over time, the current benefit formula \nessentially guarantees that future retirement benefit levels will grow \nfaster in ``real'' dollar value from generation to generation. Under \nthis proposal, the individuals in the lowest 30 percent of all wage \nearners retiring in a given year would continue to have their past \nwages, and resulting benefit levels, indexed according to wage growth, \nwhile those at the top of the wage distribution would have their past \nwages indexed for changes in prices. Those falling in between would \nhave their past wages indexed based upon a ``progressive blend'' of \nwage and price changes. In short, future benefit levels for workers who \nearned higher wages over their working career would not rise as much as \nbenefit levels for workers with lower lifetime earnings, but those \nworkers most dependent on social security for retirement income would \nbe protected from such changes.\n  This blended version of progressive price indexing targets the \nsustainable levels of revenue that will be available for future Social \nSecurity benefits under current law in a manner that ensures that those \nretirees that will be most in need are treated the most generously. It \nbuilds on the underlying progressive structure of the current benefits \nformula that replaces lower levels of career earning with a relatively \nhigher share of retirement benefits. The real purchasing power of \nfuture OASI benefits will continue to\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\ngrow, but not as much, in future decades for higher wage workers.\n  Longevity indexing recognizes that future retirees will live longer \nand, accordingly, receive inflation protected levels of their initial \nretirement benefits for longer periods of time than prior retirees. \nAbsent any adjustment for changes in life expectancy beyond the age of \nretirement, longer lifetimes in retirement would mean increasingly \ngreater dollar amounts of lifetime Social Security retirement benefits \nin future decades.\n  Under present law, the retirement age is scheduled to increase \nincrementally to age 67 beginning in 2022, the normal retirement age \ngradually increases for workers born in 1960 and later years, by two \nmonths each year starting in 2022 until it reaches age 67 in 2027. \nUnder this proposal, the move from age 66 to age 67 would begin in \n2012. The Normal Retirement Age or NRA would be increased by two months \neach year until the NRA reached age 67 in 2017. After that date, \ninitial monthly benefits for future retirees would be periodically \nadjusted by the Social Security Administration to account for changes \nin the expected average lifetimes of future retirees.\n  Because it does not change current-law benefits for disabled \nbeneficiaries, my bill does not address the remaining actuarial deficit \nfor the DI program under current law, which amounts to another .32 \npercent of payroll. Accordingly, it does not close the larger overall \nactuarial deficit for the combined OASDI programs. The latter is 1.92 \npercent of payroll under current law, and would be substantially \nreduced to only .28 percent of payroll under my bill.\n  My plan's provisions that reduce OASDI benefit obligations first \nbegin to operate in 2012, and they then improve annual unified budget \nbalances for that year and all subsequent years within the standard 75-\nyear projection period used by the Social Security Administration.\n  Several other measures demonstrate the improved solvency for the \noverall OASDI programs under my bill. The net cash flow from the OASDI \nTrust Funds to the general fund is improved by $3.6 trillion in present \nvalue. The OASDI Trust Fund exhaustion date would be extended from 2041 \nuntil 2056.\n  Until we can find further support for dealing with the remaining \nsolvency problems in the DI program, we should at least ensure that \nsufficient resources are committed to prevent sudden across-the-board \nreductions in OASDI benefit levels in later decades. Therefore, my bill \nprovides budget authority for general fund transfers as needed to \nmaintain a 100 percent OASDI trust fund ratio in later years. Those \ngeneral fund transfers are estimated by the SSA actuaries to amount to \n$0.6 trillion, in present value, over the next 75 years. This provision \nensures solvency for the combined OASDI program through that period. \nAfter 2080, additional general revenue transfers are not expected to be \nnecessary, and annual program cash-flow balances are projected to be \nimproving and approaching positive annual balances beyond that year.\n  I also think it is important to point out that this legislation \nrecognizes that changes in economic conditions have an impact on the \nactuarial balance of the program. Greater economic growth can improve \nbut not alone restore the program's solvency; recessions can \nsignificantly worsen that financial position. Some expressed concern \nearly in discussions on this legislation that we might be going too \nfar, that some of the changes might prove unnecessary. For that reason \nI have included a provision that will allow for the administrative \n``turning off' if you will of the progressive indexing or longevity \nindexing if the program comes into actuarial balance prior to those \nprovisions being fully phased in.\n  In conclusion, this legislation would substantially reduce the \nmountain of unfunded debt projected for the Social Security program in \nthe decades ahead. It does so in a manner that gradually and sensibly \nreduces the formula-driven increases in real retirement benefits under \ncurrent law for future retirees, while protecting low-wage workers and \nthe disabled. We could do more, but this bill would do a lot. At other \ntimes, I have proposed separate provisions to enhance overall \nretirement security, such as through the option of personal accounts \nfunded partly from current payroll taxes and partly from additional \npersonal saving. I have also proposed reforms in pension policy to \nencourage automatic enrollment in employer plans, provide better access \nto standard investment options, and stimulate increased saving by \nworkers. But I have left those issues for another debate and focused on \nthe solvency of the retirement program.\n  I offer this legislation as a starting point. I remain, as I have \nbeen over the past year, open to suggestions or modifications that can \nlead to bipartisan reform that will insure the permanent solvency of \nthe Social Security system. We cannot afford to ignore this issue any \nlonger. Burying our heads in the sand will only magnify the folly of \ninaction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n                         SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE\n\n       ``Sustainable Solvency First for Social Security''\n\n\n                    SECTION 2: PROGRESSIVE INDEXING\n\n       For an individual who becomes eligible for Social Security \n     retirement benefits in 2012 or later, the bill would use \n     ``progressive indexing''--a mix of wage and price indexing--\n     to determine his or her initial benefit. Those individuals \n     whose lifetime covered earnings are in the lowest 30th \n     percentile of all wage earners retiring in a particular year \n     will not be affected in any way by these changes. Similarly, \n     those individuals currently receiving Social Security \n     benefits or near retirement (age 55 or older) will be held \n     harmless. .\n       Current Law: Current Social Security benefits are \n     calculated under a ``wage indexing'' formula. Benefits for \n     retired or disabled workers retiring in 2006 and later years \n     will be based on the average level of their indexed wage \n     earnings over their working lifetime that were subject to \n     OASDI payroll taxes up to the annual taxable maximum ($94,200 \n     in 2006).\n       Several adjustments must be made to those past earnings \n     before a retired worker's initial benefits can be calculated. \n     Upon reaching age 62 or becoming disabled, the actual amount \n     of a worker's previous ``covered'' earnings must first be \n     converted into average indexed monthly earnings, or AIME. \n     Earnings for any year before the worker reaches age 60 are \n     wage-indexed to reflect changes in average wage levels \n     (rather than average price levels) in the economy that \n     occurred between the year when the earnings were realized and \n     the year when the worker reaches age 60. Wage indexing means \n     that workers do not lose the value of their past earnings \n     (when money was worth more) in relation to their more recent \n     earnings. It may add an additional productivity ``bonus'' by \n     indexing past wages to reflect subsequent ``real'' growth in \n     average wages that exceeds the effects of price inflation \n     alone. Earnings after age 60 are not wage indexed. A retired \n     worker's AIME is then based on the highest 35 years of all \n     covered earnings, divided by 420 (the number of months in 35 \n     years). For disabled workers and the survivors of deceased \n     workers, the AIME can be based on a shorter period (excluding \n     periods when the worker was disabled or deceased).\n       A progressive formula is then applied to a worker's AIME to \n     calculate his or her primary insurance amount (PIA). The PIA \n     is the monthly amount determined either for a worker who \n     begins receiving Social Security retirement benefits at the \n     age at which he or she is eligible for full benefits or for a \n     disabled worker. The formula is designed to ensure that \n     initial Social Security benefits replace a larger proportion \n     of pre-retirement earnings for people with low average \n     earnings than for those with higher earnings. Under the \n     formula, the worker's PIA is determined by applying three \n     separate percentages (90 percent, 32 percent, and 15 \n     percent), known as PIA factors, to three different portions \n     of the worker's AIME. The dollar thresholds at which the \n     applicable PIA factor changes (in other words, where the \n     fraction of additional dollars of a particular portion of \n     AIME that becomes part of a worker's PIA changes) are known \n     as ``bend points.'' The Social Security Administration \n     indexes the bend points annually to match the rate of growth \n     of average wages, while the PIA factors never change. This \n     keeps the portion of workers' pre-retirement earnings (AlMEs) \n     that is replaced by each of the respective PIA factors \n     roughly constant for each new retiring cohort.\n       The PIA formula applicable to any worker, regardless of the \n     age at which he or she actually retires, is the formula in \n     place in the year the worker reached age 62 or became \n     disabled. For example, the PIA formula for workers who first \n     became eligible for retirement benefits in 2005 was the sum \n     of: 90 percent of the first $627 of the worker's AIME, 32 \n     percent of the worker's AIME falling between $627 and $3,779, \n     and 15 percent of the worker's AIME above $3,779.\n       The amounts $627 and $3,779 were the bend points of the \n     2005 PIA formula.\n       The initial basic retirement benefit of a worker retiring \n     at the ``normal retirement\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\n     age,'' or NRA, is based on 100 percent of the PIA. However, \n     if a worker retires at an age earlier than the NRA, he or she \n     faces an ``early retirement penalty'' which reduces the \n     amount of his benefit. Before the year 2000, the NRA was age \n     65 and the early retirement penalty, or reduction factor, was \n     6-2/3 percent of the benefit for each year of early \n     retirement. That is, a worker retiring three years early, at \n     age 62 (the earliest age at which retirement benefits may be \n     claimed), would receive a benefit equal to only 80 percent of \n     the PIA. Beginning in 2000, the ``normal'' retirement age \n     began to rise from age 65 to age 66, at the rate of 2 months \n     per year for those reaching age 62 between the years 2000 and \n     2005. The NRA will continue to rise to age 67, at the same \n     rate of 2 months per year, for those reaching age 62 between \n     2017 and 2022. A worker will still be able to collect \n     benefits beginning at age 62, but the two additional years of \n     early retirement (as fully phased in by 2022) will reduce \n     benefits by an additional 5 percent per year adjustment \n     factor. The age 62 benefit in 2022 and thereafter will fall \n     to 70 percent of the PIA.\n       Once a worker's basic benefit (PIA adjusted for applicable \n     early retirement penalty) is determined, it is augmented by \n     annual cost of living adjustment (COLA) to offset inflation, \n     if any, from the year the worker reached age 62 until the \n     year of filing for benefits. After a retired worker has \n     received his or her first benefit check, the amount is \n     similarly adjusted upward every January 1 to reflect annual \n     changes in the cost of living, as measured by the consumer \n     price index (CPI). This price indexing of initial retirement \n     benefits, after a retiree has begun to receive them, is a \n     separate procedure from wage indexing a worker's earnings \n     history or the bend points of the benefit formula used to set \n     initial payments to new retirees over time.\n       In addition to the COLA, a recipient's benefit may increase \n     if the individual continues to work after first becoming \n     eligible to draw benefits. If subsequent earnings in a later \n     year exceed any of the indexed yearly earnings initially used \n     to determine the worker's initial benefit at age 62, Social \n     Security will automatically substitute the new earnings for \n     the lowest ones in the worker's earnings history, recalculate \n     the worker's PIA, and increase the worker's future benefits.\n       The current structure of the formula presents an inherent \n     problem. Because average wages generally grow faster than \n     prices over time, the current benefit formula essentially \n     guarantees that future retirement benefit levels will grow \n     faster in ``real'' dollar value from generation to \n     generation. Hence, the actual purchasing power of the Social \n     Security benefit of a person retiring in 2005, for example, \n     is greater than for a person who retired in 1995.\n       Bennett Bill: The current benefit formula would remain \n     essentially the same, except that, for new cohorts of \n     retirees beginning in 2012, the upper-two PIA factors (32 \n     percent and 15 percent) used to calculate their PIAs would be \n     adjusted lower annually by the Social Security Administration \n     in order to slow the future growth of initial retirement \n     benefits. Those benefit levels would increasingly reflect the \n     levels of price growth, rather than average wage growth, that \n     occurred during the course of most workers' careers. For \n     those individuals whose AIMEs were above the 30th percentile \n     of workers retiring in a given year, their initial retirement \n     benefit would be indexed based upon a ``progressive blend'' \n     of wage and price changes. The slowest rate of growth in \n     future retirement benefits would be for workers with steady \n     maximum taxable earnings. Future benefit levels for workers \n     who earned higher wages over their working careers would rise \n     at a lower rate than benefit levels for workers with lower \n     lifetime earnings.\n       Moreover, those workers most dependent on Social Security \n     for retirement income would be fully protected from the \n     changes. Individuals whose career-average indexed monthly \n     earnings were in the lowest 30 percent of all career-average \n     wage earners retiring in a particular year would continue to \n     have their initial benefits calculated using the current law \n     formula and they would, therefore, be held harmless entirely \n     from the PIA factor adjustments. Those workers who were age \n     55 or older on January 1,2005 also would not be affected by \n     this change in the benefit formula. Current law benefits for \n     young survivors, as well as disability benefits, would remain \n     unchanged.\n       The progressive indexing provisions of the bill would \n     operate first by establishing a new second bend point in the \n     benefit formula. It would be set above the current-law first \n     bend point (below which the first 90-percent PIA factor would \n     continue to apply. The current-law 32-percent PIA factor \n     would continue to operate up to this new second bend point. \n     The new bend point would be determined to be at about the \n     30th percentile of AIME for those newly eligible for social \n     security retirement benefits in 2012. (The calculation relies \n     on the latest available statistics for AIME of workers first \n     becoming eligible for retired worker benefits in 2001 through \n     2003 and updates them to 2012 using the intermediate \n     assumptions of the 2005 Trustees Report). The future levels \n     at which this new bend point would apply beyond 2012 would be \n     wage indexed, as is done for the other two bend points in \n     current law.\n       For workers eligible to retire in 2012 and beyond with \n     portions of AIME above the level of this second new bend \n     point, further progressive indexing adjustments would be made \n     to the other two remaining marginal PIA factors (32 percent \n     and 15 percent, respectively) under current law. The \n     objective is to gradually reduce those two PIA factors by the \n     same proportional amount over time, in a manner that would \n     reflect the relative difference between using price indexing \n     and using the current law practice of wage indexing to \n     determine the benefits for a career-maximum earner (a worker \n     always earning annual wages at or above the maximum amount \n     subject to OASDI payroll taxes). The percentage by which \n     those upper-two PIA factors are reduced in a given year, \n     however, must be somewhat greater than that ratio alone, \n     because it must be applied to a smaller base of career \n     earnings. (Initial retirement benefits derived from the \n     portion of any worker's AIME below the 30th percentile are \n     held harmless from the progressive indexing adjustments). \n     Hence, the new benefits formula adjusts those 15-percent and \n     32-percent PIA factors by multiplying them by (1) the \n     difference of the maximum CPI-indexed benefit amount for a \n     given year after 2011 over the benefit amount determined for \n     an individual whose AIME is equal to the hold-harmless 30th \n     percentile level at the second new bend point divided by (2) \n     the difference of the maximum wage-indexed benefit amount for \n     the same year over the benefit amount determined for an \n     individual with AIME at the 30th percentile level.\n       Over time, as the original 15 percent and 32 percent PIA \n     factors are reduced incrementally in line with the difference \n     between price growth and average wage growth, higher earning \n     workers will have relatively smaller shares of their total \n     AIME converted into retirement benefits. Growth in future \n     retirement benefits for relatively lower earning workers, \n     with a greater share of total AIME affected by the unchanged \n     lower-two PIA factors, will be slowed at a lesser ``blended'' \n     rate.\n       The progressive indexing reduction of the upper-two PIA \n     factors would not continue indefinitely if the financial \n     status and outlook of the Social Security system improved and \n     returned to sustainable solvency. Whenever the Chief Actuary \n     of the Social Security Administration certifies that, for a \n     calendar year after 2080, the combined balance of the Old-Age \n     and Survivors Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust \n     Fund is positive and not less than 100 percent for that \n     calendar year, and it is projected to remain stable and grow \n     in the future, further adjustments to the PIA factors would \n     be frozen and the upper-two PIA factors would remain at their \n     level of the preceding year. Additional adjustments would \n     resume in any later calendar year during which the combined \n     balance dropped below 100 percent. This stabilizing provision \n     may cause the incremental effects of progressive indexing to \n     be added only intermittently in calendar years after 2080.\n\n\n                     SECTION 3: LONGEVITY INDEXING\n\n       Initial Social Security benefits would be adjusted to more \n     accurately account for increases in worker life expectancy.\n       Current Law: A worker's initial retirement benefit is price \n     indexed annually to adjust for increases in the cost-of-\n     living, as measured by the CPI-W. No further adjustments in \n     benefits are made for changes in average life expectancy for \n     any given cohort of retirees.\n       Bennett Bill: In 2018 and later years, initial benefits for \n     future retirees would be adjusted annually by the Social \n     Security Administration to account for changes in the \n     expected average life expectancy, at age 67 (the age of \n     normal retirement for future retirees). This would be done by \n     multiplying the PIA factors by a life expectancy ratio \n     calculated by the Chief Actuary, using final and complete \n     actual data that is available for a given calendar year. It \n     would represent the ratio of the period life expectancy based \n     on computed death rates for 2013 of an individual at age 67 \n     to the period life expectancy of an individual at that age \n     based on the computed death rates for the fourth calendar \n     year preceding the calendar year for which the life \n     expectancy ratio is determined.\n       Those persons who are currently age 55 and older or who are \n     young survivors would not have their benefits impacted by \n     this adjustment.\n       The bill would also require the Social Security \n     Commissioner to conduct a study on the feasibility of \n     determining life expectancies for disabled beneficiaries. A \n     report on the study would be due no later than one year after \n     the date of enactment of the bill.\n\n\n             SECTION 4: TREATMENT OF DISABLED BENEFICIARIES\n\n       With regard to the disabled, the bill would not affect \n     those receiving Social Security disability benefits while \n     they are disabled.\n       Current Law: Upon reaching normal retirement age, the \n     social security benefits for disabled beneficiaries are no \n     longer paid by the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and \n     disabled beneficiaries become eligible for retiree benefits \n     financed by the Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund. Disability \n     benefits are computed similarly to retirement benefits, but \n     they are calculated as if the worker attained the full \n     retirement age in the year he or she became disabled.\n       Bennett Bill: At the time of conversion by disabled \n     beneficiaries to retired worker status, their retirement \n     benefits would be calculated using a blend of two formulas. \n     The current law benefit formula would continue to apply \n     proportionately for the relative period of time during their \n     potential working lifetime (between age 22 and age 62) when\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\n     they were disabled. Future changes in current law benefits \n     due to progressive indexing and longevity indexing would \n     apply proportionately to the relative period of time when \n     they were able to engage in covered employment.\n\n\n  SECTION 5: ACCELERATION OF PRESENT-LAW NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE CHANGES\n\n       The age of normal retirement, for full Initial Social \n     Security benefits, would be adjusted to more accurately \n     account for increases in worker life expectancy.\n       Current Law: The age at which a worker becomes eligible for \n     full Social Security retirement benefits--the normal \n     retirement age, or NRA, is currently scheduled to increase \n     incrementally from age 66 to age 67 for those workers first \n     reaching age 62 in 2017 or later. The NRA depends on the \n     worker's year of birth and, correspondingly, when he or she \n     becomes age 62 and first eligible for retirement benefits. \n     For people born before 1938, the NRA is 65. For workers born \n     between 1938 and 1943, the NRA already began to increase by \n     two months per birth year. Hence, the NRA now is 66 for \n     people born in 1943 or later. It will remain at that level \n     until 2017, when it again begins to increase at the rate of \n     two months per birth year, beginning with people born in \n     1955. By 2022, the NRA will be 67 for workers born in 1960 or \n     later.\n       Retirement benefits are still available at age 62, but with \n     greater reduction as the NRA increases to age 67. For \n     example, a worker retiring at age 62 in 2022 will have their \n     initial benefits reduced by 30 percent. A worker who retired \n     at age 62 in 2005 would have received benefits reduced by \n     only 20 percent.\n       Bennett Bill: The current-law increase in the NRA from age \n     66 to age 67 would begin 5 years sooner, starting in the year \n     2012 (for those born in 1950) rather than in the year 2017. \n     Hence, the NRA would be increased by two months each year \n     thereafter until it reached age 67 in 2017, for those born in \n     1955 and later.\n\n\n  SECTION 6: MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE BALANCES IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY \n                              TRUST FUNDS\n\n       The bill would ensure that benefits are not cut \n     automatically in future years due to the combined OASDI Trust \n     Fund becoming insolvent (trust fund assets insufficient to \n     cover the entire costs of the programs).\n       Current Law: According to the latest projections by the \n     Chief Actuary, the Old-Age and Survivor Trust Fund will be \n     insolvent in the year 2041. Under current law, if assets are \n     insufficient to pay for benefits in a particular year, the \n     benefits of all beneficiaries are reduced proportionately to \n     make up for the shortfall. Hence, the Chief Actuary currently \n     projects that in 2042, benefits will be reduced by roughly 30 \n     percent.\n       Bennett Bill: This bill would ensure that for years in \n     which there would not otherwise be sufficient assets in the \n     trust fund to pay out scheduled benefits, the gap would be \n     filled by the appropriation of funds from general revenues. \n     This failsafe general revenue transfer provision would ensure \n     that a sufficient financial cushion remains to provide \n     payment of all benefits promised under the bill. However, it \n     primarily operates as a fiscal placeholder that indicates the \n     annual amount of increased revenue, or reduced expenditures, \n     required to maintain an annual combined trust fund balance \n     ratio of no less than 100 percent. It remains neutral as to \n     which fiscal method, or combination of methods, is used to \n     achieve this objective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2428. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe Automated Defibrillation in Adam's Memory Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nreauthorization of the Automated Defibrillators in Adam's Memory Act, \nor the ADAM Act. This bill is modeled after the successful Project ADAM \nthat originally began in Wisconsin, and will reauthorize a program to \nestablish a national clearing house to provide schools with the ``how-\nto'' and technical advice to set up a public access defibrillation \nprogram.\n  Every 2 minutes, someone in America falls into sudden cardiac arrest. \nBy improving access to AEDs, we can improve the survival rates of \ncardiac arrest in our communities.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, as in many other States, heart disease \nis the number one killer. Ninety-five sudden deaths from cardiac arrest \noccur each day in Wisconsin alone. Overall, heart disease kills more \nAmericans than AIDS, cancer and diabetes combined.\n  Cardiac arrest can strike anyone. Cardiac victims are in a race \nagainst time, and unfortunately, for too many of those in rural areas, \nEmergency Medical Services are unable to reach people in need, and time \nruns out for victims of cardiac arrest. It's simply not possible to \nhave EMS units next to every farm and small town across the Nation.\n  Fortunately, recent technological advances have made the newest \ngeneration of AEDs inexpensive and simple to operate. Because of these \nadvancements in AED technology, it is now practical to train and equip \npolice officers, teachers, and members of other community \norganizations.\n  An estimated 163,221 Americans experience out-of-hospital sudden \ncardiac arrests each year. Immediate CPR and early defibrillation using \nan automated external defibrillator, AED, can more than double a \nvictim's chance of survival. By taking some relatively simple steps, we \ncan give victims of cardiac arrest a better chance of survival.\n  Over the past 6 years, I have worked with Senator Susan Collins, a \nRepublican from Maine, on a number of initiatives to empower \ncommunities to improve cardiac arrest survival rates. We have pushed \nCongress to support rural first responders--local police and fire and \nrescue services--in their efforts to provide early defibrillation. \nCongress heard our call, and responded by enacting two of our bills, \nthe Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act and the ADAM Act.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices program allows community \npartnerships across the country to receive a grant enabling them to \npurchase defibrillators, and receive the training needed to use these \ndevices. This program is entering its second year of helping rural \ncommunities purchase defibrillators and train first responders, and I'm \npleased to say that grants have already put defibrillators in rural \ncommunities in 49 States, helping those communities be better prepared \nwhen cardiac arrest strikes.\n  Approximately 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before \nreaching the hospital. Every minute that passes before a cardiac arrest \nvictim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by as much as 10 \npercent. After only 8 minutes, the victim's survival rate drops by 60 \npercent. This is why early intervention is essential--a combination of \nCPR and use of AEDs can save lives.\n  If we give people in rural communities a chance, they may be able to \nreverse a cardiac arrest before it takes another life. Unfortunately, \nthe President zeroed out the funding for the Rural AED program in \nfiscal year 2007 after the program was cut by 83 percent last year. I \nam very disappointed that this program has been eliminated in the \nPresident's budget, and I will do everything in my power to restore \nfunding to this program.\n  Heart disease is not only a problem among adults. A few years ago I \nlearned the story of Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student and \na star basketball and tennis player in Wisconsin. Tragically, during a \ntimeout while playing basketball at a neighboring Milwaukee high \nschool, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest, and died before the \nparamedics arrived.\n  This story is incredibly tragic. Adam had his whole life ahead of \nhim, and could quite possibly have been saved with appropriate early \nintervention. In fact, we have seen a number of examples in Wisconsin \nwhere early CPR and access to defibrillation have saved lives.\n  Seventy miles away from Milwaukee, a 14-year-old boy collapsed while \nplaying basketball. Within 3 minutes, the emergency team arrived and \nbegan CPR. Within 5 minutes of his collapse, the paramedics used an AED \nto jump start his heart. Not only has this young man survived, doctors \nhave identified his father and brother as having the same heart \ncondition and have begun preventative treatments.\n  These stories help to underscore some important issues. First, \nalthough cardiac arrest is most common among adults, it can occur at \nany age--even in apparently healthy children and adolescents. Second, \nearly intervention is essential--a combination of CPR and the use of \nAEDs can save lives. Third, some individuals who are at risk for sudden \ncardiac arrest can be identified to prevent cardiac arrest.\n  After Adam Lemel suffered his cardiac arrest, his friend David Ellis \njoined forces with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to initiate Project \nADAM to bring CPR training and public access defibrillation into \nschools, educate communities about preventing sudden cardiac deaths and \nsave lives.\n  Today, Project ADAM has introduced AEDs into several Wisconsin \nschools, and has been a model for programs in\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nWashington, Florida, Michigan and elsewhere. Project ADAM provides a \nmodel for the Nation, and now, with the enactment of this new law, more \nschools will have access to the information they seek to launch similar \nprograms.\n  The ADAM Act was passed into law in 2003, but has yet to be funded. \nShould funding be enacted, the program will help to put life-saving \ndefibrillators in the hands of people in schools around the country. I \nhave been very proud to play a part in having this bill signed into \nlaw, and it is my hope that the reauthorization of the Act will quickly \npass through the Congress and into law, and that funding will follow. \nIt would not take much money to fund this program and save lives across \nthe country.\n  The ADAM Act is one way we can honor the life of children like Adam \nLemel, and give tomorrow's pediatric cardiac arrest victims a fighting \nchance at life.\n  This act exists because a family experienced the tragic loss of their \nson, but they were determined to spare other families that same loss. I \nthank Adam's parents, Joe and Patty, for their courageous efforts and I \nthank them for everything they have done to help the ADAM Act become \nlaw. Their actions take incredible bravery, and I commend them for \ntheir efforts.\n  By making sure that AEDs are available in our Nation's rural areas, \nschools and throughout our communities we can help those in a race \nagainst time have a fighting chance of survival when they fall victim \nto cardiac arrest. I urge Congress to pass this reauthorization, and to \nfund the ADAM Act and the Rural AED program at their full levels. We \nhave the power to prevent death--all we must do is act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Section 312(e) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     244(e)) is amended in the first sentence by striking ``fiscal \n     year 2003'' and all the follows through ``2006'' and \n     inserting ``for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2010''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cornyn, \n        Mr. Crapo, and Mrs. Hutchison) (by request):\n  S. 2429. A bill to authorize the President to waive the application \nof certain requirements under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 with \nrespect to India; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, at the request \nof the administration, its proposed legislation to implement the \nrecently concluded U.S.-India Civilian Nuclear Agreement.\n  By providing this draft legislation to the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, the administration has taken the first step in \ninitiating the congressional review of the U.S.-Indian Civilian Nuclear \nAgreement. The Committee on Foreign Relations has held one hearing on \nthe issue thus far. Under Secretaries of State Nick Burns and Bob \nJoseph, as well as outside experts testified on the matter. Last week I \njoined with a number of House and Senate colleagues in discussing the \nagreement with President Bush at the White House. In recent weeks I \nhave met repeatedly with administration officials on this matter and \nlook forward to commencing the Committee on Foreign Relations' review \nof the agreement.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations will review the proposed nuclear \ncooperation agreement, the Indian separation plan, and this legislation \nclosely. The committee will commence the review with a classified \nbriefing from Under Secretaries Nick Burns and Bob Joseph the last week \nof March. During the first week of April Secretary Rice will testify in \nan open hearing. The week we return from the Easter congressional \nrecess the committee will receive testimony from panels of outside \nexperts who both support and oppose the agreement. This schedule should \nbe looked on as the beginning of the oversight and review process; it \nis possible additional committee hearings and briefings will be \nnecessary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto review this agreement to fulfill our Constitutional role on this \nimportant matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2430. A bill to amend the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife \nRestoration Act of 1990 to provide for implementation of \nrecommendations of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \ncontained in the Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today, I join my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, in introducing the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife \nRestoration Act of 2006.\n  This measure was first enacted in 1990 and reauthorized in 1998 to \ncoordinate the management, protection, and restoration of fish and \nwildlife resources within the Great Lakes Basin. Many groups support \nthis program because it is a good management tool and facilitates \nbetter communication between their agencies.\n  The Great Lakes harbor a wide variety of fish and wildlife. Over 140 \nfish species and over 500 species of migratory bird can be found in the \nbasin. As in many coastal areas, there is a heavy concentration of \npeople and industry bordering the Great Lakes. Further, the Great Lakes \nare threatened by the continuing introduction of invasive species, \nwhich negatively impact the native food chain and habitat.\n  The fish and wildlife in the Great Lakes are facing grave dangers, \nand the Great Lakes Fish & Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 would \nprovide needed resources and authority to alleviate some of these \nconcerns. For instance, the bill would reauthorize the grant program, \nincreasing the available amount to $12 million and would add wildlife \nprojects to the types of projects that may receive grants. The U.S. \nFish & Wildlife Service would award grants based on the recommendations \nfrom the existing grant proposal review committee, with the addition of \nwildlife experts.\n  The bill also would authorize up to $6 million each year for the U.S. \nFish & Wildlife Service to undertake projects that have a regional \nbenefit to fish and wildlife. Under this new authority, the Service \nwould undertake projects based on the recommendations of states and \ntribes.\n  Additionally, the bill would require the Fish & Wildlife Service to \nsubmit a report to Congress in 2011 that describes the fish and \nwildlife grants that have been awarded and the results of those grants. \nThe Service would report annually to the states and tribes regarding \nthe grants that have been awarded, priorities proposed for funding in \nthe budget, and actions taken in support of Great Lakes regional \ncollaboration.\n  This bill reflects the collaboration of non-governmental groups, as \nwell as tribal, State, and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over the \nmanagement of fish and wildlife resources of the Great Lakes. All of \nthose groups have the goal of protecting and restoring Great Lakes fish \nand wildlife, and this bill will continue in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Fish and \n     Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Great Lakes have fish and wildlife communities that \n     are structurally and functionally changing;\n       (2) successful fish and wildlife management focuses on the \n     lakes as ecosystems, and effective management requires the \n     coordination and integration of efforts of many partners;\n       (3) it is in the national interest to undertake activities \n     in the Great Lakes Basin that\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n     support sustainable fish and wildlife resources of common \n     concern provided under the recommendations of the Great Lakes \n     Regional Collaboration authorized under Executive Order 13340 \n     (69 Fed. Reg. 29043; relating to the Great Lakes Interagency \n     Task Force);\n       (4) additional actions and better coordination are needed \n     to protect and effectively manage the fish and wildlife \n     resources, and the habitats upon which the resources depend, \n     in the Great Lakes Basin;\n       (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act, actions are \n     not funded that are considered essential to meet the goals \n     and objectives in managing the fish and wildlife resources, \n     and the habitats upon which the resources depend, in the \n     Great Lakes Basin; and\n       (6) the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 941 et seq.) allows Federal agencies, States, and \n     tribes to work in an effective partnership by providing the \n     funding for restoration work.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage all Americans to save for retirement by increasing their \naccess to pension plans and other retirement savings vehicles, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance,\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make \nAmerica more competitive by increasing savings. The bill encourages \nsavings at work, and requires that the Government consider the Nation's \nsavings in the budget process.\n  That great American philosopher Yogi Berra once said: ``If you see a \nfork in the road, take it.''\n  Well, we are at that fork in the road. Private savings are at an all \ntime low. And the government just spoons out more and more red ink. If \nAmerica does not change its ways, we will find ourselves on the wrong \nfork.\n  For the past 10 months, I have been talking about competitiveness. I \nhave been talking about the steps that we must take to keep this \ncountry strong. And I have been talking about the steps that we must \ntake to make it stronger.\n  One key component of my competitiveness agenda is savings. We must \nimprove our national savings rate because capital is critical to \ngrowth. And continued deficits lead ultimately to a downward spiral.\n  The 2005 personal savings rate was negative--minus 0.5 percent. \nTaxpayers have joined their government in engaging in deficit spending. \nWe have to turn our savings rates around. The question is how to do it.\n  With regard to Federal Government budget deficits, we have talked a \nlot over the last few days about the need for a pay-as-you-go process. \nWe all know that it is important. The only question is whether we are \nwilling to take the tough steps that pay-go requires, and not leave the \nburden to our children and grandchildren.\n  Pay-go does not necessarily mean tax increases. It could mean \ncollecting the taxes that are already owed. The most recent IRS \nestimate of the tax gap--the difference between what taxpayers owe and \nwhat they pay on time--is $350 billion each year.\n  Collecting that difference would pay for a lot of the Government. \nSeveral times, the Senate has passed legislation that would close \ncorporate loopholes and other abuses that contribute to the tax gap. \nInstead of looking for additional taxes, we should work with our \nColleagues in the House to enact proposals like these that will simply \nget taxpayers to pay what they already owe.\n  Today, I want to focus on the lack of personal savings for \nretirement. We all know it is inadequate. And we must address this \nproblem if American workers are to be able to retire with confidence \nthat they can maintain their living standards.\n  The ``Savings Competitiveness Act,'' which I introduce today, will \nmake it easier for millions of workers to save for retirement. It will \ncreate an automatic opportunity for workers to have savings withheld \nfrom their paychecks.\n  We cannot improve the personal savings rate by providing tax \nincentives that simply shift savings from one type of account to \nanother, or from one investment to another. We can improve the personal \nsavings rate only by creating new savings, especially savings by \nworkers who would otherwise not save. I believe that this bill will do \njust that.\n  Data on retirement savings show that workers who can save at work \nthrough payroll deduction arrangements--such as 401(k) plans--usually \ntake advantage of the opportunity to save. About two-thirds of eligible \nworkers contribute to a 401(k) plan. That percentage jumps \ndramatically--to more than 80 percent--if eligible workers are \nautomatically enrolled in these plans. Automatic enrollment makes \nsaving the default. Workers can opt out. But those who do not opt out, \nstart saving.\n  In November, we passed the pension bill by an overwhelming margin--\n97-to-2. That bill included provisions to encourage opt-out 401(k) and \n403(b) plans, instead of opt-in plans. This is a very important first \nstep. Separate bills introduced by Senators Bingaman and Snowe, and \nSenators Conrad and Smith were the basis for the Senate provisions. And \nI applaud their efforts to move these ideas along. Since the House also \nincluded automatic enrollment language in its bill, I expect that the \nfinal conference bill will take this dramatic step toward increasing \nsavings.\n  That, however, is just a first step. Automatic enrollment in 401(k) \nand 403(b) plans will help only those who are eligible to join an \nemployer-sponsored plan. That is about 60 percent of working Americans. \nUnfortunately, that leaves 40 percent of workers out in the cold. For \nsmall employers, the situation is worse. More than half of workers with \nsmall employers--those with fewer than 25 employees--have no employer-\nsponsored retirement plan. And for firms with fewer than 10 employees, \nonly 16 percent of workers participate in an employer-sponsored plan.\n  Those who have no employer-sponsored retirement program are far less \nlikely to save for retirement than those who do; 85 percent of workers \neligible for an employer-sponsored plan are actually earning benefits \nin those plans. But less than 20 percent of eligible taxpayers \ncontribute to an IRA.\n  Many more own IRAs--because funds from employer plans have been \nrolled over to an IRA. But the truth is, most retirement savings came \nfrom employer-based retirement plans.\n  The high participation rates in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nlow rates for IRAs, leads to a clear conclusion. We can increase \nretirement savings--create new savings--by making payroll deduction \nretirement savings available to more workers.\n  This is not a new idea. President Clinton's USA accounts were one \nattempt to bring retirement savings to all working Americans. Senator \nBingaman first proposed universal access to retirement savings in his \nSecure Retirement for America Act in the 107th Congress. But it is time \nthat we stopped talking. It is time that we started doing something to \nchange the direction of the personal savings rate.\n\n  Access to payroll savings is important, but it is not enough. The \nSavings Competitiveness Act that I introduce today will expand savings \nopportunities and more.\n  This bill helps workers by providing an opportunity to save for \nretirement through payroll deduction at work. Employers are not \nrequired to contribute. Employers just withhold contributions and \nforward them to an IRA. We provide a modest credit to help small \nemployers with the start-up costs.\n  This bill helps children by allowing Young Saver's Accounts to be \nused for kid's savings.\n  This bill helps small employers who want to contribute toward \nemployees' retirement savings get started with a 3-year start-up credit \nfor 50 percent of contributions to workers who are not highly \ncompensated. And small employers who use ``SIMPLE'' plans can share the \nprofits in a good year by making discretionary contributions to \nemployees' SIMPLE IRAs.\n  This bill helps lower-income taxpayers by replacing the current \nSaver's Credit with a refundable credit, deposited to the taxpayer's \nretirement savings account. Families earning up to $50,000 would be \neligible for a 50 percent credit. Those earning up to $60,000 would be \nentitled to a portion of the credit. Low-income savers would not be \npenalized by losing eligibility for food stamps and other benefits.\n  This bill helps retirees with modest savings by exempting $50,000 of \ntheir savings from minimum distribution requirements.\n  This bill removes traps for the unwary by simplifying distribution \nrules. It would conform 401(k) and IRA penalties so that workers who do \nnot have advisers to lead them through a series of hoops do not get hit \nwith excise taxes that those with a guide can avoid.\n  This bill takes some of the guesswork out of choosing an IRA. It \nwould create a seal of approval for IRAs that have investment options \nsimilar to those in the Thrift Savings Plan and modest fees.\n  The Senate's automatic enrollment provisions are not law yet. So I \nhave also included them in this new legislation.\n  I encourage my Colleagues to join with me to provide workplace \nsavings opportunities for working Americans that now have none and to \nstop the unlimited growth of the deficit by adopting a pay-as-you-go \nrequirement. I ask you to support the Savings Competitiveness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Burns, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Baucus, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n        Burr):\n  S. 2433.

A bill to limit the amount of time Senators spend on non-\nlegislative activities; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate has been working away at a \nlobbying reform bill, which is a good start at curbing the influence of \nspecial interests, but that alone is not enough. Everyone knows the \nroot of the problem is money. Money is the oil that runs the engine of \na viable campaign for office.\n  Every single one of my colleagues and I are in a perpetual campaign. \nWhether you were born a multi-millionaire or come from more humble \norigins, you are chasing money. Senators are elected or reelected on a \nTuesday, sleep in on Wednesday and by Thursday they are back on the \nphone, dialing supporters for contributions to fuel the next campaign.\n  I do not believe Senators should have to operate this way. I believe \nthe people send Senators to the Capitol to resolve their and the \nNation's problems; I don't believe they send us to the United States \nSenate to spend all our time calling donors for support.\n  Senators are here to do the people's business, and that's why Senator \nGraham and I are introducing the first bipartisan bill that would let \nSenators focus on what the voters of our States sent us here to do. \nThis would be the first serious step toward shutting the door on the 6-\nyear stockpiling of campaign contributions. Our bill would amend the \nSenate rules to prohibit incumbent Senators from raising money until 18 \nmonths prior to their re-election. An exception to this ban would be \ntriggered if an opposing candidate or group targeted a Senator with \nmore than $100,000 in paid advertisements. Such a targeted campaign \nwould free an incumbent Senator from the prohibition on soliciting \ncontributions. Likewise, the ban would not apply to contributions to \nretire campaign debt.\n  I have long admired the system used in many European countries for \nkeeping campaigns focused on a short but intense period. That would \nrequire an amendment to the Constitution, an avenue that time and again \nhas proved too difficult to navigate. Short of a Constitutional \namendment I believe the new approach Senator Graham and I are offering \ncould prove viable.\n  Campaign finance reform is much like nuclear disarmament: everyone is \nfor it but few are willing to take the first step unilaterally. I \nbelieve that those of us who are already here in the Senate bear the \nresponsibility to take that first step.\n  Our proposal aims not just to treat the symptoms of scandal and \ncorruption; it aims to cure the overall disease by going after the \nendless race for money in politics. Our bipartisan approach enjoys the \nsupport of a number of groups, including Common Cause, Democracy21, US \nPIRG and Public Citizen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase cooperation on energy issues between the \nUnited States Government and foreign governments and entities in order \nto secure the strategic and economic interests of the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Energy \nDiplomacy and Security Act,'' legislation that recognizes energy \nsecurity to be a foremost concern for United States national security, \nand would realign our diplomatic priorities to meet energy security \nchallenges.\n  Energy issues pose a multitude of challenges for United States \nnational security, foreign policy, economy, and environment. Meeting \nthese challenges requires a rigorous and farsighted policy to move us \ntoward a sustainable energy future, which will include international \npartnership. The bill calls upon the President to improve the focus and \ncoordination of Federal agency activities in international energy \naffairs. The bill further would ensure that concern for energy security \nis integrated into the State Department's core mission and activities, \nand to this end, it calls for the creation of a Coordinator for \nInternational Energy Affairs within the Office of the Secretary.\n  The bill calls upon the Federal Government to expand international \ncooperation on energy issues. The bill seeks to enhance international \npreparedness for major disruptions in oil supplies. A particular \npriority is to offer a formal coordination agreement with China and \nIndia as they develop strategic petroleum reserves. This would help \ndraw them into the international system, providing supply reassurance, \nand thereby reducing potential for conflict. The bill also calls for \nextension of petroleum supply disruption to developing nations which \nare most vulnerable.\n  The bill would also stimulate regional partnerships in the Western \nHemisphere. Most of our oil and virtually all of our gas imports come \nfrom this Hemisphere. The bill would create a Western Hemisphere Energy \nForum modeled on the APEC energy working group. This would provide a \nbadly-needed mechanism for hemispheric energy cooperation and \nconsultation, and would promote private investment in the Hemisphere.\n  Finally, the bill would enhance international partnerships with both \nmajor energy producing and consuming countries. We must engage major \noil and natural gas producing countries. Not working with major oil and \ngas exporters will lead to unproductive political\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nshowdowns and conflict. Strategic energy partnerships with other major \nconsuming countries are also crucial for our national security. Energy \nsecurity is a priority we hold in common with other import dependent \ncountries, and partnership with the world's largest consumers will \nincrease leverage in relation to petro-states and speed our own \nconversion to sustainable energy sources. In addition to seeking new \navenues of cooperation, the bill would give focus to existing bilateral \nenergy dialogues, which have lacked clear objectives and political \nbacking.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration \nto pursue a foreign policy that meets the grave national security \nchallenges posed by the global energy situation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2436. A bill to establish an Office of Consumer Advocacy and \nOutreach within the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers from \ncertain unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of \nmyself, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, to introduce a bill \nto create an Office of Consumer Advocacy and Outreach within the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  Pyramid schemes, too-good-to-be-true business opportunities, miracle \nweight loss products--these are all examples of how average Americans \nare taken advantage of on a daily basis. These schemes have the \npotential to deplete an innocent person's bank accounts and ruin their \nfinances and credit record for years to come. Some even damage people's \nhealth permanently--all for sake a making a few bucks.\n  Unfortunately, Hispanics are twice as likely as other Americans to \nbecome victims of consumer fraud. In fact, 14.3 percent of Hispanics \nwill fall prey to this type of crime. It's hard to know exactly why \nthis is affecting Hispanics disproportionately. Some believe that \ndisreputable businesses target certain communities because they believe \nvictims are less likely to report crimes. In fact, data has shown that \nHispanics are less likely to report incidents of fraud than other \nsegments of the population.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has levied an increasing number of \ncomplaints against deceptive Spanish-language advertisements, including \nfraudulent driving permits and junk computers in recent years. Two of \nthese complaints were filed against businesses in South Florida that \ntargeted Spanish speakers with advertisements for ``scientifically \nunfeasible'' weight-loss pills.\n  The Office of Consumer Advocacy and Outreach created by this bill \nwill provide information to targeted consumers in these communities on \nhow to protect themselves against fraudulent schemes and where to seek \nredress if they become a victim. The Office will work with law \nenforcement to track and investigate fraud schemes that target \nimmigrants, the elderly, minorities and other communities.\n  This legislation will create, develop, and manage an anonymous tip \nprogram that will allow individuals to report fraud schemes that \nspecifically target their community. The tip program will allow anyone \nwith knowledge of a fraud scheme involving deceptive advertising to get \na reward for reporting it directly to the experts who work at the \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  To help publicize the reward program, the number for this newly \ncreated hotline would be included in a Spanish-language public service \nadvertising campaign produced by the Federal Trade Commission that \nwarns against consumer fraud and provides the number for this newly \ncreated anonymous hotline.\n  Finally, the Office will work with law enforcement to increase their \nlevel of participation in the Consumer Sentinel database system. This \ndatabase, currently in existence, collects information from local, \nState and Federal agencies on consumer complaints to assist in the \ntracking and investigating of consumer fraud issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Trade Commission \n     Consumer Advocacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

PURPOSE OF THE OFFICE OF CONSUMER ADVOCACY AND \n                   OUTREACH.\n\n       The purpose of the Office of Consumer Advocacy and Outreach \n     is to protect minority consumers, disabled consumers, and \n     other targeted consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or \n     practices that violate section 5 of the Federal Trade \n     Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45).\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to increase penalties for trafficking with respect to \npeonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, over 100 years ago, our country \ncriminalized slavery with the 13th amendment to the U.S. constitution. \nYet, thousands of people in our country still live a life of slavery \nand forced prostitution.\n  According to the State Department, up to 800,000 people worldwide are \ntrafficked across borders each year. As many as 17,000 persons are \nbelieved to be trafficked in the United States annually.\n  The majority of these victims are women and children. Most of them \nare trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation.\n  Human trafficking is a highly profitable and dangerous business. It \ngenerates an estimated $9.5 billion annually and is closely connected \nto organized crime. Human trafficking operations have been linked to \nmoney-laundering, drug-trafficking, document forgery, and the funding \nof terrorist activities.\n  Those involved in human trafficking prey on the most vulnerable in \nour society. They seek out those living in poverty and those who have \nnot had access to a good education.\n  Human traffickers hold their victims against their will and force \nthem into slavery or the sex industry, where they are threatened and \noften physically or sexually abused.\n  The State Department is working with other nations to combat this \nproblem internationally, and we must do more here at home.\n  Those involved in human trafficking should face severe criminal \npenalties. It is my hope that such penalties will discourage this type \nof activity. Our country is a beacon of freedom for the world, and the \nidea that thousands of people a year are enslaved right in our own \nbackyard sickens me. This must be stopped.\n  In the past, Congress has passed laws increasing the penalties for \nhuman trafficking. I urge my colleagues to join me in increasing these \npenalties once again.\n  This bill makes the trafficking of humans a capital offense. It not \nonly\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nholds those who lure men, women, and children into a life of slavery \nand prostitution responsible; it also punishes those involved in the \ntransport or purchase of these victims.\n  This bill gives our courts the tools they need to curb this ongoing \nepidemic. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n   2439. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to provide for certain nuclear weapons \nprogram workers to be included in the Special Exposure Cohort under the \ncompensation program established by that Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to provide \ncompensation for civilian veterans of the Cold War who contracted \ncancer as a result of their work at our nuclear weapons facilities, The \nNevada Test Site Veteran's Compensation Act of 2006.\n  The Nevada Test Site Veteran's Compensation Act of 2006 will ensure \nthat employees who worked at the Nevada Test Site during the years of \nabove and below ground nuclear weapons testing and suffer from \nradiation-induced cancers as a result of that work finally receive the \ncompensation they deserve. These Cold War veterans sacrificed their \nhealth and wellbeing for their county. We can wait no longer to \nacknowledge those sacrifices and to try, in some small way, to \ncompensate for the cancers they have suffered as a result of their \nservice to their country.\n  United States citizens have served their country working in \nfacilities producing and testing nuclear weapons and engaging in other \natomic energy defense activities that served as a deterrent during the \nCold War. Many of these workers were exposed to cancer-causing levels \nof radiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of Energy and \ncontractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the Department without the \nknowledge and consent of the workers, without adequate radiation \nmonitoring, and without necessary protections from internal or external \noccupational radiation exposures.\n  Six years ago, I worked with President Clinton to pass The Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 \nU.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (EEOICPA) to ensure fairness and equity for the \nmen and women who performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear \nweapons production and testing programs by establishing a program that \nwould provide timely, uniform, and adequate compensation for 22 \nspecified radiation-related cancers.\n  Research by the Department of Energy, the National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), NIOSH's contractors, the \nPresident's Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and \ncongressional committees indicates that workers were not adequately \nmonitored for internal or external exposures to ionizing radiation to \nwhich the workers were exposed and records were not maintained, are not \nreliable, are incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes \nto which workers were exposed.\n  Because of the inequities posed by the factors described above and \nthe resulting harm to the workers, EEOICPA has an expedited process for \ngroups of workers whose radiation dose cannot be estimated with \nsufficient accuracy or whose dose cannot be estimated in a timely \nmanner. These workers are placed into a Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). \nWorkers in an SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction \nprocess, which can take years and be extremely difficult as these \nworkers are often unable to produce information because it was or is \nclassified.\n  Congress has already legislatively designated classes of atomic \nenergy veterans at the Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge \nK-25, Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, Alaska, sites as members of \nthe Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA. Amchitka Island was \ndesignated because three underground nuclear tests were conducted on \nthe Island.\n  Nevada Test Site workers deserve the same designation.\n  I and many other Nevadans remember watching explosions at the Nevada \nTest Site. We were struck with awe and wonder at the power and strength \nof these explosions. Little did we know that there was another side to \nthose atomic tests--the exposure of men and women working at the site \nto cancer-causing substances. Now, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \nthese Cold War veterans face deadly cancers. Many have already passed \naway.\n  The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security ofthe United \nStates throughout the Cold War and since has been unparalleled. In \n1950, President Harry S. Truman designated what would later be called \nthe Nevada Test Site as the Nation's nuclear proving grounds and, a \nmonth later, the first atmospheric test at the Nevada Test Site was \ndetonated. The United States conducted 100 aboveground and 828 \nunderground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site from 1951-1992. Out \nof the 1054 nuclear tests conducted in the United States, 928, or 88 \npercent, were conducted at the Nevada Test Site.\n  Unfortunately, Nevada Test Site workers, despite having worked with \nsignificant amounts of radioactive materials and having known exposures \nleading to serious health effects, have been denied compensation under \nEEOICPA as a result of flawed calculations based on records that are \nincomplete or in error as well as the use of faulty assumptions and \nincorrect models.\n  It has become evident that it is not feasible to estimate with \nsufficient accuracy the radiation dose received by employees at the \nDepartment of Energy facility in Nevada known as Nevada Test Site at \nall in some cases and in other in a timely manner. There are many \nreasons for this, including inadequate monitoring, incomplete \nradionuclide lists, and DOE's ignoring nearly a dozen tests conducted \nat the site that vented. Because of these problems, Nevada Test Site \nworkers have been denied compensation under the Act, some of which have \nwaited for decades for their government to acknowledge the sacrifices \nthey made for their country and compensate them.\n  Unfortunately, 6 years since the passage of EEOICPA and in some cases \ndecades after their service to their country, very few of those Nevada \nTest Site Cold War veterans who have cancer have received compensation. \nIn fact, Nevada Test Site workers are receiving compensation at a rate \nlower than the national average and many who have waited decades are \nbeing told that they have to wait longer. And many have already died \nwhile waiting for their compensation.\n  Last November, I sent a letter to President Bush asking him to \ninitiate this process himself. He still has not responded. However, his \nAdministration is trying to re-write the law via regulation and cut \nfunding to this program in order to delay compensation further and halt \nit for some workers altogether.\n  This is unacceptable. That is why I am committed to ensuring that \nNevada Test Site workers through 1993 are designated as a ``Special \nExposure Cohort.'' This will streamline and speed up the recovery \nprocess for those workers.\n  The Nevada Test Site Veteran's Compensation Act of 2006 would ensure \nemployees and survivors of employees who worked at the Nevada Test Site \nthrough 1993 that they receive compensation. They helped this country \nwin the cold war, sacrificing their personal health in the process and \nafter decades of waiting and suffering, it is time the government \nhonored these sacrifices\n  This bill would include within the Special Exposure Cohort, Nevada \nTest Site workers employed at the site from 1950-1993 who were: (1) \nPresent during an atmospheric or underground nuclear test or performed \ndrillbacks, re-entry, or clean up work following such test; (2) present \nat an episodic event involving radiation releases; or (3) employed at \nNevada Test Site for at least 250 work days and in a job activity that \nwas monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation or worked in a job \nactivity that is or was comparable to a job that is, was or should have \nbeen monitored for exposure to ionizing radiation.\n  The Nevada Test Site has served, and continues to serve, as the \npremier research, testing, and development site for our nuclear defense \ncapabilities. The Nevada Test Site and its workers have been, and are, \nan essential and irreplaceable part of our Nation's defense \ncapabilities. This bill would honor the service of our Atomic Energy \nveterans\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nand provide them with the compensation they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nevada Test Site Veterans' \n     Compensation Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Employees working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons \n     programs were employed in facilities owned by the Federal \n     Government and the private sector producing and testing \n     nuclear weapons and engaging in related atomic energy defense \n     activities for the national defense beginning in the 1940s.\n       (2) These Cold War atomic energy veterans helped to build \n     and test the nuclear arsenal that served as a deterrent \n     during the Cold War, sacrificing their personal health and \n     well-being in service of their country.\n       (3) During the Cold War, many of these workers were exposed \n     to radiation and placed in harm's way by the Department of \n     Energy and contractors, subcontractors, and vendors of the \n     Department without their knowledge and consent, without \n     adequate radiation monitoring, and without necessary \n     protections from internal or external occupational radiation \n     exposure.\n       (4) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (in this section \n     referred to as ``EEOICPA'') was enacted to ensure fairness \n     and equity for the men and women who, during the past 60 \n     years, performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear \n     weapons production and testing programs of the Department of \n     Energy, its predecessor agencies, and contractors by \n     establishing a program that would provide timely, uniform, \n     and adequate compensation for beryllium- and radiation-\n     related health conditions.\n       (5) Research by the Department of Energy, the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), NIOSH \n     contractors, the President's Advisory Board on Radiation and \n     Worker Health, and congressional committees indicates that at \n     certain nuclear weapons facilities--\n       (A) workers were not adequately monitored for internal or \n     external exposure to ionizing radiation; and\n       (B) records were not maintained, are not reliable, are \n     incomplete, or fail to indicate the radioactive isotopes to \n     which workers were exposed.\n       (6) Due to the inequities posed by the factors described \n     above and the resulting harm to the workers, Congress \n     designated classes of atomic weapons employees at the \n     Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge K-25, \n     Tennessee, and the Amchitka Island, Alaska, sites as members \n     of the Special Exposure Cohort under EEOICPA.\n       (7) The contribution of the State of Nevada to the security \n     of the United States throughout the Cold War and since has \n     been unparalleled.\n       (8) In 1950, President Harry S.

A bill to provide the Coast Guard and NOAA with additional \nauthorities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, to strengthen the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oil \nPollution Prevention and Response Act of 2006 with my colleagues \nSenators Lautenberg, Kerry, and Wyden. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \n(OPA 90) was passed shortly after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989, \nspilling 11 million gallons of crude oil in Alaska's pristine Prince \nWilliam Sound--the largest spill in US. history. OPA 90 revolutionized \noil spill risk management and we have OPA 90 to thank for improving oil \nspill prevention, preparedness, and response.\n  However, in a report and testimony recently provided to Congress, the \nU.S. Coast Guard identified serious shortcomings in our oil spill \nmanagement system. First, in a report transmitted to Congress on May \n12, 2005, the Coast Guard noted that the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund \nwas in danger of being depleted. And they noted that every state or \nU.S. territory has received money from the Fund for oil spills. Without \nthe Fund, states would have to provide funds for these emergency \nevents.\n  Through legislation that I cosponsored last year with Senator Stevens \nand Senator Inouye, which became law as part of the Energy Policy Act, \nwe solved part of this problem by reinstating OPA 90's per-barrel fee \non oil, in order to replenish the Fund, and raising the total level of \nprincipal from $1 billion to $2.7 billion. However, the Coast Guard \nalso noted that the costs of oil spills increasingly exceed the \nliability limits for responsible parties that were set back in 1990. \nUnder OPA 90, responsible parties can be reimbursed for costs above \ntheir liability limit from the Fund--and this practice continues to \ndeplete the Fund. This\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nissue also was highlighted at a field hearing of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard that I chaired \nlast August in Seattle, where the Coast Guard testified that the \ncurrent limits are too low. The bill I introduce today will increase \nthese caps so that we return to the ``polluter pays'' principle \nenshrined in OPA 90.\n  The devastating hurricane Katrina also led to an historic number of \noil spills. The Coast Guard has estimated that such spills could amount \nto close to $1 billion. If these claims are made against the Fund, the \nFund will be quickly wiped out. That's why the Oil Pollution Prevention \nand Response Act of 2006 would ensure that such claims would be covered \nthrough the Stafford Act process and supplemental funding, and not \nthrough the regular claims process of OPA 90. Finally, this bill would \nrequire improved accountability of how monies from the Fund are \nexpended by Federal agencies.\n  The Coast Guard also testified in our hearing that we must remain \nvigilant in our efforts to prevent oil spills. According to Coast Guard \ndata, although the number of oil spills from vessels has decreased \nenormously since passage of OPA 90, the volume of oil spilled \nnationwide is still significant. In fact, vessels spilled 665,432 \ngallons of oil in 1992, while in 2004, the total was higher, at 722,768 \ngallons. Significant numbers of spills are still occurring. In 2004, \nthere were 36 spills from tank ships, 141 spills from barges, and 1,562 \nspills from other vessels, including cargo ships. And even though the \nnumber of spills from tankers declined from 193 spills in 1992 to 36 \nspills in 2004, a single incident from a vessel like the Exxon Valdez \ncan be devastating, as the recent Athos I incident in the Delaware \nRiver and Bay demonstrates.\n\n  The bill I introduce today addresses a number of key areas to improve \nprevention and response. Because human error is the leading cause of \naccidental oil spills, the Coast Guard would be required to identify \nand pass regulations to address the most frequent sources of human \nerror that have led to oil spills from vessels and ``near-misses.'' It \nwould require the Coast Guard to ensure the safety of single hull \ntankers and other high-risk vessels by increasing inspections of such \nvessels. The Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2006 also \nwould require the Coast Guard to address and reduce the increased risk \nof oil spills from oil transfers. It would also make companies who \nknowingly hire substandard single-hull tank vessels after 2010 \n``responsible parties'' in order to provide a disincentive for such \ncontracts.\n  Of particular importance to my state, the bill would provide a \nmechanism for year-round funding of the Neah Bay rescue tug, a central \nelement of the oil spill prevention safety net for Washington state's \nouter coast. It would also increase oil spill preparedness in the \nStrait of Juan de Fuca by changing the definition of ``High Volume \nPort'' for Puget Sound to make the westerly boundary begin at the entry \nto the Strait. This change would require oil spill response equipment \nto be stationed along the entire Strait and not just east of the \ncurrent line at Port Angeles. In addition, the Oil Pollution Prevention \nand Response Act of 2006 would require improved coordination with \nfederally-recognized tribes on oil spill prevention, preparedness, and \nresponse. Finally, the bill would codify into federal law the \nestablishment of the Oil Spill Advisory Council, which was created by \nthe Washington State Legislature and Governor Gregoire in the wake of \nthe October 2004 Daleo Passage Oil Spill. My bill would provide $1 \nmillion annually to support the Council's important work.\n  The slow response to the oil spill in Dalco Passage in the Puget \nSound was largely attributed to difficulties with detecting the oil \nthat was spilled. The Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2006 \nwould reinvigorate a federal research program on oil spill prevention, \ndetection, and response, and would establish a grant program for the \ndevelopment of cost-effective technologies for detecting discharges of \noil from vessels, including infrared, pressure sensors, and remote \nsensing. It would also require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nconjunction with other federal agencies, to conduct an analysis of the \ncondition and safety of all aspects of oil transportation in the United \nStates, and provide recommendations to improve such safety. This was a \nspecific recommendation of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.\n  The Department of Justice has also noted that a major category of oil \nspills are intentional discharges of oil from vessels. The United \nStates cannot address this problem alone. Thus, the bill would require \nthe Coast Guard to pursue stronger enforcement measures for oil \ndischarges in the International Maritime Organization and other \nappropriate international organizations.\n  Oil spill prevention and response is timely for Congress' \nconsideration because waterborne transportation of oil in the United \nStates continues to increase, significant volumes of oil continue to be \nreleased, and the potential for a major spill remains unacceptably \nhigh. Recent spills involving significant quantities of oil have \noccurred off the coasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, \nVirginia, and Washington, and involved barges, tankers, and non-tank \nvessels.\n  One thing we've learned from these spills is that it is more cost-\neffective to prevent oil spills than it is to clean-up oil once it is \nreleased into the environment. We've also learned that although double \nhulls and redundant steering do increase tanker safety, these \ntechnologies are not a panacea and we need to do more to ensure against \noil spills.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the Nation's \nnatural resources, public health, and environment by improving Federal \nmeasures to prevent and respond to oil spills. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Oil released into the Nation's marine waters can cause \n     substantial, and in some cases irreparable, harm to the \n     marine environment.\n       (2) The economic impact of oil spills is substantial. \n     Billions of dollars have been spent\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\n     in the United States for cleanup of, and damages due to, oil \n     spills.\n       (3) The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, enacted in response to \n     the worst vessel oil spill in United States history, \n     substantially reduced the amount of oil spills from vessels. \n     However, significant volumes of oil continue to be released, \n     and the potential for a major spill remains unacceptably \n     high.\n       (4) Although the total number of oil spills from vessels \n     has decreased since passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, \n     more oil was spilled in 2004 from vessels nationwide than was \n     spilled from vessels in 1992.\n       (5) Waterborne transportation of oil in the United States \n     continues to increase.\n       (6) Although the number of oil spills from tankers declined \n     from 193 in 1992 to 36 in 2004, spills from oil tankers tend \n     to be large with devastating impacts.\n       (7) While the number of oil spills from tank barges has \n     declined since 1992 (322 spills to 141 spills in 2004), the \n     volume of oil spilled from tank barges has remained constant \n     at approximately 200,000 gallons spilled each year.\n       (8) Oil spills from non-tank vessels averaged between \n     125,000 gallons and 400,000 gallons per year from 1992 \n     through 2004 and accounted for over half of the total number \n     of spills from all sources, including vessels and non-vessel \n     sources.\n       (9) Recent spills involving significant quantities of oil \n     have occurred off the coasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, \n     Oregon, Virginia, and Washington, and involved barges, tank \n     vessels, and non-tank vessels.\n       (10) The existing statutory caps that limit liability for \n     responsible parties were set in 1990 and have not been \n     modified since. These liability levels no longer reflect the \n     costs of oil spills, particularly for barges and large non-\n     tank vessels. For example, the liability limit for the ATHOS \n     I oil spill was $45,400,000, but costs could exceed \n     $267,000,000. Similarly, the liability limit for the \n     SELENDANG AYU spill was $23,800,000 while the actual costs \n     will likely exceed $100,000,000.\n       (11) It is more cost-effective to prevent oil spills than \n     it is to clean-up oil once it is released into the \n     environment.\n       (12) Of the 20 major vessel oil spill incidents since 1990 \n     where liability limits have been exceeded, 10 involved tank \n     barges, 8 involved non-tank vessels, 2 involved tankers, and \n     only 1 involved a vessel that was double-hulled.\n       (13) Although recent technological improvements in oil \n     tanker design, such as double hulls and redundant steering, \n     increase tanker safety, these technologies are not a panacea \n     and cannot ensure against oil spills, the leading cause of \n     which is human error.\n       (14) The Federal government has a responsibility to protect \n     the nation's natural resources, public health, and \n     environment by improving Federal measures to prevent and \n     respond to oil spills.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SAFETY STANDARDS FOR TOWING VESSELS.\n\n       In promulgating regulations for towing vessels under \n     chapter 33 of title 46, United States Code, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (1) give priority to completing such regulations for towing \n     operations involving tank vessels;\n       (2) ensure that such regulations appropriately address the \n     risks from such operations, taking into account such factors \n     as vessel age and hull configuration; and\n       (3) consider the possible application of standards that, as \n     of the date of enactment of this Act, apply to self-propelled \n     tank vessels, and any modifications that may be necessary for \n     application to towing vessels due to ship design, safety, and \n     other relevant factors.\n\n     SEC. 103. INSPECTIONS BY COAST GUARD.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall ensure that the \n     inspection schedule for all United States and foreign-flag \n     tank vessels that enter a United States port or place \n     increases the frequency and comprehensiveness of Coast Guard \n     safety inspections based on such factors as vessel age, hull \n     configuration, past violations of any applicable discharge \n     and safety regulations under United States and international \n     law, indications that the class societies inspecting such \n     vessels may be substandard, and other factors relevant to the \n     potential risk of an oil spill.\n       (b) Enhanced Verification of Structural Condition.--The \n     Coast Guard shall adopt, as part of its inspection \n     requirements for tank vessels, additional procedures for \n     enhancing the verification of the reported structural \n     condition of such vessels, taking into account the Condition \n     Assessment Scheme adopted by the International Maritime \n     Organization by Resolution 94(46) on April 27, 2001.\n\n     SEC. 104. OIL TRANSFERS FROM VESSELS.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--Within 1 year after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to \n     reduce the risks of oil spills in operations involving the \n     transfer of oil from or to a tank vessel. The regulations--\n       (1) shall focus on operations that have the highest risks \n     of discharge, including operations at night and in inclement \n     weather; and\n       (2) shall include--\n       (A) requirements for use of equipment such as putting booms \n     in place for transfers;\n       (B) operational procedures such as manning standards, \n     communications protocols, and restrictions on operations in \n     high-risk areas; or\n       (C) both such requirements and operational procedures.\n       (b) Application with State Laws.--The regulations \n     promulgated under subsection (a) do not preclude the \n     enforcement of any State law or regulation the requirements \n     of which are at least as stringent as requirements under the \n     regulations (as determined by the Secretary) that--\n       (1) applies in State waters; and\n       (2) does not conflict with, or interfere with the \n     enforcement of, requirements and operational procedures under \n     the regulations.\n\n     SEC. 105. IMPROVEMENTS TO REDUCE HUMAN ERROR AND NEAR-MISS \n                   INCIDENTS.\n\n       (a) Report.--Within 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary shall transmit a report to the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the \n     House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the types of human errors that, combined, \n     account for over 50 percent of all oil spills involving \n     vessels that have been caused by human error in the past 10 \n     years;\n       (2) identifies the most frequent types of near-miss oil \n     spill incidents involving vessels such as collisions, \n     groundings, and loss of propulsion in the past 10 years; and\n       (3) includes recommendations by the Secretary to address \n     the identified types of errors and incidents.\n       (b) Regulations.--Based on the findings contained in the \n     report required by subsection (a), the Secretary shall \n     promulgate regulations designed to reduce the risks of oil \n     spills from human errors.\n       (c) International Measures.--Based on the findings \n     contained in the report required by subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall take appropriate action at the International \n     Maritime Organization to reduce the risk of oil spills from \n     human error internationally.\n\n     SEC. 106. NAVIGATIONAL MEASURES FOR PROTECTION OF NATURAL \n                   RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Designation of At-risk Areas.--The Secretary and the \n     Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall \n     jointly identify areas where routing or other navigational \n     measures are warranted in waters subject to the jurisdiction \n     of the United States to reduce the risk of oil spills and \n     potential damage to natural resources. In identifying those \n     areas, the Secretary and the Undersecretary shall give \n     priority consideration to natural resources of particular \n     ecological importance or economic importance, including \n     commercial fisheries, aquaculture\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\n     facilities, marine sanctuaries designated by the Secretary of \n     Commerce pursuant to the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), estuaries of national significance \n     designated under section 319 of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1330), critical habitats (as defined \n     in section 3(5) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1532(5)), estuarine research reserves within the \n     National Estuarine Research Reserve System established by \n     section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, and \n     national parks and national seashores administered by the \n     National Park Service under the National Park Service Organic \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).\n       (b) Factors Considered.--In determining whether \n     navigational measures are warranted, the Secretary and the \n     Undersecretary shall consider, at a minimum--\n       (1) the frequency of transits of vessels required to \n     prepare a response plan under section 311(j) of the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(j));\n       (2) the type and quantity of oil transported as cargo or \n     fuel;\n       (3) the expected benefits of routing measures in reducing \n     risks of spills;\n       (4) the costs of such measures;\n       (5) the safety implications of such measures; and\n       (6) the nature and value of the resources to be protected \n     by such measures.\n       (c) Establishment of Routing and Other Navigational \n     Measures.--The Secretary shall establish such routing or \n     other navigational measures for areas identified under \n     subsection (a).\n       (d) Establishment of Avoidance Areas.--To the extent that \n     the Secretary and the Undersecretary conclude that the \n     establishment of areas to be avoided is warranted under this \n     section, they shall seek to establish such areas through the \n     International Maritime Organization or establish comparable \n     areas pursuant to regulations and in a manner that is \n     consistent with international law.\n       (e) Oil Shipment Data and Report.--\n       (1) Data collection.--The Secretary, through the Commandant \n     of the Coast Guard and in consultation with the Army Corps of \n     Engineers, shall collect and analyze data on oil transported \n     as cargo on vessels in the navigable waters of the United \n     States, including information on--\n       (A) the quantity and type of oil being transported;\n       (B) the vessels used for such transportation;\n       (C) the frequency with which each type of oil is being \n     transported; and\n       (D) the point of origin, transit route, and destination of \n     each such shipment of oil.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall transmit a report, not \n     less frequently than quarterly, to the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, on the data \n     collected and analyzed under paragraph (1) in a format that \n     does not disclose information exempted from disclosure under \n     section 552b(e) of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 107. EXISTING AREAS TO BE AVOIDED.\n\n       (a) Enforcement of Existing Areas to be Avoided \n     Provisions.--The Secretary and the Under Secretary of \n     Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall cooperate in \n     tracking compliance by vessels with the conditions and \n     requirements of areas to be avoided established in United \n     States waters, and shall enforce compliance with those \n     conditions and requirements. A violation of those conditions \n     and requirements is subject to a civil penalty of not more \n     than $100,000, and each day of a continuing violation \n     constitutes a separate violation.\n       (b) Olympic Coast Natural Marine Sanctuary Area to be \n     avoided.--The Secretary and the Undersecretary of Commerce \n     for Oceans and Atmosphere shall--\n       (1) revise the area to be avoided off the coast of the \n     State of Washington so that restrictions apply to all vessels \n     required to prepare a response plan under section 311(j) of \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(j)) \n     (other than fishing vessels while engaged in fishing within \n     the area to be avoided); and\n       (2) revise the area to be avoided to make the conditions \n     and requirements for that area to be avoided mandatory, \n     consistent with international law.\n       (c) Emergency Drill.--Beginning with 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall conduct, \n     jointly with other Federal agencies and State, local, and \n     tribal governmental entities, regular, unannounced emergency \n     drills for responding to an oil spill in the Olympic Coast \n     National Marine Sanctuary.\n       (d) RACON Beacons.--The Secretary shall place 1 or more \n     radar beacons in or near the area to be avoided described in \n     subsection (b) in sites that maximize warnings to vessels of \n     the boundaries of that area.\n\n     SEC. 108. HIGHER VOLUME PORT REGULATORY DEFINITION CHANGE.\n\n       Within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     notwithstanding subchapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, \n     the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall modify the definition \n     of the term ``higher volume port area'' contained in section \n     155.1020 of the Coast Guard regulations (33 C.F.R. 155.1020) \n     by striking ``Port Angeles, WA'' in paragraph (13) of that \n     section and inserting ``Cape Flattery, WA'' without \n     initiating a rulemaking proceeding.\n\n     SEC. 109. RECREATIONAL BOATER OUTREACH PROGRAM.\n\n       The Secretary shall establish an outreach program for \n     recreational boaters and commercial and recreational \n     fishermen to inform them about ways in which they can assist \n     in reducing the risk of an oil spill or release.

A bill to authorize resources for a grant program for local \neducational agencies to create innovation districts; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill--the \n``Innovation Districts for School Improvement Act''--to establish \ngrants to 20 school districts across the country. Through competitive \ngrants, these districts would be offered new resources in return for \nsystematic reforms and measurable results.\n  Today, in my own state, out of every 100 African-American or Latino \nmales in the Chicago schools at age 13, only 3 or fewer will continue \non to earn a degree from a 4-year college. The chances of success for a \nyoung man of color in many of our urban school districts are the same \nas the chance of a soldier in Napoleon's Grand Army surviving in the \ndismal march to Moscow. That is considered a great historical folly, a \nwaste of a generation of young talent. How will we be judged?\n  Today, a good education is parceled out to some and denied to others, \nhanded down, as a privilege, from generation to generation. A good \neducation is denied not only to children of color in our cities, but \nalso to children living in poverty in our rural areas.\n  Today, 6 million middle and high school students are reading with \nskills far below their grade level. Half of all teenagers are unable to \nunderstand basic fractions, and half of all 9 year olds are unable to \nperform basic multiplication or division. We now have one of the \nhighest high school dropout rates of any industrialized country.\n  This is a folly and a failure that hurts us all. As we continue in \nthis failure, other nations are moving ahead of us. We know that China \nand India are training more skilled engineers, who are developing new \ntechnologies and innovating in ways that result from their investments \nin education. We live in a world where few American jobs are secure, \nand we know that to compete successfully, we must better educate our \nstudents. All our students: urban and rural, black and white, rich and \npoor.\n  In fact, America's richest untapped source of talent may be in our \nunderserved cities and poor rural areas, among students now trapped in \ninadequate schools. The best strategy for maintaining America's \neconomic preeminence is to give more students the knowledge and the \nskills to innovate. To achieve this, our schools, too, must innovate.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Innovation Districts for \nSchool Improvement Act. We need to make sure there is an effective \nteacher in every classroom and an effective principal in every school. \nWe need to make sure teachers are not distributed in a way that \ndisproportionately places inexperienced and untrained teachers in \nclassrooms with students who need the best teachers. We need to help \nyoung teachers get the training and coaching they need, and make sure \nthat experienced teachers have the career opportunities that make use \nof their talents, giving the best ones a chance to train younger \nteachers, and a reason to stay in their schools and take on added \nroles.\n  Many schools do this and achieve encouraging results. The Innovation \nDistricts for School Improvement Act would apply lessons from these \nsuccesses, with school districts from across the country becoming \nseedbeds for further reform. Innovation Districts will focus on teacher \nrecruitment, training, and retention, using successful residency-based \nprograms as a model. They would offer performance pay increases to \nhigh-performing teachers, and financial incentives to teachers willing \nto work in low income schools.\n  Innovation Districts would partner with local universities, \ncharitable foundations or community institutions to develop, execute, \nand evaluate their reforms. Most importantly, Innovation Districts \nwould look at new ways to do things better, identify current practices \nthat prevent them from innovating, and show us that if we are willing \nto support and rethink our schools, all our children can learn, all our \nchildren can compete, and our schools can be the best in the world.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2442. A bill to require the President or the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States to submit to Congress draft \ninvestigation reports on national security related investigations, to \naddress mandatory investigations by such committee, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce common sense \nlegislation that would improve the way we review proposed purchases of \nAmerican assets by foreign companies and governments.\n  Much has already been said about the prospect of Dubai Ports World \ntaking responsibility for some of the operations of our nation's ports. \nThe way that the Bush Administration has handled this situation has \nmade it very clear that the process we currently use to review the \nnational security implications of foreign acquisitions is simply not \nworking. We must do better.\n  Let me be clear: I do not believe that we should automatically \ndismiss out of hand any potential foreign investments in this country. \nVibrant trade, when conducted sensibly and fairly, is good for America.\n  However, I think that for any proposed deal in which a foreign \ncompany would take over important responsibilities related to America's \ncritical infrastructure--whether it be our ports, our railroads, our \nairports, or anything else that is fundamental to our national \nsecurity--we should take a very close look at such a deal.\n  For any proposed deal in which a foreign country would take over any \nof our nations' companies, we should take an even closer look.\n  I strongly believe that we should be building our ties with friendly \nArab nations, through diplomacy, trade, and all of the other mechanisms \nwe have at our disposal. However, the process by which this Dubai Ports \nWorld deal was waved through by the Bush Administration without \nanything resembling a thorough review of the security risks is simply \nnot good enough.\n  This bill would improve the review process in five ways.\n  First, my legislation would require that a more thorough 45-day \ninvestigation be undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States (CFIUS) when either of two situations occurs: when a \nforeign government wants to purchase any assets in the United States, \nand when a foreign-owned company wants to purchase critical \ninfrastructure in the United States.\n  Second, my bill would mandate that at least 7 days before the end of \na foreign investment review, the CFIUS chair must submit a draft of its \nreport to the Homeland Security committees in each chamber.\n  Third, when the CFIUS review is completed, each cabinet secretary \nwhose agency has been involved in the review must certify in writing \nhis or her agreement or dissent.\n  Fourth, under current law, the President can only block a transaction \nwhen the buyer ``might fail to take necessary action to prevent \nimpairment of the national security,'' which is an extraordinarily high \nthreshold for action. My bill would lower the threshold so that the \nPresident can realistically take action in more ambiguous situations \nwhere there is credible evidence that the buyer itself presents a \nnational security threat.\n  Fifth, the bill would mandate that CFIUS should be chaired by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security instead of the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  I believe that these common sense reforms will support healthy trade \nand investment, but will at the same time ensure that foreign \ninvestments in American assets do not compromise our national security. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to combine my bill with \nthe many other good ideas that have been proposed in order to pass \nlegislation that will make this review process stronger.\n  Our national security--and our economic strength--depend on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2443. A bill to grant the power to the President to reduce budget \nauthority; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in his final State of the Union Address, \nPresident Reagan stood for the last time before both Houses of Congress \nand asked for line-item veto authority for future Presidents.\n  On that evening, the President had with him three pieces of \nlegislation: an\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nappropriations bill that was 1,053 pages long and weighed 14 pounds; a \nbudget reconciliation bill that was 1,186 pages long and weighed 15 \npounds; and a continuing resolution that was 1,057 pages long and \nweighed 14 pounds. President Reagan slammed down on the lectern the 43 \npounds of paper and ink, which represented 1 trillion dollars' worth of \nspending. He did so to emphasize the magnitude of wasteful spending in \nthe bills--spending that the President could not stop unless he was \nwilling to veto each piece of legislation in its entirety. In the case \nof the continuing resolution, that would have meant that the Federal \ngovernment would shut down.\n  Almost 20 years later we are in exactly the same situation we were in \nwhen President Reagan said to Congress, ``Let's help ensure our future \nof prosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will not \nget use to use it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must \nhave. Give the President the same authority that 43 Governors use in \ntheir States: the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare \naway the waste, and enforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line-\nitem veto.''\n  Last week, President Bush rightly renewed Ronald Reagan's call for \nline-item veto authority by sending to Congress a legislative proposal \nfor a form of line-item veto authority known as expedited rescission. \nThat proposal was introduced as the Line Item Rescission Act of 2006 \nshortly after the President offered it. I am an original cosponsor of \nthat legislation, which would authorize the President to propose \nspending and targeted tax benefits that would ultimately have to be \napproved by a majority of each House of Congress. The Line Item \nRescission Act is one way to give the President more authority to \nimpose fiscal restraint, and if it were enacted it would constitute a \nsignificant move in Washington, DC, towards fiscal discipline.\n  Today, I am introducing the Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto \nAct of 2006 to present what I believe is a stronger approach to \ngranting the President true line-item veto power. Under this proposal, \nwhich is crafted to ensure its constitutionality, each item of every \nappropriation measure and authorization measure containing new direct \nspending or new targeted tax benefits passed by Congress would be \nseparately enrolled. The President would then be able to consider each \nitem as a separate bill and would have the power to veto items that, as \nPresident Bush has said, constitute unneeded spending that reflects \nspecial interests instead of the people's interest.\n  We must keep in mind that even strong line-item veto authority will \nnot solve all of our fiscal problems. We also desperately need to \nreform our earmarking process and our lobbying practices--and we must \nremember that it is ultimately Congress's responsibility to control \nspending. However, granting the President line-item veto authority \nwould go a long way toward restoring credibility to a system ravaged by \ncongressional waste and special interest pork. I look forward to the \nSenate's consideration of line-item veto legislation, and I trust that \nCongress will act on such legislation soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2444. A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to \nestablish a program to provide grant assistance to States for the \nrehabilitation and repair of deficient dams; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Daniel Inouye, to introduce the Senate companion to \nH.R. 1105, the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act, which was introduced \nby Representative Sue Kelly and co-sponsored by my colleagues from the \nState of Hawaii, Representatives Neil Abercrombie and Ed Case.\n  The Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act will improve the safety of our \nNation's dams by establishing a Federal program to assist Hawaii and \nother states in rehabilitating publicly owned dams that pose a risk to \npublic safety.\n  Storms that struck Hawaii in recent weeks remind us that the \ndevastation wrought by the collapse of a dam can be severe and tragic. \nAll too often, these catastrophic collapses come with little or no \nwarning, leaving those in the path of flooding with no time to avoid \ndanger.\n  Dam safety is a neglected aspect of our homeland security. While we \nplan for the possibility that terrorists may attack our infrastructure, \nwe fail to fully recognize that critical infrastructure is also subject \nto the forces of nature and, therefore, prone to wear and tear. Just as \nwe must guard against attacks on our critical infrastructure, we must \nalso be attentive to its maintenance.\n  Our Nation has thousands of dams. The homes and businesses of \nmillions of Americans are in the path of potentially catastrophic \nflooding that could result from dam failures. Some of our great cities \nare at risk, as are vast tracts of our most productive agricultural \nland. Although dams are often out of sight and given little regard in \neveryday life, we put lives and property at peril when we fail to \nproperly maintain them.\n  The Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act takes an important step forward \nby allocating Federal funds for the repair and rehabilitation of \npublicly owned dams that are deemed to be unsafe. Specifically, this \nbill will: Mandate the Director of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (FEMA) to establish a program providing grant assistance to \nstates for the repair of dams that pose a public safety risk; require \nthe FEMA Director to determine appropriate procedures for awarding \ngrants and allocating funds; establish a risk-based priority system to \nidentify dams in need of repair; and establish a cost sharing \narrangement between the Federal Government and States.\n  In addition, I am working to ensure that both public and private dams \nreceive the maintenance they need for the public's safety, and I \nappreciate the technical assistance that the American Society of Civil \nEngineers has given me on this critical problem. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass legislation that augments the \nNational Dam Safety Program and provides states with the necessary \nassistance to protect the public.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at this point a letter \nfrom the Dam Safety Coalition endorsing this legislation and that text \nof the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Dam Safety Coalition,\n\n                                                   March 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The dam safety, engineering, and \n     construction community would like to commend you for your \n     commitment to dam safety and for introducing the Dam Repair \n     and Rehabilitation Act in U.S. Senate. The legislation would \n     fill a vital need in our infrastructure by developing a \n     federal funding program devoted to repairing the nation's \n     unsafe dams.\n       Dams are a vital part of our nation's aging infrastructure \n     and provide enormous benefits to the majority of Americans--\n     benefits that include drinking water, flood protection, \n     renewable hydroelectric power, navigation, irrigation and \n     recreation. Yet, these critical daily benefits' provided by \n     the nation's dams are inextricably linked to the potential \n     consequences of a dam failure if the dam is not maintained, \n     or is unable to impound water, pass large flood events or \n     withstand earthquake events in a safe manner.\n       In 2005, ASCE published the Report Card for America's \n     Infrastructure giving the condition of our nation's dams a \n     grade of D, equal to the overall infrastructure grade. States \n     have identified 3,500 unsafe or deficient dams, many being \n     susceptible to large flood events or earthquakes. The \n     Association of State Dam Safety Officials, in its October \n     2003 report entitled ``The Cost of Rehabilitating Our \n     Nation's Dams'', estimated that $10 billion would be needed \n     to repair the most critical dams over the next 12 years.\n       It is a reasonable expectation of every American to be \n     protected by our government; including protection from \n     preventable disasters such as dam failures.\n       We look forward to working with you to enact the Dam \n     Rehabilitation and Repair Act in the 109th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian Pallasch,\n     Co-Chair, Dam Safety Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the minimum penalties for violations of \nthe Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mine Safety \nEnforcement, Reporting, and Training Act. This bill will raise the \nminimum fine for safety violations from $60 to $500, require coal mine \noperators to pay fines up front, require a public yearly report of fine \npayments, and double funding for education and training grants to \nStates from $10 million to $20 million.\n  The recent tragic events in West Virginia and Kentucky have captured \nthe Nation's attention and exposed the serious dangers our miners face \nevery day. Safety violations often result in injuries that cost miners \ntheir health, livelihood or lives. Safety inspectors have advised me \nthat the fines need to be tougher when a company violates our safety \nlaws and that we need to put more resources into training inspectors.\n  The vast majority of fines issued in 2005 were under $100. \nUnfortunately, many multimillion dollar mining companies view these \nfines no worse than a minor speeding ticket. Hopefully, raising the \nminimum fine from $60 to $500 will prompt these companies to get \nserious about making safety improvements.\n  Many coal operators are taking advantage of the current system which \nallows them to withhold payment of fines levied against them while \nnegotiating to reduce the amount of those fines. From 2001 to 2003, \nmore than two-thirds of all major fines were reduced from the original \namount imposed by safety inspectors from the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration (MSHA). MSHA reports that of the fines that are \nappealed, the average reduction is 47 percent.\n  Moreover, since 2001, almost half of all fines have not been \ncollected. Federal records also show that in the last two years the \nfederal mine safety agency has failed to hand over any delinquent cases \nto the Treasury Department for further collection efforts, as is \nsupposed to occur after 180 days. I believe that a public report card \nof fine payments gives us the chance to grade these companies and make \nnecessary changes before we have another tragic accident on our hands.\n  Over the years, funding for education and training grants has \nsteadily declined--seriously impacting the agency's ability to meet the \ntraining needs of individual States. Nationally, MSHA awards up to $10 \nmillion in grants annually, and like many other states, my home state \nof Illinois has witnessed a reduction in grants in the past ten years, \nwhich is especially troublesome during a time of revived coal mining \nactivity. State regulating agencies, such as the Illinois Office of \nMines and Minerals, uses the funds it receives from MSHA to purchase \nsafety vehicles, rescue training equipment and to\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\nhelp train new coal mine employees. Not only are state mine agencies \nunable to purchase new equipment as old equipment wears out, but state \nagencies are having trouble purchasing modern mine rescue training \nequipment.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort to increase \nenforcement efforts, public reporting of violations, and education and \ntraining grants for the benefit of our coal miners across the country. \nOur coal miners deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to reduce the \nage for receipt of military retired pay for nonregular service from 60 \nyears of age to 55 years of age; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for several years members of this Chamber \nhave worked to reduce the age that retired members of the National \nGuard and Reserve can receive their retirement pay from 60 to 55. \nSenator Corzine offered such legislation in the first session of this \nCongress, and I was delighted to co-sponsor it. With Senator Corzine's \ndeparture from the Senate for the New Jersey State House, we have \nreassembled the body of co-sponsors and are introducing this \nlegislation again to signal our continued commitment to addressing this \nissue.\n  The issue is simple. If you join the active duty Army at age 18 and \nserve 20 years on active duty, retiring at age 38, you are immediately \neligible to receive retirement pay. If you join the National Guard or \nReserves, you may retire after 20 years, but you must wait until age 60 \nto begin collecting retirement pay. A 38-year-old veteran of the Guard \nand Reserves must wait 22 years to see any of their retirement pay.\n  To be sure, everyone recognizes the difference between service in the \nactive component and the reserve component in peace time. But since \nSeptember 11, 2001, as we are reminded almost daily, we have been a \nNation at war. Our National Guard and Reserves have been fully engaged \nin the War against al Qaeda and the War in Iraq. As of last week, \nnearly 120,000 reservists were mobilized, including 1,230 troops from \nmy home state of Massachusetts. And sadly, almost 600 members of the \nGuard and Reserves have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country.\n  We can never fully express our Nation's gratitude for their service \nand sacrifice, but we can try to make benefits and compensation more \nworthy of the commitment and service shown by America's citizen \nsoldiers. That's exactly what the legislation I introduce today seeks \nto accomplish. I'm delighted to be joined in this effort by Senators \nDayton, Durbin, Johnson, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Menendez, and Reid.\n  It is no secret that our all volunteer force is stretched. Recruiting \nnumbers have sagged under the anxieties and concerns of a nation at \nwar. Retention has remained healthy to date, but as the nation \napproaches its 5th year of war, we must be proactive in seeking to \nsupport those who have already done so much for us. Reducing the age at \nwhich members of the Guard and Reserves can receive their retirement \npay can help make continued service more attractive, retaining those in \nwhom America has already invested so much.\n  We are asking for more from our National Guard and Reserve members \nthan ever before. In turn we should be providing them with what they \ndeserve and have certainly earned. This legislation would be a small \nstep in the right direction to honor the service of these Americans and \nto ensure their continued strength.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN AGE FOR RECEIPT OF MILITARY RETIRED \n                   PAY FOR NONREGULAR SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Age.--Section 12731(a)(1) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``at least 60 \n     years of age'' and inserting ``at least 55 years of age''.\n       (b) Application to Existing Provisions of Law or Policy.--\n     With respect to any provision of law, or of any policy, \n     regulation, or directive of the executive branch that refers \n     to a member or former member of the uniformed services as \n     being eligible for, or entitled to, retired pay under chapter \n     1223 of title 10, United States Code, but for the fact that \n     the member or former member is under 60 years of age, such \n     provision shall be carried out with respect to that member or \n     former member by substituting for the reference to being 60 \n     years of age, a reference to the age in effect for \n     qualification for such retired pay under section 12731(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first month \n     beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and shall apply to retired pay payable for that month and \n     subsequent months.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2450. A bill to strengthen national security by encouraging and \nassisting in the expansion and improvement of educational programs in \norder to meet critical needs at the elementary, secondary, and higher \neducation levels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nwith Senator Durbin that will increase educational opportunities in \nscience, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), and foreign \nlanguages for all students.\n  Last month, I shared with my colleagues the need to expand \neducational opportunities in these areas so that the youth of today can \nmeet the challenges of tomorrow. The President, in his State of the \nUnion address, said that America's ability to compete in global markets \nand to defend the nation against foreign threats depends on the \nstrength of our educational system. On this point, he and I agree. Our \nfuture national and economic security are tied directly to our \nmathematical, scientific, and linguistic acumen.\n  For example, prior to 9/11, the Intelligence Community was not \nprepared\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\nto handle the challenge of translating the volumes of foreign language \ncounter-terrorism intelligence it had collected. The Intelligence \nCommunity faced backlogs in material awaiting translation, a shortage \nof language specialists and language-qualified field officers, and a \nreadiness level of only 30 percent in the most critical foreign \nlanguages. This news, however, was not new. In 2000, Ellen Laipson, \nVice Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, reported similar \nproblems and said that thousands of technical papers providing details \non foreign research and development in scientific or technical areas \nwere not being translated because of the lack of personnel to interpret \nthe material, which could lead to the possibility of ``a technological \nsurprise.''\n  It is clear that our national security relies on having a workforce \nskilled in the areas of science, technology, engineering, math, and \nforeign languages. We need to take action to strengthen education in \nthese areas so that the United States can compete, prosper, and be \nsecure in the 21st Century. A major investment in America's education \nsystem is necessary to ensure that we can communicate with and \nunderstand the cultures of our world partners and competitors. In the \nwords of the Committee for Economic Development, ``we must redefine, as \neach generation has done, what it means to be an educated American in a \nchanging world.'' Enactment of the Homeland Security Education Act \nprovides the framework to enhance our education system to ensure that \nour nation's youth will have the skills needed for success.\n  Our education system must be reenergized and reinvigorated to meet \nthe needs of our nation by preparing students to be proficient in \nforeign languages and leaders in the scientific and engineering fields. \nOur schools need the equipment and the materials to teach the critical \nSTEM and foreign language courses and bring these subjects to life. To \naddress these issues our bill would: encourage public private \npartnerships to improve science and math curricula; upgrade laboratory \nfacilities; provide scholarships for students to study math, science, \nor engineering at the university level; and establish internship and \nmentoring opportunities for students in grades K through 12; develop \ncultural awareness and immersion programs in colleges and universities \nthat combine science, technology, and engineering instruction with \nforeign language to expand international understanding and scientific \ncollaboration; and create language learning pathways to facilitate \nproficiency in critical foreign languages from Kindergarten through \ngraduate school.\n\n  However, no amount of funding or new programs will address the \nproblem if there are not enough teachers trained in these subjects. To \naddress the shortage of STEM and foreign language teachers, our bill \nincludes provisions to award scholarships in the amount of $15,000 to \nlanguage-proficient individuals and practicing scientists and engineers \nto return to school and earn their degrees and become certified to \nteach these critical skills to students in high-need, low income \nschools. Our bill would also allow National Security Education Program \nscholarship and fellowship recipients to meet their service \nrequirements by teaching in these critical areas if they cannot find a \nnational security position in the Federal Government.\n  A key provision in the Homeland Security Education Act focuses on \nforeign language teacher training by awarding grants to facilitate \npartnerships between K through 12 schools and institutions of higher \neducation to build professional development programs, summer workshops \nor institutes, and foreign language distance learning programs for \nelementary and secondary school teachers.\n  In addition to providing new programs and teachers, we must encourage \nstudents to study these subjects. The U.S. currently lags far behind \nother countries in the number of students majoring in these critical \nareas. We must reverse this trend if we are to ensure an adequate \nsupply of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics expertise \nin the years ahead. For example, only 32 percent of undergraduates in \nthe United States receive their degrees in science and engineering, \ncompared to 59 percent in China and 66 percent in Japan. The statistics \nare even worse for foreign language education, where fewer than one in \n10 college students enroll in a foreign language class. Our bill would \nprovide financial incentives for students to take the tough classes, \nearn their degrees, and be trained in the skills that will help America \nsucceed by providing them with $5,000 scholarships to earn degrees in \nSTEM or a foreign language.\n  I am proud of my home State of Hawaii, which appreciates the \nimportance of learning other languages and understanding other cultures \nand where high school seniors take Advanced Placement (AP) exams in \ncalculus, chemistry, physics, and science at rates that are higher \nthan, and in some cases nearly double, the national average. Still, \nthere definitely is room for more students to take AP exams and excel \nin these important areas.\n  The Homeland Security Education Act would help make this a reality by \ncomplementing efforts such as the PACE bills, Senator Kennedy's \nlegislation, and the President's education initiatives--all of which I \nsupport because they are positive steps to increasing educational \nopportunities in critical STEM and foreign language studies.\n  Professor Richard Schmidt, Director of the National Foreign Language \nResource Center at the University of Hawaii, said that ``this \nlegislation has strong potential to produce the kind of close \narticulation between K through 12 and higher education programs that \nhas been very difficult in the past.''\n  I wish to thank Professor Schmidt, the University of Hawaii College \nof Education, and the National Council for Languages and International \nStudies for supporting this bill. I ask unanimous consent that letters \nof support be printed in the Record\n  Education serves as the catalyst to ensure our Nation's long-term \nsecurity. To remain a world leader we need Americans who are well-\neducated and who can communicate in the global marketplace. The bill we \nintroduce today will help us meet these essential requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Homeland Security Education Act, \nand I look forward to working with them to strengthen our national \nsecurity through enactment of our bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                    National Council for Languages\n\n\n                                    and International Studies,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Council for Languages and International Studies, representing \n     54 member language and international education associations, \n     to thank you for sponsoring the Homeland Security Education \n     Act (HSEA), which increases federal investment in foreign \n     language education, specifically in languages of critical \n     need to national security.\n       The benefits of language learning as a part of a basic \n     education cannot be overstated. In addition to learning \n     another language, studies indicate that students develop \n     better problem-solving and cognitive skills. In addition to \n     being an essential part of a basic education, recent events \n     have demonstrated that early language learning is also \n     imperative for national security. The events of September \n     11th brought to light the scarcity of highly qualified \n     language professionals in the federal government workforce. \n     Our nation cannot develop the high-level language expertise \n     necessary to national security and economic competitiveness \n     if we do not have the programs that encourage proficiency in \n     critical languages.\n       Recent studies and initiatives such as the National \n     Security Language Initiative, the Lincoln Commission Report, \n     and the Center for Education Development's report, Education \n     for Global Leadership: The Importance of lnternational \n     Studies and Foreign Language Education for U.S. Economic and \n     National Security provide a much-needed framework to develop \n     foreign language skills by calling for the implementation of \n     new and expanded language programs at all levels of education \n     and in the workforce. HSEA will provide the resources needed \n     to develop such critical programs.\n       Legislation like HSEA provides the framework and funding \n     that is critical to carrying out these initiatives at the \n     primary, secondary and higher education levels. Its focus on \n     encouraging students to continue their language education as \n     well as providing the grants needed for institutions of \n     higher education to develop and strengthen foreign language \n     programs, this bill will create the resources needed to \n     address the issues facing the U.S. in today's world.\n       This comprehensive and forward thinking legislation is \n     sorely needed. Thank you for\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\n     your assistance and support of languages, international \n     education and programs that promote better understanding of \n     other languages and cultures. If there is anything we can do \n     to help, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            J. David Edwards, PhD,\n      Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   University of Hawai`i at Manoa,\n\n\n                                         College of Education,\n\n                                 Honolulu, Hawai`i, March 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, 141 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing on behalf of the faculty \n     and students of the University of Hawai`i, College of \n     Education to express my enthusiastic support for the Homeland \n     Security Education Act proposed by you and Senator Durbin.\n       It is clear that if we are to remain leaders in this \n     increasingly competitive world, America needs a workforce \n     skilled in science, mathematics, computer science, and \n     engineering. We also need a larger population of people able \n     to speak foreign languages and relate well with people from \n     other countries and cultures.\n       The Homeland Security Education Act is designed very well \n     to address this need, as it provides scholarships for college \n     students entering those fields and for teacher candidates in \n     the sciences, mathematics, and languages. It also provides \n     grants to assist K-12 schools in improving related \n     instruction, to improve facilities and obtain equipment. \n     Three different grant programs support efforts to improve the \n     numbers of foreign language speakers. The student loan \n     program also holds promise of encouraging more people to \n     enter these fields.\n       As Dean of the College of Education, I know first hand how \n     difficult it is to attract teacher candidates into \n     mathematics or science. The scholarships provided through the \n     Homeland Security Education Act will help us encourage more \n     students to enter these teaching fields. It may also be \n     helpful if the student loan repayment program could be \n     applied to individuals who enter the teaching profession and \n     teach in some of our more difficult to staff public schools.\n       I am also finding it very difficult to find mathematics and \n     science educators to teach in our teacher preparation \n     programs. There is a severe national shortage of mathematics \n     and science educators with doctoral degrees. You may want to \n     consider providing support to individuals to obtain \n     doctorates in these areas.\n       Your Homeland Security Education Act addresses a very \n     serious problem. If we do not address this problem today, our \n     nation will suffer because of it in the near future and for \n     many years to come. I sincerely hope that your colleagues in \n     congress will share your vision and choose to support this \n     important legislation.\n       Thank you for your good leadership and for your continued \n     support for excellent education for all children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Randy Hitz,\n                                                             Dean.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2453. A bill to establish procedures for the review of electronic \nsurveillance programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce a \nbill to regulate electronic surveillance programs designed to gather \nintelligence for national security purposes.\n  On Friday, December 16, 2005, the New York Times reported that in \nlate 2001, President Bush signed a highly classified directive that \nauthorized the National Security Agency to intercept communications \nbetween people inside the United States and terrorism suspects \noverseas. And so the debate began. Did the President have the authority \nto authorize this program? Did it violate the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act--or FISA? Had Congress independently granted the \nPresident this authority? Did he have these inherent powers under the \nConstitution? Lawyers and laymen throughout our country have debated \nthe issue. The Senate Judiciary Committee initiated two hearings on the \nlegality of the NSA program and, pursuant to our oversight function, \nbrought in Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and seven leading scholars \nand experts to testify. After questioning General Gonzales for some 7 \nhours, and the panel of scholars for hours more, we were still left \ntroubled by two competing concerns.\n  On the one hand, we are a Nation at war. On September 11 we suffered \nthe worst attack on civilians in our country's history by an enemy like \nnone we had faced before. The more we learn about this enemy, the more \nwe learn about a cruel and brutal opponent who will stop at nothing to \nterrorize and harm our country. This is an enemy that knows no honor. \nIt seeks to inflict ever-escalating violence on defenseless civilians. \nThis is an enemy that knows no mercy. It beheads innocent aid workers \nand journalists and proudly broadcasts these murders for the world to \nsee. This is an enemy that knows no bounds of decency. It recruits \nwomen and children to strap bombs to their bodies and blow themselves \nup, knowing that American soldiers are likely to come close to help \nthem. This is an enemy that is patient. It infiltrates our borders and \nwaits quietly for an opportunity to attack. Most frighteningly, this is \nan enemy that is capable. It roams the globe, organizing terrorist \ncells along its path. It has the ability to master and exploit modem \ntechnology and organize attacks on America from anywhere on the globe.\n\n  On the other hand, we are a Nation that believes in the rule of law. \nWe are a people that hold dear the rights and liberties enshrined in \nour Constitution. Although we recognize the threat we face, we are not \nwilling to sacrifice our rights and live in a state of perpetual fear. \nOur enemy is the enemy of freedom, and we will not give that enemy the \nsatisfaction of making us give up the very freedom we cherish.\n  The question remains, what is a society like ours to do?\n  I do not agree with those who contend that the current FISA law is \njust fine. When the FISA bill was enacted in 1978, we faced a very \ndifferent enemy. That enemy did not attack on our soil; that enemy was \norganized into nation states that we could negotiate with; that enemy \ndid not use terrorist tactics on our civilian population. And in 1978, \nwe were grappling with very different technologies. We were worried \nabout telephone and telegraphs, not e-mail, cell phones, handheld \ncomputers, and Internet chat rooms. Accordingly, the Congress passed a \nlaw in 1978 that required case-by-case warrants; warrants that \nidentified individual persons and places; warrants a lot like those a \nprosecutor would seek in a routine criminal investigation. These case-\nby-case warrants, however, simply may not be sufficient today, when we \nare in a time of war and we need to track an amorphous enemy that moves \nquickly and is often able to evade detection.\n  At the same time, I do not agree with those who insist that we are \nfacing an entirely new situation, and that the checks and balances our \nnation has long embraced are now outdated. I think these advocates are \nwrong when they insist that the best we can do is to give the Executive \nBranch a blank check and hope that it will do the right thing.\n  I believe that there is a middle ground. I believe it is possible to \nprovide the President with the flexibility and secrecy he needs to \ntrack terrorists, while providing for meaningful supervision outside of \nthe Executive Branch. It may be surprising to some, but I think we can \nget some insight from, of all places, a Senate hearing.\n  Let's step back and survey the situation. The country had recently \ndiscovered that the NSA had secretly worked with major communication \ncompanies for years. We learned that initially the program focused on \ncertain foreign targets, but it grew to cover communications from U.S. \ncitizens. Amid accusations that the President had violated the \nConstitution and Federal statute, a Senate Committee called the \nAttorney General to testify and address the ``serious legal and \nconstitutional questions . . . raised by the program.''\n  If this sounds familiar, it should. It is what took place in November \n1975, when the nation discovered a secret NSA program to monitor \ntelegraph messages, and a special Senate Committee called Attorney \nGeneral Edward Levi to testify.\n  That hearing, like the hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee held \nlast week, elicited discussions on the importance of preserving civil \nliberties and upholding the Bill of Rights, and the need to protect \nnational security and preserve secrecy in foreign intelligence. That \nhearing also elicited a possible solution.\n  During his testimony to the Church Committee on U.S. Intelligence \nActivities, Attorney General Levi suggested that one method for \ngranting the President the needed flexibility, while maintaining \nsupervision by the courts, was to give a special court the power to \nissue broader, program-wide warrants. Attorney General Levi reasoned \nthat for programs ``designed to gather foreign-intelligence information \nessential to the security of the Nation,'' the court should have the \npower to approve\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\na ``program of surveillance.'' He explained that the traditional \nwarrant procedure works only when surveillance ``involves a particular \ntarget location or individual at a specific time.'' While this \nprocedure was fine for routine, criminal investigations, the Nation \nneeded a different solution for enemies that require ``virtually \ncontinuous surveillance, which by its nature does not have specifically \npredetermined targets.'' Attorney General Levi suggested that in \napproving a surveillance plan, the court should determine whether the \nprogram ``strikes a reasonable balance between the government's need \nfor the information and the protection of individuals' rights.''\n  Unfortunately, we did not follow Attorney General Levi's suggestion. \nIt is not too late to do so, however. The National Security \nSurveillance Act of 2006 seeks to pick up where the Congress of 1978 \nleft off.\n  I believe that the National Security Surveillance Act sets forth \nworkable and effective procedures for the FISA Court to evaluate \nsurveillance programs. Its procedures, in fact, are very similar to \nthose Attorney General Levi advocated thirty years ago.\n  First, in order to continue the NSA program, or any similar programs, \nthe Attorney General must apply to the FISA court for permission to \ninitiate a surveillance program and then seek re-authorization of that \nprogram every 45 days. The Attorney General must explain his legal \nbasis for concluding that the surveillance program is constitutional. \nHe must also provide a good deal of information to the court. He must: \nidentify or describe the foreign country or terrorist group he seeks to \nmonitor; provide enough facts to indicate one of the parties on the \nline is a member of that foreign country or terrorist group or has had \ncommunications with it; identify the steps he is taking to make sure \nthat innocent Americans are not being swept into the surveillance \nprogram; determine that at least one of the parties is in the U. S.; \nestimate the number of communications to be monitored; and provide data \nso the FISA court can evaluate the program, including information on \nhow long the program has existed and what type of intelligence it has \nuncovered.\n  The Attorney General should feel no concern in sharing information \nabout the program with the FISA court. The FISA court has proven that \nit is capable of maintaining the secrecy with which it has been charged \nand that it possesses the requisite expertise and discretion for \nadjudicating sensitive issues of national security.\n  The FISA court must then determine whether approving the program is \nconsistent with the U.S. Constitution. It must also balance the \ninterests at stake and decide whether to approve the program. \nSpecifically, the court must: determine whether probable cause exists \nto authorize the surveillance; evaluate whether historically the \ngovernment has implemented the electronic surveillance program in \naccordance with its proposals; determine that at least one of the \nparticipants to the electronic communication is a member of the foreign \ncountry or terrorist group that the Attorney General has identified; \nconsider the privacy costs of the program as measured by the number of \ncommunications subjected to the electronic surveillance program, the \nlength of time the electronic surveillance program has been in \nexistence, and the effectiveness of the minimization procedures; and \nconsider the benefits of the program as measured by the intelligence \ninformation obtained or the number of plots uncovered or cells \ndisrupted.\n  The Attorney General must resubmit the program to the FISA court \nevery 45 days. In the event the FISA court refuses to approve the \nelectronic surveillance program, that does not end the matter. The \nAttorney General may modify the program and then submit a new \napplication, until the FISA court concludes that the program satisfies \nthe Constitution and the standards set forth in this bill. In the \nalternative, the Attorney General may conclude that implementing an \namended program is inappropriate in light of the FISA court's concerns. \nThe FISA court would itself be required to notify Congress of its \ndecision with respect to the proffered program's constitutionality. \nFinally, the bill requires the Attorney General to submit information \non the program's scope and effectiveness to the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees every 6 months.\n  In the case at hand, the Attorney General would be required to \njustify the NSA surveillance program to the FISA court, which would, in \nturn, determine whether the program met all constitutional and legal \nrequirements. The court would be required to consider, for example, \nwhether members of Al Qaeda were appropriately targeted, whether proper \nminimization techniques were being followed, and whether the program \nsatisfied the demands of the Fourth Amendment.\n  There are those who will say that we should not act. That currently, \nthings are fine. I would remind my colleagues that our enemies are not \nso content to sit still. A country that does not understand that our \nenemy has changed since the 1970s will come to regret it. And a \nCongress that pauses when it should act, denies its duty to adapt to \nthe enemy we currently face. But, ultimately, the enemies of democracy \nwin when civil liberties are lost. We must maintain our democracy and \ndefeat our enemies.\n  This legislation does both and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Security \n     Surveillance Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to \n     intercept communications between people inside the United \n     States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects \n     overseas.\n       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is \n     that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our \n     Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy \n     conventional law enforcement practices.\n       (3) The Commander in Chief requires the ability and means \n     to detect and track an enemy that can master and exploit \n     modern technology.\n       (4) Although it is essential that the President have all \n     necessary means to protect us against our enemies, it is \n     equally essential that, in doing so, the President does not \n     compromise the very civil liberties that the President seeks \n     to safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The \n     President's power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem \n     either from an Act of Congress or from the Constitution \n     itself.''. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. \n     579, 585 (1952) (opinion by Black, J.).\n       (5) In 2004, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her \n     plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: \n     ``We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a \n     blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of \n     the Nation's citizens. Youngstown Sheet & Tube, 343 U.S., at \n     587, 72 S.Ct. 863. Whatever power the United States \n     Constitution envisions for the Executive in its exchanges \n     with other nations or with enemy organizations in times of \n     conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three \n     branches when individual liberties are at stake.''. Hamdi v. \n     Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).\n       (6) Similarly, as Justice Jackson famously observed in his \n     Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to \n     an express or implied authorization of Congress, his \n     authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he \n     possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can \n     delegate . . . . When the President acts in absence of either \n     a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only \n     rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of \n     twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent \n     authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. \n     Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence \n     may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not \n     invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility . \n     . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \n     lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own \n     constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive \n     Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the \n     Congress from acting upon the subject.''. Youngstown Sheet \n     & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) \n     (Jackson, J., concurring).\n       (7) The Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of \n     oversight over national security and foreign policy, under \n     article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, which confers on Congress numerous powers, including \n     the powers--\n       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, \n     and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';\n       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';\n       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of \n     the land and naval Forces'';\n       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute \n     the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions''; and\n       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining \n     the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States''.\n       (8) It is in our Nation's best interest for Congress to use \n     its oversight power to establish a system to ensure that \n     electronic surveillance programs do not infringe on the \n     constitutional rights of Americans, while at the same time \n     making sure that the President has all the powers and means \n     necessary to detect and track our enemies.\n       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that \n     the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance \n     program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to \n     ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief \n     of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic \n     surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the \n     executive branch, by the Article III court established under \n     section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803). It is also the belief of Congress that \n     it is appropriate for an Article III court to pass upon the \n     constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that \n     may implicate the rights of Americans.\n       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the \n     proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic \n     surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the \n     secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the \n     requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive \n     issues of national security.\n       (11) In 1975, then-Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong \n     defender of executive authority, testified that in times of \n     conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range \n     electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence \n     surveillance court should be empowered to issue special \n     warrants in these circumstances.\n       (12) This Act clarifies and definitively establishes that \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has the authority \n     to review electronic surveillance programs and pass upon \n     their constitutionality. Such authority is consistent with \n     well-established, longstanding practices.\n       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already \n     has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of \n     international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants \n     for surveillance of a particular individual under sections \n     104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).\n       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in \n     investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held \n     that flexible warrants comply with the fourth amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States when they relate to \n     complex, far reaching, and multi-faceted criminal enterprises \n     like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts \n     recognize that applications for search warrants must be \n     judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the \n     courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature \n     and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal \n     organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.\n       (15) Federal agents investigating international terrorism \n     by foreign enemies are entitled to tools at least as broad as \n     those used by Federal agents investigating domestic crimes by \n     United States citizens. The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith \n     Case'', United States v. United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized \n     that the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary \n     crime may not be applicable to cases involving national \n     security. The Court recognized that national ``security \n     surveillance may involve different policy and practical \n     considerations from the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and \n     that courts should be more flexible in issuing warrants in \n     national security cases. United States v. United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. \n     297, 322 (1972).\n       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress \n     preserves the ability of the Commander in Chief to use the \n     necessary means to guard our national security, while also \n     protecting the civil liberties and constitutional rights that \n     we cherish.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Cancellation of visas\n       Section 127 voids visas held by a nonimmigrant alien if the \n     alien remains in the U.S. beyond the period of authorized \n     stay, and requires aliens who overstay to return to their \n     consulate abroad to undergo additional\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n     screening before being able to return to the U.S.\n     Section 128. Biometric entry-exit system\n       Section 128 authorizes DHS to collect biometric data from \n     any alien or LPR seeking admission to, exit from, transit \n     through, or paroled into the U.S., and provides that failure \n     to comply with the biometric requirements is a ground for \n     inadmissibility.\n     Section 129.

The \n     IG would have to provide a report to the Secretary on any \n     cost overruns, delays in execution, or mismanagement of these \n     contracts. This section would also require the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to disclose all contracts with foreign \n     entities on the Secure Border Initiative and the Committee on \n     Foreign Investment in the United States would have to report \n     to Congress on proposed purchases of U.S. port operations by \n     a foreign entity.\n\n\n                    title ii.--interior enforcement\n\n     Section 201. Removal and denial of benefits to terrorist \n         aliens\n       Section 201(a) amends the INA so that all aliens \n     inadmissible on terrorism-related grounds are ineligible for \n     asylum.\n       Section 201(b) expands the class of aliens ineligible on \n     security-related grounds for cancellation of removal. Current \n     law provides that all aliens ``inadmissible'' and \n     ``deportable'' on security-related grounds are ineligible; \n     subsection (b) provides that all aliens ``described in'' \n     those provisions are also ineligible.\n       Section 201(c) expands the class of aliens ineligible on \n     security-related grounds for voluntary departure. Current law \n     disqualifies from voluntary removal all aliens ``deportable'' \n     on security-related grounds and because of conviction of an \n     aggravated felony; subsection (c) extends this \n     disqualification to all aliens ``described in'' those \n     provisions.\n       Section 201(d) renders ineligible for withholding of \n     removal all aliens ``described in'' the provisions of the INA \n     rendering aliens inadmissible on terrorism grounds and most \n     of the provisions rendering aliens deportable on terrorism \n     grounds.\n       Section 201(e) narrows the class of aliens eligible for a \n     record of admission for permanent residence if no such record \n     is otherwise available. Current law requires an alien seeking \n     such a record of admission to prove that he is not \n     ``inadmissible'' on the grounds of participation in certain \n     Nazi-related activities and certain other activities, and \n     that he is not ``deportable'' for terrorist activities; \n     subsection (e) requires aliens to prove they are not \n     ``described in'' those provisions.\n       Section 201(f) provides that the amendments in this section \n     apply to aliens in removal, deportation, and exclusion \n     proceedings on the date of enactment, and to acts or \n     conditions occurring before, on, or after the date of \n     enactment.\n     Section 202. Detention and removal of aliens ordered removed\n       Section 202 responds to the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678 (2001). The issue addressed \n     in this section, and in Zadvydas, is what the Government may \n     do if the removal period expires and the Government has not \n     managed to remove the alien.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(E)-(G) addresses authority to detain \n     beyond the removal period aliens ordered removed who are \n     inadmissible; who are removable as a result of violations of \n     status requirements or entry conditions, violations of \n     criminal law, or reasons of security or foreign policy; or \n     who have otherwise been determined by the Attorney General to \n     constitute a risk to the community or to be unlikely to \n     comply with the order of removal.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(E) provides that such aliens may be \n     detained beyond the removal period in the discretion of DHS \n     and without any limitations other than those specified in the \n     statute. Section 202(a)(1)(G) sets forth detailed guidelines \n     for detention following the removal period of the classes of \n     aliens identified above:\n       With respect to aliens who have effected entry to the \n     United States and have fully cooperated with the Government's \n     efforts to carry out removal, DHS may detain such aliens \n     until removal after making one of a variety of \n     certifications. DHS must renew such a certification every six \n     months for as long as it wants to continue detaining the \n     alien. In the absence of a certification, the alien is to be \n     released, although conditions may be imposed and re-detention \n     is possible. DHS may not delegate the decision to certify \n     or renew a certification to an officer inferior to the \n     Commissioner of ICE.\n       With respect to aliens who have effected an entry to the \n     United States and would be removed but for failure to \n     cooperate fully with removal efforts, DHS may detain them \n     until the alien makes all reasonable efforts to comply with \n     the removal efforts.\n       With respect to aliens who have not effected an entry to \n     the United States, DHS is required to follow the guidelines \n     set forth in a specified provision of the CFR.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(G) authorizes DHS to parole the alien if \n     she/he is an applicant for admission. Finally, it makes \n     judicial review regarding the above paragraphs available only \n     in habeas corpus proceedings after exhaustion of \n     administrative remedies available as of right.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(A) provides that DHS, not DOJ, oversees \n     detention and removal of aliens ordered removed.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(B) modifies the definition of one of the \n     three events, the latest of which marks the beginning of the \n     90-day removal period. Under current law, one of the three \n     events marking the beginning of the removal period is the \n     date of the court's final order, if such a court has stayed \n     the alien's removal so that it can review the removal order. \n     Section 202(a)(1)(B) revises this clause so that the removal \n     period would begin on the expiration of the stay of removal \n     entered by a court, the BIA, or an immigration judge.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(B) also expands the authority of the \n     Government to extend the removal period beyond 90 days, if \n     the alien fails or refuses to make all reasonable efforts to \n     comply with the removal order or to fully cooperate with \n     DHS's efforts to establish the alien's identity and carry out \n     the removal order.\n       Finally, Section 202(a)(1)(B) provides that in no event can \n     the 90-day removal period begin until the alien is in DHS's \n     custody. If DHS transfers custody of the alien during the \n     removal period to another Federal, state, or local agency, \n     the removal period is tolled and begins anew when the alien \n     is returned to DHS's custody.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(C) provides explicit statutory authority \n     for DHS to detain an alien during a stay of removal ordered \n     by a court, the BIA, or an immigration judge, so long as the \n     alien is otherwise subject to an administratively final order \n     of removal.\n       Section 202(a)(1)(D) addresses the terms under which the \n     alien is to be supervised if she has not been removed after \n     the removal period expires to prevent the alien from \n     absconding, to protect the community, or otherwise to enforce \n     the immigration laws.\n       Section 202(a)(2) provides that the amendments made by \n     Section 202(a)(1) will apply to all aliens subject to a final \n     administrative removal, deportation, or exclusion order that \n     was issued before, on, or after the date of enactment of the \n     Act.\n       Section 202(b) amends that portion of title 18 concerning \n     release of a criminal defendant pending trial to establish a \n     rebuttable presumption that no conditions of release will \n     reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant as required \n     if the judge finds probable cause to believe that the person \n     has no lawful immigration status, is the subject of a final \n     order of removal, or has committed one in a list of \n     immigration offenses.\n       Section 202(b) also amends that portion of title 18 \n     enumerating the factors that a judge must consider when \n     determining whether there are conditions of release that will \n     reasonably assure the appearance of criminal defendants as \n     required. The subsection provides that the judge shall \n     consider the person's immigration status.\n     Section 203. Aggravated felony\n       Section 203(a) modifies the definition of the term \n     ``aggravated felony.'' Sections 203(a)(1) and (a)(5) provide \n     that convictions based on the term of imprisonment are \n     covered even if the length of the sentence was based on \n     recidivist or other enhancements.\n       Section 203(a)(2) broadens the term to include all bringing \n     in and harboring certain aliens crimes.\n       Section 203(a)(3) broadens the definition to include any \n     felony conviction under INA Section 275 (Improper Entry by an \n     Alien) and Section 276 (``Reentry of Removed Alien''). The \n     current definition covers only crimes under Sections 275(a) \n     and 276 that were committed by an alien previously deported \n     for another aggravated felony. By capturing the rest of \n     Section 275, the definition now includes felony convictions \n     for marriage fraud and immigration-related entrepreneurship \n     fraud, in addition to a much broader swath of offenses for \n     improper entry and reentry themselves.\n       Section 203(a)(4) expands the definition to include \n     soliciting, aiding, abetting, counseling, commanding, \n     inducing, or procuring another to commit one of the crimes \n     listed already in the definition.\n       Section 203(b) bars a refugee convicted of an aggravated \n     felony from eligibility for adjustment of status.\n       Section 203(c) provides that Sections 203(a) and 203(b) \n     apply to acts occurring before, on, or after the date of \n     enactment and to all proceedings in which the alien is \n     required to establish admissibility on or after the date of \n     enactment of the Act.\n     Section 204. Terrorist bars\n       Section 204(a)(1) provides that no alien shall be found to \n     have ``good moral character'' for purposes of the INA if DHS \n     or DOJ determines that the alien is described in sections \n     212(a)(3) (excludable on security or related grounds) or \n     237(a)(4) (removable on security or related grounds).\n       Section 204(a)(2) clarifies that the bar against aggravated \n     felons being found to have ``good moral character'' applies \n     even if the underlying crime was not classified as an \n     aggravated felony at the time of conviction, and provides \n     waiver authority when the completion of the term of \n     imprisonment and sentence occurred 10 or more years prior \n     to the date of application.\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\n       Section 204(a)(3) clarifies that the ``catch-all'' \n     component of the definition of ``good moral character'' \n     includes discretionary authority to find an alien lacks good \n     moral character for reasons not enumerated in the definition. \n     The provision also clarifies that this discretionary \n     authority may be based upon the alien's conduct outside the \n     period during which good moral character is required.\n       Section 204(b) provides that a petition for granting \n     certain classes of immigrant status may not be granted if \n     there is any proceeding pending that could result in the \n     petitioner's denaturalization or loss of the petitioner's \n     lawful permanent resident status.\n       Section 204(c) clarifies that an alien admitted as a \n     conditional lawful permanent resident must have the condition \n     removed before she can be lawfully admitted.\n       Section 204(d) modifies the law governing judicial review \n     of naturalization decisions. Subsection (d)(1) requires an \n     alien to seek review of the denial of his application for \n     naturalization within 120 days of DHS's final determination. \n     Subsection (d)(2) imposes on the alien the burden of showing \n     that DHS's denial was contrary to law. It also removes \n     jurisdiction from the courts, except in proceedings to revoke \n     naturalization, to review or make any determination that an \n     alien is a person of good moral character, understands and is \n     attached to the principles of the Constitution, and is well-\n     disposed to the good order and happiness of the United \n     States.\n       Section 204(e) bars from being naturalized any alien whom \n     DHS determines to have been at any time an alien described in \n     INA sections 2l2(a)(3) (excludable on security or related \n     grounds) or 237(a)(4) (removable on security or related \n     grounds).\n       Section 204(f) provides that neither a court nor DHS may \n     consider a naturalization application while there is pending \n     any proceeding to determine inadmissibility, deportability, \n     or rescission of eligibility for lawful permanent residence, \n     regardless of when the proceeding commenced.\n       Section 204(g) modifies the circumstances under which an \n     alien may seek judicial review of a pending naturalization \n     application. The subsection limits the district court's \n     jurisdiction to examining the basis for any delay and \n     remanding to DHS for adjudication. The time after which the \n     alien may seek judicial review is extended to 180 days after \n     DOJ's examination of the applicant.\n       Section 204(h) provides that the amendments made by this \n     section will apply to acts occurring before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment and to all applicable cases or matters \n     pending on or filed after the date of enactment of the Act.\n     Section 205. Increased criminal penalties related to gang \n         violence, removal and alien smuggling\n       Section 205(a)(1) renders inadmissible any alien who a \n     consular officer, DOJ, or DHS knows or has reason to believe \n     is or has been a member of a gang (as defined in Title 18), \n     or who has participated in such a gang's activities knowing \n     or having reason to know that such activities supported the \n     gang's illegal conduct. Section 205(a)(2) renders such aliens \n     deportable as well, though it exempts aliens who were members \n     of a gang only before admission to the country. (DHS and DOJ \n     can waive application of both 205(a)(1) and (a)(2).)\n       Section 205(a)(3) modifies the rules concerning Temporary \n     Protected Status (TPS). It transfers the authority over TPS \n     from DOJ to DHS; provides DHS with authority to terminate a \n     TPS designation for any reason; permits DHS to extend a \n     country's TPS designation for any amount of time up to 18 \n     months; abolishes the $50 cap on the TPS registration fee; \n     denies TPS status to any alien who is a member of a gang, or \n     has been at any time after admission; and clarifies that a \n     TPS alien's immunity from detention on the basis of his/her \n     immigration status does not extend to detentions authorized \n     by other provisions of law.\n       Section 205(b):\n       Permits the government to penalize for failure to depart \n     those aliens ordered removed because they were inadmissible.\n       Changes the base penalty for failure to depart to a \n     mandatory minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 5 years, along \n     with a fine.\n       Changes the penalty for an alien's willful failure to \n     comply with the terms of release under supervision by \n     removing any statutory limit on the fine and adding a \n     mandatory minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 5 years, or 10 \n     years for certain categories of deportable aliens.\n       Allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to instruct the \n     Secretary of State to deny issuing a visa to any national of \n     a country if that country refuses to accept the return of its \n     nationals. The language only relates to visa issuance, not \n     denial of admission at port-of-entry, ensuring that refugees/\n     asylees are not impacted and that aliens know they will not \n     be admitted before they travel to the U.S.\n       Section 205(c) strikes and replaces the provision of the \n     INA covering alien smuggling and related offenses. One key \n     purpose of this section is to clarify a provision of the INA \n     that has become confusing and overly complicated after years \n     of piecemeal amendments. But there are substantive changes as \n     well, as the section:\n       Expands the alien-smuggling crime to cover individuals who \n     ``facilitate[ ], encourage[ ], direct[ ], or induce[ ]'' an \n     alien to enter the country at other than a designated port of \n     entry, and to cover those who act with reckless disregard of \n     the alien's unlawful immigration status;\n       Creates a new crime for transporting or harboring certain \n     aliens in unlawful transit outside the U.S., under \n     circumstances where the alien is seeking to enter the United \n     States unlawfully; and\n       Criminalizes attempts to encourage or induce an alien to \n     reside or remain in the United States.\n       Section 205(c) also dispenses with the current penalty \n     scheme for alien smuggling and provides increasing penalties \n     depending on whether the offense was not committed for profit \n     (5 year stat max), if the offense was committed for \n     commercial advantage, profit, or private financial gain (20 \n     year stat max), if the offense was a second or subsequent \n     violation and committed for profit (3 year mandatory minimum, \n     20 year stat max), if the offense was committed with the \n     intent to further or aid another offense punishable by 1 year \n     or more (5 year mandatory minimum, 20 year stat max), if the \n     offense created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily \n     injury (5 year mandatory minimum, 20 year stat max), if the \n     offense caused serious bodily injury (7 year mandatory \n     minimum, 30 year stat max), if the offense involved an alien \n     who the offender knew or had reason to believe was engaged in \n     terrorist activity (10 year mandatory minimum, 30 year stat \n     max), or if death resulted (10 year mandatory minimum, life \n     maximum). The subsection also provides for extraterritorial \n     federal jurisdiction.\n       In addition, Section 205(c) clarifies that a religious \n     organization is not guilty of alien smuggling if it provides \n     room, board, travel, and medical assistance to an alien \n     serving as a minister or missionary in a volunteer capacity, \n     provided that the alien has been a member of the religious \n     denomination for at least one year.\n       Section 205(c) also broadens the crime of hiring \n     unauthorized aliens for employment to include those who \n     knowingly hire in reckless disregard of the alien's unlawful \n     immigration status and increases the maximum penalty to 10 \n     years.\n       Section 205(c) also expands the forfeiture provisions of \n     the alien-smuggling statute to cover any property used to \n     commit or facilitate a violation of either alien smuggling or \n     hiring of unauthorized aliens, proceeds of such a violation, \n     and property traceable to either of them.\n       Finally, Section 205(c) simplifies and slightly expands the \n     reach of provisions governing prima facie evidence in the \n     determination of alien smuggling violations; makes two modest \n     changes to the section governing admissibility of videotaped \n     witness testimony to ensure compliance with the Confrontation \n     Clause; and includes new definitions making it clear that for \n     purposes of alien smuggling, an alien is deemed to have \n     crossed the border into the United States regardless of \n     whether the alien is free from official restraint.\n       Section 205(d) adds alien smuggling to the list of crimes \n     during and in relation to which 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c) \n     provides a mandatory minimum for carrying or using a firearm.\n     Section 206. Illegal entry or unlawful presence of an alien\n       Section 206 modifies INA Section 275, which currently \n     covers illegal entry.\n       The new Section 275(a):\n       Adds a scienter requirement, ``knowingly,'' to the various \n     improper entry crimes.\n       Criminalizes an alien's knowing unlawful presence in the \n     United States;\n       Clarifies that the unlawful entry crime covers any alien \n     who knowingly crosses the border, even if s/he was under \n     observation at the time;\n       Provides higher maximum penalties for aliens convicted of \n     illegal entry (and unlawful presence) who have a sufficiently \n     serious criminal record; and\n       Clarifies that illegal entry and unlawful presence continue \n     until the alien is discovered within the country by an \n     immigration officer.\n       The new Section 275(b) clarifies that the civil penalties \n     for unlawful entry cover any alien who knowingly crosses the \n     border, even if s/he was under observation at the time.\n     Section 207. Illegal reentry\n       Section 207 provides higher maximum penalties for aliens \n     convicted of illegal reentry who have a sufficiently serious \n     criminal record. The penalty structure here is similar to \n     that provided for illegal entry and unlawful presence in \n     Section 206.\n       In addition, this section:\n       Adds an element to an affirmative defense available to \n     aliens previously denied admission and removed;\n       Heightens the standard the alien must meet in order to \n     collaterally attack the underlying removal order under this \n     section; and\n       Clarifies that the illegal reentry crime covers any alien \n     who knowingly crosses the border, even if s/he was under \n     observation at the time.\n     Section 208. Reform of passport, visa, and immigration fraud \n         offenses\n       Section 208 provides a comprehensive rewriting of chapter \n     75 of title 18, which currently covers Passports and Visas \n     and is amended to cover Passport, Visa, and Immigration \n     Fraud.\n       The proposed section 1541 creates a new crime for \n     trafficking in passports. Section 1541(a) would punish those \n     who unlawfully produce, issue, transfer, forge, or falsely \n     make passports, as well as those who transact in passports \n     they know to be forged or\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n     counterfeited and those who prepare, submit, or mail \n     applications for passports that they know include a false \n     statement. The maximum penalty for these crimes would be 20 \n     years.\n       Section 1541(b) would punish any individual who knowingly \n     and without lawful authority produced, obtained, possessed, \n     or used various papers, seals, symbols, or other materials \n     used to make passports. This crime also would carry a maximum \n     of 20 years.\n       The proposed section 1542 modifies the current penalization \n     of false statements in a passport application:\n       For making a false statement in a passport application, \n     modifies the requisite mens rea to ``willfully''; removing \n     the requirement that the government show intent to induce or \n     secure the issuance of a passport from the United States; and \n     broadens the crime to cover the passport's supporting \n     documentation;\n       Creates a new crime for completing, signing, or submitting \n     a passport application (including supporting documentation), \n     knowing that it contains a false statement or representation;\n       Creates a new crime for causing (or attempting to cause) \n     the production of a passport by means of any fraud or false \n     application for a U.S. passport, when such production occurs \n     (or would occur) at an authorized facility; and\n       Creates a statutory maximum of 15 years for all these \n     crimes, replacing the tiered penalty structure under current \n     law.\n       The proposed section 1543 addresses ``Forgery and Unlawful \n     Production of a Passport,'' and is analogous to existing \n     section 1543, which covers ``Forgery or False Use of a \n     Passport.'':\n       For falsely making or counterfeiting a passport, requires \n     that the defendant knowingly counterfeited or falsely made \n     the passport (in contrast to current law, which requires \n     proof that the defendant falsely made or counterfeited a \n     passport with intent that the same may be used);\n       For transferring a forged or counterfeited passport, \n     requiring only that the defendant ``knowingly'' transferred \n     the passport, knowing it to be forged or counterfeited (in \n     contrast to current law, which requires proof that the \n     defendant ``willfully and knowingly'' furnished such a \n     passport to another);\n       For using a forged or counterfeited passport, reducing the \n     mens rea to ``knowingly'';\n       Adding the new crime of knowingly and without lawful \n     authority producing or issuing a passport for or to any \n     person not owing allegiance to the United States;\n       Adding the new crime of knowingly and without lawful \n     authority transferring a passport to a person for use when \n     such person is not the person for whom the passport was \n     issued or designed; and\n       Creating a statutory maximum of 15 years for all these \n     crimes, replacing the tiered penalty structure under current \n     law.\n       The proposed section 1544 covers ``Misuse of a Passport,'' \n     the same title that section bears under current law. Changes \n     include:\n       For using a passport issued or designed for another, \n     reducing the mens rea to ``knowingly'';\n       For using a passport in violation of applicable rules, \n     reducing the mens rea to ``knowingly'';\n       Expanding the crime of knowing use of a forged or \n     counterfeit passport so that it covers the knowing \n     possession, receipt, purchase, sale, or distribution of such \n     a passport;\n       Amending the crime for violating the terms and conditions \n     of any duly-obtained safe conduct by adding a mens rea of \n     ``knowingly'';\n       Increasing the maximum penalty for violating the terms of \n     any safe conduct from 10 to 15 years;\n       Creating a new crime for knowingly using a passport to \n     enter or attempt to enter the country, knowing that the \n     passport is forged or counterfeited;\n       Creating a new crime for knowingly using a passport to \n     defraud an agency of the United States or a State, knowing \n     that the passport is forged or counterfeited; and\n       Creating a statutory maximum of 15 years for all these \n     crimes, replacing the tiered penalty structure under current \n     law.\n       Section 1545 creates new crimes designed to punish schemes \n     to defraud aliens. Section l545(a) provides a maximum 15-year \n     penalty for anyone who knowingly executes a scheme to defraud \n     any person in connection with any matter arising under the \n     immigration laws or that the offender claims arises under the \n     immigration laws. Section 1545(b) provides a maximum 15-year \n     penalty for anyone who knowingly and falsely represents \n     himself to be an attorney in any matter arising under the \n     immigration laws.\n       Section 1546, ``Immigration and Visa Fraud,'' revises and \n     expands the current version of the same section, which is \n     titled, ``Fraud and Misuse of Visas, Permits, and Other \n     Documents.'' Changes to Section 1546(a) include:\n       Creating a new crime for knowing use of any immigration \n     document issued or designed for use by another;\n       Penalizing those who knowingly forge or falsely make any \n     immigrant document (in contrast to current law, which covers \n     only those immigration documents ``prescribed by statute or \n     regulation for entry into or as evidence of authorized stay \n     or employment'' in the U.S.);\n       Expanding the crime for false statements in an application \n     for immigration documents by striking the requirement that \n     the statement was made under oath;\n       Expanding the crime of knowing use of a forged or \n     counterfeit immigration document so that it covers ``any \n     immigration document'';\n       Expanding the same crime so that it covers the knowing \n     possession, receipt, purchase, sale, or distribution of such \n     documents;\n       Creating a statutory maximum of 15 years for all these \n     crimes, replacing the tiered penalty structure under current \n     law.\n       Section 1546(b) creates new penalties for trafficking in \n     immigration documents. The covered conduct is analogous to \n     those covered in the proposed section 1541(a), concerning \n     trafficking in passports. Also like the proposed section \n     1541(a), section 1546(b) provides a maximum penalty of 20 \n     years.\n       Section 1546(c) creates new penalties analogous to section \n     1541(b). The new 1546(c) would punish any individual who \n     knowingly and without lawful authority produced, obtained, \n     possessed, or used various papers, seals, symbols, or other \n     materials used to make immigration documents. Like its \n     counterpart, section 1541(b), section 1546(c) would carry a \n     maximum of 20 years.\n       Section 1547 strengthens the penalties for marriage fraud \n     by:\n       Increasing the maximum penalty for marriage fraud from 5 \n     years to 10 years;\n       Providing a new penalty of up to 10 years for those who \n     misrepresent the existence or circumstances of a marriage in \n     immigration documents or proceedings;\n       Providing a new penalty of up to 20 years for those who \n     enter into multiple marriages in order to evade immigration \n     law;\n       Providing new penalties of up to 20 years for those who \n     arrange, support, or facilitate multiple such marriages;\n       Providing that the offenses continue until the fraudulent \n     nature of the marriage is discovered; and\n       Penalizing attempts and conspiracies in the same manner as \n     a completed violation.\n       Expanding the penalty for immigration-related \n     entrepreneurship fraud from 5 years to 10 years.\n       Section 1548 provides that attempts and conspiracies to \n     violate any section of chapter 75 carry the same punishment \n     as a completed violation.\n       Section 1549 provides for a maximum penalty of 25 years for \n     any violation of this chapter where the actor intends to \n     facilitate an act of international or domestic terrorism, or \n     where s/he knew that the violation would facilitate such an \n     act. It also provides a maximum penalty of 20 years for any \n     violation where the actor intends to facilitate any felony \n     offense against the United States or a State, or where s/he \n     knew that the violation would facilitate such a felony \n     offense.\n       Section 1550 provides for seizure of property used to \n     commit or facilitate any crime under this chapter, the gross \n     proceeds of such a crime, and property traceable. Section \n     1551 extends the jurisdiction of U.S. courts to violations of \n     this chapter committed outside the United States in certain \n     circumstances. Section 1552 provides broad venue for the \n     prosecution of false statements in an application for a \n     passport. Section 1553 consists of definitions, and section \n     1554 clarifies that these amendments are not designed to \n     modify certain tools of law enforcement.\n     Section 209. Inadmissibility and removal for passport and \n         immigration fraud offenses\n       Section 209 renders inadmissible and removable any alien \n     convicted of a passport or visa violation under Chapter 75 of \n     title 18. Section 209(c) provides that these amendments apply \n     to proceedings pending on or after the date of enactment.\n     Section 210. Incarceration of criminal aliens\n       Section 210(a) authorizes DHS to extend the Institutional \n     Removal Program (IRP), which identifies removable aliens in \n     Federal and State prisons and remove such aliens after \n     completion of their sentences, to all states.\n       Section 210(b) authorizes States to hold an illegal alien \n     for up to 14 days after completion of the alien's prison \n     sentence in order to effectuate transfer of the alien to \n     Federal custody. Alternatively, the State may issue a \n     detainer allowing such an alien to be detained by the State \n     prison until ICE can take the alien into custody.\n       Section 210(c) requires the use of technology ``to the \n     maximum extent possible'' in order to make IRP available in \n     remote locations. Section 210(d) requires reporting on State \n     participation in the IRP or similar programs, and Section \n     210(e) authorizes appropriations.\n     Section 211. Encouraging aliens to depart voluntarily\n       Section 211(a)(1):\n       Expands the class of aliens ineligible for voluntary \n     departure to those ``described in'' Section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) \n     (aggravated felony) and Section 237(a)(4) (security and \n     related grounds, including terrorist grounds); and\n       Transfers the power to permit aliens to depart voluntarily \n     in lieu of removal proceedings from the Attorney General to \n     the Secretary of DHS.\n       Section 211(a)(1) also modifies the procedures for aliens \n     who accept voluntary departure after the beginning, but prior \n     to the completion, of removal proceedings, by:\n       Offering such an alien only 60 days to depart (in contrast \n     to the 120 days allowed under current law) and allows for \n     aliens who agree to voluntary departure in lieu of removal \n     proceedings under both current law and the INA as amended by \n     this Act); and\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n       Requiring such an alien to post a voluntary departure bond, \n     to be surrendered upon proof that the alien has left the \n     country within the time specified, which can be waived on \n     presentation of ``compelling'' evidence that the bond is \n     unnecessary and would present a financial hardship.\n       Section 211(a)(2) makes one change with respect to aliens \n     permitted to depart voluntarily at the conclusion of removal \n     proceedings: reducing the period in which such an alien must \n     depart from 60 days to 45 days.\n       Section 211(a)(3) sets forth various new provisions \n     governing voluntary departure agreements, providing that:\n       Voluntary departure is granted only as part of an \n     affirmative agreement by the alien;\n       An alien who accepts voluntary departure after the \n     conclusion of removal proceedings must waive his or her right \n     to any further appeal or petition relating to removal;\n       DHS has the authority, in connection with a voluntary \n     departure agreement, to reduce the period of inadmissibility \n     for certain aliens; and\n       Agreements as to voluntary departure reached during removal \n     proceedings or at the conclusion of removal proceedings must \n     be presented on the record before the immigration judge, and \n     the judge must advise the alien of the consequences of the \n     agreement.\n       In addition, Section 211(a)(3) provides that the failure of \n     the alien to comply with any terms of a voluntary departure \n     agreement renders the alien automatically ineligible for the \n     benefits of that agreement, subject to civil penalties \n     already authorized by the INA, and subject to an alternate \n     order of removal. Moreover, if the alien agrees to voluntary \n     departure but later files a timely appeal, such an appeal \n     voids the agreement and renders the alien ineligible for \n     voluntary departure while s/he remains in the country.\n       Finally, Section 211(a)(3) provides that unless expressly \n     agreed to by DHS, an alien who has agreed to voluntary \n     departure shall not have the period allowed for such \n     departure tolled or otherwise affected by any motion, \n     application, or other legal petition.\n       Section 211(a)(4) provides penalties for an alien's failure \n     to comply with a voluntary departure agreement: an automatic \n     $3,000 fine; ineligibility for certain forms of relief as \n     long as the alien remains in the country and for 10 years \n     thereafter; and ineligibility to reopen a final order of \n     removal, except to apply for withholding of removal or \n     protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n       Section 211(a)(5) provides that all aliens previously \n     permitted to depart voluntarily are ineligible for a second \n     or subsequent voluntary departure agreement. This subsection \n     also transfers the power to issue regulations limiting \n     eligibility for voluntary departure in lieu of removal \n     proceedings from the Attorney General to the DHS Secretary, \n     and provides the DHS Secretary authority concurrent with the \n     Attorney General's to issue regulations limiting eligibility \n     for voluntary departure in other circumstances.\n       Section 211(a)(6) removes jurisdiction from the courts to \n     stay, toll, or otherwise affect the period allowed for \n     voluntary departure.\n       Section 211(b) authorizes the DHS Secretary to promulgate \n     rules to impose and collect penalties for failure to honor a \n     voluntary departure agreement.\n     Section 212. Deterring aliens ordered removed from remaining \n         in the U.S. unlawfully\n       Section 212(a) closes a loophole allowing aliens to avoid \n     the bar on reentry by aliens ordered removed by unlawfully \n     remaining in the United States. Specifically, Section 212(a) \n     provides that the bar on admissibility applies to aliens who \n     seek admission ``not later than'' 5 years (or 10, or 20, as \n     the case may be) after the date of removal, in contrast to \n     the current law's bar on admissibility for aliens who seek \n     admission ``within'' 5 years (or 10, or 20, as the case may \n     be) of the date of removal.\n       Section 212(b) renders ineligible for future discretionary \n     relief any alien who absconds after receiving a final order \n     of removal. The bar applies until the alien leaves the United \n     States and for 10 years after. However, Section 213(b) \n     clarifies that such an alien remains eligible for a motion to \n     reopen to seek withholding of removal under certain \n     circumstances.\n     Section 213. Prohibition of the sale of firearms to or the \n         possession of firearms by certain aliens\n       Section 213(1) prohibits the transfer of firearms and \n     ammunition to an alien by those knowing or having reason to \n     know that the alien is a parolee. Section 214(2) prohibits \n     aliens who are parolees from transporting, possessing, and \n     receiving firearms and ammunition in interstate commerce. \n     Section 214(3) makes several technical corrections.\n     Section 214. Uniform statute of limitations for certain \n         immigration, naturalization, and peonage offenses\n       Section 214 provides a statute of limitations of 10 years \n     for most immigration crimes under the INA and title 18.\n     Section 215. Diplomatic security services\n       Section 215 authorizes Special Agents of the State \n     Department and the Foreign Service to investigate identity \n     theft, document fraud, peonage, slavery, and Federal offenses \n     committed within the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States.\n     Section 216. Field Agent Allocation and Background Checks\n       Section 216 mandates each State to have at least 40 \n     immigration enforcement agents, and at least 15 service \n     personnel (Secretary may waive requirement for states with \n     smaller populations).\n       It also requires DHS and DOJ to wait until the completion \n     of background and security checks before granting any \n     immigration-related status or benefit or issuing \n     documentation evidencing such a grant.\n     Section 217. Denial of benefits of terrorist and criminals\n       Section 217 provides that nothing in the INA shall be \n     construed to require any federal agency to grant any \n     application, status, or benefit to an alien who may pose a \n     threat to national security, who is the subject of an \n     investigation under certain circumstances, and for whom \n     background checks have not been completed.\n     Section 218. State criminal alien assistance program\n       Section 218 directs DHS to reimburse States and units of \n     local government for costs associated with detaining and \n     processing illegal aliens through the criminal justice \n     system.\n     Section 219. Transportation and processing of illegal aliens \n         apprehended by state and local law enforcement officers\n       Section 219 requires DHS to provide sufficient \n     transportation and officers to take all illegal aliens \n     apprehended by State and local law enforcement officers into \n     custody for processing at a DHS detention facility.\n     Section 220. State and local law enforcement of federal \n         immigration laws\n       Section 220 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     reimburse state/local police organizations for training \n     required under Sec. 287(g). Under Sec. 287(g), Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement provides state and local law \n     enforcement with the training and subsequent authorization to \n     identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration \n     offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-\n     enforcement activity.\n     Section 221. Reducing illegal immigration and alien smuggling \n         on tribal lands\n       Section 221 authorizes DHS to award grants to Indian tribes \n     with lands adjacent to international borders who may have \n     been adversely affected by illegal immigration.\n     Section 222. Alternatives to detention\n       Section 222 directs the Secretary of DHS to study the \n     effectiveness of alternatives to detention, including \n     electronic monitoring and the Intensive Supervision \n     Appearance Program (ISAP).\n     Section 223. Conforming amendment\n       Section 223 amends the definition of ``aggravated felony'' \n     so that it covers all penalties for passport, visa, and \n     immigration fraud under chapter 75 of title 18, as amended by \n     Section 208 of this Act.\n     Section 224. Reporting requirements\n       Section 224(a)(I) and (2) amend the current provisions in \n     INA Section 265 to take account of the transfer of \n     immigration enforcement authority from the Attorney General \n     to DHS.\n       Section 224(a)(4) adds several new registration \n     requirements to the INA. Section 224(a)(4) makes clear that \n     the Secretary should provide for appropriate coordination and \n     cross-referencing of address information provided by aliens. \n     This section also makes clear that the Secretary can rely on \n     the most recent address provided by an alien to the Secretary \n     for any purpose under the immigration laws as an address to \n     contact the alien, and the Attorney General and the Secretary \n     may rely on the most recent address provided by the alien \n     pursuant to section 239 for purposes of contacting the alien \n     with respect to pending removal proceedings. Section \n     224(a)(4) makes clear that there is a separate change of \n     address requirement under existing law for aliens who are in \n     pending removal proceedings.\n       Section 224(b) makes several conforming amendments with \n     respect to related provisions of the INA.\n       Section 224(c) modifies the penalties provided in section \n     266(b) of the INA, by providing for an increase in fines (the \n     current $200 fine has remained unchanged in the more than 50 \n     years since enactment of the INA), and by providing for \n     imprisonment up to 6 months for a second or subsequent \n     violation. Subsection (c)(I) also adds a new paragraph (3) in \n     section 266(b), providing that the Secretary and the Attorney \n     General may take into account, as a negative discretionary \n     factor in evaluating discretionary forms of relief from \n     removal, an alien's previous failure to comply with section \n     265. Section 224(c) also amends the penalty provision for \n     aliens who file an application for registration containing a \n     statement known by them to be false, so that it covers the \n     filing of a change of address notice containing a statement \n     known to be false.\n     Section 225. Mandatory detention for aliens apprehended at or \n         between ports of entry\n       Section 225 requires that as of October 1, 2006, all aliens \n     attempting to cross the border illegally must be detained \n     until removed, with some exceptions. This provision also \n     requires that in the interim period before October 1, 2006, \n     an alien who is released pending an immigration removal \n     hearing will have to post bond of at least $5,000.\n     Section 226. Removal of drunk drivers\n       Section 226 establishes that a third DUI conviction is an \n     aggravated felony and a reason for removal.\n     Section 227. Expedited removal\n       Section 227 mandates the use of expedited removal of \n     illegal aliens who are apprehended within 100 miles of the \n     border or 14\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\n     days of unauthorized entry. Additionally, this section amends \n     the INA to expand the scope of offenses subject to the \n     expedited removal program for incarcerated or deportable \n     aliens and allows DHS to use expedited removal on criminal \n     aliens found in correctional institutions.\n     Section 228. Protecting immigrants from convicted sex \n         offenders\n       Section 228 prohibits certain criminals from sponsoring an \n     alien (e.g. spouse or fiancee) for a green card unless the \n     DHS determines that the sponsor poses no threat to the alien. \n     Specifically, the prohibition would apply to any person \n     convicted of (i) murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor; \n     (ii) certain crimes related to sexual exploitation of minors; \n     or (iii) an offense that relates to a prostitution business \n     or trafficking.\n     Section 229. Law enforcement authority of states and \n         political subdivisions and transfer to federal custody\n       Section 229 reaffirms the existing inherent authority of \n     State law enforcement personnel to assist the federal \n     government in enforcing the immigration laws of the United \n     States during the normal course of carrying out their law \n     enforcement duties. It also requires DHS to promptly take \n     aliens apprehended by state and local law enforcement \n     entities into Federal custody. Alternatively, DHS can request \n     that the relevant state or local law enforcement entity \n     temporarily detain the illegal alien or transport them to the \n     point of transfer to Federal custody. Finally, this section \n     mandates that states and localities be fully reimbursed for \n     all reasonable expenses incurred for detention and \n     transportation.\n     Section 230. Listing of immigration violators in the NCIC \n         database\n       Section 230 directs ICE to work with the FBI to place \n     information on certain immigration violators into the already \n     existing Immigration Violators File (IVF) of the National \n     Crime Information Center database. The four categories of \n     immigration violators whose information will be entered are: \n     aliens with final orders of removal, aliens under voluntary \n     departure agreements, aliens who have overstayed their \n     authorized period of stay and aliens whose visas have been \n     revoked.\n     Section 231. Laundering of monetary instruments\n       Section 231 permits those who engage in alien smuggling or \n     the harboring of illegal aliens for financial gain to be \n     prosecuted for money laundering based on the receipt of \n     proceeds from their illegal activity.\n     Section 232. Severability\n       This section is a severability clause.\n\n\n        title iii--increased worksite enforcement and penalties\n\n     Section 301. Unlawful employment of aliens\n       Section 301 amends Section 274A of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Act.\n       Subsection (a)(1) prohibits the hiring, recruiting, or \n     referral of any alien with knowledge or with reason to know \n     of the alien's illegal status, as well as the hiring of an \n     individual without complying with the identification and \n     employment documentation verification requirements \n     of subsection (c) and the Electronic Employment \n     Verification System requirements of subsection (d).\n       Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) bar the continued employment \n     of an unauthorized alien after acquiring knowledge of the \n     alien's illegal status, as well as the use of illegal aliens \n     as laborers through contracts or subcontracts.\n       Subsection (a)(4) provides that, in a civil enforcement \n     context, if the Secretary determines that an employer has \n     hired more than ten unauthorized aliens within a calendar \n     year, a rebuttable presumption is created that the employer \n     knew or had reason to know that such aliens were \n     unauthorized.\n       Subsection (a)(5) provides a defense for employers who \n     comply in good faith with the requirements of subsections ( \n     c) and (d) and who voluntarily use the Electronic Employment \n     Verification System.\n       Subsection (b): Order of internal review and certification \n           of compliance\n       This provision authorizes the Secretary to require, when \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that employers have \n     failed to comply with this section, an employer to certify \n     that it is in compliance with this section, or has instituted \n     a program to come into compliance.\n       The purpose of this section is to allow the Secretary to \n     obtain an employer's formal assurance that the employer is in \n     fact in compliance with immigration laws or that it has \n     developed a plan to come into compliance with the \n     requirements of this section. The provision allows DHS to \n     rely on an employer's self-assessment and self-certification \n     rather than launching a formal DHS investigation. Within 60 \n     days, the employer is required to certify completion of this \n     review and that it is either in compliance or has instituted \n     a program to come into compliance. At the request of the \n     employer, the Secretary may extend the deadline for good \n     cause.\n       Subsection (c): Document verification system\n       Subsection (c) requires employers hiring, recruiting, or \n     referring employees to take reasonable steps to verify that \n     such employees are authorized to work.\n       Subsection (c)(1) requires employers to attest under \n     penalty of perjury that they have verified the identity and \n     work authorization status of their employees by examining a \n     document establishing both work authorization and identity \n     (described in (c)(I)(B)) or a document establishing work \n     authorization (described in (c)(I)(C)) and a document \n     establishing identity (described in (c)(I)(D)).\n       Subsection (c)(1) also establishes the standard of \n     compliance with regard to examination of a document. Section \n     (c)(I)(E) authorizes the Secretary to prohibit or place \n     conditions on the use of documents that do not reliably \n     establish identity or work authorization or which are being \n     used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree.\n       Subsection (c)(2) describes an employee's obligation to \n     attest in writing to being legally authorized to work and \n     prescribes a penalty for false representations.\n       Sections (c)(3) and (c)(4) require the employer to retain \n     copies of the attestation form and supporting documentation.\n       Subsection (c)(5) subjects an employer that fails to comply \n     with the documentation, recordkeeping, and other requirements \n     of subsection (c) to penalties pursuant to subsection \n     (e)(4)(B). As detailed in subsection (e)(4)(B), penalties for \n     paperwork violations are progressive in their severity, \n     depending upon whether the violation is a first, second or \n     third offense.\n       Subsection (c)(6) provides that nothing in this subsection \n     authorizes the issuance or use of a national identification \n     card.\n       Subsection (d): Electronic employment verification system\n       Subsection (d)(1) requires the Secretary, in cooperation \n     with the Commissioner of Social Security, to implement an \n     Electronic Employment Verification System (EEVS).\n       Subsection (d)(2) incorporates existing Basic Pilot program \n     language requiring the Secretary to operate the verification \n     system through a toll-free phone number or other electronic \n     media through which participating employers can make \n     inquiries as to whether individuals are work authorized. This \n     subsection also requires that the Secretary maintain records \n     of inquiries and responses to inquiries, allowing for a \n     robust audit capability. The verification system must provide \n     an initial response within 3 days. Until the employer \n     receives an answer, the employment relationship may continue. \n     If the employer receives a tentative non-confirmation from \n     the verification system, the employee may contest that \n     finding. While the tentative nonconfirmation is being \n     contested, the employer may not terminate the employee based \n     on a lack of work authorization.\n       The system must be designed and operated for maximum \n     reliability, ease of use, and safeguarding against \n     unauthorized disclosure of private information as well as \n     unlawful discriminatory practices. This section requires the \n     SSA Commissioner to establish a system to compare names with \n     SSNs in order to confirm or not confirm their correspondence \n     as well as whether a SSN is authorized for employment, and \n     prohibits the disclosure of SSN information to employers. The \n     section requires the Secretary to establish a system to \n     compare names with alien identification or authorization \n     numbers in order to confirm or not confirm work \n     authorization. This section also requires updating of \n     information for maximum accuracy.\n       Subsection (d)(3) outline the requirements for employer \n     participation into the System. As a general rule, the \n     verification requirement will apply only to new employees and \n     be rolled out gradually. As of the date of enactment, the \n     Secretary is authorized through notice in the Federal \n     Register to require participation in the EEVS by employers \n     that the Secretary determines to be part of the critical \n     infrastructure, or directly related to the national, or \n     homeland security needs of the United States. Participation \n     of these employers shall apply with respect to both newly \n     hired and currently hired employees.\n       Two years after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary must require employers with more than 5,000 \n     employees to participate in the EEVS. Three years after the \n     date of enactment, the Secretary must require employers with \n     less than 5,000 employees and with more than 1,000 employees \n     to participate in the EEVS. Four years after the date of \n     enactment, the Secretary must require employers with more \n     than 250 employees and less than 1,000 employees to \n     participate in the EEVS. Five years after the date of \n     enactment, the Secretary must require all employers to \n     participate in EEVS.\n       The Secretary also has the authority to require employers \n     to participate in the EEVS based upon immigration \n     enforcement. Participation of these employers shall apply \n     with respect to their newly hired employees. The Secretary is \n     authorized to waive or delay the participation in EEVS but \n     must provide notice to Congress of such waiver prior to the \n     date such waiver is granted.\n       Subsection (d)(6) states that any failure to comply with \n     the EEVS's requirements by a shall be treated as a violation \n     of subsection (a)(1)(B)' s prohibition against hiring \n     individuals without complying with this section, including \n     the requirements of subsections (c) and (d). Subsection \n     (d)(6) further provides that such failure to comply shall be \n     treated as presumed violations of subsection (a)(1)(A)'s \n     prohibition against the hiring of unauthorized aliens.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n       Subsection (d)(7) establishes procedures for employers \n     participating in the EEVS, including provision of identity \n     and work authorization information, presentation of \n     documentation, reliance on documentation, requirements for \n     seeking confirmation or resolving non-confirmations of work \n     authorizations, and consequences of final non-confirmations. \n     This subsection largely incorporates language identical to \n     that contained in the current Basic Pilot statute, in order \n     to allow the current program to be expanded with a minimum of \n     operational disruption.\n       Subsection (d)(8) protects from civil and criminal \n     liability any person or entity who relies in good faith on \n     information provided through the EEVS confirmation system. \n     This incorporates existing language applicable to the Basic \n     Pilot program authority.\n       Subsection (d)(9) prohibits use of the EEVS by any Federal \n     agency for any purposes other than enforcement and \n     administration of the immigration laws, the SSA, or the \n     criminal laws.\n       Subsection (d)(10) authorizes the Secretary to modify the \n     requirements of the EEVS.\n       Subsection (d)(11) allows the Secretary to establish, \n     require, and modify fees for employers participating in the \n     EEVS. Such fees may be set at a level that will recover the \n     full cost of providing the EEVS to all participants. This \n     provision further provides that fees are to be deposited and \n     remain available as provided in INA sections 286(m) and (n), \n     and that the EEVS is considered an immigration adjudication \n     service under 286(n). This provision also allows the \n     Secretary to modify the frequency or schedule for payment.\n       Subsection (d)(12) requires that the Secretary submit a \n     report to Congress within one year after enactment on the \n     capacity, integrity, and accuracy of the EEVS.\n       Subsection (e): Compliance\n       Subsection (e)(1) requires the Secretary to establish \n     procedures for the filing of complaints and investigation of \n     possible violations.\n       Subsection (e)(2) ensures that immigration officers have \n     reasonable access to evidence of employers they are \n     investigating. It also authorizes DHS to compel the \n     production of evidence by subpoena and to fine or void any \n     mitigation of penalties available to employers who fail to \n     comply with subpoenas.\n       Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the Secretary to issue pre-\n     penalty notices to employers when there is reasonable cause \n     to believe the employer has violated this section. It would \n     provide employers a reasonable opportunity to defend their \n     actions and to petition the Secretary for the remission or \n     mitigation of any fine or penalty or to terminate the \n     proceedings. Mitigating circumstances would include good \n     faith compliance and participation in the EEVS. The \n     subsection also sets forth the procedures for the Secretary \n     to follow when making a determination of whether there has \n     been a violation and authorizes the Secretary to mitigate \n     penalties or terminate proceedings in appropriate cases.\n       Subsection (e)(4) sets forth the civil monetary penalties \n     for unlawfully hiring, recruiting, or referring unauthorized \n     aliens or for continuing to employ an individual who is \n     unauthorized to work, as well as penalties for recordkeeping \n     or verification practice violations.\n       Subsection (e)(5) provides that an employer may appeal an \n     adverse determination within 45 days of the issuance of the \n     final determination.\n       Subsection (e)(6) authorizes the Government to file suit in \n     Federal court if an employer fails to comply with a final \n     determination.\n       Subsection (f): Criminal penalties\n       Subsection (f) establishes criminal penalties and \n     injunction procedures for employers who engage in a pattern \n     or practice of knowing violations of subsection (a)(1)(A), \n     which prohibit hiring unauthorized aliens, or subsection \n     (a)(2), which prohibits continuing to employ unauthorized \n     aliens after employer is aware or has reason to be aware that \n     the alien is not authorized to work. Such employers can be \n     fined up to $10,000 for each unauthorized alien with respect \n     to whom such a violation occurs, imprisoned up to six months, \n     or both. This subsection further authorizes the Attorney \n     General to bring a civil action requesting such monetary \n     penalties or injunctive relief.\n       Subsection (g): Prohibition of indemnity bonds\n       Subsection (g) prohibits any employer from requiring \n     prospective employees to post a bond or other security \n     indemnifying the employer against liability arising from the \n     employer's violation of this section. Violation of this \n     prohibition is subject to civil penalties, and amounts \n     obtained in the form of such bonds can be ordered to be \n     deposited in the Employer Compliance Fund authorized by INA \n     Sec. 286(w).\n       Subsection (h) bars noncompliant employers from eligibility \n     for Federal contracts.\n       Subsection (i) contains provisions relating to work \n     documentation from DHS and a federal preemption clause \n     applicable to the provisions of this section.\n       Subsection (j) directs the deposit of funds paid for civil \n     penalties into the employer compliance fund authorized by INA \n     Sec. 286(w).\n     Section 302. Employer compliance fund\n       Section 302 establishes an Employer Compliance Fund into \n     which funds derived from civil penalties are to be deposited. \n     The Employer Compliance Fund shall be used for enhancing and \n     enforcing employer compliance with section 274A.\n     Section 303. Additional worksite enforcement and fraud \n         detection agents\n       Section 303 authorizes the hiring of additional DHS \n     personnel dedicated to worksite enforcement fraud detection \n     agents.\n     Section 304. Clarification of ineligibility for \n         misrepresentation.\n       Section 304 is a technical change that conforms section 212 \n     to section 274A. This provision closes a loophole in the \n     ground of inadmissibility for falsely claiming U.S. \n     nationality in section 212 of the INA that has been exploited \n     to obtain unauthorized employment and subsequently evade \n     removal.\n       The employment verification provisions in section 274A of \n     the INA require an employee to certify that (unless claiming \n     work authorized alien status) he is a ``citizen or national'' \n     of the United States. The Form I-9 uses this formulation. The \n     parallel ground of inadmissibility, although it refers \n     specifically to section 274A verification, only uses the \n     phrase ``citizen.'' Some aliens have escaped the consequences \n     of their misrepresentations by successfully arguing that a \n     false attestation that one is a ``citizen or national'' is \n     not covered by the ground of inadmissibility. A false \n     attestation to any form of U.S. nationality should have the \n     same consequences in employment verification or in other \n     circumstances.\n\n\n  TITLE IV--BACKLOG REDUCTION AND VISAS FOR STUDENTS AND ALIENS WITH \n                            ADVANCED DEGREES\n\n     Section 401. Elimination of existing backlogs\n       Section 401 reduces visa backlog waiting times by allowing \n     the recapture of unused visa numbers and increases the number \n     of employment-based green cards from 140,000 to 290,000. It \n     also exempts immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the \n     480,000 annual cap on family-based immigration.\n     Section 402. Country limits\n       Section 402 increases the per-country limits for family-\n     sponsored and employment-based immigrants are from 7 percent \n     to 10 percent (in the case of countries) and from 2 percent \n     to 5 percent (in the case of dependent areas).\n     Section 403. Allocation of immigrant visas\n       The current 480,000 ceiling on family-sponsored immigrants \n     is redistributed among existing family preference categories. \n     Ten percent is allocated to the first preference--unmarried \n     sons and daughters of U.S. citizens. Fifty percent is \n     allocated to the second preference--spouses and unmarried \n     sons and daughters of lawful permanent residents, of which \n     seventy-seven percent of such visas will be allocated to \n     spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents. \n     Ten percent is allocated to the third preference--married \n     sons and daughters of U.S. citizens. Thirty percent is \n     allocated to the fourth preference--brothers and sisters \n     of U.S. citizens.\n       Section 403 restructures visa number availability to \n     provide additional visas for unskilled workers (who are \n     limited to 5,000/year right now) and other categories where \n     visas have not kept up with demand. The 290,000 ceiling for \n     employment-based immigrant visas is redistributed among the \n     employment-based immigrant visa categories and certain \n     modifications are made to current categories. 15% is \n     allocated to the first preference--aliens with extraordinary \n     ability, outstanding professors and researchers, and \n     multinational executives and managers. 15% is allocated to \n     the second preference--aliens holding advanced degrees or \n     having exceptional ability. 35% is allocated to the third \n     preference--skilled workers and professionals. 5% is \n     allocated to a re-designated fourth preference--investors. \n     30% is allocated to a re-designated fifth preference--other \n     workers performing labor or services (previously included in \n     third preference).\n     Section 404. Relief for minor children\n       Section 404 amends the immediate relative category to allow \n     the children of spouses and parents of U.S. citizens to \n     obtain legal status and travel to the United States with \n     their families.\n     Section 405. Student visas\n       Section 405 extends foreign students' post-curricular \n     Optional Practical Training (and F-1 status) to 24 months. It \n     also creates a new ``F-4'' student visa for students pursuing \n     an advanced degree candidates studying in the fields of math, \n     engineering, technology or the physical sciences. The new \n     visa would allow eligible students to either to return to \n     their country of origin or remain in the United States for up \n     to one year and seek employment in their relevant field of \n     study. Once such a student received such an offer of \n     employment, the individual would be allowed to adjust status \n     to that of a legal permanent resident once the alien paid a \n     $1,000 fee and completed necessary security clearances. \n     Eighty percent of this fee would be deposited into a fund for \n     job training and scholarships for American workers, while \n     twenty percent of the fee would go toward fraud prevention.\n     Section 406. Visas for individuals with advanced degrees\n       Section 406 exempts from the numerical cap on employment-\n     based visas aliens with advanced degrees in science, \n     technology, engineering, or math, and has worked in a related \n     field in the U.S. during the 3 year period preceding their \n     application for adjustment of status. It also exempts \n     immediate relatives of aliens who are admitted as employment-\n     based immigrants from the numerical limitations of 203(b). \n     Finally, it increases the available visas numbers for H-1B \n     nonimmigrants and provides an exemption from the numerical \n     limitation aliens who\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n     have earned advanced degrees in science, technology, \n     engineering, or math. The numerical limitation is also \n     supplemented with a flexible limitation that is set according \n     to demand for foreign high-skilled workers.\n     Section 407. Medical services in underserved areas\n       Section 407 permanently authorizes the current J-1 visa \n     waiver program. Under this program, participating states are \n     allocated 30 J-1 visa waivers, which enables them to waive \n     the 2 year home residency requirement for medical students \n     and physicians who serve in ``medically underserved \n     areas'' upon completion of their J-l program. The program \n     has been reauthorized twice before and is now set to \n     expire on June 1, 2006.\n\n\n               TITLE V--IMMIGRATION LITIGATION REDUCTION\n\n     Section 501. Consolidation of immigration appeals\n       Section 501 consolidates all INA civil and administrative \n     appeals into the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Federal Circuit, and increases the number of authorized \n     judgeships in the Federal Circuit by three to 15. The \n     amendments made by this section shall apply to any final \n     agency order or District Court decision entered on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n     Section 502. Additional immigration personnel\n       Section 502 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     increase annually in FY 2007-2011 the number of investigative \n     personnel investigating immigration violations by not less \n     than 200 and the number of trial attorneys in the Office of \n     General Counsel working on immigration by not less than 100, \n     subject to the availability of appropriations. It also \n     directs the Attorney General to increase annually in FY 2007-\n     2011 the number of litigation attorneys in the Office of \n     Immigration Litigation by not less than 50, the number of \n     Assistant U.S. Attorneys who litigate immigration cases in \n     Federal courts by not less than 50, and the number of \n     immigration judges by not less than 50, subject to the \n     availability of appropriations. Finally, it authorizes \n     appropriations for additional Assistant Federal Public \n     Defenders who litigate Federal criminal immigration cases in \n     Federal court.\n     Section 503. Board of Immigration Appeals removal order \n         authority\n       Section 503 grants the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) \n     authority to enter an order of removal without remanding to \n     the immigration judge. It also conforms certain terminology \n     to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) by inserting the term \n     ``order of removal'', and the term ``immigration judge'' in \n     place of the term ``special inquiry officer,'' and expands \n     the situations in which orders of removal are deemed final.\n     Section 504. Judicial review of visa revocation\n       Section 504 provides that the decision to revoke a visa and \n     the removal order predicated on that revocation are not \n     reviewable. Review of a final order of removal, however, is \n     still permitted under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1252(a)(2)(D) when \n     questions of statutory interpretation or alleged \n     constitutional infirmity arise.\n     Section 505. Reinstatement of removal orders\n       Section 505 clarifies that section 241(a)(5) of the INA (8 \n     U.S.C. 1231(a)(5)) does not require further hearing by an \n     immigration judge in cases in which prior orders of removal \n     are reinstated against aliens who illegally reenter the \n     United States. This provision applies to orders of \n     deportation or exclusion issued in cases initiated before \n     April 1, 1997, and clarifies that the alien's ineligibility \n     for relief is not dependent on when the alien applied for \n     such relief. This section also provides that reinstatement \n     orders are not reviewable.\n     Section 506. Withholding of removal\n       Section 506 clarifies an alien's burden of proof with \n     respect to withholding of removal to make it consistent with \n     the standard established for asylum by section 101(a)(3) of \n     the REAL ID Act. Applicants for withholding, who have \n     traditionally borne a higher burden than applicants for \n     asylum, will bear the same burden of proof as applicants for \n     asylum.\n     Section 507. Certificate of reviewability\n       Section 507 establishes a screening process for aliens' \n     appeals of Board decisions under which appeals of removal \n     orders will be referred to a single judge on the Federal \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. If the alien establishes a prima \n     facie case that the petition for review should be granted, \n     the judge will issue a ``certificate of reviewability'' \n     allowing the case to proceed to a three-judge panel; \n     otherwise it is dismissed.\n     Section 508. Discretionary decisions on motions to reopen or \n         reconsider\n       Section 508 revises the statutory provisions relating to \n     motions to reopen and motions to reconsider to state \n     expressly that the Attorney General's decision whether to \n     grant or deny such motions are committed to his discretion, \n     subject to existing statutory exceptions. This section adds a \n     special provision providing for reopening in order to \n     consider withholding of removal or protection under the \n     Convention Against Torture claims in one limited \n     circumstance. These amendments are applicable to all motions \n     to reopen or reconsider filed on or after the date of \n     enactment in any removal, deportation, or exclusion \n     proceeding.\n     Section 509. Prohibition of attorney fee awards for review of \n         final orders of removal\n       Section 509 abolishes EAJA fee awards in immigration cases \n     for aliens who are removable, except when the Attorney \n     General's or the Secretary's determination regarding \n     removability was not substantially justified.\n     Section 510. Board of Immigration Appeals\n       Section 510 directs the Attorney General to promulgate \n     regulations to require the Board of Immigration Appeals to \n     hear cases in 3 member panels (unless certain conditions are \n     met) and to permit the Board limited authority to issue \n     affirmances without opinion.\n\n\n                        TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     Section 601.

Res. 403\n\n       Whereas the Surgeon General and the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics recommend that most babies be exclusively fed with \n     breast milk for the first 6 months of life, and continue on \n     with breast milk through the first year of life;\n       Whereas studies have shown that children who were breastfed \n     had a 20 percent lower risk of dying in the first year of \n     life than children who were not breastfed;\n       Whereas promoting breastfeeding can potentially prevent up \n     to 720 postneonatal deaths in the United States each year;\n       Whereas breast milk provides the right balance of nutrients \n     to help an infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler, \n     improves the chances of infant survival, and helps protect \n     against common childhood illnesses and infections;\n       Whereas research also suggests that breastfeeding may be \n     protective against chronic diseases such as type I and type \n     II diabetes, leukemia, and obesity;\n       Whereas breast milk contains important amino acids, only \n     found in natural breast milk, that help an infant's brain \n     develop;\n       Whereas maternal benefits to breastfeeding include \n     decreased postpartum bleeding, decreased risk of breast and \n     ovarian cancer, and decreased risk of postmenopausal \n     osteoporosis;\n       Whereas the health advantages for mothers and children of \n     breastfeeding translate into economic benefits for the \n     family, health care system, and workplace;\n       Whereas breastfeeding more children would reduce medical \n     care costs, decrease spending for public health programs such \n     as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \n     Infants, and Children (WIC), and decrease parental \n     absenteeism;\n       Whereas breastfeeding more children would have an \n     environmental benefit by reducing trash and plastic waste \n     from formula cans and bottle supplies;\n       Whereas 1 of the objectives for improving health in Focus \n     Area 16, Maternal, Infant, and Child Health, from Healthy \n     People 2010, is to increase the percentage of mothers who \n     breastfeed to 75 percent in the postpartum period, 50 percent \n     6 months after birth, and 25 percent 1 year after birth; and\n       Whereas throughout the United States, mothers have \n     encountered legal and systematic challenges while trying to \n     breastfeed in public and upon returning to work when seeking \n     out adequate places to express milk in the workplace: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the unique health, economic, and social \n     benefits breastfeeding affords to children, mothers, and the \n     community at large; and\n       (2) calls upon States to take steps to protect a mother's \n     right to breastfeed and remove the barriers faced by women \n     who breastfeed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I speak today to recognize the importance \nof breastfeeding as a child and maternal health issue. Breastfeeding is \nwidely accepted as the most complete form of nutrition for infants, and \nit provides an array of benefits for both infants and mothers.\n  Yet many mothers who choose to breastfeed find themselves in \nsituations where they are discouraged, or even prohibited, from \nbreastfeeding. I submitted a Senate resolution today to recognize the \nmany benefits of breastfeeding and to encourage States to protect the \nrights of women to feed their children.\n  My home State of Illinois recently adopted legislation to exempt \nbreastfeeding mothers from the State's public indecency laws. The \nimpetus behind the State initiative came in no small part from a woman \nnamed Kasey Madden, a young mother turned advocate after she was asked \none too many times not to breastfeed her infant daughter.\n  Kasey was at her local fitness center one day, exercising to get back \ninto shape after pregnancy but also caring\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\nfor five-month-old Sadie. Sadie was in the day care center at the gym. \nAt the moment, she was mad, and she was hungry. Kasey picked up the \nbaby and sat down to let her nurse. Imagine how she felt when the gym \nmanager came to her and asked her to leave the child care center, in \ncase anyone there might be offended.\n  Today, Sadie is a healthy, red-haired, energetic toddler. Kasey knows \nmore than she ever thought she would about how to affect public policy. \nThat fitness center and every place like it in the State of Illinois \nnow must respect the right of women to breastfeed their babies.

Mr. President, we have several items in wrapup in a little \nbit and a lot of activity is going on. Hopefully in 15 or 20 minutes we \nwill be able to close the Senate. I come to the Senate to make a couple \nof statements.\n  I begin with the very brief comment on the budget itself. I thank my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle for their tremendous efforts in \nbringing to a close passage of a budget resolution that this Senate can \nbe very proud of. Overall management of the budget was superb. I thank \nChairman Judd Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad for their leadership, for \ntheir patience on what is always a very difficult process that \nculminates in this vote-arama that we have been in from about 1:30 \ntoday up until about an hour ago. With these vote-aramas, everyone is \non the floor and milling around, considering amendment after amendment. \nIt is a challenge for all Senators, with tensions tending to rise. To \nhave two cool heads calmly manage this bill is a real tribute to both \nof them. I thank them for their leadership.\n  The budget itself is a tough budget. It is a disciplined budget. It \nrestrains spending and tackles the deficit. It reflects our commitment \nto America's future and to making America stronger and safer and more \neconomically sound. Like so many of the issues we tackled this year, it \nis not an easy process. It has not been a very easy process. With \ndetermination and with focus, a lot of energy by leading on principle, \nwe are delivering meaningful solutions for the American people. We have \ndemonstrated this Senate can and does govern. We have been doing that \nconsistently.\n  As we reflect over the last several weeks, no more so than with the \nconfirmation of Justice Samuel Alito. A lot of our opponents had tried \nto distort his record and to undermine the process, but this Senate \nheld firm, and with that Judge Alito did receive a fair up-or-down vote \nthat he deserved in the Senate. But to get to that point was tough. We \nproved that the Senate can hold a free, a dignified, and a thorough \ndebate while at the same time fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibility of giving advice and consent. Justice Alito now sits on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. In every respect Judge Alito \nwas a nominee who meets the highest standards of excellence. I \ncongratulate him once again on his most deserved achievement.\n  Principle and determination to protect the American people also \nguided more recently our passage of the PATRIOT Act. Again, the process \ngot stymied. There was a lot of delay. There was a lot of postponement. \nBut we pressed forward and after sustained negotiations we were able to \nsecure law enforcement's No. 1 terrorist fighting tool, the USA PATRIOT \nAct.\n  The legislation itself works to promote information sharing and \nbreaking down barriers between our intelligence agencies and our law \nenforcement agencies. It has proven to be an effective tool. It levels \nthe playing field so we can effectively harness all of our resources to \ndefeat terror. It appropriately balances the constitutional rights of \nall Americans against our need to effectively investigate and halt \npotential terrorist attacks. Every day it is helping the authorities \ndismantle terrorist organizations and stop our enemies in their tracks.\n  Keeping America strong also means keeping our economy thriving, and \nthat is why also this past month we passed the Tax Relief Act of 2005. \nWe know that tax cuts work. We know they grow the economy and help \ncreate jobs. In 2001 we delivered tax relief to the American people of \n$1.4 trillion; 2 years later, another $350 billion. We cut taxes on \nincome and marriage. We doubled the child tax credit, we slashed taxes \non capital gains and dividends. And the product we are seeing, our \neconomy, has grown. We created over 5 million jobs in the last 36 \nmonths. Unemployment is the lowest it has been since before September \n11, lower now than the average of the 1990s, those boom years, and the \n1980s and the 1970s. Home ownership is up. Almost 70 percent of \nAmericans own their homes. Minority ownership is at an all-time high. \nTax relief has led to 3 years of continued strong growth.\n  The tax cuts are working. Even this past year we saw growth in \nrevenues coming to the Government in over 10 percent, in double digits. \nWhen we return, I hope we will be able to address the conference report \non this tax reconciliation bill.\n  That brings me to what will come in the 2 weeks after the current \nrecess.\n  Our attention is to focus on border security when we come back. Our \ncountry needs security at our borders in order to stop the flow of \nillegal immigration and make America safer from foreign criminals and \nterrorists.\n  Today, I introduced a border security bill to ensure the Senate will \nhave legislation available for consideration during that week of March \n27. The Senate Judiciary Committee, under the fantastic leadership of \nArlen Specter, has been addressing border security and interior \nenforcement aggressively over the last 3 weeks. They have had what we \nall know of as a markup this week, including today and yesterday, on 2 \ndays of last week and the week before. Arlen Specter has been a \ntireless leader. Indeed, they will return on that first Monday to \ncontinue that markup.\n  Now is the time to take their outstanding work to the floor. That is \nexactly what we will do. The bill I introduced is based on the \nconsensus enforcement, visa reform, and immigration litigation reform \ntitles of Chairman Specter's bill, the markup of border security \nlegislation. It focuses on ensuring strict enforcement of our Nation's \nimmigration laws.\n  I do look forward to bringing a border security bill to the floor in \nthe\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nearly part of that week, on Monday or Tuesday of that week, and \nallowing the full Senate to work its will on border security and on \ninterior law enforcement, as well as comprehensive immigration reform.\n  America will be more secure, and our constituents will be safer. I \nhope the Judiciary Committee will be able to report a bill that we can \nbring to the floor that meets these objectives. As a country of \nimmigrants who respect the rule of law, I expect us to honor those \nheritages as the debate unfolds.\n  It is going to be a heated discussion. These are tough issues. This \nbody will struggle with each of these issues. There will be a lot of \ndebate, and I know there will be a lot of amendments. But it is \nimportant to the American people, for their safety, for their security, \nand to do what is right on the issue of border security and \nimmigration. A country that cannot secure its borders cannot secure its \ndestiny.\n  We made great strides in the past 2 months. We are working hard to \nsecure America's future. We are working hard to deliver real outcomes \non real issues. I look forward to continuing this work when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/03/16/senate-section/article/S2387-1", "month": "03", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL HOAGLAND\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tonight, as we wrapped up our votes on the \nbudget, I do want to take a minute to acknowledge someone who everybody \nin this body knows very well, but someone who has worked hard for many \nyears behind the scenes--shirt sleeves rolled up, often with a furrowed \nbrow. His name: Bill Hoagland, the Senate's undisputed budget guru, and \nmy valued budget adviser.\n  No one knows the budget better than Bill Hoagland. No one understands \nbetter the stresses and strains it has undergone as Congress has \nstruggled to find ways to control spending.\n  Bill has seen this process transform as Congress has added layer upon \nlayer of complexity in our ongoing efforts to control deficits. There \nis no greater authority than Bill on how that process began, how it has \nchanged, where it is going in the future.\n  He has amassed this deep reservoir of knowledge, in part, by being \nscrupulously frank and impeccably honest. Bill will always tell you \nwhat he thinks, and he does so in a way that is often maybe too open, \nbut open and transparent. And never, ever does he have a hidden agenda.\n  He provided this service for many years for Senator Domenici when he \nserved as the former Budget Committee chairman's staff director. He has \ndone it for me since joining my team in the leader's office, and for \nany other Senator who has solicited his views.\n  Over the last 3 days, and especially over the course of today--when \nthings started to get a little bit tough, when there was a question \namong Senators in their many small meetings, both on the floor and off \nthe floor--the most common question was, as things got tough: Where is \nBill Hoagland? Where is Bill? And indeed, Bill would come, and with his \nexperience and with his discipline and with his focus, he would fix it. \nAnd fix it he did--again and again and again.\n  Bill is dedicated, well informed, and honest. He never trims his \ncounsel to please the listener. These qualities have been a huge asset, \nan enormous asset, to me as leader. I know when I talk with him, I may \nnot always necessarily hear what I want, but I always hear what I \nprobably should.\n  This is Bill Hoagland's 22nd budget. It is my last. I want to take \nthis opportunity to thank the Indiana native for his service to the \nSenate and to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STAFFORD WHITE ROCKS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 2447 introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2447) to redesignate the White Rocks National \n     Recreation Area in the State of Vermont as the ``Robert T. \n     Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has agreed to \nunanimously approve this legislation to rename the White Rocks National \nRecreation Area in the Green Mountain National Forest as the Robert T. \nStafford White Rocks National Recreation Area. Along with Senator \nJeffords, I introduced this legislation as what we believed is a \nfitting tribute to our friend and former colleague, Senator Robert \nStafford.\n  Bob Stafford is an absolute giant in Vermont politics. He spent \nalmost 30 years representing our great State first in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and then in the United States Senate. Prior to his \narrival in Washington in the early 1960s, he served his fellow \nVermonters closer to home holding a number of prominent State \npositions. He served as Rutland County prosecuting attorney, as Rutland \nCounty State's Attorney, as deputy State attorney general, and finally \nas our State's attorney general. From 1957-1959 Bob Stafford held the \npost of lieutenant governor, and in 1959 he went on to become Governor.\n  In 1960, Bob Stafford was elected to Vermont's sole seat in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. He won five successive reelections. In \nSeptember 1971, he resigned his House seat to accept appointment to the \nU.S. Senate following the death of Senator Winston Prouty. After \nwinning a special election in January 1972, Bob proceeded to represent \nVermont in the Senate during the next 17 years. I had the distinct \nprivilege of\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nserving with him during all but two of those years. During his Senate \nservice Bob Stafford became a national figure of stature, of vision and \nof courage in his leadership especially on environmental and education \npolicy issues and legislation. His legacy endures in his many \nlegislative achievements.\n  To honor our friend, Senator Jeffords and I introduced this \nlegislation to name the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the \nGreen Mountain National Forest as the ``Robert T. Stafford White Rocks \nNational Recreation Area.'' White Rocks is among his most beloved \nnatural areas in Vermont, and Bob Stafford protected more land in our \nState than anyone who came before him. I know he and Helen could \nactually see the towering white cliff face of White Rocks Mountain from \ntheir home. By passing this legislation, the Senate honors our former \ncolleague and our friend.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, in seeking to rename the White Rocks National Recreation \nArea in the Green Mountain National Forest of Vermont in honor of our \ngreat friend, and my mentor and predecessor, Robert T. Stafford.\n  Twenty-two years ago, Senator Stafford introduced the Vermont \nWilderness Act of 1984 on behalf of himself and Senator Leahy. Senator \nStafford said at that time, ``It is our intention to present this \nlegislation to Vermonters and seek their comments . . . I am willing to \nlisten to the voices of other Vermonters before a decision is made.'' \nAnd listen he did.\n  Senator Stafford then led Senator Leahy and me back home to Vermont \nto hear from hundreds of our constituents. Their input changed the \nbill, and the result was the creation of the White Rocks National \nRecreation Area.\n  This magnificent, 36,000-acre recreation area exists because of \nSenator Stafford's insistence upon listening to Vermonters and seeing \ntheir views embodied in the law.\n  Senator Stafford's public service spanned four decades, and included \nsix years as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. Throughout his career, he proved himself a true steward of our \nenvironment. As he approached his retirement at the end of the 100th \nCongress, Senator Stafford gave a series of floor statements describing \nthe environmental threats that faced our Nation.\n  On September 12, 1988, he said, ``We humans have degraded the \nenvironment of our world, and now we must set ourselves on the path of \nreversing that course. It will not be an easy task to accomplish, but \nit is a necessary one . . . If only we can recognize this circumstance \nfor what it is--an opportunity to redirect ourselves toward a brighter \nfuture--then setting ourselves to the task ahead will not be a burden, \nbut a joy.''\n  That was 18 years ago, and unfortunately, those threats remain very \nmuch with us today. But it is my hope that the White Rocks recreation \narea, which Senator Stafford can look out upon from his home in \nRutland, Vermont, will be a constant reminder of Senator Stafford's \ndevotion to Vermont and his devotion to our environment.\n  No monument or statement or park renaming can do justice to the \nunparalleled contributions Senator Stafford has made to both Vermont \nand this Nation. Senator Stafford has been one of the most devoted, \ncapable and complished public servants the Senate has ever known. That \nsaid, naming the White Rocks area after Senator Stafford is as fitting \na tribute as I can imagine.\n  Just as the Wilderness Act of 1984 named the George Aiken Wilderness \nArea in honor of that great Vermont Senator, we seek to bestow the same \nhonor upon Senator Stafford with the naming of the Robert T. Stafford \nWhite Rocks National Recreation Area.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2447) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Cross-border fraud and deception are \n     growing international problems that affect American consumers \n     and businesses.\n       (2) The development of the Internet and improvements in \n     telecommunications technologies have brought significant \n     benefits to consumers. At the same time, they have also \n     provided unprecedented opportunities for those engaged in \n     fraud and deception to establish operations in one country \n     and victimize a large number of consumers in other countries.\n       (3) An increasing number of consumer complaints collected \n     in the Consumer Sentinel database maintained by the \n     Commission, and an increasing number of cases brought by the \n     Commission, involve foreign consumers, foreign businesses or \n     individuals, or assets or evidence located outside the United \n     States.\n       (4) The Commission has legal authority to remedy law \n     violations involving domestic and foreign wrongdoers, \n     pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission Act. The \n     Commission's ability to obtain effective relief using this \n     authority, however, may face practical impediments when \n     wrongdoers, victims, other witnesses, documents, money and \n     third parties involved in the transaction are widely \n     dispersed in many different jurisdictions. Such circumstances \n     make it difficult for the Commission to gather all the \n     information necessary to detect injurious practices, to \n     recover offshore assets for consumer redress, and to reach \n     conduct occurring outside the United States that affects \n     United States consumers.\n       (5) Improving the ability of the Commission and its foreign \n     counterparts to share information about cross-border fraud \n     and deception, to conduct joint and parallel investigations, \n     and to assist each other is critical to achieve more timely \n     and effective enforcement in cross-border cases.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enhance the \n     ability of the Federal Trade Commission to protect consumers \n     from illegal spam, spyware, and cross-border fraud and \n     deception and other consumer protection law violations.\n\n     SEC. 2.
