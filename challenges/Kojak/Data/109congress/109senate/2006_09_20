Mr. President, I wish to comment on the issue before us \ntoday. I am glad we are dealing with this question. It is certainly one \nthat has had a great deal of discussion and impact all over the country \nas to how we handle it. I think it is one of our principal issues. \nCertainly, there is a different view as to how it ought to be handled \nand all these kinds of things; nevertheless, I believe it is important \nthat we begin to do something. Even though there are many other things \nthat legitimately could be considered, of course, sealing the border is \nprobably the first step that ought to be done.\n  The Senate, of course, passed a bill that was quite lengthy--\nincluding ways and means of dealing with those who are already here \nillegally--and created a good deal of discussion and debate. I didn't \nsupport the Senate bill in that I thought it was too broad in terms of \ndealing with people who had come here illegally, even though I do \nbelieve there are some, depending on the situation, who should be given \nan opportunity to go through the system. But I am pleased that we are \nbeginning to do something.\n  The first thing, obviously, is to do something about the border. I am \ngoing to support the bill before us, although I don't think it is \nperfect. I think, frankly, there needs to be some limit on building \nfences. I cannot imagine building a fence, a 40-foot-tall fence, all \nacross the border. All we would have is 40-foot ladders if we did that. \nBut there are areas in particular where this needs to be done. I think \nthis is an authorization where some decisions can be made with respect \nto how that is done.\n  There ought to be other things we consider along with it. One of them \nis that we need to have a modernized system for people coming to the \nUnited States. All of us want workers and immigrants to be able to come \nlegally. That system needs to be modernized, made more efficient, so \nthat those kinds of things can happen without taking a very long time. \nWe are challenged with the notion of having some kind of identification \nsystem where we can tell easily and clearly who are legitimate citizens \nand who are not.\n  In connection with that, I believe it is appropriate for employers to \nbe required to report as to who on their work staff is legal and who \nisn't. As I said, this is a difficult issue and one we need to work on.\n  I simply want to say I am pleased we are moving forward to do \nsomething. I intend to support this movement today for cloture. I hope \nwe can do that so we can start to do something about this issue, which \nis one of the most important issues to all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9738-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9738-S9739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COUP IN THAILAND\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor many times \nto talk about our great interest in the nations of Southeast Asia and \nto call for increased engagement and more attention to the relations \nbetween the United States and Southeast Asia.\n  In the early winter of 2006, I spoke about the tsunami and the impact \nthat had on the region. Many of us, particularly from farm country, \nremember what happened when Thailand's currency collapsed in 1997. It \nbrought a tremendous decline in the region and a decline in our \nexports. We were previously exporting $12 billion of agricultural \nproduct--much from the Midwest--to that region, and that drop of $12 \nbillion caused the precipitous drops in the prices of commodities sold \nby many farmers in the grain States. So we know that it is an important \ntrading partner.\n  But yesterday, a military coup took over the Government in Thailand \nwhile its Prime Minister, Thaksin Chinnawat, was in New York at the \nU.N. Prime Minister Thaksin had been a successful businessman. He had \nstrong support from Thailand's largely rural population but with \nopposition to the urban dwellers. In 2005, his Thai Rak Thai--which \nmeans ``Thais love Thais''--I cannot understand why we didn't think of \nsomething clever like that as a name for a political party--captured \n374 out of 500 seats in the House of Representatives. The opposition \nparty boycotted it, however. There was discussion of potential \ncorruption by the sale by the Prime Minister of his telecommunications \nand satellite business. He had controversies with the military, \nbeginning when 87 Muslim protesters in southern Thailand died in \nsecurity custody, and the Prime Minister was attempting to put his own \npeople in charge of the military.\n  After the election, the King stepped in and asked the court to review \nthe election. They set it aside, and Thaksin essentially resumed power \nas Prime Minister even though the election was overturned.\n  Now, it is with great concern and disappointment that we see the \nmilitary coup. Our neighbors in the region have spoken out. They have \nexpressed concern, great disappointment. And it is clear that for the \ncause of the country and the region, the constitutional process must be \nrestored in Thailand and an election date set for a new democratic \ngovernment very shortly.\n  America has had in Thailand one of its best allies. We conduct \nnumerous joint military exercises. Thailand was responsible for the \ncapture of the infamous radical Islamic terrorist Hambali, who \nmasterminded the Bali bombing. We have worked closely with them.\n  Thailand has been the economic stronghold of Southeast Asia. It is \nalso a constitutional monarchy, with well-developed infrastructure and \na free-enterprise economy and proinvestment policies. I think the \neconomy will recover. As far as democracy, King Bhumibol, a benign \nmonarch who served for 60 years, exercised his considerable influence \nto keep Thailand moving in that direction. Thailand, which, during the \nlate 20th century, experienced numerous coups and military coups, had \nnot had one since 1991. I believe King Bhumibol will push for a \ndemocracy and will get back on the negotiations between Thailand and \nthe United States for a free-trade agreement.\n  As I said, Thailand is key in the region. I have described that \nregion as the second front in the war on terror because al-Qaida-\nrelated radical Islamist groups have been conducting terrorist attacks \nhere. It is set forth in a book by Ken Conboy, describing the most \ndangerous terror network. There is concern that since the bombings in \nsouthern Thailand have shown that there are insurgents--some 1,700 \npeople have died--that this might become a haven, a breeding ground for \nthe radical Islamists, rather than the insurgents in the three southern \nprovinces of far south Thailand.\n  My view is that is an overreaction. I think the insurgents have \nissues with the Government, but to this point, I don't see evidence \nthat they will become a host for al-Qaida or other related groups. They \ngenerally have practiced the moderate Muslim viewpoint of Islam of the \nSoutheast Asia region.\n  Also, at the same time, I might mention, as we are speaking about the \nbattle against terrorism and modern Islam, I visited Malaysia in \nAugust. Malaysia, again, has been a country that has been making great \nprogress. It is a democratic nation committed to progress and \ndevelopment and has aspired to the peaceful and tolerant teachings of \nIslam. It is a key economic partner. It is our 10th largest trading \npartner overall. It has been growing at 5 percent annually. We are in \nnegotiations for a free-trade agreement with them. Malaysia imports \nmore from the United States than any\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\ncountry, other than Japan, in that region. I believe that a free-trade \nagreement will help build on that constructive partnership in fighting \nterrorism and ensuring other security issues.\n  Despite all this, I saw a disturbing trend while I was there; that \nis, the possibility that some of the more radical views of extremism \nand intolerance in religion may be raising their ugly head in religion \nin Malaysia.\n  Most recently, a Malaysian woman who was born Azalina Jailani, \nchanged her name to Linda Joy, and has been waiting for the federal \ncourts to approve her conversion from Islam to Christianity. It was \nreported that when her application came to change her religion, it was \nrejected, and she was sent back to the Sharia or religious courts. Her \nlawyer has been arguing before Malaysia's highest court that Joy's \nconversion be considered a right under the constitution and not a \nreligious matter.\n  We are watching this case with great interest. There are reports that \nprovinces in Malaysia are going to change their law to implement the \nSharia, or harsh religious law, as law of the province.\n  Sixty percent of Malaysia's people are Muslim, and Christians of \nvarious denominations make up about 8 percent. The rest are Buddhist, \nTaoist, and Hindu. We look forward to seeing a decision reasserting \nMalaysia's commitment to democratic principles and a rejection of \nintolerant religious laws.\n  Malaysia Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi has been an outspoken \nchampion of tolerance. He has pointed out the obvious political dangers \nof taking that road, but I hope he will not succumb to the pressures \nthat appear to be increasing to move down a path toward less tolerant \nand potentially more extremist forms of religion.\n  The pressures for adopting harsh religious laws are also being \napplied to Indonesia where President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been \nanother strong advocate of tolerance, freedom, and democracy.\n  The Muslim countries in that region, we hope, will continue on a path \nof secular, pluralistic, democratic societies or the choice is to see \nthem turn from that path to a potential breeding ground for terror and \ninstability.\n  Speaking of terror and instability, one country where I am not \nfearful of that occurring is Cambodia, which I also visited in August. \nI was stunned to see the World Bank put out a list of ``failed states'' \nwith the danger of becoming harbors for terrorism, and they listed \nCambodia.\n  To me, Cambodia is definitely heading in the right direction in terms \nof fighting terrorism. They are making great economic progress. We have \nbeen cooperating with them. They have contributed to counterterrorism \nefforts in the region.\n  Prime Minister Hun Sen said:\n\n       If we aren't active enough in fighting terror, we risk \n     becoming the hostage.\n\n  They set up a national committee to fight terrorism. After the \nattacks on the United States on 9/11, Cambodia offered overflight \nrights to support our operations.\n  Cambodia has contributed peacekeepers to Sudan. The United States has \nprovided international military education and training funds for the \nfirst time, and we are planning military exercises with Cambodia later \nthis year.\n  The IMET contribution of $45,000 is small, but it shows we are \nwilling to work with them and ensure their military has civilian \ncontrol, appropriate rules of engagement, and other means of conducting \nthemselves in this very difficult time.\n  There is an economic issue that I hope we can resolve successfully \nwith respect to Cambodia because they are moving on the path toward \nwhat we would want to see, and that is democracy and human rights in \nthis part of the world and free markets.\n  The economy of Cambodia has been growing since 1999, boosted by a \nbilateral textile agreement, and we believe that has been a reason for \nthe strong economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators wishing to take the \nfloor. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Cambodia has adopted international labor \nrights and standards touted by the International Labor Organization as \na model for other developing countries, and they are beginning to \nflourish. This is a country that has half its population under the age \nof 20 because of the unbelievable depredations of the Khmer Rouge in \nthe late seventies and widespread murder and genocide. But it is on the \nright track.\n  However, with the expiration of the bilateral textile agreement, \ncountries such as Cambodia are now losing out in the competition with \neconomies such as China and India. I strongly support and hope we can \npass a measure to enhance economic opportunities such as the Tariff \nRelief Assistance for Developing Economies, or TRADE Act, that will \nallow least developed countries, such as Cambodia, to remain \ncompetitive by enhancing economic growth. They need to create a better \ninvestment environment.\n  They are clearly not a Thomas Jefferson democracy yet. They have had \na very colorful and very deadly past, but we think that with our help \nand support, they can redevelop what was once Southeast Asia's rice \nbasket--prior to the Khmer Rouge's destruction of small irrigation \ninfrastructure and the execution of anyone with agricultural \nexpertise--again to a strong contributing economy.\n  We must adopt initiatives such as these for Cambodia and for other \ncountries in the Southeast Asia region. We have to work to continue \nimproving education, emancipation, economic development, and promoting \ndemocracy in Southeast Asia, as around the rest of the world.\n  Doing so is not only good neighborly, it will not only help the \nSoutheast Asian nations move toward economic and political reform, but \nit will be the most important thing we can do against the war that \nradical Islam has declared upon our world and keep these countries from \nturning to the extremist violence, the terrorism we now see primarily \nin the Middle East and have seen too frequently, as noted in ``The \nSecond Front,'' in Southeast Asia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9739-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

We must honor both of those heritages. \nAccordingly, we pursued in this body a four-pronged approach to reform: \nfirst, fortify our borders; second, strengthen worksite enforcement; \nthird, develop a strong temporary worker program; fourth, develop a \nfair and realistic way to address the 12 million people here already \nwho entered our country illegally, but under no circumstances would we \noffer amnesty.\n  Unfortunately, at this point it is pretty clear to everyone that we \nwill not reach a conference agreement on comprehensive immigration \nreform before we break in September. While I have made it clear that I \nprefer a comprehensive solution, I have always said that we need an \nenforcement-first approach to immigration reform--not enforcement only \nbut enforcement first.\n  We share a 1,951-mile border with Mexico, and it doesn't take too \nmuch creativity to imagine how terrorists might plot to exploit that \nborder. It is time to secure that border with Mexico. As a national \nsecurity challenge, that is absolutely critical to fighting a strong \nwar on terror. That is the approach of this bill, the Secure Fence Act \nof 2006, a bill on which we will shortly vote.\n  Earlier this year, with passage of the supplemental appropriations, \nwe provided almost $2 billion to repair fences\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\nin high-traffic areas, to replace broken Border Patrol aircraft for \nlower traffic areas, and to support training for additional Customs and \nBorder Patrol agents. In addition, we deployed more than 6,000 National \nGuard troops to our southwest border, and subsequently--and this is \ntremendous news--we saw a 45-percent drop in border apprehensions.\n  But we have to do more. The Secure Fence Act picks up where that \nsupplemental left off. It lays the groundwork for complete operational \ncontrol over our border with Mexico, and it will go a long way toward \nstopping illegal immigration altogether. Customs and Border Protection \nwill take responsibility for securing every inch of our border with \nMexico. Engineers and construction workers will erect two-layer \nreinforced fencing along the border. Hundreds of new cameras and \nsensors will be installed. Unmanned aircraft will supplement existing \nair and ground patrols.\n  We are enhancing and fortifying our borders to entry so we will have \nbetter control over who enters the country, how they come, and what \nthey bring. We know this approach to enforcement works. We saw a \ndrastic downturn in illegal immigration when Congress mandated a 14-\nmile stretch of fence in San Diego, from 200,000 border violations in \n1992 to 9,000 last year.\n  The Secure Fence Act is a critical component of national security. It \nis an essential first step toward comprehensive immigration reform. So \nwe can't afford to demean it with partisan political stunts.\n  Mr. President, very shortly we will have a vote to bring this bill to \nthe floor. But the vote isn't just about this bill. It is about \nbolstering national security. It is about keeping America strong. It is \nabout ensuring the safety of each and every American. With action here \nto secure our border, Congress and the Nation can turn to resolving the \nchallenges of worksite enforcement, of a strong temporary worker \nprogram, and the challenges of the 12 million illegal aliens who live \namong us, with respect and care and dignity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments on \nthis legislation and ask that I be notified after 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend? Under the previous \norder, there will be 1 hour for debate equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are indeed a nation of immigrants. We \nwill always have immigrants coming to our country, and they have \nenriched our Nation in so many different ways. It is time for us, \nhowever, to recognize that the policies we have adopted as a Nation are \nnot working; that the law that we as Americans respect so greatly is \nbeing made a mockery of; the system is in shambles, and the American \npeople are very concerned about it--as they rightly should be. I \nbelieve public officials are coming to understand the gravity of the \nproblem after the American people have led them at last to that event.\n  For the last 30 or 40 years, the American people have been right on \nthis subject. They have asked for a lawful system of immigration. They \nhave asked for a system of immigration that serves the interests of the \nUnited States of America. And they have expressed continual concern \nabout the illegality that is ongoing. Frankly, the politicians and \nGovernment officials have not been worthy of the good and decent \ninstincts and desires of the American people.\n  Finally, I think those voices are being heard today.\n  We want to talk about the House bill that is on the floor of the \nSenate today. We are asking that this legislation be considered by the \nSenate. The majority leader has had to file for cloture because \napparently some in this body do not even want to consider this \nlegislation. They do not want to talk about it, push it away through \nsurreptitious legerdemain. They want to figure out a way to undermine \nwhatever legislation has been passed and make sure nothing ever gets \ndone. That has been the problem. I hate to say it. We have gone again \nand again, and we have promised we are going to do something and we \ntell the American people we are going to do this and we are going to do \nthat. But they are not ignorant, they know we have not done anything, \nexcept for the last few months we began to take a few steps that had \nsome significance. But for the last 40 years we have basically had a \nsystem driven by illegality that is not worthy of the American people, \nnot worthy of our heritage of law, and it must end.\n  Let me tell you what happened in the Senate about the fencing issue. \nFive months ago, May 17, my colleagues, by a vote of 83 to 16, after \ntalking to their constituents, I submit, approved my amendment to \nmandate the construction of at least 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles \nof vehicle barriers along the southwest border. That totals 870 miles \nof physical barriers, either a fence or a vehicle barrier. Admittedly, \nthat was a strong vote in this body, indicating that fencing on the \nsouthern border is and should be a part of our plan to recapture a \nlegal system of immigration in America. It remains one of our important \npriorities.\n  On August 2, my colleagues, this time, by a vote of 93 to 3, voted to \nfund the construction of those miles of fencing and barriers on the DOD \nappropriations bill as part of the National Guard effort at the border. \nToday we will vote again. I expect and hope that the Senate will have \nthe votes for cloture so we can move forward with this bill and not \nhave it obstructed from even being debated in the Senate. The miles of \nfencing contained in this bill are not that different from what the \nSenate had already voted for, 93 to 3 to fund this year.\n  The Senate has already voted to fund them, and we are moving forward. \nThis bill simply requires--the House bill that has been passed by the \nother body--that more of those miles be fencing in designated areas.\n  I will make this point: We are not there yet. Just because we have \nhad these votes, just because the House has voted for fencing, just \nbecause the Senate, by an overwhelming vote, has authorized fencing, we \nhave not begun to construct that yet. We have to get the money, and we \nhave to get a final bill. The amendment I offered--that passed 83 to \n16--was part of the comprehensive immigration bill. That bill is not \ngoing to become law. That whole bill is not going to become law. So if \nwe are going to commence now to build a barrier on the border, we need \nto pass this legislation that actually authorizes it. So don't go back \nhome and say I voted for it, but I didn't vote for this bill. This bill \nis going to determine whether we actually do something and we authorize \nit and direct how it is to be done, not your previous vote.\n  That is what has been happening. We have always said we have had \nthese votes, but when the dust settled we never made it law and never \nmade it reality. I urge my colleagues to understand that. Without this \nlegislation we are not going to get there in the way you previously \nvoted, and everybody needs to understand that.\n\n  Let me tell you a little bit about what is in the legislation. The \nmajority leader summed it up correctly. I appreciate his leadership and \nhis strong support from the beginning for sufficient border barriers. \nMajority Leader Frist is committed to a good and just solution of the \nimmigration problem in America, but he has come to understand that we \nhave to take steps and do some things, and one of them is fencing.\n  This is what this bill will do. It will establish operational control \nof the border. Most people think we ought to have that now but we do \nnot. We do not have operational control of the border. So not less than \n18 months after the enactment of this bill, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity must take all actions necessary and appropriate to achieve and \nmaintain operational control of the border. Isn't that what we want? \nIsn't that what we have been asking for, for 30 years?\n  Within 1 year of enactment, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \nmust report to Congress and to the American people on the progress made \ntoward achieving operational control of the border. We are not going to \njust pass a bill this time and forget it. We are going to have some \nreports and some analysis so we can monitor whether we are being \nsuccessful.\n  Operational control under the legislation includes systematic \nsurveillance\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\nof the international land and maritime borders through the use of \npersonnel and technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles, ground-based \nsensors, satellites, radar, and cameras. Those are all going to be part \nof any effective system. We know that. We are not opposed to that. But \ndon't let anybody tell you only those things will make the system work. \nThey will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Physical infrastructure enhancements to prevent illegal entry of \naliens and to facilitate access to international land and maritime \nborders by the Customs and Border Protection Agency are important. The \nbill further defines operational control as the prevention of unlawful \nentry into the United States, including entry by terrorists, unlawful \naliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and contraband. Second, \nthe bill extends the current requirement for border fencing in San \nDiego, requiring that fencing be installed by 2008 through several \nurban areas. It mentions those. All the fencing in the bill is focused \non the heavily trafficked areas on the southwest border. None of the \nfencing extends further than 15 miles outside high trafficking areas.\n  Let me just say this: The system that we have today is failing so \nbadly that last year we apprehended 1.1 million people entering into \nthis country illegally. Tell me that is a functional system.\n  By sending in the National Guard, by building these barriers, by \nadding to the number of agents, each one of those steps will help send \na message throughout the world that we are not wide open, that our \nborders are going to be enforced. You should not come illegally. You \nshould wait in line and come legally.\n  Those are facts that I think all of us need to consider as we \nevaluate this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I see the Democratic leader here, Senator Reid. I know \nhis day is busy. I will be pleased to yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I so appreciate the courtesy that is so normal and usual \nfrom my friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. President, it is so interesting that here it is 5 days before we \nare set to adjourn, 6 weeks before an election, and this border fence \nbill has been brought forward. The majority and the President have had \n5 years since 9/11 to secure our borders, but they basically ignored, \nfor 5 years, this issue of national security. Now, with the elections \nlooming, suddenly they want to get serious about protecting America. If \nthey want to have this debate, I am happy to join in it.\n  First of all, we can build the tallest fence in the world, and it \nwill not fix our broken immigration system. To do that we need the kind \nof comprehensive reform that the Senate passed earlier this year. We \nhave been waiting for months for the majority to appoint conferees so \nwe can move forward on this bill, but they have not done that.\n  Mr. President, I direct your attention and that of my distinguished \nfriend from Alabama to this document called ``Immigration and America's \nFuture.'' I just completed a meeting with Senator Spencer Abraham and \nCongressman Lee Hamilton, who are cochairs of this Task Force on \nImmigration and America's Future. Twenty-five of the most prominent \npeople in America have met to recognize that our system is in bad \nshape. This document will be made public in a matter of hours. It will \nbe made public today. I so much appreciate their coming and talking \nabout what they believe is good and bad about our system. I think it is \nwithout any exaggeration that they think the House suggestion that we \ncan do it through just security will not work.\n  Our bill, our Senate bill--I am sure they are not going to endorse it \nbut, of course, they think it is better than the House bill by a far \nmeasure.\n  Because it appears very clear to me that the President and the \nmajority leader are not going to help us get this conference \nappointed--we have waited weeks and weeks for a conference--I hope that \nwe can, when we come back next year, do something about immigration, \nsomething serious and substantial.\n  I have not read this document. I have the greatest respect for the \npeople who have come up with this document, and I think we can find a \nlot of substance in it. We need a bill that combines strong and \neffective enforcement of our borders, tough sanctions against employers \nwho hire undocumented immigrants, a temporary worker program, and an \nopportunity for undocumented immigrants currently in this country to \nhave a pathway to legal immigration. They need to work hard, pay their \ntaxes, learn English, and stay out of trouble. Only a combination of \nthese elements will work to get our broken immigration under control.\n  President Bush says he supports comprehensive reform, but he has a \nstrange way of showing it. I heard my friend, who is one of the \nSenate's lawyers. Rarely does he come to the Senate floor unless he has \nan element of the law on which to speak. One of the things he talked \nabout, last year they apprehended a little over a million people coming \nacross the borders. However, that is down 30 percent from the time \nPresident Bush took office until now. Prior to that, we were picking up \nclose to 2 million. We have a system that just does not work.\n\n  It is not just people coming across our border; it is what they are \nbringing across the border. The General Accounting Office reported that \nthey were able to bring nuclear materials across our border. Now, 6 \nmonths after we received that report from the General Accounting \nOffice, the Republicans want to get serious about border security. What \nhas taken so long?\n  For years, we have had procedures and laws in place to secure our \nborders--not well but certainly better--and they have been virtually \nignored. The September 11 Commission told the President he should work \nwith other countries to develop a terrorist watch list that our Border \nPatrol agents could use to check people coming in. Did he do that? No. \nThe September 11 Commission gave him a failing grade.\n  In the 9/11 Act--we all remember that--Congress provided for 2,000 \nnew Border Patrol agents. Guess what. Like so many things, they are \nauthorized but not paid for. We have been unable to get the President \nand the Republican Congress to pay for these new Border Patrol agents. \nWe authorized them and do not pay for them.\n  We did not oppose the sensible fence on the border. Almost all of us \nvoted for a 370-mile fence as part of the comprehensive bill. If I am \nnot mistaken, it is the Senator from Alabama who moved forward to have \nthe fence paid for. That is good. Now we have an amendment to build 700 \nmiles of extremely expensive fencing--some estimate it will cost as \nmuch as $7 billion--with no plan to fix our broken immigration system.\n  The majority has made very clear they have no interest in negotiating \nwith the Senate to enact legislation. What we are doing today is about \nNovember 7th. In addition, we now hear the majority may try to include \nthe entire House enforcement package in the Homeland Security \nappropriations conference report. This is the package that the House \nRepublicans put together after their unprecedented summer of sham \nhearings about the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  Among the measures included in the package is a provision making the \n12 million undocumented immigrants subject to arrest and detention. \nThis provision has long been opposed by State and local law enforcement \nauthorities who already are stretched thin and do not want to \njeopardize the policing efforts in immigrant communities.\n  This is clearly an effort to sneak the controversial criminalization \nprovisions of the House enforcement-only bill through the back door. I \nstrongly oppose this illegitimate maneuver. If the Republicans want to \nmove forward on these provisions, they should have agreed to a \nconference on immigration bills that each Chamber passed.\n  Enforcement measures alone will not secure our border. It is crucial \nwe get control of our border. That is without any question. But, like \nmany of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and like \nPresident Bush, I believe we can only secure our border through \ncomprehensive reform. No amount of grandstanding will change that.\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\n  This is a rehash of a battle we already have fought. The Senate has \nspoken and profoundly disagrees with the House. The Senate is ready to \nsit down with the House and work out a real solution. We need the \nPresident and the majority leader to help find the solution. We have \noffered practical, workable, fair solutions to solve our immigration \nsystems. The President and the majority leader said they supported what \nwe were trying to do, but it does not appear they are interested in \nreal solutions, just political posturing at this stage.\n  On the motion to proceed to this bill, I will vote aye in the hope \nthat the majority leader will allow Members to amend it to reflect the \nSenate's bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform. At \nthe very least, there are certain key things we need to do. The fruits \nand vegetables in our country are being thrown away at harvest time \nbecause we do not have the people to pick the fruit and vegetables and \nwork at the processing plants. I hope that amendment would be allowed--\nat least the farm workers provision.\n  I wish we were in a different position. I, again, direct my \ncolleagues' attention to this work done by Senator Abraham, Congressman \nHamilton and 23 others. It is a bipartisan group. As I have indicated, \nI have not read this--I have gotten a briefing on it--but we need to \nhave a new direction in immigration in this country. Hopefully, this \ndocument will allow that new direction.\n  Again, I so appreciate my friend allowing me to speak. I appreciate \nit so very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Democrat leader and his \nciting of that report. I look forward to reading it.\n  The reason that is important, this so-called comprehensive reform \nbill that actually passed the Senate, with a substantial number of no \nvotes, is nothing more than an extension of the current failed system. \nIt is not a comprehensive reform of immigration at all.\n  We had a hearing last week at my request. We had some of the best \nminds in America on immigration. They said our present system is \ncompletely ineffectual. I think that is fair way to summarize what they \nsaid.\n  They all spoke favorably of the Canadian plan, the Australian plan, \nand other plans being developed by developing nations around the world. \nIt makes every sense that we do that. I am looking forward to analyzing \nthat report. I am confident it will be further evidence that business \nas usual in immigration must end.\n  Next year we need to come forward--and I will commit to working with \nmy colleagues--and have a real dialog on what immigration should be for \nAmerica. The seminal expert in America, Professor George Borjas, \nhimself an immigrant, at the John F. Kennedy School at Harvard, has \nwritten the most authoritative and best-known book on immigration, \n``Heaven's Door.'' He just testified at our hearing last week. He has \nsaid in his book and in his testimony, fundamentally, America needs to \nask this question: Are you crafting an immigration policy that serves \nyour national interests?\n  If that is what we are doing, then he has some ideas that help us do \nthat. But that is not what we have been doing. We have never had a \ndiscussion of the Canadian plan that gives preference to people with \neducation. We have never discussed the Canadian plan that gives \npreference to people who already speak English. We have not discussed \nthe system in Canada that gives preferences to people who bring \nbusiness investment or have skills that are important in the workplace.\n  Isn't that what a rational nation would do? This bill that passed the \nSenate is fatally flawed. We need to start over completely. I believe, \nthat report will validate the things I just mentioned.\n  Of course, let me say to all of our colleagues, no one suggests that \nbuilding a fence is the end to the problem. Mr. T.J. Bonner, head of \nthe Border Patrol Agents Association, testified at our committee. He \nsaid there are two things we need to do: We need to strengthen the \nborder and eliminate the magnet of the workplace by cracking down on \nillegal hiring in the workplace.\n  The Senator from Nevada, the Democratic leader, is correct. We have \nseen some reduction in the numbers being apprehended. I hope that \nindicates we are seeing a reduction in those attempting to enter the \ncountry. I believe it does.\n  What should that tell us? That should tell us that if we continue to \ntake strong steps, we can end this worldwide perception that our border \nis wide open, that anyone can come through our country legally or \nillegally and end that whole perception and shift toward that magic \ntipping point where people realize they are not going to be successful \ngetting in our country illegally, and they are not going to be able to \nget a job once they get here. We can do both of those.\n  The American people need to know, our Members of Congress need to \nknow, if we continue the course we are on and actually follow through \non the things we have discussed, we can create a lawful border. It is \nnot impossible. Don't have anyone say that is impossible. It is part of \nthe steps. To say we should not do border fencing because that is just \none step and that is not the whole thing is silly. If we have to take \n20 steps to get to the goal, why say it is worthless to take 2 of those \nsteps? Certainly we ought to take the steps we know we can do right \nnow.\n  The American people are a bit cynical about what we are doing. The \nleader asks, Why do we want to bring it up now? We are about to finish \nthe session, and we still haven't gotten it done. I don't want to go \nhome without having done some things to improve the legal system of our \nborder. I don't think most Members do. We have to get it done. We \nshould have already had it done. I agree with that.\n  I was sharing some thoughts before the minority leader, the \nDemocratic leader arrived, about what is in this bill, how it actually \nis effective and will actually work and will actually reduce the \nimmigration in our country from illegal sources by a significant \namount.\n  I was able to travel with Senator Specter, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, to South America recently. We were in a number of countries. \nWe saw a report on polling data in Nicaragua that said 60 percent of \nthe people of Nicaragua would come to the United States if they could. \nI mentioned that to the State Department personnel in Peru. They told \nme that 70 percent of the people in Peru would come to the United \nStates if they could, according to a recently published poll. This is a \nwonderful place. America is a great country. All over the world, \nmillions and millions and millions would like to come here. We cannot \naccept everyone that would like to come. I wish we could, but it is \njust not possible.\n  We need to set standards and appropriate behaviors to create a system \nthat is lawful, No. 1; also, a system that lets people come in on the \nbasis of merit and what is in the best interests of our country.\n  The House bill we are now considering has some important and valuable \nthings in it. It calls for interlocking surveillance camera systems \nthat must be installed by May of next year. They are going to keep \nwaiting. How much longer can this go on? We need Homeland Security to \nget moving. It says all of the fencing must be installed by May of \n2008. That is a good step. That says we are going to get serious and we \nare going to do something.\n  Laredo-Brownsville would be given until December of 2008. The bill \nprovides the Secretary of Homeland Security the flexibility to \nsubstitute fencing with other surveillance and barrier tools if the \ntopography of a specific area has an elevation or hillside of greater \nthan 10 percent.\n  I ask what the balance is on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 11 minutes remaining and \nthe minority side has 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the bill that is before us today \nrequires the Secretary, not later than 30 days after passage, to \nevaluate the authority of our Customs and Border Protection agents to \nstop vehicles that enter the United States illegally and that refuse to \nstop when ordered to stop. Compare that authority with the authority \ngiven to the Coast Guard to stop vessels on the high seas that don't \nstop\n\n[[Page S9743]]\n\nwhen they are ordered to stop, and to make an assessment about whether \nthe Border Patrol authority needs to be expanded. We have a real \nproblem with people just riding by and placing people at risk by not \nstopping. That situation needs to end.\n  We need to give our agents authority sufficient for their own \npersonal safety and the protection of the laws of this country.\n  The Secretary would be required to report his decision within 60 \ndays.\n  The bill further calls for a northern border study to assess the \nfeasibility of a state-of-the-art infrastructure security system. The \nreport will assess the necessity for such a system, the feasibility of \nimplementing a system, and the economic impact of the system.\n  We need to look at the northern border. We are not arresting 1 \nmillion people-plus a year on the northern border. It does not have \nanything like the impact of the movement of people illegally such as we \nhave on the southern border, but we need to watch that, too.\n  Fencing is proven. In San Diego, where they built a fence a number of \nyears ago, crime has fallen dramatically. According to the FBI Crime \nIndex, crime in San Diego County--the whole county--dropped 56 percent \nbetween 1989 and 2000. Can you imagine that? Just by ending the open \nborder that existed, vehicle drive-throughs where they do not stop--and \nthe reason they have fallen from between 6 and 10 a day before the \nconstruction of the fence, to only 4 drive-throughs in 2004, the whole \nyear.\n  This is a mockery of law when 6 to 10 people are just driving through \nthe border ignoring the Border Patrol officers who are there. What kind \nof mockery of law is that?\n  Fencing has reduced illegal entries in San Diego.\n  According to the numbers we have, apprehensions decreased from \n531,000 in 1993 to 111,000 in 2003. That is by four-fifths. That is \nonly one-fifth the number being arrested today as there were 10 years \nago as a direct result of serious enforcement bolstered by physical \nbarriers.\n  Fencing has also reduced drug traffic in San Diego. In 1993, \nauthorities apprehended over 58,000 pounds of marijuana coming across \nthe border. In 2003, only 36,000 pounds were apprehended. In addition, \ncocaine smuggling decreased from 1,200 pounds to 150 pounds.\n  I am glad to hear that the majority leader--and the Democratic \nleader--indicated he would move to have this bill come forward on the \nSenate floor. If there is some tweaking which needs to be done, that \nwill give us an opportunity to do that.\n  I think the bill is fundamentally sound in all respects. I urge my \ncolleagues to look at it. I think they will feel comfortable that it is \nconsistent with their previous votes in this body for a fencing \nmeasure.\n  But the Members of our body need to understand that our first vote on \nfencing, which we authorized on the immigration bill, is not going to \nbe effective because that bill is not going to pass. It was an \namendment to that bill. If we are going to do anything before we leave \nthis year--and the American people should be watching us carefully--\nthis is what we need to do. We have an opportunity now to stand up and \nmake real what we have talked about and what we voted for. If we don't \ndo it, we will not make that reality come into effect, and we will not \nbe faithful to the promises we made to our constituents. And, once \nagain, we will see this kind of cynicism and disrespect for Congress \nbecause of our inconsistency in what we say and what we do.\n  Too often I have observed in this body when we come up with an idea \nabout immigration that does not work, it will pass. If you come up with \nsomething that actually does work, for some reason or another, even if \nit is voted and passed in one body or other, it never seems to really \nbecome law. This time we need to make our legal system work.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am convinced that physical barriers at \nour borders--fencing in particular--are an important and central cost-\neffective solution to border security.\n  My colleague, the Democratic leader, has used a figure of $7 billion. \nWe think that is greatly exaggerated. We believe it can be done for \nmuch less than that, although that money has been floated. A private \ncontractor has indicated he could do it for about $1.8 billion, and \nthat is the money we put into the bill. And with the help of the \nNational Guard, I think we ought to be able to build fencing at a rate \nfar less than that.\n  I note that this is a one-time expenditure. This expenditure is going \nto reduce the 1 million apprehensions a year dramatically. A barrier \nlike this will enhance the ability of each and every single Border \nPatrol officer to do his or her job. It will enable them to be far more \neffective. It is going to enable us to not have to hire nearly as many \npeople. It will send a signal to the world that our border is not open. \nThat means we will need fewer bed spaces.\n  We are going to be moving toward reaching that tipping point where \nthe border is perceived as being closed, where the legal system is \nbeing honored in America again, and where we can make a difference in \nthis whole system. Manpower alone cannot work.\n  Are they going to have to stand every 500 yards on the border and try \nto catch people? When you apprehend somebody, you have to pay to take \nthem to a facility and then take them back across the border; or if \nthere is some distant country, pay for a plane ticket and send them \nback home and put them in a detention place until that occurs. We think \nwe need a catch-and-release program. But even if we do this, it is \nstill very costly.\n  A fence is going to save us billions of dollars over the years. It is \ngoing to allow us to be effective, with fewer Border Patrol agents. It \nis going to help us reach that tipping point where we will need far \nfewer bed spaces and far fewer planes to charter to take people back \nhome. We will have far fewer efforts to move people back across the \nborder, at a great savings to this country. This is a cost-savings \nbill. It is a statement bill, I submit. When you count the costs of \nsalaries and the time and insurance for our Border Patrol, the risk at \nwhich they are placed, a fence is going to be a tremendous asset to \nthem. We will have a roadway so they can move down in their vehicles \nalong the border to pick up people who have entered. The word is going \nto get out that it is not easy to do that anymore.\n\n  There are a lot of other things we need to do. We need to clarify the \ncurrent law as it exists.\n  Along with my staff person, Cindy Hayden, a lawyer on the Judiciary \nCommittee, my chief counsel, we wrote a Law Review article for the \nStanford Law Review. We talked about the authority of the local law \nenforcement officers. They have authority in most instances, but it is \nblurred and confused, and as a result most State and local law \nenforcement officers are afraid to do anything. We need legislation \nthat will fix that. We need the workplace enforcement.\n  All of these are steps that need to be taken so that people can't \ncome into the workplace fraudulently and get a job as they are today. \nThose things can be done, but a critical part of this entire process is \nsecuring the border first. The American people expect us to do that.\n  This legislation gives us that capacity. We can make that difference, \nand the result will be that we are going to see further improvements in \nthe number of apprehensions.\n  Then, next year we need a good dialog. As Senator Harry Reid said, we \nneed to take Professor Borjas's book, ``Heaven's Door,'' and take other \ntestimony that we have seen and reviewed and build on that and develop \na comprehensive program that we can be proud of, that will allow \ntalented immigrants to come here, people whom we know scientifically \nfrom studies and analyses will be successful in America, who will pay \nmore in taxes than they take out. And the numbers are really scary.\n  Large numbers of people coming in today are high school dropouts, do \nnot have a high school diploma. According to the National Academy of \nSciences, a person coming into our country without a high school \ndiploma, over a lifetime, will cost the U.S. Treasury almost $90,000. \nThink about that. They\n\n[[Page S9744]]\n\nwill have a low-wage job. They will not be paying income tax. They will \nbe receiving other benefits. That does not include extra schools and \nhighways that will have to be built. It only includes what they will be \ngetting in terms of earned-income tax credit or Food Stamps and other \nbenefits such as medical and the like.\n  We are moving now. The American people's voices are beginning to be \nheard. But I think we are going to have to study this issue. If the \nAmerican people will stay in tune, if they will insist on the highest \nand best values, including law and decency and generosity and a \npositive view of immigration, we will have all those values at play in \nour decisionmaking process. We can come up with legislation next year \nthat actually could do more good than most people realize.\n  I can't tell you how exited I am about it. But it is absolutely \nessential that we take steps today to gain credit with the American \npeople; to have them understand that we are listening, that we are \ngoing to make the legal system work. And then we can enter into a \ndialog with them next year to develop, as Professor Borjas's book says, \npolicies that serve the legitimate interests of our Nation.\n  Why shouldn't we do that? Other countries are doing that. Are we \nsaying that Canada is not an advanced and humane nation? Are we saying \nthat the policies that New Zealand adopted are not humane and decent \nand effective? Look at it. We will find that they are. In fact, they \nallow quite a number of people to come into their country every year, \nbut they try to allow those to come who have the best chance of being \nthe most successful.\n  It has exciting possibilities for us. It is important that the \nmisguided legislation that has come through this Senate has now ground \nto a halt, that the House has flatly rejected it, and that we in our \nown body are reevaluating it--I think rightly--and we will be at a \npoint where we can start over, start afresh and develop a comprehensive \nplan.\n  Let's get credibility with the American people.\n  Let's make this border a lawful border again, and we will see a \nreduction in crime. We will see increasing economic and commercial \ndevelopment in the areas where enforcement becomes a reality. We can \ntell the world that you have an opportunity to come to our country, but \nyou are going to have to meet standards. You will have to apply, and \nyou will be objectively and fairly evaluated. And if you meet those \ncriteria, you will rise up in the list. If you do not, you may not be \nable to get in. We are sorry, because everybody cannot come in here. We \nwish it were different, but it is just so. We cannot accept more and \nmore and more. We have to decide what the right number is, what skills \nand assets they bring that we want for our country, and make a \nselection process on that basis. It is really exciting, that \npossibility.\n  In our situation today--I say to my colleagues, I would like to share \nthis one thought with you--and I am sure the report that Senator Reid \nmentioned probably has some discussion of it because it is a defining \nevent--only 20 percent of the green cards--that is the card that gives \none permanent residence in the United States--only 20 percent of those \nare given out based on the skills of the applicant. Think about that. \nHow can that be in our national interest? The experts we have heard say \nit is not in our national interest. Canada and other nations have \nanalyzed this. They have decided that is not where they want to go. So \nthey are trying to get to 60, to 70 percent based on skills.\n  Yes, we will always have those subject to persecution around the \nworld, humanitarian cases, who we will allow in our country. But the \nnumber and the way we are doing it now is not a sensible way to \nproceed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I notice that none of my colleagues are \nhere. Senator Reid, I am pleased to say, indicates he will be \nsupporting moving forward to the bill and cloture. I will take time, as \nwe are heading up to the hour to vote, to share a few additional \nthoughts.\n  The only way we are going to get an authorization of the fencing is \nto pass this amendment. The authorization for border barriers I offered \nas an amendment, which was adopted as part of the comprehensive so-\ncalled immigration bill, will not become law because that bill will not \nbecome law. This is the way we have now to do it.\n  The House has passed a bill that is thoughtful, that makes sure we \nare not playing a shell game with the American voters but that we \nactually create a mechanism to ensure that the fencing gets built on a \ntimetable. It includes a number of other things, such as technology and \nsensors and the like.\n  The second aspect of the legislation is very, very important. We \nvoted in this body 93 to 3--and the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader both made reference to it--to fund it at $1.8 billion. That was \na commitment we made. We said we were for that. This budget that we \npassed has $20 billion set aside for emergency funding as part of our \nbudgetary expectations for this year. How much of that will go to \nhomeland security? We have to be careful to watch. And even though we \nauthorized these barriers at the border, which are going to make a \nhuge, huge difference in reducing illegal entry into America--it is \ngoing to be so positive--but if we do not fund it so we can actually \nbuild it, it cannot be built. That requires an appropriations.\n  So I am getting worried about that. I am hearing some things--that \nthe $1.8 billion we passed with such an overwhelming vote may not be \nfunded. So isn't that the shell game we are talking about now? Isn't \nthat the deal? We thought we had done it on the Defense bill. It would \nbe built through the National Guard who is already on the border. And \nthe money would go to them to supervise, to contract out, or utilize \ntheir own personnel to construct this fencing.\n  That is what we thought we had done. But as often happens around \nhere, subtle things happen. You think you have something in your hand \nand like a will-o'-the-wisp it just disappears. I hate to use the words \n``shell game'' because it is not always planned out that way, but the \neffect can be the same. First you think you have it, and then it \ndisappears. You think it is under that shell, you think you have it, \nand it is not there.\n  So I am going to have to tell our leadership on both sides of the \naisle I am pleased to see we have a commitment to building the fences. \nWe voted twice now, and the House has overwhelmingly voted for this. \nBut we need to make sure we don't play a shell game where we don't have \nthe money at the end to build it because somebody wants to spend it on \na pet project they have.\n  This is a matter of national interest. It is a matter of national \nsecurity. It is a matter we cannot fumble the ball on. It is a matter \nwe are committed to by our previous votes. So let's make sure we do it. \nAnd setting priorities is what we do. That is what we are paid to do. \nWe cannot do everything. So we will have a bit of a test as the session \nwinds down to see if the appropriations process--the actual \nappropriating of the money to do the things that are needed to be \ndone--is carried out and the funding is there and the barriers are \nbuilt.\n  Again, I repeat, this would be a one-time expenditure. I believe the \nnumbers we are hearing are too high. We felt like $1.7 billion, $1.8 \nbillion would do the 370 miles of fencing, including 500 miles of \nvehicle barriers. There is enough money to fund that. But if we are \ngoing to have to have that, we can't have no funding, a third of the \nfunding, or a half of the funding or we are not going to be able to do \nthis job. And if it turns out we are wrong and the cost is higher than \nwe expected, we are not going to come close to doing what we are \ntelling the American people we intend to do. So we will have to watch \nthat.\n\n  I will just share, in conclusion, my thoughts about the nature of the \nAmerican Republic of which we are a part. It is a good and decent \nnation. We have a positive view of immigration. We have been a nation \nof immigrants from our founding. We believe in immigration. But we are \nalso a nation of laws.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years, and it breaks my heart to \nsee the Federal United States law be made a mockery along the border of \nour country, that without fencing people are driving by, and not even \nstopping when the Border Patrol attempts to detain them.\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\n  We had a hearing yesterday on crime in America. We had the Director \nof the Bureau of Prisons. He told us that in the Federal prison \npenitentiaries 27 percent of the people detained are not American \ncitizens. Can you imagine that--27 percent?\n  Now, I am absolutely convinced that overwhelmingly the people who \ncome to our country are law-abiding; even if they come to our country \nillegally, they are law-abiding, other than their entry. But I have to \ntell you, if I were in big trouble somewhere in some foreign country, \nand they were trying to arrest me in my hometown, and the chief of \npolice knows my name, and I am facing a big, serious crime, why would I \nnot want to scoot across the border and go to the United States where \nnobody would know me?\n  I think we are picking up an excessive number of people who may even \nbe fleeing prosecution in their towns or people who have come here to \nset up drug distribution networks and things of that nature. So somehow \nwe are picking up a larger number of the criminal element than we ever \nhave. When I asked Mr. Lappin about the prison system and the fact that \nhe said 27 percent of the people in the Federal penitentiaries are \nnoncitizens, I asked him: Does that include those we detain at the \nborder who are being held waiting to be deported? He said, No, it does \nnot even include those.\n  So this Nation, in our own interest, has every right--indeed, we have \na duty to our people--to make sure our borders are not wide open, \nterrorists do not come here, drug dealers do not come here, people in \ntrouble for sexual offenses and child pornography and those kinds of \nthings, and child abuse, who flee their own countries, do not run \nacross the border to safety in the United States, where they are never \napprehended and live here.\n  So this is all part of it. If we are coming through with the right \nfunding, we will be successful in taking the historic step to creating \na lawfulness in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words before we move \nto the cloture vote on H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. \nColleagues, the purpose of the fence is to prevent illegal pedestrian \nand vehicular traffic crossing the international border of the United \nStates with Mexico.\n  This bill does four main things. First, it authorizes over 700 miles \nof two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border with \nprioritized placement at critical, highly populated areas. Second, the \nlegislation mandates that the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nachieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through \na ``virtual fence'' that deploys cameras, ground sensors, unmanned \naerial vehicles, UAVs, and integrated surveillance technology. Third, \nit requires DHS to provide all necessary authority to border personnel \nto disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority held by the U.S. \nCoast Guard for maritime vessels. Finally, the bill requires DHS to \nassess the vulnerability of the northern border.\n  Some of my colleagues ask why we need these additional border control \ntools. When combined with high-tech detection devices, a secure fence \nshould make attempts to cross our border more time-consuming so that \nthe Border Patrol has time to respond and catch those trying to breach \nthe border. Having a state-of-the-art border security fence system \nshould ensure that it cannot be easily compromised. The business of \napprehension is manpower-intensive, slow, and legally complex. If we \nonly build a ``virtual fence'' without additional physical barriers, we \nwill spend millions on technology that is subject to ordinary downtime \nand then spend even more money to chase down, apprehend, process, and \ndeport the illegal border-crossers.\n  I believe instead we should add these tools to the toolbox of the \nBorder Patrol, as requested by DHS. An increased manpower alone \napproach would have the Border Patrol remain vulnerable to decoys and \nother tactics designed to draw our border agents into one area so that \nanother area is left exposed. This fencing will help border control \nefforts and will not be an inhibitor to legitimate entry to this \ncountry.\n  More importantly, we know that fencing works. With the establishment \nof the San Diego border fence, crime rates in San Diego have fallen off \ndramatically. According to the FBI Crime Index, crime in San Diego \nCounty dropped 56.3 percent between 1989 to 2000. Vehicle drive-\nthroughs in the region have fallen from between 6 to 10 per day before \nthe fence to only 4 drive-throughs in 2004, and those occurred only \nwhere the secondary fence was not complete. According to numbers \nprovided by the San Diego Sector Border Patrol in February 2004, \napprehension decreased from 531,689 in 1993 to 111,515 in 2003.\n  The Senate should take up and pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and \ngive the Border Patrol all of the tools it needs to do its job. The \nSenate should send a clear message that we need this fence and we need \nit now. Let's send this bill to the President before we leave at the \nend of the month.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to again voice my strong \nsupport for securing our Nation's borders, which remain porous. We must \nimmediately address this threat to our national security.\n  I have consistently supported and voted in favor of border security \nefforts such as the installation of reinforced fencing in strategic \nareas where high trafficking of narcotics, unlawful border crossings, \nand other criminal activity exists. I have also supported installing \nphysical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors where \nnecessary.\n  However, I object to the Congress making decisions about the location \nof border fencing. These decisions should be made by State and local \nlaw enforcement officials working with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, not dictated by Congress. The border States have borne a \nheavy financial burden from illegal immigration; their local officials \nare on the front lines. They should be part of the solution.\n  Ours is a nation of laws and we must be a nation of secure borders. I \nstand resolved to work with my colleagues to enact meaningful \nlegislation in this session of Congress that addresses border security \nfirst and enacts comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will \nreport the pending motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 615, H.R. 6061, a bill to establish \n     operational control over the international land and maritime \n     borders of the United States.\n         Bill Frist, Ted Stevens, Robert Bennett, Lisa Murkowski, \n           Mike Enzi, Pat Roberts, Jeff Sessions, Orrin Hatch, \n           Wayne Allard, Thad Cochran, James Inhofe, Trent Lott, \n           John Ensign, Jon Kyl, Tom Coburn, Mitch McConnell, John \n           Cornyn.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum has \nbeen waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to claim my 1 \nhour at this point and ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               job losses\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the most \npressing issue that I believe families feel across this country and \ncertainly in my home State of Michigan, and that relates to the squeeze \nthat families are feeling on all sides today. It starts with the issue \nof jobs. We see that almost 3 million jobs have been lost in the \nmanufacturing sector in the last 6 years--almost 3 million jobs. When \nwe look at this chart, under this administration we see that we have \nthe slowest job growth of any administration in over 70 years. We have \nto go back to Herbert Hoover to see the kind of job loss that we are \nnow seeing--the slowest job growth in over 70 years.\n  In my home State of Michigan it is even worse than that, because what \nwe are seeing is the impact of a lack of a 21st century manufacturing \nstrategy on those in my State who have been the global leaders--who are \nthe global leaders--in manufacturing. Almost 3 million jobs have been \nlost in manufacturing alone, and 260,000 of those jobs have been in \nmanufacturing in Michigan.\n  Now, to add insult to injury, we see expenses going up on all sides \nfor families. They are losing good-paying jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question \nabout the previous chart?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. I yield to my dear friend who is the \nranking member on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, this figure here \nreflects the amount of annual growth rate of employment under the Bush \nadministration.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. At four-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We should compare that with the job growth that has \ntaken place in all of these previous administrations. This is the \nsmallest amount until we get back to Herbert Hoover, is that correct?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. Prior to the Great Depression.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Right. It is a matter of very great concern. This chart \nis a dramatic demonstration that this so-called economic recovery has \nnot really produced jobs, which, after all, is one of the main purposes \nthat we seek in terms of the workings of the economy.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. In my home State of Michigan, because we \nare the global leaders in manufacturing, and I know in my good friend's \nhome State of Maryland it is the same way, in terms of manufacturing, \nthat number is even worse because of the lack of effectiveness in \nenforcing trade-offs, because of our inability to address health care \nand being able to change the way we fund health care, because of the \nlack of investment in education and innovation. That number does not \nreflect the fact of the impact of the loss of good-paying jobs, the \nkind of jobs that have built the middle class of this country.\n  Frankly, I am very proud to represent a State that has been at the \nforefront in the auto industry, with an industry that has created the \nmiddle class in this country--middle class jobs, not only in autos, in \nfurniture production, in other manufacturing.\n  The reality is that we have lost almost 3 million jobs that created \nthe middle class of this country. Even though there has been just a \ntiny little bit of an increase here over all, we see it is the lowest, \nslowest job growth of any administration. We have to go way back to \nHerbert Hoover to find an administration that has a worse jobs record \nthan this particular President.\n  I have to say it is particularly insulting to those of us in Michigan \nwho, given this record and the fact that we have almost 3 million jobs \nthat have been lost, and 260,000 manufacturing jobs in Michigan alone, \nthat when the President of the United States came to Michigan a couple \nof weeks ago to do political fundraising, he didn't have 30 minutes to \nmeet with the auto industry. He didn't have 15 minutes to meet with the \nexecutives of the largest employers in the country. In fact, he has \npostponed or canceled I believe three different meetings with them and \nnow says he is prepared to meet with them after the election.\n\n  This isn't about elections. This isn't about politics. This is about \na fight for a way of life. This is a fight for a way of life in this \ncountry. While he is waiting until after the elections to meet with the \nauto industry and to begin to engage to do something about these \nnumbers, we have folks who are facing layoffs today. We have headlines. \nWe have Ford Motor Company and their latest headlines. We have \nstruggles going on throughout the industry. Every day, somebody in \nMichigan gets up in the morning and worries about whether or not they \nare going to have a job, worries about whether or not they are going to \nbe able to afford to send their kids to college, whether or not their \nhealth care is going to still be there, and whether or not they are \ngoing to be able to pay for it.\n  To add insult to injury, too many people who have worked all their \nlives and who have paid into a pension are now finding themselves in a \nsituation where that pension won't be there. I think that is the \nultimate outrage. In the United States of America, I never thought I \nwould have to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say somebody \nmay be in a situation to lose a pension they have paid for their whole \nlives. We addressed this issue on a bipartisan basis, and I am very \nproud we put in place efforts that are going to save many of those \npensions because of the work that we did a few weeks ago. But too many \npeople still find themselves on the line as a result of that, and that \nshould not be an issue. Bankruptcy or no bankruptcy, in this country \nyou ought to get your pension, period.\n  So we have a situation where more and more families are on the edge, \nmore and more families who believe in America, who believe in playing \nby the rules, who get up every day and work hard at one job, two jobs, \nthree jobs, and still find themselves falling more and more behind.\n  On top of the job situation that they are concerned about, they are \nbeing squeezed on all sides by all of the other costs that relate to \ntheir families. We see, for instance, a 44 percent increase in the cost \nof college tuition, room, and board--a 44 percent increase. So here we \nare, we are in a transition. We hear that the economy is changing. We \nneed to be investing in education. We need to be investing in \nopportunity for the future, and in innovation and, at the same time, we \nsee the costs going up, and the exact opposite policies are being put \nin place in terms of cutting opportunity for people.\n  We all want our children to have a better opportunity than we have \nhad. I am very fortunate to have two children who have worked their way \nthrough school and a wonderful stepdaughter who just graduated. I \nunderstand about\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\nstudent loans and what that means. I know the costs have gone up, \nbecause we have watched them go up over the last several years. There \nis no question that families are feeling more and more squeezed as it \nrelates to creating opportunity for their children to be successful, \nand that makes no sense in this country. That makes no sense at this \ntime when we could be doing something about it.\n  Health insurance premiums have gone up 71 percent. Seventy-one \npercent under the Bush policies and this administration--71 percent. \nNow, this is an issue for us in Michigan with not only families and \nindividuals who are struggling to be able to pay for what I believe \nshould be a right in this country, not a privilege, which is health \ncare, but we know what it is doing to our businesses as well. We know \nthat in a global economy, we are the only industrialized country that \npays for health care the way we pay for it. So we add to the burdens on \nour manufacturers, our small businesses, and others by having health \ncare predominantly on the backs of business\n  To make it even worse, we end up, because of our system, because of \nthe craziness of our health care system, paying twice as much of our \nGDP for health care as any other country, but we have 46 million people \nwith no health insurance. What is wrong with this picture? The United \nStates of America has the highest infant mortality rate. Shame on us. \nWe can do better than that. All this takes is a matter of political \nwill, to make the changes that are necessary so no family has to go to \nbed at night praying that the kids are not going to get sick; no small \nbusiness has to worry about whether they are going to be able to find \nhealth care for themselves and their employees; and no manufacturer \nshould have to worry about whether they are going to be able to compete \ninternationally and still provide health care for their workers.\n  Health care costs have gone up 71 percent. To add insult to injury, \ngasoline prices experienced a 104-percent increase. They are coming \ndown now. They are coming down a little bit before the election. We \nknow what will happen after the election. And we also know what has \nhappened to people trying to go to work, trying to take the kids to \nschool.\n  In my home State, in Michigan, where we have a very robust tourism \nseason, we want everybody to be able to go to the cottage up north, \ntake the boat out, and enjoy the wonderful Great Lakes or go fishing on \nthe inland lakes and rivers. This is a major economic factor for us, \ngas prices. What happens to individuals who have to take more money out \nof their pockets just to be able to get to work? Maybe this summer they \ndidn't take that trip they normally take, which means our small \nbusinesses up north were hurt. It means economically we are not seeing \nthe robust investment in tourism that normally we have seen in \nMichigan.\n  Families are being squeezed on all sides. This is just a fraction of \nthe cost we have seen going up. What has been the response of this \nadministration? What has been the response of the Republicans in \nCongress? Unfortunately, the response has been, first of all, to block \nour efforts to ban price gouging. As part of the Energy bill that \npassed a year ago, an amendment of mine was agreed to that required the \nFederal Trade Commission to do a complete investigation of price \ngouging. It took them way too long, but they finally came back and \nindicated that on the surface of it, they didn't think it was happening \nand they really didn't have the tools. We had not defined price gouging \nso that they could really be serious about that. The administration \nbasically took a pass on whether there is price gouging. So we \nintroduced legislation to define it. That has not been able to move \nbecause there has been no support to do that.\n  Health care costs? We could go on and on in all of the areas in \nwhich, instead of coming together and doing what we can do, efforts \nhave been blocked. Here are some of the basics, starting with the \nMedicare prescription drug program. Instead of having a plan that works \nfor seniors and the disabled, a plan was written that was great for the \ndrug industry. Included in that was the outrageous provision that we \nare not allowed--Medicare is not allowed to negotiate group discounts. \nCan you imagine that anywhere else? Anybody knows bulk purchasing is \ncheaper, negotiating group prices is cheaper. Yet, in the area of \nMedicare, in behalf of the industry, that is prohibited.\n  What is the result of that? First of all, we have a Medicare plan, \nessentially, that is privatizing Part D, requiring those to go through \nprivate insurance rather than directly through Medicare. There is just \na great big hole. Some folks have called it a doughnut hole, this gap \nin coverage, because there is not enough money to pay for complete \ncoverage because they can't negotiate group prices. All the money is \ngoing to the industry rather than going to make sure there is \ncomprehensive coverage.\n  There is a better way to do that. I am introducing legislation that \nwould allow us to go directly to Part D. Any senior, any person with \ndisabilities, could go directly to Medicare, sign up under Part D under \nthe normal copays and premiums, go to their local pharmacy, they \nnegotiate prices, we eliminate the gap in coverage, and folks would get \nwhat they need without all of the confusion and complexity. But that \nhas stalled. We have not been able to move that forward because of the \nadministration and those in control.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it the case that the VA, in providing health care \nfor veterans, can use its bargaining position with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies to get lower drug prices and therefore is in a better \nposition to provide more extensive coverage for the veterans as a \nconsequence? But on the Medicare for our seniors--I remember the \nSenator opposing that provision so strongly here on the floor--it is \nprohibited that Medicare enter into this bargaining with the \npharmaceutical companies, bulk purchasing, in order to get lower prices \non the drugs?\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have the model. \nIt is the VA. They have done it very well. They have been able to get a \nbetter deal, anywhere from a 35-percent to a 40-percent lower price \nbecause they negotiate prices. I don't know anywhere else in the \nFederal Government where we are not trying to get the best price, where \nwe are not trying to negotiate, except in the area of prescription \ndrugs, except in the area of lifesaving medicine where somebody may \nneed it or they may not be able to live or may not be able to treat \ntheir symptoms for high blood pressure or diabetes or get their heart \nmedicine or get their cancer medicine--except in the area that is \nlifesaving.\n  Even with the VA, which does a marvelous job in negotiating prices, \nwe are able to do that in every area except Medicare--Medicare, the \nhealth care system for older Americans and the disabled. It is the only \nplace where the decision was made to go with the drug companies rather \nthan to go with the people who are on Medicare.\n  There are so many areas in health care costs we should be \naddressing--health IT, bringing down the cost of prescription drugs \nwith the use of generic drugs, addressing the issue of health care \ncosts. Senator Durbin and Senator Lincoln have a very important \nproposal that would allow small businesses to pool together nationally \nand to be able to have a pool--whether it is Blue Cross, whether it is \nother private insurance, whether it is HMOs--be able to pool together \nto get the best price. That came to the floor and was voted down.\n  I have legislation that would provide a catastrophic tax credit for \nour manufacturers. We know about 1 percent of employees in a business \nwill be seriously ill during the year, but it is 20 to 25 percent of \nthe cost of the health care paid during that year. We could take a \nmajor step forward if we provided a tax credit for catastrophic costs \nto help our manufacturers and our businesses.\n  This is not rocket science. It is about having the political will and \nthe right values and the right priorities. This has not happened here, \nand every day people continue to struggle with their health care. Too \nmany people end up in emergency rooms where we pay twice as much \nbecause they are sicker than they should be and they are not getting \nthe care at the time they should be getting it. They get treated. The \nhospital, of course, does the treatment, as it should. Then the costs \nroll over onto everybody with insurance. That is why\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\nwe pay so much for health care, and we in the Senate should be focusing \non this as a No. 1 priority.\n  I mentioned college tuition before. Right when we need to be focusing \non more opportunity for people in a changing economy--we all talk about \neducation all the time--what happens here? Right before Christmas, we \nhad the largest cut in student loans in the history of the country, $12 \nbillion. For everybody who had to refinance their loan by July 1 and \nsaw their interest rate go up, it was as a result of that.\n  Then, on top of that, we see the President proposed the largest cut \nin education for next year, the largest ever proposed since the \nDepartment of Education was established. Who would believe that at this \ntime, in a global economy, that we ought to be proposing and passing \nthe largest cuts ever suggested for education? These are the wrong \npriorities and the wrong direction.\n  And then, certainly, time and time again, we have tried to pass a \nminimum wage bill that truly raises the minimum wage for everyone. It \nis something that makes sense. It is something where workers in every \nState will find that their minimum wage will be raised.\n  Let me just say that I see our distinguished colleague here, Senator \nReed, who has played such a distinguished role on economic issues, and \nI will yield to him to speak in just a moment, but when you look at the \nnumbers and you look at what is happening to families across this \ncountry, we need a new direction. We need a new direction. We need to \ncreate a new set of priorities based on a different set of values that \nput Americans first--American businesses and American workers.\n  What I see happening in this country is a willingness by the \nPresident and those in charge of Congress to accept a race to the \nbottom in a global economy. Too many workers in my State have been \ntold: If you only work for less, pay more in health care, and lose your \npension, we can be successful. That is a lose-lose strategy. First of \nall, there is always going to be somebody in another country who can \nwork for less.\n  I don't want to win that race. Nobody in Michigan is interested in \nwinning a race to the bottom. What we understand is that we need to do \nwhat America does best, which is make this a race to the top. In order \nto make it a race to the top, we have to have a level playing field on \ntrade. We can compete with anybody if the rules are fair, if it is a \nlevel playing field. We have to change the way we fund health care and \naddress health care costs for businesses and families. We have to \nchange. We have to start passing legislation that addresses health care \nin a positive way, to truly bring down costs, not just shift them \naround but bring down costs in a real way and make health care \navailable and affordable and support businesses and families.\n  We have to continue to say we are going to protect pensions. We did \nmake a step forward in that area, and I am proud that we did that \ntogether.\n  Then we have to race like crazy on education and innovation. That is \nwhat we do in America. Let's race up. Let's make every other country \nrace to keep up with us. Let's be the ones who are continuing to invest \nin education, in opportunity for every child, in opportunities for \neverybody to be able to go to college and focus on areas of math and \nscience and technology and engineering and all of those things we need \nto do to make it a race up, areas of health research, creating new \nopportunities and new discoveries. That is what we do in America. That \nis what we have always done in America. But we have seen in the last 6 \nyears a willingness to put that all aside for other priorities, put \nthat all aside and make this a race to the bottom. That is not good \nenough.\n  We believe in a race to the top, and we know that is going to take a \nnew direction. It is going to take a different set of priorities. It is \ngoing to take a different set of values to do that. But in a global \neconomy, if we are going to keep our middle class, we have to do that.\n  We are in a fight for our way of life in this country. It is not \ngoing to do any good if a few people have a lot of money if the average \nperson has no money in their pocket to be able to buy that house, that \ncar, send the kids to college, get the boat, and be able to enjoy the \nbeautiful lakes in Michigan, be able to buy their medication. It is not \ngoing to matter if everybody is being asked to race to the bottom.\n  So I am hopeful--in fact, insistent--that we turn things around. \nAmerica can do better. We need a new direction. We need a race to the \ntop. We can do this. It just takes people who get it, people who get it \nto be in charge with the right values and the right priorities, and \nAmericans are expecting that to happen. In fact, they are tired of \nwaiting for it to happen. And so am I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am very pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, and my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to talk about the \nreality that is confronting the American family across the country. \nThat reality is, they are being squeezed, and they are feeling every \nday increased pressure from an economy that is not resulting in higher \nwages and income but is demonstrating increased costs to every family \nin the country. Between flat, stagnant incomes and increasing costs, \nthey are seeing their dreams shredded.\n  It is our obligation, our duty to respond. This administration has \nnot responded. The President tries to paint a rosy picture of the \neconomy, but the American people know better because every day they see \nthe high gasoline prices, and increased costs of education. They look \nat their paychecks and see no significant increases. And they wonder, \nreally, for the first time in my lifetime, whether their children will \nhave a better life than they enjoyed.\n  It was taken as an article of faith in America when I was growing up \nin the 1950s and 1960s that your children would do better than you did. \nThey are probably going to college, if you hadn't gone to college. If \nyou were fortunate to be a college-educated person, they certainly \nwould go to college and maybe on to professional school beyond. They \nwould be able to enjoy a home in a good community. They would be able \nto use their talents and their energies to provide for their families \nand to build a strong America. But, again, for the first time in \ngenerations, many, many people are wondering whether their children \nwill be able to afford what they did, and be able to accomplish what \nthey have done. Can they afford a home in the same community they grew \nup in? In many cases, that is not true in America today. Will they have \na pension that they can depend on when they get older 40 or 50 years \nfrom now? Will they have the ability to send themselves to school, to \neducate themselves, not just through college but throughout their \nlifetime?\n  This is not something that is just the impersonal effect of the world \neconomy and globalization. This is something that Government has a duty \nto respond to, and this administration has not responded to it.\n  The facts are very clear. After adjusting for inflation, the income \nof the typical family is lower than it was when President Bush took \noffice. The typical family has fallen behind in the last 6 years. The \neconomy has gone through the most protracted job slump since the Great \nDepression. Even though job creation has turned positive, the pace of \njob creation has been modest and real wages are not growing.\n  The administration likes to point to statistics that show an increase \nin average income or compensation. But it seems pretty clear that these \naverages reflect gains by highly compensated individuals who receive \nbonuses, who exercise stock options, while ordinary workers see their \nwages falling behind with rising living costs.\n  When you talk about an average, if you have a lot of poor people and \nyou have several highly compensated individuals, that average moves up. \nThat is what the President is talking about.\n  What we should be looking at is, how do we help those low-income \nAmericans see more in their paychecks? How do we help them protect \nagainst rising prices in so many critical areas?\n  This first chart demonstrates what has happened between 2000 and \n2004. This is the median inflation-adjusted household income. This is \nthe centerpoint of households in the U.S., 50 percent below, 50 percent \nabove. So\n\n[[Page S9749]]\n\nit takes away the distorting effect of a few, a handful of terribly \nwealthy households in the country. This is the most accurate view of \nwhat has been happening. You can see in 2004, the median income was \n$47,399; in 2005, in inflation-adjusted terms, $46,326, a fall of \n$1,273. Median household incomes fell. That is not the sign of a good \neconomy. In fact, that is the sign of a failing economy.\n  This is accompanied by another phenomenon. The second phenomenon is \nthat prices are increasing. In fact, they are rising dramatically in \ncritical areas.\n  This is a chart that shows the middle-class squeeze under the Bush \nadministration. College tuition, room and board, up 44 percent; \nhouseholds have $1,300 less at the median; their expenses for college \nare going up 44 percent. Health insurance premiums, if you can afford \nthem or you have access to health insurance at all, because there is a \ngrowing number of Americans who can't buy health insurance; those \npremiums are going up 71 percent.\n  Gasoline prices, up by 104 percent. Even in the last few weeks of \nlower prices, they are still extraordinarily high given the prices in \n2000.\n  What you have seen is a situation--this is just arithmetic--income \ngoes down, costs go up, families are squeezed. They have to put on hold \na lot of their dreams and hopes for the future--for college, in some \ncases. They have to worry about whether they will be destroyed \nfinancially by a health care crisis at home because they cannot afford \nhealth care coverage.\n\n  Certainly we are all seeing throughout the economy how expensive it \nis just to get around because of the price of gasoline. For upper \nincome Americans, the people who are certainly above the median income, \nthis is a problem. For the vast majority of Americans, low-income \nAmericans, the extra $10 or $15 per fillup means they cannot take the \nkids out for even a modest meal. They can't do things that they took \nfor granted. They certainly cannot save.\n  One of the other phenomenons we have seen is virtually a zero savings \nrate for households in the country. They are not getting ahead.\n  I can recall--I think we all can recall as children--when parents \ntalked about trying to get ahead, trying to get a little bit ahead, \nsomething that will give them not only some financial security but \npeace of mind. For some families in the last 6 years they are not only \nnot getting ahead but they are falling behind. It is not predestined; \nit is not inevitable. It is because of the policies of this \nadministration.\n  One of other startling aspects of the Bush administration is that \nemployment has not grown. This is a chart showing the growth of nonfarm \nemployment throughout administrations in the country going back to \nHerbert Hoover. The Bush administration has the worst nonfarm \nemployment growth of any administration since Herbert Hoover. That is \nnot a comparison anyone would like to entertain.\n  We have seen it go up and down through administrations, but this is \nthe worst. Under the Clinton administration, there was a 2.4 percent \nper year growth in nonfarm employment. That has been reversing.\n  This is a situation where people are looking around, again despite \nall the happy talk of the administration, people just have to look \naround. The jobs are going away and they are not coming back. Pick up \nthe paper. About every day you see a big American company announcing \n20,000 jobs being let go, changes, restructuring, et cetera. That \ncauses people great concern.\n  Again, we have to do something, and nothing of consequence is being \ndone by this administration. It is the worst job record since Herbert \nHoover.\n  That is a damning epitaph for the economic policies of this \nadministration.\n  Coupled with the anemic job growth has been a similar anemic growth \nin earnings. Here again is a comparison. Between 1995 and 2000, under \nthe Clinton administration, and between 2000 and 2005 under the Bush \nadministration. What you see in the Clinton administration is a strong \ngrowth in earnings, weekly earnings, for every category of worker, from \nthe lowest to the highest.\n  In fact, I should point out that the highest-income Americans did \nmuch better under the Clinton administration than they are doing under \nthis administration. But what is startling is that this picket fence of \nthe Clinton administration of growth in every income level, strong \npositive growth, is not the case in the Bush administration. In fact, \nin the lowest 10 percent you are seeing negative growth, a loss in \nterms of weekly earnings. The poorest Americans are not only not \nkeeping up, they are falling behind. It is not just at the bottom, it \nis all the way up to the 50th percentile. Half of American full-time \nworkers have seen a loss in the last 5 years in their usual weekly \nearnings. They are losing ground, and they know it. They are not \ngetting ahead. They are falling behind.\n  You see at the upper income levels a slight increase. It was much, \nmuch better under the Clinton administration.\n  One of the ironies here is that the economic policy, relatively \nspeaking, is benefiting the wealthiest Americans, but it is not \nbenefiting them as much as under the Clinton administration.\n  Again, these are weekly earnings. This figure would be much, much \ndifferent if we put in all forms of compensation. There you are seeing \neven a more pronounced view of the upper income Americans because of \nstock bonuses, because of all sorts of compensation that is not in the \nform of weekly earnings.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I understand that chart correctly, the people up to \nthe 50th percentile in the last 5 years have actually fallen behind. \nThey have not had an increase, they actually have had a decrease in \ntheir real weekly earnings. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REED. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Then beyond that, while there has been some increase, \nit is far less than what occurred in the previous 5 years of the \nClinton administration? Is that right?\n  Mr. REED. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, that helps to explain what people are \nthinking about the economy. I know our distinguished colleague from \nMichigan talked earlier about the increase in health care costs, the \nincrease in tuition costs, education costs, and the increase in energy \ncosts. That is one side of the squeeze on the middle class and working \nAmerica. But this is the other side of the squeeze on the middle and \nworking Americans. They are being squeezed down in their earnings and \nthey are being squeezed from the other direction by the increase in \ncosts. So they are really caught in a vise. Their income is not as good \nand key costs are going up--and at a rather rapid rate. Will the \nSenator agree with that?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is right. It is absolutely a phenomenon between \nbeing crushed by falling real income and rising costs. It is not a \nsituation where incomes are falling and being compensated by falling \nprices. It is a situation where they are being caught in this vice. The \npain is palpable to working families throughout this country. These are \nall of our citizens. These are the people we all say we are here to \nhelp. And we are not helping them--not this Congress, not this \nadministration. Not only are we not helping these individuals but it \nturns out the very policies of this administration and this Congress \nare rewarding those people who are doing the best, not those who need \nthe assistance. That is evident in the tax policy being pursued by this \nadministration and supported by this Republican Congress.\n  This is the average amount of capital gains and dividend tax cuts by \nhousehold incomes in 2005. This is one of the centerpieces of the \nadministration's proposal. They have to cut capital gains taxes. They \nhave to cut dividend taxes. Here is where the benefits go. If you make \nunder $50,000--that is an awful lot of Americans--you get $6 in \nbenefits If a person is making between $50,000 and $100,000--most \nAmericans within that range are considered to be pretty prosperous \nfolks--they get $55 in benefits. If a person makes over $1 million, \nthey get $37,000 in benefits. One of the reasons for this is the fact \nthat most working Americans, if they hold stock, they hold it in their \nretirement accounts. These retirement accounts do not benefit directly \nfrom these capital gains and dividends tax cuts. So\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\nfor the vast majority of Americans, we are seeing virtually no direct \nbenefit from these capital gains and dividends tax cuts. Of course, for \nthe wealthiest, it is a bonanza.\n\n  Now, if this somehow stimulated a huge spurt in economic activity, \ngrowth, job performance, and increased employment, that might be a \njustification--not the most compelling, but a justification. We are not \neven seeing that.\n  What we are seeing--because, again, ultimately this is about \narithmetic as much as anything--we are seeing a decrease in the \nresources and revenues of the Federal Government. So we can't \ncompensate for increased cost of tuition. In fact, this administration, \nas the Senator from Michigan suggested, is sending up a budget that has \nrecord cuts in Pell grants and Stafford loans and those supports for \neducation that are so critical at a time when everyone reflexively says \nwe have to be the best educated country in the world because we must \ncompete today with an emerging India and an emerging China.\n  We can no longer sit back on our laurels saying we have the best \neducated people. We have to keep investing in education. We have \ndissipated those resources in a way that does not benefit the vast \nmajority of Americans but benefits very few. As a result, not only are \nthe costs of education going up, but our Federal support for education \nis going down.\n  I should say something else, too. The last several weeks the, \nPresident hasn't missed an opportunity to remind the American people \nthat we are at war. We are. And we have to support our forces in the \nfield. I saw a figure today that to keep an Army division in operation \nin Iraq for 1 month costs $1.5 billion. Those costs have to be met.\n  With the tax policy rewarding the wealthiest Americans without \nbenefiting the rest of America, without contributing in a demonstrable \nway to significantly increase employment, without contributing to \nsupports and programs so essential to investments for the future of \nthis country, we are not only dissipating our resources, we have also \nengaged in an international policy that requires spending that is very \ndifficult to avoid, nigh impossible. Who is bearing the burden? It is \nall being rolled into the next generation of Americans as we accumulate \na huge amount of debt going forward.\n  This is the most reckless economic policy I have ever seen. It is \n``credit card economics,'' borrow as much as you can to fund military \noperations abroad, but we cannot afford domestic programs. What \nresources we have we give away in the form of tax cuts that are not \nstrengthening the economy.\n  It is a massive shift of resources from the vast majority of \nAmericans to the wealthiest Americans; from a generation in the future \nthat will pay for it, to a generation today that seems to be consuming \nit.\n  Ultimately, these policies will catch up with us. They have already \ncaught up with the families of America. As we debate these issues \ntoday, they are looking at sticker shock in health care, education, at \nthe gas pumps, and housing. And they are looking at their stagnant \npaychecks.\n  Not only can we do better, we must do better. This Government has in \nthe past been able to sort these problems out. We have a record over \nthe last 5 years of the preceding decade of growth across the board in \nterms of income at robust levels, of significant employment gains, of \nfiscal responsibility. All of that today is history.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, we have had this tremendous runup \nin the debt. We are just saddling this burden on the next generations.\n  One of the things that has happened and needs to be underscored, at \nleast as I am informed, is that the amount of the debt that we are \nborrowing from overseas has escalated tremendously. In fact, we have \nborrowed more from overseas--in other words, foreign-held debt--under \nPresident George W. Bush than all of the previous Presidents combined.\n  It is not only that we are incurring the debt and the problems that \ngo with that in terms of the future burden, but more of that debt is \nbeing held externally by people overseas rather than being held \ninternally. Before, we were paying it to ourselves. It meant working \npeople were paying money to people who held the Government bonds, but \nat least it was all within the country. Now there is a tremendous \ntariff on working people to send this money overseas to the debt that \nis being held abroad.\n  Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. REED. That is absolutely right. The Senator is right.\n  We have extraordinary debt being held by countries such as China. \nEven Mexico is a creditor of the United States today. That debt has to \nbe serviced. That money goes overseas. It is not kept within the United \nStates for investment here.\n  It also not only economically weakens us, it puts us into a position \ninternationally where we do not have the kind of leverage we used to \nhave when we were an economic power that did not have these huge debt \nburdens, and we did not rely upon the kindness of strangers. We are \nrelying on the kindness of lots of countries who, sometimes, are not \nour friends.\n\n  We can see that manifested in situations such as our relations with \nNorth Korea, China and our relationship with Iran. The Senator is a \nsenior member of the Foreign Relations Committee. We are struggling now \nto control the Iranians' race for nuclear technology. A key player is \nthe Chinese. We cannot push them hard to take a tough line, in some \ncases because they hold a lot of our debt. That is a reality not only \neconomically but also in terms of international affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, as the Senator points out, \nwe have become dependent, as Tennessee Williams said, on ``the kindness \nof strangers.''\n  On the one hand, we say we are the world's superpower. In many \nrespects, that is quite true. However, economically, the foundations \nare weakening. They are not as solid and as strong as they once were.\n  In the last years of the Clinton administration we were running \nsurpluses and paying down the debt. The Bush administration came in and \nmade these very excessive tax cuts at a time when we moved into a war \nfooting. We have never done that before in this country. When we have \ngone into a war footing we have always concerned ourselves with how to \nmeet the budgetary demands of the war. That did not happen here. All of \na sudden we have switched from running surpluses to running these large \ndeficits, year after year after year. The projections are that they \nwill go out into the future as far as the eye can see.\n  The Bush people say: We will lower the deficit a little bit. As long \nas we are running the deficit, we are still building up the debt. We \nare adding to the debt every step of the way. As we noted previously in \nour discussion, more and more of that debt is being held overseas. To \nthe extent that happens, we are subject to the kind of leverage that \nothers have.\n  The United States has gone from being the world's largest creditor \nnation; now we are the world's largest debtor nation.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is absolutely right. He realizes, as I do, when \nthe Bush administration came into power, we were running a surplus. We \nhad a projected surplus over several years in the trillions of dollars, \nan opportunity to do lots of critical and important tasks for America: \nto try to reform our health care system which will require not only \nchanges in rules, regulations, and procedures, but probably additional \nresources; to try to reinvigorate public education at the elementary \nand secondary level and try to make college more affordable. These were \ninvestment goals. At that juncture we had the resources to do it.\n  The Senator listened, as I did, to proposals which we thought were \nfanciful: the suggestion that if we did not cut taxes, our surplus \nwould grow so great it would be unmanageable. What has grown so great \nand what is unmanageable now is not a surplus but a deficit.\n  The Senator also recognizes, as we look ahead and as we see this \ncontinued deficit finance and growing debt, there are structural issues \nwhich will drive the deficit further. For example, we have to somehow \ncome to grips with a longer term solution to the alternative minimum \ntax which will take additional revenues and resources away from the \nFederal Government.\n  There are proposals, and we have heard them, of a full-scale repeal \nof the\n\n[[Page S9751]]\n\nestate tax. Again, that would be an additional denial of revenues and \nresources to the Government at a time when we are running a huge \ndeficit and we are fighting a war.\n  All this adds up to what the Senator pointed out: not only annual \ndeficits but a hugely increasing debt funded by foreigners, leaving us \nvulnerable not only to economic shocks but also to the fact, as the \nSenator suggested, that we are dependent. Dependency, in many respects, \nis the opposite of strength. We have surrendered a great deal of \neconomic strength through these policies.\n  The bottom line of this discussion is that this is not some \ntheoretical macroeconomic research topic. This is reflected in the \ndaily lives of Americans who are struggling, and in the future they are \nseeing every day a decreasing sense of confidence that they can provide \ntheir sons and daughters at least as good a quality of economic life, \nfamily life, and support as they have enjoyed. That is distressing the \nAmerican public.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, furthermore, we have an \nopportunity to strengthen the economy in so many ways, including \naddressing the Social Security system which can be done with a number \nof relatively sensible steps.\n  The Bush administration, of course, has been pressing this \nprivatization. For the moment, they have been beaten back on that and \npeople are turning their attention elsewhere, but it is very clear they \nhave not given up.\n  The President, at the end of June, said:\n\n       If we can't get it done this year I'm going to try next \n     year. And if we can't get it done next year, I'm going to try \n     the year after that.\n\n  The majority leader in the House of Representatives says:\n\n       If I'm around in a leadership role come January [this \n     coming January], we're going to get serious about it \n     [privatizing of Social Security].\n\n  And the chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social \nSecurity said that privatization would be a top priority in the \nCongress in 2007.\n  The American people have to understand this is still very much on the \nagenda of this administration and its supporters.\n  Now they want to abolish the estate tax. Why not keep the estate tax \nand devote the revenues from the estate tax to strengthening the Social \nSecurity system? Then there would be a better retirement for everybody.\n\n  Mr. REED. Well, I think the Senator has a very valid point about \nSocial Security, that, yes, you are right, from what I read into those \ncomments, the President and the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives are committed to, once again, going after Social \nSecurity. It seems to me to be contradictory to everything that \nAmericans are experiencing today.\n  The one phenomenon that is frightening everyone is the loss of \ndefined benefit pensions, left and right. Thinking back to when I was \nbeginning to enter the workforce, in the 1960s and 1970s, if one of my \ncolleagues had said: I have just taken a job as a machinist at United \nAirlines--you would say, you are set for life, just like your father \nwas. You are going to work for 30 years, and you are going to retire \nwith a nice pension and have benefits like health care. You, \nfinancially, are in a good position.\n  Now we are hearing stories about machinists' pensions being abrogated \nbecause of bankruptcy proceedings, companies that we took for granted \nas being solid trying to get rid of their pension liabilities. The only \nthing left for most Americans is Social Security.\n  Now, we hope they all have 401(k)s and private investments. But there \nis that credit card commercial about how something costs $50 and \nsomething costs $80, but at the end there is that priceless element. \nThe priceless element, when it comes to pensions, is Social Security \nbecause at least you know every month you will get a certain amount of \nmoney, you will have something, you will know what it is. And that is \nworth a great deal because it gives a certain peace of mind. For most \nAmericans, it is very modest, but at least it is something they can say \nthey will have as long as they live.\n  This administration wants to eliminate that. They want to put every \nAmerican into a market which has great ups, but also great downs. It \nhas cycles where everyone is doing well and cycles where people are not \ndoing very well at all.\n  That cannot be the bedrock of retirement. We have to maintain Social \nSecurity. So it is shocking to me that despite what America said over \nthe last several months--essentially, take your hands off my Social \nSecurity--this administration is going to try again.\n  And, of course, there are ways we can fund Social Security. I think \nwe did that under the leadership of you and your colleagues in the \n1980s, where changes were made to the formulas, changes were made to \nthe rates of taxation, changes were made to strengthen Social Security.\n  They are not interested, I think, in strengthening it because their \nobjective is not making sure that American families have something to \nrest their dreams on in retirement. This is, in some respects, simply \nanother example of catering to the market, of letting these investments \nbe turned over to private markets. And there is some advantage to that, \nbut not fundamentally with respect to Social Security.\n  I am afraid we are going to have to fight this fight again.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, the administration states the problem in such \na way I think to sort of panic people, and then use that panic to push \nthem toward the privatization of the Social Security system.\n  For example, the administration says the Social Security system is \nbankrupt. The Social Security system is not bankrupt. The Social \nSecurity system, at the moment, is taking in more money than it pays \nout in the trust fund. Of course, the administration then borrows that \nmoney to cover its deficits. That is a separate issue. But there is \nmore flowing into the system than is flowing out. That will last until \nabout 2020.\n  After that, they will start paying out more than flows into the fund, \nso they will start drawing down the fund. And they can continue to pay \nout all the benefits until 2046--in other words, 40 years from now, \nunder the projections; of course, the projections are all problematic \nbecause it depends a lot on how the economy functions--but under their \nbest projections, before they draw the fund down. At that point, they \nwill still be able to pay 75 to 80 percent of the benefits from what is \ncoming in to the Social Security trust fund. So the worst scenario is a \n20- to 25-percent shortfall 40 years from now.\n  Now, there are many things you can do now, next year, the year after, \nwith an administration that really wants to support the Social Security \nsystem, to take care of that problem. The magnitude of that problem is \nnot out of bounds in terms of being able to address it.\n  But it has been dramatized as though it is an immediate crisis I \nthink to sort of help scare and panic the American people and then have \nthem be more open to these privatization proposals, which, as the able \nSenator from Rhode Island points out, would be to shift people from a \nguaranteed benefit--where they are told, as they are with Social \nSecurity: You are going to get so much a month and that is guaranteed \nto you--to a defined contribution plan, where you do not know what you \nare going to get.\n  The people who worked at Enron and WorldCom thought they had \nwonderful retirements. They had these 401(k)s and everything--they \nthought they had company plans--they thought they had wonderful \nretirements, and they were going to be living quite well in their \nretirement years, and it all collapsed. But they still have----\n  Mr. REED. Social Security.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Their Social Security, with its guaranteed benefit \nevery month. So at least they have that basic form. People need to \nunderstand how important Social Security is to more than half of \nAmericans who get more than 50 percent of their retirement income from \nSocial Security. And 20 percent of retired Americans get more than 90 \npercent of their retirement income from Social Security.\n  So Social Security is really essential to providing that base. In \nfact, it has helped to lift the seniors out of poverty. It used to be \nthat the age group most in poverty was the elderly. Because of Social \nSecurity, essentially--and other things--but because of the\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\nimprovements we have made to it now, that is the age group least in \npoverty. So we have made a substantial change. But Social Security is \nessential to achieving that.\n  And I do not know why the administration put it out there. The \ncountry rejected it, clearly. And it was reflected by Members of \nCongress from both parties who said: No, no. And now they continue to \ntalk about coming back to this issue and privatizing. They have not \ngiven up on privatizing the Social Security system.\n\n  Mr. REED. Well, I think the Senator is absolutely right in terms of \nhis analysis. He has stated very eloquently and accurately about how \nmany Americans depend upon Social Security; how, over the long term, it \nis a program that will be solvent--with no changes--for 20-plus years, \nand 50 years even if it is not paying full benefits.\n  Frankly, I cannot think of another Federal program where we can say \nwe can guarantee 25 years from now you are going to get what we told \nyou you are going to get. That is one of the few programs of the \nFederal Government that will do that.\n  I think the other point that should be made is that these actuarial \nassumptions are rather conservative. So this is not a situation where \nwe are trying to, with smoke and mirrors, create an artificial picture \nof the funding stream going forward. And I have the same shock that you \nhave, in a way, at these proposals because right now Social Security is \neven more important.\n  There was a period in our economic history, from the end of World War \nII up until fairly recently, where many Americans were looking at and \nanticipating not only their Social Security but a defined benefit \nprivate pension--a rather good private defined pension--and their \nprivate investments. Frankly, we all understand that the best \nretirement plan has, as a foundation, Social Security, but it is not \nonly Social Security. It has to have private savings, private \ninvestments over time.\n  Sometimes--I am sure the Senator might have some of the same feelings \nI have--if we have all these proposals--benefiting the wealthiest \nAmericans, why can't we give incentives for average Americans--more \nincentives--to save for their retirement, to put money away? We have \nsome, but they are not enough. We can do that. But that is a conscious \nchoice to favor, in this respect, the wealthiest over the vast majority \nof Americans.\n  I do not think it makes much sense in terms of economic policy, \nfiscal policy, and also social policy. But today we have seen those \nprivate pensions too often disappear. Today it is more important to \nmaintain the defined benefit program of Social Security, and I hope we \ncan.\n  But again, I say to the Senator, like you, I am concerned there is \nanother movement afoot. Just listen to what the President says and what \nthe chairman of the relevant subcommittee in the House and also the \nHouse majority leader say. If they get a chance, next year, they are \ngoing right back after Social Security, despite, as you point out, the \nrejection by the American people. And this was not some type of narrow, \nclose call. Seniors, middle-income Americans--all Americans, I think--\nwere standing up basically saying: This is not a sensible approach.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I think this does \nmuch to help explain the anxiety that Americans are feeling about the \nworkings of their economy.\n  Now, as the Senator so ably showed earlier, working people are being \npressed from two directions. Their wages are not going up to keep pace \nwith inflation, and key costs are increasing. That is compounded by the \nfact that the retired people are in a state of anxiety because they are \nconstantly being told: Social Security will not be there for you--\nalthough I think that is a false cry.\n  Furthermore, as the increase in educational costs indicates, younger \npeople--not yet in the workforce but moving in that direction--see the \nopportunities for education and training not opening up but closing \ndown. Senator Stabenow pointed out earlier, we have the most \nsignificant cuts in Federal aid to education that we have experienced \nsince the Federal Government began to try to provide assistance in that \narea.\n  So through every age group, as they look at the situation, they find \nthemselves being constrained, to deny them the opportunity--the young \npeople--to get an education. Working people are being squeezed badly. \nAnd our retired citizens are kept in a constant state of agitation \nabout the safety and the security of their retirement income.\n  I think that explains why you are getting all these articles now in \nthe major periodicals and in the major newspapers about this sort of \nanxiety that is running through the society about the workings of our \neconomy. And when they look at it, it is very clear what is happening: \nthe benefits are all being--as that chart indicates--focused right up \nat the top of the income and wealth scale. And everyone else is left in \na state where they are really quite concerned about their future.\n  Mr. REED. I think the Senator is absolutely right. I think what \nAmericans are seeing is a bifurcated society. That is a fancy term for \nthe haves and the have-nots. The haves are doing quite well.\n  I remember Warren Buffett once said: ``If this is class warfare, my \nclass is winning.'' And it is not class warfare. What it is is a series \nof economic policies that are not creating the jobs, that are not \ncreating circumstances so that those jobs provide growing compensation \nto workers, and then on top of that, developing tax policies which \nfavor the very wealthy and do not do enough to help those who do need \nassistance. Then it is complicated further by budget policies that are \nundercutting education and health care. We are debating a cut to \nphysicians in terms of their compensation which goes into the overall \neffect of the health care system.\n  One point I would make, in addition to this issue about education, is \nthat one of the reasons we saw a spectacularly productive decade in the \n1990s and previous decades is not because anything was done in the \n1990s, it is because of the Pell grants and Stafford loans of the 1960s \nwhen Americans with talent and ambition could go to college. Twenty-\nfive years later, they were inventing new products. They were \ndeveloping new ways to develop and provide services. They were leading \nthe world economy in every dimension--health care, business, all these \nthings.\n  If we stop investing in education now, we will lurch along for a few \nyears, but we will start slowing up in terms of momentum, and we will \nask ourselves 20 years from now: Are we still the preeminent economy, \nthe preeminent area of scientific research? And that is a question \nmark.\n  People understand that. I think it goes back to the point we have all \ntried to make, which is that these charts are illustrative of what is \ngoing on from a statistical and analytical point; but just ask the \naverage family and they will say simply: My wages are stuck, my \nexpenses are going up, I cannot provide for my children the way I \nthought I could, and I need help. We should be giving them help and we \nare not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, where are we at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Postcloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. \n6061.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 6061, \nthe Secure Fence Act of 2006. As I traveled back home over the summer, \nparticularly over the month of August, there was not a single issue I \nheard more of from my constituents, whether they were in the north \nGeorgia mountains, vacationing on Georgia's coast, or working on farms \nin south Georgia, than illegal immigration. This is by far the most \nemotionally charged issue with which I have dealt during my 12 years in \nCongress.\n  Earlier this year, the American people watched as Congress debated \nhow\n\n[[Page S9753]]\n\nto handle the growing crisis of illegal immigration. During that \ndebate, there were a wide variety of views expressed regarding the best \nway to stop illegal immigration and how to address the presence of 15 \nto 20 million illegal aliens currently in the United States. However, \nthere was one issue on which everybody agreed; that is, the need to \nsecure our borders. This legislation we are considering today takes an \nimportant step in the right direction to do just that.\n  Securing the borders is not anti-immigrant. There is more to this \ndebate than the presence of illegal immigrants. Securing our borders \nwill stop illegal commercial activities, such as human trafficking and \ndrug and weapons smuggling--the three most lucrative illegal commercial \nactivities in the world. Human traffickers profit by exploiting people \nwho seek to come to the United States to seek a better life for \nthemselves and their families. It is estimated that 20,000 people are \ntrafficked into the United States each year, primarily women and \nchildren. In addition, porous borders result in illegal drugs and \nweapons being smuggled into our country.\n  If drug and weapons smugglers can get cocaine and firearms into our \ncountry, what is to prevent them from bringing nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological weapons across the border? It is an important national \nsecurity matter for us to take the appropriate steps to gain \noperational control of our borders. We have all heard from our \nconstituents and know they demand no more and deserve no less.\n  Earlier this year, when the Senate considered the comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill, this body voted overwhelmingly to authorize \nconstruction of 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers \nalong the southwest border. This totals almost 900 miles of barrier on \nthat border. Late this summer, the Senate voted to fund the \nconstruction of fencing and barriers we previously authorized.\n  Some may ask: Why are we considering this legislation if the Senate \nhas already considered something very similar? We all know Congress is \nnot going to pass the comprehensive immigration reform bill before we \nleave. Passage of this bill will allow us to move forward with the \nprocess of getting these necessary tools in place to secure the border.\n  Finally, the American people have questions about the commitment of \nCongress when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform. Congress \ntried to sell this idea to them in 1986 when it said that we would \nallow all of those people who were here illegally to adjust their \nstatus. In exchange, we pledged to secure the border and have real \ninterior enforcement. We all know what happened. Millions of people \nwere allowed to obtain lawful permanent residence, but we did not \nsecure our borders. Now 20 years later, some in Congress are trying to \nsell the same idea again, and the American people simply are not buying \nit, and rightfully so.\n  This bill will give Congress an opportunity to move in the direction \nof gaining the trust of the American people on the issue of immigration \nand allows us to prove to the American people that we are serious about \nsecuring our borders.\n  Once we have operational control of our borders and can know who is \ncoming into and going out of the country, I think the American people \nwill be more receptive to temporary guest worker programs. Once we have \noperational control of our borders, the American people will be willing \nto engage in a debate about whether we should increase the number of \npeople our country accepts for permanent resident status each year. \nUntil we have operational control of our borders, most people think we \nwill simply have a repeat of the 1986 amnesty.\n  I don't believe a fence is a panacea, and I don't believe we need to \nbuild a fence across the entire stretch of our borders. However, we \nknow fencing and vehicle barriers are effective border security tools. \nCombined with state-of-the-art technology, it is possible for us to \ngain control of our borders and then have a healthy, responsible debate \nabout our Nation's immigration policies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Federal Tax Gap\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have repeatedly raised the problem of \nthe ever-growing Federal tax gap. What is that? The tax gap is the \ndifference between taxes legally owed and taxes actually paid. That gap \nis $345 billion a year, and it is growing. That is right. Every year, \nabout $345 billion in taxes legally owed is not paid--$345 billion a \nyear.\n  One of the things that contributes significantly to the tax gap is \nconfusion. Many taxpayers simply claim credits or deductions by \nmistake, and that error rate is about to get worse. As IRS Commissioner \nEverson pointed out in a Finance Committee hearing this month, the IRS \nand taxpayers will face unnecessary confusion and compliance errors if \nCongress does not finish its changes to the tax law soon. Taxpayers \nwill face more mistakes and hassles if we do not extend the expired tax \nprovisions soon. ``Soon'' means prior to October 15, according to \nCommissioner Everson.\n\n  If Congress does not reinstate the expired tax incentives before it \nrecesses for the election, then the IRS will have to print tax forms \nfor next year's filing season applying the law ``as is.'' That means \nreprint; more expense. The IRS will print the forms without the tax \ncredit for U.S.-based research jobs, without the tax deduction for \nState sales taxes, without the tax credit for hiring welfare workers, \nand without the tax deductions for classroom supplies that teachers \nbuy--without those deductions. That is what would have to be printed by \nthe IRS.\n  If Congress does not extend these provisions by the end of next week, \nthen the IRS will have to spend taxpayers' money to rush printing for \nsupplemental documents to describe these incentives if and when \nCongress actually passes them.\n  Millions of families, businesses and workers utilize these popular \ntax incentives. These are not obscure tax benefits claimed on separate \nforms or schedules.\n  For example, look at the front page of the basic form 1040, which I \nhave at my right. Look at line 23, right here, in the category \n``adjusted gross income.'' That line 23 is labeled ``educator \nexpenses.''\n  What should the IRS do with the classroom teachers' deduction? Look \nat line 34, right here: ``Tuition and fees deduction.'' What should the \nIRS do with the tuition deduction for middle-income families? They both \nexpired at the end of 2005, so the IRS really cannot print them. It \ncannot do so on the 2006 tax form. It cannot print them because \nCongress has not extended those provisions.\n  But if the IRS does not print them on form 1040, and it cannot do so, \nhow many teachers will miss out on this deduction? School started not \ntoo long ago this year. How many teachers will miss out if the IRS \nmerely mentions the deduction in some supplementary instruction guide?\n  What about the millions of taxpayers who use software to assist in \ntax preparation? Those software providers have deadlines, too, and they \nhave told us mid-October is their ``drop dead'' date, just as it is for \nthe IRS. They will try to have their products in stores and on the \nshelves by Thanksgiving. That would be literally days after our lame \nduck session, when some believe that we should extend these benefits \nappearing on form 1040.\n  You might ask why these software providers cannot just send updates \nto customers. The providers tell us they cannot force the customer to \nreceive the update. Millions of customers will miss the update; they \njust will not know about it. They will miss it. Millions of customers \nwill ignore the update and millions will lose out.\n  Earlier this year the Finance Committee held an investigative hearing \nand looked at the ``free file'' alliances, which provide free \nelectronics services to many taxpayers via the IRS Web site. The \ncommittee found many members of the ``free file'' alliance simply \ndeclined to include any of the Katrina-related tax benefits. Why? \nBecause\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\nCongress enacted those benefits into law so late in the year it simply \nwas not feasible for providers to include them.\n  Delay has costs. Delay costs taxpayers money. Delay impairs the \neffective tax administration by the IRS.\n  I am again asking my colleagues to support my unanimous consent \nrequest to pass the negotiated tax extenders. If my amendment is agreed \nto, it will retroactively restore all those popular benefits. We are \ngoing to enact them, but the real cost and the irresponsibility will be \nif we don't pass them in the next couple of weeks but, rather, later on \nin the year when it will cause all these costs I just mentioned. My \namendment will also provide the compromise reached on the Abandoned \nMine Land trust fund, or AML.\n  We need these tax cuts. We cannot wait until the next tax period.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anybody on the floor who might object, \nexcept for the Presiding Officer. I guess he will object in his role of \na Senator from his State.\n\n\n                  unanimous-consent request--h.r. 4096\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 326, H.R. 4096, that the Senate adopt my amendments numbered 5003 \nand 5004, which are the agreed-upon tax extender package, that this \nbill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, and all this occur without intervening action.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, before the Chair in his role as a Senator \nobjects, because he has been instructed to do so by the majority party, \nI think it is extremely irresponsible for this body not to enact these \nextenders right away. As I stated, it is going to happen, so why put \nthe American people through this unnecessary, ridiculous additional \ncost? Why can't we as a body just do what is right? What is right is to \npass these extenders now before we recess in a couple of weeks. That is \nthe right thing to do instead of all the games we have been playing \naround here. I wish those games would not be played. But, frankly, the \nparty in control of this body has chosen to object to this request. I \nam very disappointed in the U.S. Senate for not doing what is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from South \nCarolina, I object.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want to \nhave the Record spread with my appreciation for who he is and how he \nhas operated as a Member of Congress, first in the House of \nRepresentatives and now in the Senate. Our ranking member on the \nFinance Committee has been the chair of our Finance Committee, the \nchair of the Environment and Public Works Committee. The people of \nMontana are very fortunate to have him in their corner.\n  I appreciate his coming here, as the people of Montana and the people \nof Nevada want, with just commonsense legislation. This is going to \npass. I cannot imagine that this legislative body would walk away from \nhere and not pass this must-do legislation.\n  But I say I am of the opinion now that maybe this Republican \nCongress, which has been dubbed--not by me but by writers all over the \ncountry--as the most do-nothing Congress in the history of our \nRepublic, I guess they want to make sure they don't lose that record as \nthe most do-nothing Congress in history.\n  This is evidence of it. We sit here doing nothing all day today, \ndoing nothing all day tomorrow, when there are important things to be \naccomplished.\n  Some of my colleagues were here earlier talking about the delicate \nbalance we have in our economy. Housing all over the country is headed \nthe wrong way. I have learned that highway construction and \nhomebuilding are the two economic engines that drive our economy.\n  I am so disappointed, and I say that very seriously, that these \nimportant provisions have not been extended today. If we had an \nopportunity to vote on these it would be virtually unanimous, Democrats \nand Republicans, but we are not provided the ability to vote on this. I \ndon't know why. Maybe they are trying to come up with some kind of an \narrangement so that we will be forced to vote for it because, although \nit will have other things in it that we will not like, we will like \nthis so much. That was tried once and it didn't work. The American \npeople are too smart, and we speak for the American people.\n  Some things are so important. I have a niece. Her name is Lari, named \nafter my father and brother. She struggled to get through school. She \nworked. She finally got to become a schoolteacher. She now teaches high \nschool at Las Vegas High School, but she doesn't have much money.\n  She spends money out of her own pocket to buy school supplies. The \nschool district should buy them but they don't. Under the provisions we \nare trying to extend, schoolteachers all over America can deduct up to \n$250 a year for school supplies they buy out of their own pocket.\n  Mr. President, $250 to my niece means a lot. It may not mean a lot to \nmillionaires and all the people who benefited so much during this \nRepublican administration, but to my niece it means a lot. She will not \nget that unless we put on these extenders.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate the Senator's comments, but let me \nask if the Senator heard, as I have, in a good number of companies, if \nthese provisions are not enacted the companies are going to have to \nbegin to restate their financials and take a charge against earnings \nbecause of the loss of the work opportunity tax credit and loss of the \nresearch and development tax credit.\n  I wonder if my good friend from Nevada has heard that, learned that, \nand what he might tell us the consequences of that might be when a \ncompany has to take a charge because of the failure of the other side \nof the aisle to let this provision pass, which we all know is going to \npass.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I received a call before the last \nrecess from the chair of the Business Roundtable. This is a group \ncomposed of Democrats and Republicans but, frankly, more Republicans \nthan Democrats, and they represent the American business community. The \nchairman of that group said something to me. I asked him, Of all these \nprovisions, which is the most important? And he said, We only care \nabout one: the research and development tax credit has to pass. It is \nso important to the American business community. If we don't have that, \nit is going to have a tremendously detrimental effect on business.\n  We have not done it.\n  So I say to my friend, there are so many problems and he has outlined \nthem very clearly. I listened to my friend--I just saw him walk through \nhere--the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. He wants to do what I am suggesting.\n  Mr. REID. He made a wonderful statement. He said, Why should the \nFederal Government have to pay extra money for what we aren't doing?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right.\n  Mr. REID. They are waiting, as you indicated. They need to prepare \nthese forms. It costs money to do this. In my State--it is different \nthan your State--we pay a very large sales tax. In your State you don't \nhave a sales tax, you have an income tax.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Correct.\n  Mr. REID. You get a deduction. There are 12 million families in \nStates without a State income tax, and they are not going to have the \nbenefit of that--12 million families.\n  I talked to my friend--I don't think he would be embarrassed if I \nmentioned his name--Steve Wynn, who is one of America's great \nbusinessmen. He has done so much for Las Vegas. He is a modern business \ngiant. He comes up with new ideas. His hotels are magnificent.\n  He called me up about a situation today. I am trying to work it \nthrough the last few days of this session. We have a Republican in the \nHouse and a Republican in the Senate who are fighting over a bill. He \ndidn't know who. He thought one of them was a Democrat. I said, No, \nthese are two Republicans fighting over this. He said, That's the way \nit always is, Harry.\n  I said, Steve, I'm sorry to say you are right. What do you think the \nAmerican people think of this?\n  We mentioned just a few things. I again mentioned my little niece, \nthe schoolteacher and the $250. To us, we get a big fat salary, we \nMembers of Congress, and all the tax cuts the administration passed on. \nThey don't\n\n[[Page S9755]]\n\ncare about my niece; $250, what does it mean to them? To her it means a \nlot. What do the American people think we are doing here? These \nprovisions have to be passed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend very much.\n  Mr. REID. I so appreciate your leadership. I have never come to this \nfloor, ever, and criticized the chairman of the Finance Committee. I \ncan't say that about other chairmen, but I have never criticized the \nfarmer from Iowa, because he has a heart of gold. He can be very tough \nand hard. But he has been saying everything he can publicly that has \nsupported our position. I hope the majority will allow this most \nimportant piece of legislation to come before it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. The chairman of the Finance Committee \nmore than anything else wants to do what is right. He doesn't like to \nget involved in politics. That is what the American people want, not to \nget involved in politics, but to do what is right. That is why they \nshould listen to the chairman who very much agrees with what you have \ntalked about here.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to talk about my niece so much. Her name is Lari \nDawn. She is named after my dad and my brother, Larry. We love Lari \nDawn. But she is one of 3.3 million teachers who are forced to reach \ninto their own pockets to provide supplies for their students. They are \ngoing to lose that. Again, that doesn't sound like much, but for the \nAmerican people they get their money's worth for every Lari Dawn of the \nworld who is out there trying to educate their children. For the 3.3 \nmillion teachers and the head of the Business Roundtable, all aspects \nof our society benefit from this legislation.\n\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the Senator from Montana.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nbusiness be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I just had the unfortunate experience of \nbeing trapped in the Presiding Officer's chair as some of my Democratic \ncolleagues presented a sad scenario of how Republicans had not taken up \nan important bill that would continue important tax credits for \nAmericans and American businesses. Unfortunately, they failed to admit \nthat we all had a chance to vote on that bill only a couple of weeks \nago when Republicans, attempting to work with Democrats, brought all of \nthese ``tax extenders,'' as we call them, to the floor, along with the \nincrease in the minimum wage, which our Democratic colleagues had \nspoken so often for, and a reform of the death tax, a compromise plan \nto tax only the larger estates in this country. We put this together in \norder to try to move some business through the Senate--a very important \npiece of legislation that we called the Family Prosperity Act because, \nindeed, that is exactly what it was.\n  All of us were amazed at how our Democratic colleagues came to the \nfloor and found one excuse after another why we could not vote for this \nimportant piece of legislation that would have given the tax credits \nfor schoolteachers who buy supplies, it would have given some breaks to \nmiddle-class families who are faced with the death tax on their farm or \nfamily business, and it certainly would have given low and minimum wage \nworkers the increase that we talked about for years. Yet the Democrats, \nwhich has been their form for month after month--in fact, during my \nentire time here in the Senate--when we bring something important to \nthis floor, the Democrats block it. Then, as they did today, they come \ndown and attempt to blame Republicans for the bill not getting passed.\n  I think it is important for the American people to know the truth, \nparticularly as we head toward elections. The tax credits which are so \nimportant to America were brought to the floor by the Republicans, with \na good compromise package, with an honest attempt to work with \nDemocrats on several important issues. The Democrats to a person \nunanimously voted against this bill. Now they are here trying to blame \nRepublicans.\n  I think it is important that we set the record straight. I intend to \nbe a part of doing that as we try to end this session in a productive \nway next week.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed. \nWe are in a postcloture period, having invoked cloture, 94 to 0.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 alternative energy fuel grant program\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on July 24, the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly passed H.R. 5534 by a vote of 355 to 9. This bipartisan \nlegislation seeks to provide grants, not to exceed $30,000, to assist \ngas station owners and other eligible entities who install alternative \nfuels such as biodiesel, natural gas and E85 ethanol.\n  As all of my colleagues know, the American public has been calling on \nCongress to address our Nation's overdependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy. Senator Salazar from Colorado and I have a bipartisan \nsubstitute to the House-passed bill that is currently being held in the \nSenate at the desk. The substitute has been cleared by the relative \ncommittees, as well as by my colleagues on this side of the aisle; \nhowever, for some unknown reason, some of my Democratic colleagues have \nplaced secret holds on this very noncontroversial bill.\n  The Thune-Salazar substitute has the support of the U.S. Automakers \nAlliance, alternative energy groups, and environmental organizations \nthat have called upon Congress to increase the availability of \nalternative fuels.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, which includes BMW Group, \nDaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mazda, Mitsubishi, \nPorsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Alliance of Automobile\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                               September 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing in support of legislation \n     authored by Senators Thune and Salazar that seeks to expand \n     our Nation's alternative fueling infrastructure through the \n     use of CAFE program fines. Automakers urge the Senate to \n     adopt this legislation prior to adjournment.\n       As our Nation works toward energy independence, automakers \n     support a diverse mix of fuels to power our transportation \n     sector. To date, automakers are proud to report that there \n     are over nine million alternative fuel and advanced \n     technology vehicles on America's roads. These vehicles are \n     powered by E-85 (ethanol), clean diesel, gasoline-electric \n     hybrid engines, as well as other emerging technologies that \n     improve mileage and reduce our dependency on foreign oil.\n       However, the infrastructure to refuel vehicles capable of \n     running on ethanol is woefully inadequate. Currently, only \n     about 830 of the 170,000 gasoline stations in America offer \n     E-85 for sale. Expanding availability of this, and other \n     renewable, domestic fuel sources, can help reduce our \n     dependence on imported petroleum.\n       The Thune-Salazar legislation would create an Energy \n     Security Fund within the Department of the Treasury. The Fund \n     would use moneys collected from CAFE program fines and \n     penalties toward a grant program for investment in \n     alternative fuel infrastructure. Furthermore, the Thune-\n     Salazar proposal is similar to legislation that passed \n     earlier this year in the House by a vote of 355-9.\n       Automakers support this legislation as sound public policy \n     to spur development of an infrastructure for the distribution \n     of alternative fuels. It is an important piece of legislation \n     that deserves passage before the Senate concludes its \n     business for the year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frederick L. Webber,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition and the National \nAssociation of Convenience Stores, representing the fuel retailers \nacross this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                           Convenience Stores,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, August 3, 2006.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Thune and Salazar: On behalf of the 2,200 \n     retail member companies of the National Association of \n     Convenience Stores (NACS), I would like to commend you for \n     your dedication to promoting a more stable motor fuels market \n     for America's consumers and for recognizing the challenges \n     that face the nation's motor fuels retailers with the \n     introduction of alternative fuel products.\n       As you know, many of the alternative fuels available today \n     have chemical properties that necessitate certain adjustments \n     to the current distribution and storage infrastructure. These \n     adjustments can cost substantial amounts. For example, to \n     accommodate the alternative fuel E-85, many retailers must \n     either retrofit existing underground storage tank systems or \n     install new systems. This can be extremely costly, ranging \n     from $40,000 to more than $200,000 in some markets. \n     Therefore, NACS supports your amendment that will provide \n     additional funding through the Clean Cities Program for \n     alternative fuel infrastructure grants.\n       It is important to note, however, that while these \n     infrastructure grant programs will help offset the cost of \n     converting a retail facility to accommodate an alternative \n     fuel, there are other factors a retailer must consider before \n     making such an investment. These include whether there is the \n     physical capacity to store and dispense an additional fuel \n     product without compromising the availability of traditional \n     fuels, whether the level of consumer demand for the \n     alternative fuel justifies the investment, and whether the \n     alternative fuel can be offered for sale at a price that is \n     competitive with traditional fuels on a miles per dollar \n     basis. These considerations will be determined by individual \n     retailers based upon conditions within their own markets.\n       The underlying bill, H.R. 5534, was recently approved by \n     the House of Representatives by a vote of 355-9. Your \n     amendment, which seeks to balance competing priorities to \n     increase the likelihood that the proposed ``Energy Security \n     Fund'' will be signed into law, will facilitate the \n     introduction of alternative fuels to the marketplace by \n     addressing one of the major challenges facing petroleum \n     retailers. NACS applauds your efforts to help address the \n     costs associated with alternative fuels infrastructure. Thank \n     you for your continued support of the nation's convenience \n     and petroleum retailers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John Eichberger,\n     Vice President, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Ethanol\n\n\n                                            Vehicle Coalition,\n\n                               Jefferson City, MO, August 9, 2006.\n     Hon. John Thune.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thune: As you know, the National Ethanol \n     Vehicle Coalition (NEVC) promotes the use of 85 percent \n     ethanol (E85) as a renewable, alternative transportation \n     fuel. Our membership comprises a wide array of interests \n     including ethanol producers, automakers, and health and \n     agricultural organizations--all of which are working together \n     to increase deployment of E85 refueling infrastructure \n     nationally.\n       I am writing to express our support for the Senate version \n     of H.R. 5534, legislation to establish a federal grant \n     program for alternative fuel infrastructure. Your proposal \n     incorporates an idea originally put forth by the NEVC to use \n     penalties collected from the Corporate Average Fuel Economy \n     (CAFE) program to promote alternative transportation fuels. \n     This legislation would advance both the NEVC's efforts to \n     make E85 a viable transportation fuel nationally and the CAFE \n     program's explicit goal of reducing energy consumption by \n     cars and light trucks.\n       We also understand the Secretary of Energy would have broad \n     authority to allocate grants authorized under this bill and \n     that the sponsors intend for the Department of Energy to \n     maximize its benefit for the driving public. Unfortunately, \n     the legislation does not prioritize funding for the most \n     viable and prevalent alternative fuels or include any \n     requirements for grant recipients to market or even sell \n     these fuels. Without such clarification, it remains unclear \n     how much funding will go towards deployment of E85 and how \n     many E85 pumps will be placed in service. Therefore, we \n     believe it essential for Congress to provide dedicated \n     funding for E85 national deployment in Fiscal Year 2007.\n       We appreciate your understanding of the important role the \n     NEVC plays in providing critical technical and marketing \n     assistance and we look forward to continuing to work with you \n     to expand the use of alternative transportation fuels, \n     particularly E85.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Phillip J. Lampert,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, simply put, our substitute has no budgetary \nscore and simply authorizes future appropriations for the annual \npenalties collected each year from foreign automakers who violate CAFE \nstandards.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with \nSenator Salazar and me to clear this important measure. The House has \nagreed to take up and pass the Thune-Salazar substitute once it clears \nour Chamber, allowing the bill to be sent to the President for his \nsignature. In light of the very clear message from the American people \nthat they want Congress to do more to increase the availability of \nalternative fuels, I hope my colleagues drop any objections they have \nso this measure can be passed by the Senate.\n  If we look at the state of the renewable fuel industry today and the \nstate of our energy situation in this country, it is very clear that we \nneed to be doing more to promote the use of alternative energy and \nrenewable fuels.\n  If you look at the Energy bill that was passed last summer, it \nincluded a renewable fuels standard for the first time ever as a matter \nof policy for this country. We have in law a requirement that a certain \namount of renewable fuel--ethanol and other types of bioenergy--be \nused. Now, that creates a market for ethanol.\n  We also have on the other side, on the production side, a lot of \nethanol plants either currently in production or under construction. In \nfact, back in my State of South Dakota, we have 11 ethanol plants and 3 \nothers under construction. In just a few short months from now we will \nbe somewhere around a billion gallons of ethanol produced annually.\n  So we have the production side of it. Our ethanol production is \ngearing up. We have the market now, the renewable fuels standard we \npassed last year as a part of the Energy bill, which is something I \nthink was long overdue and much needed in terms of our energy policy in \nthis country.\n  What we have is a gap in the distribution system. We do not have \nenough retailers out there, convenience stores, filling stations, that \nmake E-85 available at the pump. In fact, there are 180,000 fuel \nretailers in this country, and of those only about 600 make E-85 \navailable at the pump.\n  So what we are talking about is dealing with what, in my view, is a \nreal sort of gap in our system; that is, making all that production \nthat is being brought on line available to consumers in this country \nwho really want to buy and use alternative fuels but do not have access \nto them because fuel retailers across this country simply do not want \nto deal with the cost of installing the pumps.\n  So what this bill does, the Thune-Salazar bill, is provide up to \n$30,000. The cost for installing a new E-85 pump is considered to be \nsomewhere between $40,000 and $200,000, depending on where you are in \nthe country. But the simple fact is, we think this incentive will go a \nlong way toward filling in that distribution gap so the ethanol \nproduction side of it, the supply side of it, can meet the demand; the \ndemand being, of course, the renewable fuels standard we passed last \nyear, as well as Americans' appetite for using renewable fuels and \nmoving increasingly away from our dependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  It makes perfect sense. We have an energy crisis in our country. \nPeople have reacted with extreme intensity toward $3-a-gallon gasoline. \nThey want to see us take steps that will make America energy \nindependent, that will provide American energy to meet the demands that \nwe have out there in the marketplace, to continue to drive our economy, \nto provide fuel for those who travel long distances.\n  I will say, in my State of South Dakota, we are a predominantly \nagricultural State. We are a State that relies heavily upon tourism. We \ndrive long distances. We are a big user of fuels to get to where we \nneed to go, to get to our destinations--whether it is part of our \neconomy to get to jobs, the marketplace, whether it is farmers in the \nfield or ranchers, or whether it is, again, tourism, which is an \nimportant component in our State's economy.\n  For all these very obvious reasons, we need policies that will make \nrenewable fuels more available to more people in this country. Today, \nas I said,\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\nthere is a point in that distribution system that has been closed off. \nWe have the production over here, the ethanol plants under \nconstruction, and those that are already fully operating that are \nproducing more and more ethanol. And we have, again, the demand side, \nconsumers who want to use renewable energy. And we have the renewable \nfuels standard we passed last summer as part of our policy. There is \nnow a requirement for many of our States to get in compliance with that \npolicy.\n\n  What we are missing right now is at the fuel retailer level. This is \nan opportunity to address that, to do something that is meaningful \nabout lessening our dependence upon foreign sources of energy, about \nusing more American energy, and meeting what is a very serious need in \nour economy.\n  So, again, I would refer people to the letters I have included in the \nRecord. We have auto manufacturers in this country that are \nincreasingly--you see more and more production of E-85, or what they \ncall flex-fuel vehicles, those vehicles that can use E-85. I have to \nsay, our bill does not preclude other alternative sources of energy \nfrom the pumps being installed, from them offering other energy other \nthan E-85.\n  But I think it is fair to say there is a growing demand in this \ncountry for E-85. There are more and more flex-fuel cars being \nmanufactured in America today, as evident from the letter from the \nAlliance of Automobile Manufacturers. But all the car companies in this \ncountry are building more and more cars that are flex-fuel vehicles \nthat could use E-85.\n  The simple fact is, they cannot get access to the fuel because it \ndoes not exist, because we do not have the number of pumps that are \nnecessary out there to provide people in this country who want to use \nrenewable energy and want to use E-85 the opportunity to do that.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we have E-85 pumps installed in most of \nthe cities across the State. Where that has been true, the cost of E-85 \nis somewhere from 50 cents a gallon less to up to $1 a gallon less, in \nplaces such as Aberdeen, SD.\n  But the simple reality is, we could do a lot to help ease the \npressure on fuel prices in this country. We could do a lot to lessen \nour dependence upon foreign sources of energy. We could do a lot to \nmeet the demand that American consumers have for using renewable \nenergy. But today we have this gap in the distribution system, and we \nneed to address that.\n  This is such a straightforward piece of legislation. It is so clear \nand obvious that it is supported--broadly supported--with, as I said, a \nbig bipartisan vote of 355 to 9 coming out of the House of \nRepresentatives. We have holds on it in the Senate. I do not know what \nthose holds are. The rules of the Senate, obviously, preclude us from \nknowing who has holds on bills. I, urge and plead with my colleagues on \nthe other side who are holding up this legislation to release those \nholds.\n  It is important. This is noncontroversial. It is broadly supported. \nIt is very necessary if we are going to follow through on the \ncommitment we made last summer in the renewable fuels standard we \npassed in the Energy bill to increase the use of renewable energy in \nthis country.\n  We have the production out there. These plants are coming on line. We \nhave car manufacturers that are making flex-fuel vehicles. We have a \nrenewable fuels standard in place that requires usage of a certain \namount of ethanol, renewable or E-85. We have consumers who I believe \nare very conscious of, again, lessening our dependence upon foreign \nsources of energy and supporting American-grown energy.\n  For all those reasons, this bill makes so much sense. I am at a loss \nto explain why anybody would put a hold on it. I understand there are \nlots of cross pressures in an election year, but I hope that will not \nget in the way of doing what is right for the country, following \nthrough on the commitment that was made last year in the Energy bill in \nthe renewable fuels standard, to put in place the distribution system, \nthe mechanism whereby people can have access to renewable energy, to \nethanol, E-85, other types of alternative fuels that would be made \navailable under this legislation by allowing these fuel retailers to \ninstall the pumps that are necessary to deliver it to the American \npeople.\n  Again, as I said, I have a letter from the National Association of \nConvenience Stores which represents all the fuel retailers across the \ncountry. It is important this legislation move, that it not get bogged \ndown, and it move before Congress adjourns at the end of next week for \nthe elections this year.\n  I know my colleague from Colorado is here. He has been a great \nadvocate and supporter of this legislation. I enjoyed very much the \nopportunity to work with him on this legislation. I think he is as \nfrustrated as I am at some of the secret holds that have been put on \nthis bill. But, again, I would urge my colleagues in this Chamber, and \nthose on the other side who have been obstructing and stopping this \nfrom moving forward, to release those holds.\n  There may be other issues associated with this legislation that I am \nnot aware of, but the reality is that this bill, on the merits, is \nbroadly supported in both Chambers by both parties. It is a necessary \npart of our energy policy in this country. It is high time, for the \ngood of the American people, that we get it passed.\n  The Senator from Colorado is here. I am sure he wants to take some \ntime to speak to this issue. But I appreciate his support and hard work \nto get it to where we are today. I know he shares my interest in \ngetting the holds released and being able to proceed forward.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield back my time to allow the Senator from \nColorado to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my comments, Senator Leahy be recognized for his comments on \nthe pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the pending business? Is there \npending business, might I inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently on the motion to proceed, on \nwhich cloture has been invoked.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. Does the Senator know how long he might \nspeak?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I intend to speak for probably 10 \nminutes. And I don't know what my friend from Vermont planned on, how \nmuch time he will consume after my statement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I tell my friends from Colorado and \nAlabama, I certainly would not consume more time than that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, Mr. President, I want to talk on a slightly \ndifferent issue, so I would accept that and withdraw any objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama and the \nPresiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, let me, at the outset, say that I very much appreciate \nthe work we have done on the alternative fuels legislation that Senator \nThune and I have been sponsoring and advocating. I would hope it is \nlegislation we can move forward to yet in this Congress. I think when \nwe look at the issues that are confronting our world, from the issues \nof terrorism, to the issues of energy independence, there is an \nopportunity for us to do something significant that will move us down \nthat track of energy independence.\n  Last year, in the passage of the 2005 Energy Policy Act, we acted \ntogether in a bipartisan way to move that legislation forward. I am \nhopeful the legislation Senator Thune and I have been sponsoring will, \nin fact, be legislation that can, in fact, become law and reach the \nPresident's desk as a result of the work of this Congress. I appreciate \nhis work and his advocacy in trying to find out where the problems lie \nwith respect to this particular bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to turn my attention and remarks to the \nborder fencing bill, H.R. 6061, which is before the Senate today.\n  First, let me say that as I look at where we have gotten today with \nrespect to immigration reform in this\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\nCongress and here in America, we are now at the point where we are \nplaying political games and gimmicks and tricks with what is a very \nimportant national security issue.\n  At the heart of the immigration reform debate, which has consumed so \nmuch of our time in this Senate and this country over the last year, we \nrecognized it is in America's national security interests for us to \ndevelop a comprehensive immigration reform package. We recognized, as \nwell, that we are a nation of laws, and as a nation of laws we should \nbe enforcing our immigration laws in the United States of America. And, \nfinally, we recognized there is a reality of 12 million undocumented \nworkers who live somewhere in the shadows of this society and that we \nought to move forward and create a realistic program that addresses \nthose 12 million human beings who live in the United States of America \ntoday.\n  Yet somehow today we have gotten away from that comprehensive \napproach to immigration reform, to look at what is a 1-percent \nsolution. It is a small part of the solution that we need to deal with \nfor immigration reform. Yet it has been chosen that we move forward to \ndiscuss this issue because there are political agendas at stake. It is \nthe House Republican leadership that has refused to go along with the \ncomprehensive approach which President Bush and this Senate have \nadvocated, which has resulted in us coming to the point where we are \nnow talking about a fence-only bill to deal with this very complex \nissue of immigration reform which has gone unaddressed by this country \nand by this Congress decade after decade.\n  President Bush, himself, in his address on August 3, 2006--this \nyear--said:\n\n       I'm going to talk today about comprehensive immigration \n     reform.\n\n  This was just a month ago--6, probably 8 weeks ago, where he said:\n\n       I say comprehensive because unless you have all five pieces \n     working together it's not going to work at all.\n\n  That was the President of the United States.\n  Earlier on, the President had said:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, \n     because all elements of this problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be solved at all.\n\n  Again, this is President George Bush, former Governor of Texas, who \nhas been working on this immigration issue for a long time. He, as \nPresident, reached that conclusion. He said:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, \n     because all elements of this problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be solved at all. Congress can \n     pass a comprehensive bill for me to sign into law.\n\n  Unfortunately, we appear to be failing in getting a comprehensive \nimmigration reform package to the President that he can sign. Instead, \nwe have devolved to the point where there is a piece of legislation \nwhich the House of Representatives has passed which is a fence-only \nbill. This fence-only bill is only a very small part of the solution we \nface to this very complex problem.\n  From my point of view, it is a cop-out and a political gimmick being \nplayed on the people of the United States. Let me remind people that it \nwas not so long ago that in this Chamber, by a large bipartisan \nmajority, Democrats and Republicans came together and said we can pass \na comprehensive immigration reform package that addresses the issues \nthat the President and the country want to be addressed in immigration \nreform. It was a law-and-order bill, which we enacted out of this \nSenate. It was a bill that dealt in a straightforward manner with \nborder security, with enforcement of immigration laws, and also \napplying penalties and registration to those people who had come \nforward from the shadows and registered to take them out of the \nshadows.\n  I want to briefly review the comprehensive nature of that bill and \nsome of the components that caused me to support the bill as the right \nway for us to address immigration reform.\n  First, we said we would do border security. We are not afraid to do \nthat. We ought to do border security because it is our right as a \nsovereign nation to do border security. It is our right to make sure \nthat we are protecting America against terrorism coming across our \nborders.\n  For us, as we worked on that comprehensive bill, border security was \nvery important. In our legislation we added 12,000 new Border Patrol \nagents. We created additional border fences--in fact, a 370-mile \nfence--through an amendment authored by my friend from Alabama. We \nprovided new criminal penalties for construction of border tunnels, \nwhich we find in places where there are fences today. We added new \ncheckpoints and points of entry throughout the border between Mexico \nand the U.S. We expanded exit-entry security systems at all land \nborders and airports.\n  So, yes, this legislation was a very tough border security bill. It \nwas part of the comprehensive approach that we took.\n  Secondly, we said that it is not enough to just strengthen our \nborders. We need to do more in terms of what we do inside our country. \nWe said we would do more with respect to immigration law enforcement. \nInstead of continuing the patterns and practices of looking the other \nway in this country, we said we as a nation of laws are going to \nenforce our immigration laws.\n  We said we would add 5,000 new investigators in our legislation. We \nsaid we would establish 20 new detention facilities. We said we would \nreimburse States for detaining and imprisoning criminal aliens. We \nwould require a faster deportation process. We would increase penalties \nfor gang members, for money laundering, and for human trafficking. We \nwould increase document fraud detection. We would create, very \nimportantly, new fraud-proof immigration documents with biometric \nidentifiers. And we would expand authority to remove suspected \nterrorists from our country.\n  So it was tough in terms of our saying that as a nation of laws we \nwill enforce the laws. We didn't stop there. We said there is something \nelse that needs to be dealt with in America--those 12 million people \nwho are cleaning hotel rooms, working out at the construction sites, \nand the people who probably provided you with your breakfast this \nmorning. There are those 12 million people here who are human beings, \nand we need to deal with them in a humane and moral fashion.\n  We said to them that we will require there to be some punishment and \nregistration with respect to your presence in the United States of \nAmerica. You must go to the back of the line, and, eventually, over a \nlong 12-year period, after we put you in this period of ``purgatory,'' \nyou may end up becoming a citizen.\n  We said we would require a fine for their illegal conduct of several \nthousand dollars. We would require them to register with the U.S. \nGovernment. I don't have to register with the U.S. Government; I am a \ncitizen. We are requiring these people to register with the Government. \nWe require them to obtain a temporary work visa. We require them to pay \nan additional $1,000 fee. We require them to go to the back of the line \nof the legal immigration process. We require them to pass a background \ncheck so we would make sure they would all be crime-free.\n  We would require that they learn English. We would require them to \nlearn history and government. We would require them to pass a medical \nexam. We would require them to prove continuous employment with a valid \ntemporary visa.\n  Mr. President, that was a comprehensive immigration reform law that \nwas passed by a bipartisan group of Senators in this Senate, and it is \nlegislation that we should be proud of.\n  Today, we are being asked to forget that work we did, forget the \ncomprehensive nature of that reform, and to take a simple piece of \nlegislation on a fence and say that we have dealt with the immigration \nproblem of our country.\n  That is simply, again, a piecemeal approach to dealing with the \nissue, a political gimmick being used in this election year. It is a \ngimmick that we should stand together as United States Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, and reject it and say we are going to \nmove forward with comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Finally, with respect to this fence, when you look at what people \nhave said about the fence, some have said it reminds them of the Berlin \nWall. Some have said that it is un-American. But I would like to quote \nfrom some of the members of the administration who,\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\nfrankly, have been working with us on a comprehensive immigration \nreform package. Secretary of Homeland Defense, Mr. Chertoff, said:\n\n       Fencing has its place in some areas, but as a total \n     solution, I don't think it's a good total solution.\n\n  We had a fence in our comprehensive reform bill, but it was not this \nfence that essentially creates a fence all across the wide chasm of \nArizona and most of Texas.\n  Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said this about the fence:\n\n       I think that's contrary to our traditions.\n\n  He noted that ``99.9 percent'' of illegal immigrants ``come across to \nseek a better life for their families,'' not to make trouble.\n  That was his quote with respect to the fence.\n  He also said:\n\n       I don't know if that would make much sense. We've got a \n     2,000-mile border. Because of natural geography, we don't \n     need a fence or border along certain portions of that border.\n\n  Yet, today we are looking at legislation proposed in the form of H.R. \n6061 that would create a fence-only solution to this very complicated \nproblem we are facing.\n  In conclusion, I believe Americans deserve better from the U.S. \nCongress and from us in the Senate. We can, in fact, move forward with \ncomprehensive immigration reform and deal with this issue of national \nsecurity importance, of economic security importance, and of the moral \nimportance of how we deal with the 12 million human beings who live in \nAmerica today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                          Military Commissions\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Colorado and my \nfriend from Alabama for their usual courtesy.\n  Over the last couple of weeks, the President, as Presidents do, used \nhis pulpit to inform the Senate that his top priority was fixing the \nproblem he created when he unilaterally proclaimed what laws govern \nmilitary commissions. This newfound desire, this last-minute conversion \nto the idea of working with Congress, stands in stark contrast to his \nposition in 2002, when a number of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nreached out to the administration and asked the President to work with \nus to establish the authority for fair and effective military \ncommissions.\n  Four years later, after saying flat out, no, now the administration's \ngo-it-alone plan has succeeded in having no terrorist military \ncommission trials completed and no convictions. They are ``tough on \nterror,'' but nobody has been convicted.\n  Still, Congress set to work and the Armed Services Committee last \nweek reported a bill that is supported by Republicans and Democrats to \nauthorize military commissions. They worked with the professionals in \nthe military, and listened to them. But this week the Senate Republican \nleadership has threatened to filibuster that bill, which came from a \nRepublican-controlled committee and was voted for by both Republicans \nand Democrats.\n  I am a little bit confused. I have been here for 32 years, and I \ndon't always follow exactly what is going on. But as I understand it, \nlast week, the leadership was demanding immediate action on military \ncommissions, saying they were going to be the Senate's No. 1 priority. \nAll of a sudden, they are going to filibuster that. Just last year, the \nsame leadership could not be more critical of what it called \nleadership-led partisan filibusters on the Democratic side. But \napparently they are a great idea when led on the Republican side, even \non legislation they supported--or said they did--in the present \nconference.\n  This week, the priority is a 700-mile fence along the southern border \nand a study to do the same thing along the northern border. It is \ngetting hard to keep track of their real priorities.\n  In the Spring, the majority leader praised and voted for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. The President supported it. The \nmajority leader stood with Senators on both sides of the aisle and \nsupported that bill. Now, he seems ready to throw our work over the \nside and abandon our principles.\n  If there is an opportunity for Senate floor time, why not use it \ninstead to put an end to the ongoing war profiteering and contracting \nfraud in Iraq? Why not help those suffering from Hurricane Katrina? Why \nnot pass a Federal budget? We are required by law to do that in April; \nit is now late September. Let's show the American people we will obey \nthe law and pass one. Or we can consider the remaining appropriations \nbills; most have to be completed by next Saturday. Why not work on \nlowering health care costs? That would get a great cheer from everybody \nin my State. Or we can work on health insurance costs, fuel costs, or \nthe rising costs of interest rates and mortgage rates.\n  The bill before us was rushed through the House of Representatives; \nit is not ready for consideration on the Senate floor. It has had no \ncommittee hearings whatsoever in the Senate. It is completely different \nthan what the Senate passed, with Republicans and Democrats voting for \nit just a few months ago. I don't know why we could not have worked in \nthe normal way we have done for a couple hundred years here and worked \nout the bills we had. Actually, this is an issue on which the President \ncould be of help and show some leadership. He stated privately that he \npreferred the bill we passed, and it would be nice to hear him support \nit publicly.\n  Along with a bipartisan majority of Senators, I voted for a far more \nmeasured version of a physical barrier on the southern border. In doing \nso, we demonstrated our commitment to border security.\n  The Senate bill has a provision calling for 370 miles of fencing in \nthe most vulnerable high-traffic areas. That is what the White House \nrequested and recommended. That is what we were told the Secretary of \nHomeland Security wanted. It also had a provision, which makes a lot of \nsense, for consultation with the Mexican Government regarding any \nbuilding of new fences to help ease the tensions that come along with \nsuch a project. We don't have an awful lot of friends around the world \nand we should not work to lose any friendships from our neighbors. In \nthe Judiciary Committee, we also took into account the differences \nalong the northern border and the very close working relationship and \npersonal relationship with the Canadian Government, and kept out a \nstudy for a barrier on the northern border.\n  Look what we are debating today instead of all that. It is a hasty, \nill-considered, mean-spirited measure that will cost taxpayers billions \nof dollars. America can do a lot better than this. A wall of this \nmagnitude will be a scar on the landscape, a scar on a fragile desert \necosystem, and a scar on our legacy as a nation of immigrants. My \ngrandparents were immigrants; my parents-in-law were immigrants. What \ndoes a 700-mile barrier wall say about us as a free country?\n  Most troubling, this bill would give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity unfettered power to decide what laws to follow, but even more \nimportant, what laws to totally ignore. Read the bill.\n  Remember, it is the same Department of Homeland Security that just \nlast year was supposed to handle Katrina, one of the biggest \ngovernmental screw-ups in our lifetime. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity was supposed to have those people back a year later in their \nhomes. Instead, we are spending billions of dollars, most of which have \nbeen wasted; it has disappeared. What we do see are homes intended for \nthe victims of the Hurricane sitting in fields, empty and decaying.\n  This is the same Department of Homeland Security that has not managed \nto secure our ports, chemical plants, and our borders. It is the same \nDepartment of Homeland Security that the House of Representatives would \nentrust with unlimited power to ``take all actions the Secretary \ndetermines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain \noperational control over the entire international land and maritime \nborders of the United States.''\n  Mr. President, we don't create czars in this country. We fought a \nrevolution to get out of the dictatorial control of King George. We \nhave a constitutional form of government. We don't give one person the \npower to set aside any law they want.\n  I don't think any executive official, certainly not those who \nhorribly mismanaged our preparation for Katrina and our response to it, \nshould be given\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\none more blank check. How many more blank checks should we give away? \nWe have already given them to Halliburton in Iraq. We have given them \nto the Department of Homeland Security for Katrina.\n  Remember how this administration misinterpreted the authorization for \nuse of military force? We told them to get Osama bin Laden and they \nfailed miserably, even when they had him cornered. Instead, they say: \nWhat we really meant was, not to get Osama bin Laden, but that the \nPresident can violate the FISA law and secretly wiretap Americans \nwithout a warrant. It is like ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n\n  This is the same President who signs a law with his fingers crossed \nbehind his back and then issues a signing statement reserving to \nhimself the power to decide what laws to follow, and how and when.\n  Remember the law against torture? We all voted for that legislation. \nThe President signs a signing statement saying: However, I will \ndetermine how best to follow it.\n  This is the administration to which the Republican House wants to \ngive a blank check, even after Justice O'Connor and the Supreme Court--\nthe Supreme Court made up of seven Republicans out of the nine \nmembers--have reminded us our Constitution provides for checks and \nbalances, not a blank check for the administration.\n  As I said, instead of doing the job we should do--sitting down, \nhaving a conference, working this out, and actually voting on this \nlegislation--what do the Senate and House Republican leadership want to \ndo? Just give all the power to a Republican appointee, and we can all \ngo home and campaign for reelection. God bless America.\n  The only thing the House left out of its bill is calling this a war \non immigrants in which they view Secretary Chertoff as the commander in \nchief. Actually, I would like to see him take care of the problems in \nthis country, starting with Katrina.\n  Have the lives lost in Iraq and the billions of taxpayers' dollars \nunaccounted for, the tragedy of 9/11, and Katrina taught us nothing? \nEverything happened on this administration's watch: Iraq, 9/11, \nKatrina, and billions of tax dollars wasted trying to fix the messes \nthey created. How many more disastrous mistakes must this \nadministration make before even a Republican-controlled Congress \nrecognizes that abdicating our constitutional role and concentrating \npower in the executive branch is the wrong strategy for protecting the \nsecurity and rights of the American people? Do we need to create yet \nanother environment for crony contractors of the Bush-Cheney \nadministration to bilk taxpayers out of billions?\n  Five years of this administration's incompetence has left America's \nborders unsecured and our immigration system broken. We joined to pass \na bipartisan Senate bill with tough, practical, comprehensive \nimmigration reforms to secure the borders, enforce our laws, and fix \nour immigration system. We want to bring undocumented immigrants out of \nthe shadows. They are not just numbers; they are actual, real people--\nmothers, fathers, husbands, wives, children. The President and his \nadministration say that comprehensive immigration reform will make us \nsafer. I agree with the President on this issue. President Bush told \nthe American people he supports comprehensive immigration reform. I \ntold the public I agreed with him. So now, if he wants comprehensive \nimmigration reform, he has to tell the Republican leadership in \nCongress to stop obstructing it. They haven't even gone to a \nconference.\n  Nor do we need a study to determine whether we should build a barrier \nalong the 3,175 miles of the United States-Canada border. Heavens to \nBetsy, most of us who live up there go back and forth all the time. We \nare visiting our relatives, visiting our cousins. I have been visiting \nmy wife's relatives for years. When they come down, they are not \nterrorists, they are our neighbors whom we welcome to the United \nStates. As I said before, and I will say again, I have heard some \ncockamamie ideas in my time in the Senate, but this rises to the top.\n  The northern border is different. It spans the continent. It is the \nworld's longest and safest international boundary, and Canada is our \nmost important trading partner. Have we gone blind? It is clear to me \nthat those who want to build this barrier have no clue about the \ncharacter, the history, and the day-to-day commercial importance of the \nnorthern border and the needs of the States and communities that would \nbe affected. It is best to nip this foolishness in the bud before \nCongress wastes more tax dollars on another boneheaded stunt.\n  America can do better than this. The Senate has already pointed the \nway with a bipartisan, comprehensive approach. We need comprehensive \nreform that reflects America's values and which will actually work. The \nHouse bill we debate today will cost the taxpayers dearly, but it will \naccomplish little.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a question on how \nmuch time he would like? I would like to speak immediately following \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from California, I \nattempted to follow the Senator from Colorado, and Senator Leahy wanted \nto speak next.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't have a problem.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am thinking about 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is wonderful. I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the Senator's remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the question of fencing \nalong our southern border, I wish to make a couple of points.\n  Over 1 million people were apprehended last year along that border. \nOne million people coming in illegally were apprehended. Probably \nanother half million got through without being apprehended. Good fences \nmake good neighbors. It is time for us to bring lawfulness to that \nborder. I think the American people want that.\n  If somebody would like to know the differences between our parties \nand the differences of how we approach the question of having a lawful \nimmigration system in America, I suggest that my colleague--I enjoy \nworking with him a great deal on the Judiciary Committee.\n  My colleague referred to the legislation that we voted to move \nforward to consider--legislation that passed this Senate 94 to 3 to \nfund the fence on the border and passed 83 to 16 to authorize the fence \nto be constructed--as ``hasty, ill-considered, and mean-spirited.'' He \nthen went on to suggest Secretary Chertoff is conducting a war on \nimmigrants.\n  How much of a difference can we have here? How big a gulf? Do the \nAmerican people want us to just say nothing can be done one more time \nand just give up, or do they want us to take rational steps that would \nbring lawfulness to the border? I think they want us to do the latter. \nThey have been asking us to do that for some time, and the votes in \nthis Senate and the House of Representatives have been overwhelming in \nfavor of that approach.\n  My colleague says that we had hearings in the Senate and we had a \nSenate bill on the floor, and he implied--I thought he said that \nfencing was a part of that bill, but it wasn't really. It was my \namendment on the floor that moved that bill forward in a significant \nway. At any rate, we did discuss it, and there has been broad support \nboth in the committee and on the floor to proceed to that matter.\n\n  I just want to say, yes, we want comprehensive reform. No, we don't \nwant to end all immigration. The wall the Communists built in East \nGermany was to keep their citizens in East Germany, to keep them from \nfleeing their country so they could have freedom. That is quite \ndifferent from an attempt to maintain a legal flow of people into the \ncountry because we just can't accept everybody. This country cannot \naccept everybody who would like to come.\n  A recent poll in Nicaragua said 60 percent would come to the United \nStates in they could. A poll in Peru said as many as 70 percent would \ncome if they could. The whole world has millions and millions of people \nwho would like to come to this country. So we ought to set up a \nrational system, one that serves our national interest, one\n\n[[Page S9761]]\n\nthat is fair, and then enforce it, set up a system that works. As long \nas we have a wide-open border, without control and law, we are not \ndoing our duty. I don't think those of us in this Congress, in this \nSenate, want to go back home after we recess and say we didn't follow \nthrough on what probably most of us have been saying--that we do \nbelieve barriers are necessary.\n  The House has sent us a bill, not unlike the Senate bill that we \npassed 83 to 16 and we voted to fund 94 to 3. The bill I offered had \n370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of barriers. The House bill has \nabout 700 miles, I believe, of fencing and barriers and electronics. \nThere is not a lot of difference fundamentally between the two.\n  We now will have an opportunity to offer amendments to discuss \ndetails. Fundamentally, we need to take action. We need to do \nsomething. We don't need to go home again and wait until next year \nwithout any action.\n  Then when it comes to comprehensive reform, we need to bury the \nproposal we have that the Senate has considered and voted on, move that \naside, and come back next year with a fresh approach and create a \ncomprehensive plan for immigration that serves our national interest, \nthat is consistent with what our allies, such as Canada and Australia, \ndo, and consider what they do. If we do, we will come up with some good \nideas, and we will have something the American people can support.\n  If we gain some credibility with the American people by, first, \ntaking action toward enforcement, we will be able to do something good, \nbut it will have to be next year. There is no way this Senate should \naccept a rushed-through package before this election or after this \nelection in some lame-duck Congress that does not have a fresh look at \nour policy. I will resist that with every fiber of my being, but I will \nnot resist comprehensive reform because I think we need it.\n  I wanted to share those thoughts, Mr. President. I am pleased that we \njust had a unanimous vote to move forward to the fence bill the House \nhas passed. We will talk about it today and tomorrow.\n  I also serve on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services \nCommittee. We have had quite a lot of discussions on those two \ncommittees and now in Armed Services, in particular, about how to deal \nwith the effect of the Hamdan decision and how to make sure we are in \ncompliance with the Supreme Court opinion. I want to make a couple of \npoints.\n  The President thought and believed and his top lawyers advised him--\nhis top lawyers advised him--that the detainee interrogation program \nthat was being conducted, that they wanted to conduct, was producing \nsubstantial results for America, obtaining information that has \nthwarted attacks on America and saved lives, has provided information \nto identify that some of the people involved in 9/11--these are some of \nthe people who have admitted and we have evidence against to prove were \nactually complicitous in 9/11, coconspirators. The President has moved \nthose prisoners down to Guantanamo.\n  The interrogation process for those have been exhausted. They believe \nthey have obtained all the information they can expect to obtain. They \nneed to be tried for the crimes they have committed in a war they are \nconducting against the United States of America. They will be tried in \nthe forum in which they should be tried, in a forum provided for in the \nU.S. Constitution, in a military commission.\n  This is not a trial in the Southern District of New York for an \nAmerican citizen for bank fraud or drug dealing. This is a military \ncommission adjudication of whether these people are involved in a war \nagainst the United States that has resulted in the deaths of 3,000 \nAmerican citizens on 9/11 and other deaths since then. So he had a \nlegal opinion on that. They briefed it to him. And do you remember the \nPresident looking us in the eye right after 9/11, and he said just the \nother night, Monday night a week ago, I guess, on television, he looked \nthe American people in the eye and said: I am going to use every lawful \npower I have to defend the people of this country. That is my \nresponsibility, in effect, he was telling us, that is my duty, to \nprotect this country, and I am going to use every lawful power I have. \nAnd we cheered. And we said: Yes, sir. And we said: Mr. President, \ncatch those guys. Put your people out there and catch these terrorists \nwho have attacked our country and killed our innocent people and \ncrashed into the Trade Towers and run airplanes into them. Go get them. \nDo you remember that? Boy, I am telling you, people felt strongly about \nit.\n\n  So now what do we have? Oh, we have the complainers and the second-\nguessers. I just want to say this: I believe the President's program \nwas legal from the beginning. I have researched the law. I have been \ninvolved in this. I was a Federal prosecutor. I don't know everything, \nbut I have some understanding of it through both of the committees in \nwhich I have been involved, and I know they researched the law and they \nbelieved they were operating lawfully.\n  I remember the Ex parte Quirin case during World War II when \nPresident Roosevelt was President. They caught a group of saboteurs who \nwere let loose on the American homeland from a submarine, I believe it \nwas, and they came in and they planned sabotage against the American \npeople. Do you know what they did? And the Supreme Court approved this \nin the famous case Ex parte Quirin. They took them, they caught them, \nthey set up a commission, they tried them, and they executed most of \nthem in short order because this was not like some normal trial. These \nwere people coming into our country for the purpose of sabotaging this \ncountry, people whose motives and desires were to kill innocent men, \nwomen, and children, contrary to the laws of war--contrary to the laws \nof war, which do not allow for that. That is the big deal.\n  So the people who have been apprehended, the people who were being \ndetained and incarcerated and interrogated were not prisoners of war. \nThis is crystal clear. You can't execute prisoners of war the way we \nexecuted the Nazi saboteurs. Prisoners of war are entitled to all of \nthe protections of the Geneva Accords, and they have to be provided \ngreat protections and great advantages, really, and we adhere to that, \nwe adhere to that today, and we always have. It was been taught to \nevery soldier in America.\n  But these are unlawful combatants. They sneak around. They don't wear \nuniforms. They don't carry their weapons openly. And their goal and \ntactic is to utilize terror and slaughter innocent men, women, and \nchildren to promote their agenda. That is not a soldier. A soldier can \ndrop a bomb on a military target, but a soldier can't shoot because it \nmay unfortunately result in someone being killed. But a soldier can't \ndeliberately have his policy to kill women and children and \nnoncombatants. Otherwise, they are an unlawful combatant, not a lawful \ncombatant, and they have been considered not to have been covered by \nthe Geneva Accords.\n  But the Supreme Court, in my opinion fundamentally reversing the \nQuirin case, which the President relied on, came along and said that in \nHamdan, Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to these \nterrorists and that we need some more rules and regulations with regard \nto how to try them to create a just trial.\n  OK. So what did the President do? Did he act unilaterally and say: I \nam not going to do it, I am not going to comply with the Supreme Court. \nYes, he previously said he thought what he was doing was proper. No. \nWhat did the President say? He said: Congress, let's review Hamdan. We \nare sending you some proposals which will clarify what we can do with \ninterrogations, which will fix the concerns about trying these unlawful \ncombatants, and I want you to act on that, and we need to do it quickly \nbecause we need to continue to interrogate terrorists and we need to \ntry those people who are responsible for the deaths of American \ncitizens on 9/11. That is not a seizing of power--some dictator. That \nis not someone who comes along and says: It has to be my way or the \nhighway.\n  So we have a group of Senators now on the Armed Services Committee \nwho say: Well, they have their own plan and they have researched the \nlaw and they don't want to do what the President says. They want to do \nit their way. OK. This is what Congress is all about.\n  I agree with the President. From what I understand of the situation, \nI\n\n[[Page S9762]]\n\nam supporting the President's view. But I know people have different \nviews, and I am willing to listen to those concerns. If we can reach an \naccord that I feel good about and the President feels good about and \nthe Senators objecting who have their own agenda can agree to, that \nwould be wonderful. But there are a couple of things that have to \nhappen.\n  We cannot end our interrogation procedures that have been so \neffective. General Hayden, the Director of the CIA, has told us and \npleaded with us that if we adopt the proposal the Senators have \nfavored--and it was voted out of the Armed Services Committee--he is \ngoing to have to stop the program. Wow. He is going to have to stop \nthat program. So we don't want to do that, surely. I mean, this is a \nman of integrity and ability and experience. He has talked to his \npeople who conduct these interrogations. They are not torturing anyone. \nWe have a statute that prohibits the torture of anyone--Federal law. \nPeople can go to jail for that. It defines what torture is in very \nexplicit terms. If somebody has proof that our people have tortured \nsomebody, well, let's bring them up and try them. But let's not \noverreach here.\n  We are in a dangerous world. The leader in Iran recently said that \nhis goal was to see the United States of America bow down before Iran, \nin a public address. How about that? We have nonstate extremists \ncommitted to death and destruction around the world through suicidal \nattacks, and they represent a real threat to the peace and dignity of \nthe whole world. So this is not an itty-bitty matter.\n\n  There are two things that have to be done, and we should do them \nbefore we adjourn. The two things are as follows: We need to establish \nthe rules for interrogations because if you read through the lines, if \nyou read through the lines, what you will hear those agents saying is: \nWe thought we were serving you. We thought we were following all these \nrules the lawyers told us to. But we were using what we thought were \nlegal tactics and techniques to interrogate prisoners, and we have \nobtained great and valuable information which will help protect our \ncountry, which has helped us identify people who attacked us on 9/11, \nwhich has thwarted attacks. We have done all of these things. That is \nwhat we thought you wanted us to do, Congress. Now you tell us we are \nsome sort of beasts and that we have done all these things wrong and we \nought to be sued. And many of our people are being sued right now--\n400--by terrorists, and we are going to accuse them of being less than \nAmerican. They put their lives on the line in some of the most \ndangerous areas of this globe to capture these terrorists. And they are \nsaying: OK, Congress, you tell us.\n  That is what I read General Hayden to be saying. He didn't say that \nexactly, but he speaks for those agents of his. And they are having to \ntake out insurance policies against lawsuits because they expect to be \nsued more by terrorists. Where did this happen--in a war, we have \nlawsuits?\n  I am suggesting that this matter is no light deal. We do not need to \nmake a mistake and destroy the morale of those who have served us so \nably, with so much fidelity and courage and hard work. We need to fix \nthis, and we need to allow them to utilize legitimate techniques. Some \nof those have the ability to stress an individual for a period of time \nbut not torture. That is against the law. That is illegal. It is not \nagainst the treaties we have signed. We can do that, but we don't need \nto go too far.\n  The next thing is, it is time to get on with the trial of the people \nwho attacked us, in a military format because it was a military attack \non us. Al-Qaida, you remember, bin Laden declared war on the United \nStates of America for years before 9/11. He attacked our warship, the \nUSS Cole, he attacked our embassies in Africa, and there have been \nother attacks. We are in a state of hostilities with al-Qaida directly, \nand we have authorized those hostilities by the Congress of the United \nStates. So they are rightly to be tried not in the Southern District of \nNew York, not in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, \nthey are to be tried in a military commission as an extension of the \nmilitary campaign, the war we are conducting.\n  The military commissions are not the same as trials, I have to tell \nmy colleagues. They are just not. It is a different animal. Because we \nare Americans, we want to be sure that even those terrorists we try are \nnot unjustly convicted, that the evidence against them is legitimate \nand that it proves their guilt to the required degree, and only then \nshould they be punished, as opposed to just being detained, actually \npunished for the crimes they committed. But it does not require that we \nmeet the standard of Federal district court.\n  Let me just say these two things. We have made mistakes before. This \ntime we are in now, we have the newspapers all excited, saying we have \nabused prisoners. We have leftist groups and world interest groups, and \nthey have all said we are abusing prisoners and Guantanamo is horrible. \nWell, I have been to Guantanamo twice, and it is not horrible. They are \ntreating those prisoners fairly and decently. They are not being \ntortured. Anybody who abuses prisoners is being disciplined.\n  They said: Well, you abused prisoners in Abu Ghraib. Well, they have \nbeen tried and sent to jail, the American soldiers who participated in \nthat. They put them in jail. And it was not part of any interrogation. \nWhat they did was just an abuse of those prisoners for their own \namusement, their own sick feelings or ideas. They were not \ninterrogators. They were not interrogating them. They were not \nfollowing any rules of interrogation. They were just abusing prisoners. \nAnd we have tried them and convicted them and sent them to jail. The \nfact that they did that was discovered by the military itself. Our \nmilitary has done its level best to treat prisoners fairly and justly, \nand it is a slander on them to continually suggest that is not so. \nPeople from all over the world have gone to Guantanamo.\n  So I want to say this warning. I am going to watch this legislation. \nEven if the President agrees to it, I am going to read it. I don't know \nwhat they are talking about now. I haven't seen the latest negotiations \nbetween the Armed Services Committee and the White House. I want to \ngive this warning. It wasn't too many years ago that people in the \nCongress and in the news media and the world groups all raised cain, \nand they said that CIA agents were out talking to bad guys, people who \nhad criminal records, and they were paying them money to be informants \nfor them. And some of them had actually killed people, and this was \nhorrible. The CIA couldn't have that judgment call to make anymore, and \nthey should never again associate themselves with people with criminal \nhistories. The people said: This is going too far.\n  Many times, the only people who know anything are people who are \nparticipating in it. You have to get the information wherever you can \nget the intelligence. No, the Congress said, listening to the media, \nlistening to the ACLU-type groups. No, no. We have to crack down on our \nagents and make sure they don't deal with people with criminal records. \nSo we passed a law that banned that.\n  Then they said: Well, you know, the CIA can gather information \ndifferently than the FBI. We don't know what they might gather, so we \nhave to create a wall between the CIA and the FBI, and the CIA can't \nshare information with the FBI--not to prosecute somebody--just to find \nout what is going on. In this country, when they find out from foreign \nintelligence that someone is threatening the security of America, they \nare not able to share that information readily. I suppose they were \ntrying to mollify the news media and the activist groups and those who \nare always complaining. Maybe they did, in the short run. But do you \nremember what happened after 9/11? I remember. We said we didn't have \nenough intelligence. Why didn't we know this was happening to our \ncountry? Why didn't we know?\n\n  We began to look at it and see what was happening. Both of these \nissues--they were passed in a fit of morality or trying to go overboard \nto prove we were good and decent people. They went back and found both \nof these tactics, the wall between the FBI and the CIA and the ban on \nagents talking to dangerous people with criminal records were bad, and \nwe promptly reversed them. Can you imagine that? So we threw them out.\n  All I am saying is we need to watch this deal coming forward to the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\ntoday. We do not need to go too far. We have laws against torture. We \nhave laws that require us to treat prisoners with decency and respect \nin accordance with the Geneva Conventions. But there are things we can \ndo consistent with our law and consistent with our treaties. It would \nbe a mistake for us to unilaterally, out of some sort of attempt to \nplacate opinion around the world or the opinions of those who dislike \nus, to adopt restrictions on our capabilities that go beyond what the \nlaw requires. How silly would that be.\n  It might not make a difference in this case, because he has already \nconfessed, but what cases are we going to see in the future? What other \nthreats will this country have? I, for one, am not going to participate \nin unilaterally hamstringing the ability of our military and our \nintelligence agencies to do their job, to protect America consistent \nwith our law, consistent with our heritage, consistent with the \ntreaties which we signed.\n  It is a tough call. The matters are very complicated. I respect \npeople on both sides, but I am telling you we need to be careful. We \ndon't need to make the mistakes we did when Frank Church was running \nthe Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate and we made a lot of \nerrors, and other errors we made over the years.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to share these thoughts as we \ncontinue to wrestle with how to establish interrogation rules and \ntrials of those who have attacked our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                               After 9/11\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from \nAlabama. He brought us back to 9/11 and that is where I am going to \nstart in my remarks right now, on a dreadful day when we saw the \nPentagon in flames right here from the Capitol and we ran down those \nfront steps and it was the bluest of skies and we were looking for \nFlight 93, was it coming our way? We all vowed to go get the people who \nattacked us.\n  I came down to this floor and with a heart full of grief. Every one \nof those planes was going to my State. I voted to go get the \nterrorists. Go get al-Qaida. Go to war against Osama bin Laden. I am \nsorry to say that, for whatever reason--and we are beginning to learn \nmore about it--based on misinformation, faulty information, skewed \ninformation, we turned around and we took our resources, great \nresources and the greatest men and women in the military, and we went \ninto Iraq.\n  The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee now tells us \nunequivocally there was never one connection between al-Qaida and \nSaddam Hussein. Remember all the talk and all the chatter from the Vice \nPresident and the President and Condi Rice? Remember when Donald \nRumsfeld said we know where those weapons are? I remember sitting \nliterally 8 feet from Donald Rumsfeld, asking him where the weapons of \nmass destruction were. And he said, Oh, they are all around Baghdad. \nYou go down the street, take the left, turn to the right--there they \nare.\n  No. No. Now we have a circumstance where, because of the great work \nof our intelligence community, we have brought back people, some of \nwhom were involved--that is what we believe--in 9/11. Right now we do \nnot have a system in place so they can meet their just reward because \nthe Supreme Court said Congress has to act and set up a tribunal in a \nway that respects the Geneva Conventions--this is very important.\n  We have three Senators with distinguished military careers on the \nother side of the aisle, who have said: Whatever we do we must not \njeopardize our troops. Therefore, we must make sure that we do not do \nanything to change the Geneva Conventions. What do they get for thanks \nfrom those who have never seen combat?\n  My husband served in the military. I know what it is like to sit and \nwait, because he was 6 years in the Army Reserves, asking, Will he be \ncalled? Won't he be called? We were fortunate. Senator McCain was not \nthat fortunate. He was a prisoner of war. He, John Warner, and Lindsey \nGraham, who was an attorney in the military, are guiding us to write \nsomething that makes sense so that we can try these people. And if in \nfact they are guilty, they can meet their just reward.\n  They get people on their own side of the aisle calling them out. I \nthink it is outrageous. To quote the Senator from Alabama:\n\n       People who don't agree with the President on this, they are \n     slandering the military.\n\n  I can't believe it. It is basically like swiftboating Senator McCain \nand Senator Warner. It is unbelievable.\n  Who would you trust, I ask the people of America, on this military \nmatter? People who never served a day in combat or people who put their \nlife on the line? And then to hear them slandered in this way on the \nfloor of the Senate--not by name, but by inference--is very \ndisheartening. And to see a Republican do it to a Republican? I don't \nget it. I don't get it.\n  I hope we can come together to make sure we have a good plan in place \nbecause if we do not have a good plan in place, what good does it do \nus? It doesn't do us any good if we don't have a plan in place that \npasses the legal test, because it will be thrown out by the courts and \nwe will be back to square one and we will not be able to try these \npeople in the way they ought to be tried.\n  I come here to say thank you to those Senators who stepped out and \nsaid: Wait a minute; we want to do this right, Mr. President. Work with \nus. We want to do it right.\n  I think we have had enough. We have had enough of swiftboating around \nhere, and it has to stop in America. It has to stop in America.\n  I want to go back to 9/11 because when I voted to go after the \nterrorists, that is what I thought this Government was going to do. I \nthought they would throw all the resources at it. We went into \nAfghanistan. We freed the people there. I was proud. I went to my \nAfghan-American community and I was so happy for those people. They saw \nlight. And we shorted that. We shorted them. We don't have enough \ntroops there.\n  You know what is happening even in Kabul now. You are seeing attacks \non women and girls, you are seeing murders. The poppy trade is growing. \nThis was our opportunity to not only find Osama bin Laden, who was \nthere, but also to make Afghanistan a model of democracy that the \nPresident is always talking about. He stood up at the United Nations--\nsome of the things he said I really believe were correct. But one of \nthe things that was not correct is when he said: We need democracy; \ntake a look at what we have done in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I can tell you, anyone with a television set looks at what is \nhappening in Iraq and says: Oh, my God, it's close to civil war. He \nputs that picture in our minds next to the word democracy? That is not \ngoing to help people. People looking around the world at that say, You \nknow what? I really want democracy, but if my country is going to look \nlike this, count me out.\n  It is just not real, Mr. President. It is not real. Just like it is \nnot real to go after three Senators with distinguished military careers \nand tell them they are off-base when they try to put forward a solution \nto the problems that we are facing in terms of how we try these alleged \nterrorists. If they did what we think they did, again, I don't want \nthem sitting in prison, I want them tried, convicted, and meet their \nfate. That means we need to put a system in place.\n  After 9/11 and after we took that turn and we didn't go after the \nterrorists as we should and we went into Iraq instead and we got bogged \ndown there, year after year after year, and the President's plan is, \nand I quote: We will be there as long as I am President. That is his \nplan. That is not a plan. That is not a strategy. That is not a policy \nof success. It is the status quo, and it is weighing on the American \npeople.\n  The President said that. I agree with him. It is weighing on the \nAmerican people. What he didn't say is it is weighing down the American \npeople because it is so expensive that it is up to near $8 billion, $9 \nbillion, $10 billion a month in Iraq.\n  I went to a rally on The Mall today for cancer survivors. Mr. \nPresident, I don't know if you got to go over there, but it is the most \ntouching thing I have seen in a long time. Each State there has a tent \nand in the tent are the cancer survivors. They are asking us,\n\n[[Page S9764]]\n\nthey are begging us, they are pleading with us to reverse the cuts that \nthis President made in this budget for cancer research. That is what \nthey are asking.\n  We spend $5 billion a year on cancer research--$5 billion. That is 2 \nweeks of the Iraqi war. Why don't we just decide we will end the war 2 \nweeks earlier and double the funding for cancer research?\n  Our families need us at their backs. They cannot do this alone. They \ncannot find the cure for cancer. They cannot come up with the \ntreatments, with the science. Many of them need insurance. We spend $10 \nbillion a month, almost, for the Iraq war. Think about it.\n  So this war, which has nothing to do with the war on terror, which \nhas been shorted because of this war, is also now stealing from the \nAmerican people, and they do not want it. They want to start bringing \nthe troops home.\n  We need a political solution in Iraq. We need a conference with that \ncountry and its neighbors. We need to look at semi-autonomous regions, \nwith the Federal Government there making sure that the oil is \ndistributed in the right way. That is a way out of this. Senator Biden \nhas explained it many times. He understands that it is not a policy to \njust say we are just going to keep on keeping on.\n  Anyone who has ever read a book on Iraq knows that after World War I \nthe Brits put together everyone in that country who didn't get along \nwith each other and then they were just busy taking in oil while \neveryone else was fighting. It took a monstrosity of a man, a \ntyrannical man, to keep that country together--and now that man is \nfacing his just rewards.\n  But there has to be a better way than the status quo. We need a new \ndirection in Iraq, and we need it because the Iraqi people have to step \nup to the plate and take care of their own country. No country can \nsurvive with an occupation force running the show. It doesn't work.\n  They have to want freedom and democracy. They have to love each other \nenough to live in the same country as much as we want it for them; \notherwise, this is an endless war. This is the forever war.\n  Come to my office. In front of the door I have four easels. I am \nsorry to tell you they are huge easels with small print. On those are \nthe names of the dead from California or based in California. We are \nall faced with this in our States more and more--broken-hearted \nmothers, hysterical children. And what is the ultimate plan?\n  First, it was the mission: go get the weapons of mass destruction. \nThen we found out there were none. That mission was done. Second \nmission: go get Saddam Hussein. Our military was brilliant. They got \nSaddam Hussein. He has been brought to trial. Then they said, well, \nthings are still not good. Maybe you ought to get his family members, \nand we will show them to the Iraqis. That will stop the killing. Tell \nthem that we mean business. Our military did it. That didn't help. Oh, \nwell, we will get a terrorist. That will show them. That didn't help \nbecause the underlying problem is these are people who have hatreds \nthat go way back. They have to decide if they want to set those hatreds \naside. Otherwise, we will be there forever.\n  We are fueling terrorism. We cannot stop this civil war. And we are \npaying the price in dead and wounded, 20,000-plus, with the worst \ninjuries you can imagine, including brain damage, burns, things that I \ndon't know whether any of us here could actually imagine.\n  The cost is weighing us down. Everywhere you look we don't have the \nmoney for this, we don't have the money for that, we don't even have \nthe money for what Senator Sessions is putting before the body, which \nhe voted for before. There are areas of the border where you can build \nthe fence. This isn't an issue with me. But we don't even have the \nmoney for that. It is not even in this bill that is before us. Where \nare we going to get it?\n  I wasn't going to go on and on with these different subjects because \nI really came to talk about the state of agriculture in my State. I am \ngoing to do that now. But when the Senator from Alabama--and he is most \nsincere--came down here and attacked people who are trying to find a \nreasonable solution to a difficult problem and said that they were \nslandering the military if they do not agree with the President, I had \nto talk about these things.\n  It was a Republican President who said this. I wish I had the exact \nquote. I will paraphrase it. This was Teddy Roosevelt. He said--and I \nparaphrase--that the President is the most important elected official \namong many, but those who say that he should not be criticized are \nguilty of being servile and border on the treasonous.\n  I can tell you when I came here, I took an oath to protect and defend \nmy country. I told the people of California they could count on me to \ndo that. I didn't come here to be a servile Senator, to rubberstamp any \nPresident, Democratic, Republican, Independent, you name it. And I \ncertainly didn't come here to say to another Senator who might not \nagree with me that if they do not support the President they are \nslandering the military. I find that over the top, outrageous.\n  We have a bill before us that, as I understand it, the Republicans \nare not going to allow us to amend. I hope I am wrong. I hope Senator \nFrist, in fact, will allow us to amend it because there are some very \ngood ideas in this body that need to be heard about security, about \nimmigration reform. And I know my colleagues in the Chamber today have \nworked very hard to try to bring balance into the way we approach the \nimmigration debate. I support them on that.\n  I want to tell you what is happening in my State right now. We \nhaven't acted, and we haven't taken care of the broader issue. I have a \nfarm community, an agricultural community that is in deep trouble. It \nseems to me, since we have 62 Members supporting the Craig-Kennedy \nbill, which is the AgJOBS bill, that at minimum we ought to be allowed \nto offer an amendment, which I know Senator Craig wants to do, to deal \nwith this terrific problem. We must do more than one thing at a time.\n  To those people who say we will take care of the fence, and then \nafter it is built we will figure out how we can take care of the rest \nof the immigration problem, I say that is a recipe for economic \ndisaster, at least in the agricultural community.\n  I want to read to you a letter that I received from an organization \nthat represents 1,100 organizations, the United Fresh Produce \nAssociation. The headline says: ``Farmers to Congress: Support a Safe \nand Secure American Food Supply, Pass an Immigration Fix Before the \nElection of 2006.''\n  It goes on to say that we have a horrible problem in our agricultural \nindustry.\n  Here is what they say:\n\n       American labor-intensive agriculture has proactively sought \n     a solution to its labor and immigration challenges since the \n     early 1990's. Unfortunately, Congress has failed to act. Now, \n     growers and producers are experiencing actual labor shortages \n     rather than just shortages of legal workers. Labor shortages \n     are being reported from coast to coast. Crop losses are \n     starting to occur, from berries and pears in the West to \n     oranges in Florida.\n       Specialty crops, fruits, vegetables, nursery, greenhouse \n     and floriculture plants, turfgrass, sod, wine grapes, forage \n     crops, and Christmas trees comprise 50 percent of the value \n     of the American crop agriculture. They are labor-intensive \n     crops, and they are at risk. Also at risk are poultry, dairy \n     and livestock production.\n\n  My dairymen tell me the same thing. They talk about the fact that the \n50-year-old flawed guest worker program just isn't working. It is \nunresponsive, it is bureaucratic, and it is expensive. It is litigation \nprone. They are asking for this AgJOBS bill.\n  You may ask: Senator, why can't you offer this amendment? The answer \nhas to come from the Republican side. They control this place. I can \ntell you right now there is support from 1,100 businesses from growers \nto shippers, wholesalers, retailers in every state want this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Farmers to Congress: Support a Safe and Secure American Food Supply--\n              Pass an Immigration Fix Before Election 2006\n\n       American labor-intensive agriculture has proactively sought \n     a solution to its labor and immigration challenges since the \n     early 1990's. Unfortunately, Congress has failed to act. Now, \n     growers and producers are experiencing actual labor shortages \n     rather than just shortages of legal workers. Labor shortages \n     are being reported from coast to coast.\n\n[[Page S9765]]\n\n     Crop losses are starting to occur, from berries and pears in \n     the West to oranges in Florida.\n       Specialty crops (fruits, vegetables, nursery, greenhouse \n     and floriculture plants, turf-grass sod, winegrapes, forage \n     crops, and Christmas trees) comprise 50% of the value of \n     American crop agriculture. They are labor-intensive crops, \n     and they are at risk. Also at risk are poultry, dairy and \n     livestock production. An estimated 70% of the farm labor \n     force lacks proper legal status. The only available labor \n     safety net is a 50 year-old flawed guest worker program known \n     as H-2A, which presently provides only two percent of the \n     farm labor force. It is unresponsive, bureaucratic, \n     expensive, and litigation-prone.\n       The reforms American agriculture needs now are two-fold: An \n     agricultural worker program, such as reformed H-2A, that \n     meets the special needs of agriculture; A workable transition \n     strategy that allows for more experienced workers to earn \n     legal status while capacity is built on the farm and at the \n     border for wider reliance on an agricultural worker program.\n       Last May, the U.S. Senate passed a comprehensive \n     immigration reform bill. It contains agricultural provisions \n     consistent with the needs outlined above. Namely, it \n     overhauls H-2A to streamline the program, make it more \n     affordable, and provide a balance of worker and employer \n     protections.\n       By contrast last December the House of Representatives \n     passed a harsh and anti-employer border security and internal \n     enforcement bill. If it became law, H.R. 4437 would cause \n     American agriculture to lose most of its workforce through \n     mandatory and universal electronic verification of employment \n     authorization documents.\n       What is at stake? America's food independence and security.\n       That's a matter of national security.\n       And the economic contributions and job-creation that exist \n     here in America because the production is here.\n       A recent study by the American Farm Bureau conservatively \n     projects that the loss of the workforce from an enforcement-\n     only bill would result in U.S. fruit and vegetable production \n     falling $5-9 billion annually in the short term and $6.5-12 \n     billion in the long term, with impacts in other production \n     sectors reaching upward of $8 billion. Three to four jobs in \n     the upstream and downstream economy are generated by each \n     farm worker job, so well over one million good American jobs \n     are at risk.\n       To avert an unfolding crisis in American agricultural \n     disaster, Congress must enact comprehensive immigration \n     reform that that ensures growers and producers access to a \n     legal workforce American agriculture is unified behind these \n     critical principles:\n       A safe and secure domestic food supply is a national \n     priority at risk. With real labor shortages emerging, \n     agriculture needs legislative relief now. The choice is \n     simple: Import needed labor, or import our food!\n       If perishable agriculture and livestock production is \n     encouraged or forced offshore, we will also lose three to \n     four American jobs for every farm worker job.\n       Any solution must recognize agriculture's uniqueness--\n     perishable crops and products, rural nature, significant \n     seasonality, and nature of the work.\n       Enacting enforcement alone, or enacting enforcement-first, \n     will cause agriculture to lose its workforce. Even ``doing \n     nothing'' will worsen the growing crisis, with the border \n     already much more secure, and worksite enforcement on the \n     rise.\n       As part of a comprehensive immigration reform or stand-\n     alone legislation, agriculture needs a program that (1) \n     eliminates needless paperwork and administrative delays; (2) \n     provides an affordable wage rate; and (3) minimizes frivolous \n     litigation.\n       For a successful transition, trained and experienced \n     workers who lack proper legal status should be able to \n     eventually earn permanent legal status subject to strict \n     conditions like fines, future agricultural work requirements \n     and lawful behavior.\n       American farmers, ranchers, and business people are \n     depending on Congress to pass a good bill without further \n     delay. To do otherwise jeopardizes American agricultural \n     production and jobs and the food security of our Nation.\n       For more information: Agriculture Coalition for Immigration \n     Reform, Craig Regelbrugge; National Council of Agricultural \n     Employers, Sharon Hughes; United Fresh Produce Association \n     Robert Guenther.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we need to pass an AgJOBS bill. Our \nfarmers and our ranchers are begging us to do it. They need a solution. \nBut because we haven't acted, everything is paralyzed.\n  I want to show you a picture of Toni Skully, a pear farmer from Lake \nCounty, CA, looking at the pear crop she lost because she didn't have \nenough workers to pick the trees. Pear farms are an estimated $80-\nmillion-a-year business in California. They were unable to harvest 35 \npercent of their crop this year due to the lack of field and \npackinghouse labor. Unfortunately, situations like Toni's and the pear \ngrowers of Lake County are happening all over California.\n  I discussed this with my colleagues. They are telling me it is \nhappening in their States, too. My lemon growers in San Diego are \nexperiencing a 15- to 20-percent harvest loss. Avocado farmers in \nVentura County are worried about workers for the December planting \nseason. Tree fruit growers in Fresno County have seen their labor force \nincrease by as much as 50 percent. In Sonoma, as many as 17,000 \nseasonal farm workers have not returned from Mexico to work in the \nfields.\n  According to USDA, agriculture is a $239-billion-a-year industry. And \nif we refuse to provide a solution to labor shortages now, we are \njeopardizing our domestic economy and our foreign export markets. We \nare driving up production costs that get passed on to consumers. Our \nconsumers are already having trouble. Even with the decrease in \ngasoline prices, they are way up from where they where historically. \nThey are dealing with health insurance premiums that are way up. They \nare dealing with college tuition costs and education costs that are way \nup. Now they are going to walk in the supermarket where we have such \ngood prices and see that prices are up because of the inability to hire \npeople because there has been a crackdown on the workers.\n  All of that is happening for one reason: the House wouldn't follow \nthe Senate. The Senate had taken care of it. We had a good, broad bill \nthat dealt with border security, additional guards at the border, and \neverything they needed at the border, plus a way to deal with the \nagricultural industry and the millions of workers who are in the \nshadows who are afraid to come out of the shadows.\n  Let me tell you, do you think that makes us secure when we don't know \nwho they are? I don't think it does for a minute. That is why we need \nto have this type of bill passed in the Senate.\n  But at minimum, I say to Senator Frist, allow us to offer the Craig \namendment. Senator Feinstein is very strong on this.\n  It was interesting. Independent of one another we immediately said we \nought to offer the Craig-Kennedy amendment. She and I talked to Senator \nCraig. We said: Please put us on as cosponsors.\n  A 2006 study done by the American Farm Bureau found that if \nagriculture's access to migrant labor is cut off, as much as $5 billion \nto $9 billion in annual production would be lost--and that is just the \nshort-term prediction. If agriculture's access to migrant labor is cut \noff, as much as $5 billion to $9 billion in annual production of \nprimarily import-sensitive commodities would be lost in the short term. \nThat is a statistic from the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  Again, this is a place where Republicans and Democrats should come \ntogether. I don't understand why Senator Frist will not allow us to \noffer this Craig amendment. We have a vast majority in this body in \nfavor of it. Our farmers say pass the AgJOBS bill now.\n  It is supported by United Fresh Fruit and Vegetables, the \nAgricultural Coalition for Immigration Reform, the National Council of \nAgricultural Employers, Western United Dairymen, the California Grape \nand Tree Fruit League, California Citrus Mutual, among many other \nagricultural groups.\n  The AgJOBS bill pulls together both the owners and the workers. This \nis rare in and of itself to have everybody come together, farmer groups \nand the agribusiness people coming together, and yet with all that \nsupport--I believe we are up to 62 supporters in the Senate--we cannot \nat this stage be assured that Senator Frist, the Republican leader, \nwill allow us to have a vote on this amendment.\n  The AgJOBS bill would allow immigrant farm workers who are here now \nto harvest the crops. It would put 1.5 million workers on a path toward \nlegal status if they prove they worked in agriculture before enactment \nof the law, and if they work 3 to 5 more years in agriculture after its \nenactment.\n  It is a way to save the workforce and get people out of the shadows. \nWe know who they are. That is key, to know who is in this country, not \nto have people hiding. It makes no sense.\n\n  In May, the Senate again passed immigration reform that included this \nvery language we want to offer. It got 62 votes. Building a border \nfence--again, I voted for it. There are parts of our border that need \nthat kind of structure. I don't have a problem with it.\n\n[[Page S9766]]\n\n  What I have a problem with is the fact that is not going to solve our \nproblem because we need to address the economy. We are worried about a \nhousing slump. It is coming on pretty quick. We hope it does not \nmaterialize, but it does not look good. In many cases, a housing slump \nis followed by a recession. Do we want to add to the trouble by having \na situation where as much as $5 to $9 billion in annual production is \nlost? I don't think so.\n  I will do whatever I can to convince the Republican leadership to \nallow Congress to take care of agriculture. When we have a bill that is \nsupported by 62 Senators, on both sides of the aisle, that is supported \nby labor and management, it makes sense to move it forward. I cannot \nstand the thought of looking in the eyes of my dairymen and my farmers \none more time when they come back here and say the first issue on their \nagenda is this problem they are having with their workforce.\n  There is a way to do this that makes sense. There is a way to do this \nthat will give us control of our border. That is what we ought to be \ndoing. We ought to be looking, at the minimum, to saving our \nagricultural industry.\n  I say to my Republican friends, and I am being very honest, I am not \nsure farmers have been my strong supporters over the years. They \nusually go Republican. I can read the list of supporters. What is the \nmajority doing, shutting them out?\n  Let's work together. Let's work together for them, for the consumers, \nfor the workers. We cannot afford the one-two punch of an agriculture \nindustry that begins to fall apart as the housing industry is having \nproblems. We just cannot afford to see another sector have a problem. \nAutos, housing, now agriculture?\n  Please, this is too important to play politics with. Help our \nagriculture businesses. Help our workers. Help get people out of the \nshadows. Do something to help America. Don't keep this bill so narrow \nin focus that we do not see the forest for the trees.\n  I hope we have some good news and that there will be a good agreement \non our surveillance issue, on our military tribunal issue. I hope the \nleadership will open this up to save our agriculture industries. They \nare asking us for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for the passion she brings to this issue in pointing out the \nfact that, indeed, there are major industries in this country that are \ndesperately in need of a labor pool. Agriculture, as the Senator has so \narticulately pointed out, construction, the tourism industry--three \nindustries that affect our State and the Senator's State--all three of \nthose industries are enormously important.\n  If we want to do something for immigration and actually make what is, \nin effect, amnesty now, because the law is not being obeyed, at the \ntime the Senator and I served in the House of Representatives in the \n1980s, in which we voted for that immigration bill, there were only an \nestimated 2 million people in the country illegally. Now it has swelled \nto something like 12 million.\n  Amnesty is the condition we have right now because the law is not \nbeing obeyed by the people who are supposed to obey it and the U.S. \nGovernment is not enforcing the law which allows all the more illegal \nentrants into the country.\n  The solution, in the interest of the United States, it seems to me, \nto get our hands around the problem of illegal immigration, is to pass \na law that has some teeth, that will be obeyed and, at the same time, \nprovides the labor pool so we do not wreck our economy in the meantime.\n  The Senator from California has just pointed out industries in her \nState, agricultural interests in her State that, in fact, are having \ndifficulty getting workers to harvest the crops. It is another one of \nthe little ironies, that people are saying amnesty, amnesty, amnesty, \namnesty, and what we have right now because the law is not being \nobeyed.\n  We ought to pass a bill, a bill that controls the borders--of course, \nthere are more reasons for controlling our borders than just \nimmigration, with terrorists coming into our country--a bill, in \naddition, that will address the labor needs.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 2810\n\n  I address the Senate on another subject with regard to seniors and \ntheir prescription drug coverage. We have long advocated there be \nmeaningful prescription drug coverage. Two or 3 years ago we passed \none. It ended up showing there are quite a few deficiencies in the \nprescription drug coverage Medicare Part D for senior citizens. \nHowever, it was passed and it is law.\n  It is our job now to improve that law and correct the deficiencies, \nplug the loopholes, and make the appropriate changes to this program \nthat are going to help seniors afford the cost of prescription drugs.\n  Over the past several months, as we have been dealing with this \nissue, I advocated extending the enrollment period under the Medicare \nprescription drug program and the elimination of the late enrollment \npenalty. Under the current law, which was passed several years ago, \nseniors who did not sign up by May 15 of this year--that was the \ndeadline--and who enroll at a later date, when they do enroll for the \nMedicare prescription drug program, they are going to pay a penalty of \n1 percent of their premium tacked on for each month they delay the \nenrollment. If they wait to sign up until the end of the year, they are \ngoing to pay a late enrollment penalty of 7 percent.\n\n  If the whole idea of giving senior citizens some financial help with \na prescription drug program is to help them financially, and now we are \ngoing to slap a 7 percent late enrollment penalty on them, it works at \ncounter purposes to what we are trying to do to help the seniors.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that three million seniors are \ngoing to have to pay these higher premiums because they will have the \npenalties assessed. Many of the senior citizens in this country simply \nare not aware this penalty exists.\n  The Kaiser Foundation did a survey and found that nearly half of the \nseniors are unaware they face a financial penalty if they did not sign \nup by May 15. We tried, before May 15, to get Congress to extend the \nenrollment deadline. We got well over a majority of the votes, but we \ncould not get the 60 votes to cut off debate. I believe we ought to at \nleast waive that penalty for those who did not enroll and want to do so \nat the end of this year.\n  We filed a bill, S. 2810, the Medicare Late Enrollment Assistance \nAct, that allows Medicare beneficiaries to sign up during the next open \nenrollment period without a penalty.\n  Last May, after the deadline had just passed, this Senator worked \nwith Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus to introduce this bill. The \nbill now has 45 Senators cosponsoring it. The enrollment period for \nnext year is fast approaching. We need to pass this bill before we \nadjourn. We have less than a week and a half. We have a week and 2 days \nuntil the Senate adjourns. It is imperative the Congress pass this \nlegislation and not just continue to talk about it.\n  It is wrong to penalize seniors who could not enroll by the deadline. \nWhat we all ought to be doing is to make this Medicare prescription \ndrug program more senior-friendly. That includes exactly what this bill \nis. It was filed on a bipartisan basis. It is time to stop playing \npolitics with the health care of our seniors. Waiving that enrollment \npenalty, backed by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus, is the \ncompassionate thing to do.\n  We are not alone in this. Listen to the organizations that have come \nout in favor of S. 2810, the Medicare Late Enrollment Assistance Act: \nAARP; American Diabetes Association; Alzheimer's Association; American \nAutoimmune Related Disease Association; Asthma and Allergy Foundation \nof America; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; Epilepsy Foundation; Lupus \nFoundation; Men's Health Network; National Alliance for Mental Illness; \nNational Council of Community Behavioral Health Care; National Family \nCaregivers Association; the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of \nHusbandry; the National Health Council; the National Osteoporosis \nFoundation; the AIDS Institute; the Arc of the United States; United \nCerebral Palsy; and the National Coalition for Women with Heart \nDisease.\n\n[[Page S9767]]\n\n  That is a pretty broad spectrum of people who deal in health care, \nparticularly with regard to seniors.\n  Now, somebody may say: Well, it is not paid for. Members of the \nSenate, it is paid for. The bill is estimated now to cost $500 million \nover 5 years. And this cost is offset by using part of the \nstabilization fund which was set up in the Medicare drug law. That fund \nwas to be used to subsidize and entice private companies into the \nMedicare Program. But the fund is sitting there, and it is not needed \nbecause private plans are abundant in the Medicare market. There is \nmoney available, and it is time not to penalize our seniors.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately take up and pass S. 2810.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Acting in my capacity as a Senator from \nOklahoma, I object.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, given the fact that is the \ncase, that we cannot proceed, and given the fact we have 1 week left in \norder to avoid this penalty, it is my hope there may be a vehicle that \nwill come along, and that since Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nhave been trying so hard to get this legislation up, they may find an \nappropriate legislative vehicle on which to attach it to bring this \nneeded relief to the senior citizens of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                  Writ Of Habeas Corpus And Detainees\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the \nissue of habeas corpus, which is the Latin term used to define the \ngreat writ from ancient England to produce the body, to determine if an \nindividual is being lawfully held.\n  The writ of habeas corpus has an illustrious history in common law, \nin English law, and in American law. It is the focus of attention on \nissues now being considered relating to detainees in Guantanamo, and \nwas the focus of attention in the Hamdan case, which is now being \nconsidered by the Congress of the United States in terms of complying \nwith the order of the Supreme Court of the United States for the \nCongress to discharge its constitutional duty under Article I, section \n8, to establish procedures for military commissions.\n  We have pending at the present time two bills: the Terrorist \nTracking, Identification, and Prosecution Act, S. 3886, which has been \nproposed by the administration; and the Military Commissions Act, S. \n3901, which has been reported out by the Armed Services Committee.\n  There have been extended discussions about these bills in terms of \ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions, whether classified information \nmay be used, whether hearsay is appropriate, whether coerced \nconfessions can be used. But there has been relatively little \nattention--almost none--on the fact that both of these bills eliminate \nthe writ of habeas corpus review.\n  Had this prohibition been in effect earlier, the case of Hamdan v. \nRumsfeld, decided in June of this year, might not have been decided. As \na matter of law, it is my legal judgment that Congress cannot act to \ndelete the remedy of habeas corpus because the Constitution provides, \nas follows: Article I, section 9, clause 2:\n\n       The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the \n     public Safety may require it.\n\n  Now, we do not have a rebellion and we do not have an invasion. Those \nare the two circumstances under which the writ of habeas corpus may be \nsuspended. Since neither is present and the Constitution cannot be \naltered by statute, the pending legislation may be unconstitutional.\n  As a matter of public policy, the writ of habeas corpus is also \nestablished as a statutory base in Title 28, United States Code, \nsection 2241. In the case of Rasul v. Bush, in 2004, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt ruled that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay have a right to file \npetitions for habeas corpus so that a Federal court may review the \nevidence which justifies their continued detention.\n  Many of the detainees have filed petitions, but only a few have been \nheard. And most have not yet had a hearing on their habeas petition.\n  Senator Leahy and I have asked for a sequential referral to the \nJudiciary Committee from the Armed Services Committee because our \nJudiciary Committee has jurisdiction over habeas corpus and other \nprovisions of the legislation which I have cited.\n  If you take a look at the pending legislation, it is obvious that the \nenemy combatants who are detained have virtually no rights, very few \nprocedures applicable to them compared to those who may be charged with \nserious war crimes. And it would, indeed, be anomalous to have greater \nprocedural protection for someone charged with a war crime, where the \nevidence is present to justify that charge, contrasted with a detainee, \nwhere, as the practice has evolved, there is very little information, \nlet alone the absence of evidence, very little data, to warrant \ndetention.\n  The pending legislation endorses as the exclusive review mechanism \nthat the hearings will be held under the so-called Combat Status Review \nTribunals. And this is a comparison of what the Combat Status Review \nTribunals, called CSRTs, will do in comparison to the military \ncommissions.\n\n  In the CSRTs, no evidence is presented by the Government. The \nproceedings are governed by what is called a proffer in criminal \ncourts. The charges are read to the detainees, and they are asked to \nrespond. By contrast, in the military commissions that are parts of \nboth bills, the Government must introduce evidence which support the \ncharges.\n  In the CSRTs, the detainees have no lawyers. Most speak no English \nand communicate through interpreters. In the military commissions, the \naccused detainees have the right to be represented by lawyers.\n  In the CSRTs, the detainees have no ability to cross-examine the \nwitnesses against them or to see any physical evidence because none is \nintroduced. In contrast, in the military commissions, the detainees' \nlawyers will be allowed to cross-examine the Government's witnesses and \nsee the Government's physical evidence, although there may be some \nlimitation as to classified information on a controversy yet to be \nworked out.\n  In the CSRTs, the detainees have no ability to call their own \nwitnesses to produce evidence. In the military commissions, those \nrights will be fully protected through the commissions' subpoena power.\n  In the CSRTs, the tribunals are permitted to consider classified \nevidence, including, apparently, for all we know--although we are not \nreally certain as to what happened in each individual case--there may \nbe information obtained by torture or by means which produced \nflagrantly coerced confessions. That will not be the case in the \nmilitary commissions.\n  The bills provide that the rulings of the past CSRTs are final and \nconclusive, with the only appeal allowed being to the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals--and such an appeal would be limited as to \nwhether the CSRTs followed their own procedures. In contrast, a full \njudicial-like appellate procedure is provided for appeals from military \ncommissions.\n  So from this analysis, it is obvious that the worst of the detainees \nwill be accorded far greater rights--those charged with war crimes--\nthan all the other detainees, many of whom, according to summaries of \nproceedings, took no action against the United States or its allies.\n  This habeas corpus legislation, if enacted, will not end the court \nbattle over detention at Guantanamo Bay. If either of these bills \nbecomes law, there will be years of litigation as to whether the U.S. \nConstitution is violated. If the proposed changes to habeas corpus in \nthese bills are rejected by the courts, we will be back for more \nlegislative fixes and more judicial proceedings.\n  As I have noted, the request has been made for referral to the \nJudiciary Committee. There are some difficult procedural steps to get \nthat sequential referral. I am, frankly, not optimistic it will occur. \nThe scheduling of the floor action on these bills is uncertain at this \ntime, depending on whether an agreement is worked out.\n  It is my hope we will reach an agreement on the issue of how the \nGeneva Conventions will apply and whether there ought to be any \nmodifications of it. I believe the committee bill, endorsed by Senator \nWarner, Senator\n\n[[Page S9768]]\n\nMcCain, and Senator Lindsey Graham, is correct, that we ought not to \nwater down the provisions of Common Article 3 of the Geneva \nConventions, that we ought not to modify that or have the appearance of \nmodifying it. It is my legal judgment that what General Hayden is \nlooking for can be accommodated within the existing recognition by the \nUnited States.\n  The Geneva Convention on torture was adopted in 1988 and has language \nwhich is very similar on indignities or mistreatment. And the Congress \nfiled a reservation as to that 1988 Convention, saying that it would be \ndefined in terms of the provisions of amendments V, VIII, and XIV to \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  My understanding is that is pretty much what General Hayden is \nlooking for, so that it may be possible to establish the existing \nposition of the U.S. Government on that reservation, which would be \nconsistent with full recognition of Common Article 3, as a stand \nalready taken by the United States, so that we would not be limiting \nCommon Article 3 to something new or we would not be appearing to limit \nCommon Article 3 to something new.\n  With respect to classified information, again, I agree with what \nSenators Warner, McCain, and Graham have articulated, that it is not \nappropriate to deny classified evidence to an individual where the \ndeath penalty might follow or other serious penalties might be imposed. \nIt is insufficient to give that information to a lawyer. And even if it \nwere given to the lawyer, there is a problem as to whether it might be \ntransmitted, and sources and methods might be revealed to those who \ncould harm the United States.\n  As to coerced confessions, again, I agree with the Warner-McCain-\nGraham approach, that coerced confessions should not be admitted.\n  They are unfair and unreliable. When it comes to the issue of habeas \ncorpus, I think both the administration's bill and the bill passed out \nof committee, with the endorsement of Senators Warner, McCain, and \nGraham eliminating habeas corpus is inappropriate. Depending on when \nthe bill comes to the floor, there may be an opportunity for the \nJudiciary Committee to hold a hearing and to have an analysis of the \nconstitutional limitation on suspending habeas corpus and the public \npolicy interests that are involved.\n  I, Senators Leahy, Levin, and others will be circulating a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter advising that we intend to offer an amendment if \nthese bills come to the floor with the denial of habeas corpus in them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I thank my colleague for coming to the floor. I \nheard him open his remarks while I was in my office, and I salute him. \nI don't think many colleagues are aware of the seriousness of the \nhabeas corpus provision that is in the detainee bill coming out of the \nArmed Services Committee. I ask my colleague--and I only caught part of \nhis remarks--are you going to ask that this bill be referred to our \nSenate Judiciary Committee for hearings on this question of habeas \ncorpus?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in response to the question of the \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Leahy and I have signed a letter to the \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, and the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid, asking for sequential referral.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One further question. I ask of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, we understand the Armed Services Committee's jurisdiction \non treatment of detainees, military commissions, and the like. If I am \nnot mistaken, I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, when we discuss a \nfundamental constitutional question, it seems to me that is an \nappropriate area for the Judiciary Committee to consider the merits of \nthe question. I think I know the answer from what I have already heard \nin the Senator's previous statements. I hope I can join the Senators in \nmaking this request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct. The Judiciary Committee has \njurisdiction over the constitutional issue. In fact, as to the pending \nlegislation, the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over Common \nArticle 3, and the committee also has jurisdiction over changes to the \nwar crimes.\n  We have submitted to the Armed Services Committee a sequence of war \ncrimes which have been included in the bill. Regrettably, we didn't \nhave enough time for committee action. Although, as the Senator from \nIllinois may recollect, I advised the committee of what we were doing \nand circulated early drafts so people could be in a position to \ncomment. I think it is important that Congress move ahead to comply \nwith Hamdan. Also, we ought to do it right. It requires some analysis. \nWe can do it in a relatively short timeframe. Provided we focus on it \nand have hearings, it is going to require Senators to become acquainted \nwith what is going on.\n  The fact is, Congress has been derelict in its duty in providing \nrules for military commissions, and it is our responsibility under \narticle I, section 8. The Senator from Illinois and I filed legislation \nshortly after 9/11, 2001, to accomplish that, as did other Senators. \nThe Congress did not act because this issue has been too hot to handle, \ntoo complicated, too dicey. It is not to the credit of the Congress, \nwhich sat back and did nothing.\n  Finally, in June of 2004, the Supreme Court came down with three \nopinions. We punted to the courts, as we do repeatedly. Thank God for \nthe courts. Thank God for life tenure and the independence of the \ncourts in this country, which come in to act when there has been \ninertia and inaction by the Congress, or inappropriate contact by the \nexecutive branch historically, and not just with this administration.\n  When the Hamdan case came down, the Court ordered the Congress to \ncomply with our duty to legislate. All of this comes about because of \nhabeas corpus. I don't believe the Congress has the authority to take \naway habeas corpus jurisdiction, especially in light of the specific \nprovisions of habeas corpus, but also generally. When we considered, in \na rush, the legislation last year that was passed, I was the sole voice \non this side of the aisle objecting to it. It was passed with \nsubstantial support on the other side of the aisle because it was \nthought that at least it would not be applied to pending cases. Then \nthere was a surprise when Justice Scalia said these colloquies were \ninserted by staff after the fact and there was no matter of \ncongressional intent. He would have disregarded it. The majority \nopinion did not deal with the issue but just took the jurisdiction and \nmoved ahead to decide the case.\n  This is not an issue which I came to recently. This is an issue that \nhas concerned me for more than two decades. When Chief Justice \nRehnquist was up for confirmation, I raised the issue in the \nconfirmation proceedings with him as to whether the Congress had the \nauthority to take away the jurisdiction of the Court on first amendment \nissues. Chief Justice Rehnquist refused to answer. Overnight we \nproduced an article that he had written criticizing the Congress in the \nWhitacre proceedings for not asking about due process or equal \nprotection, talking only about matters of lesser concern, such as \nWhitacre being from Kansas City and it was an honor to both Kansas and \nMissouri because he lived in one State and worked in the other.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist, when confronted with the article, answered \nthe question. He said Congress could not take away the jurisdiction of \nthe Court on first amendment issues. Then I asked him about the fourth \namendment, search and seizure. He declined to answer. I asked about the \nfifth amendment, privilege against self incrimination. He declined to \nanswer. On the eighth amendment, crucial and unusual punishment, he \ndeclined to answer. It was a significant statement that Chief Justice \nRehnquist made. As to the first amendment, the Congress could not take \naway the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or the Federal courts.\n  There is a much stronger case that you could take jurisdiction on the \nfirst amendment rather than on habeas corpus because the Constitution \nsays habeas corpus is suspended only when there is a case of invasion \nor rebellion. You don't have either. We better be careful what we do on \nconstitutional rights. We better be careful. We were concerned in the \nPATRIOT Act to make sure we didn't go too far, that we could pass an \nact to give law enforcement protection and protect the \nconstitutional rights, and we are struggling with the electronic \nsurveillance issue, where we are trying to accommodate the interests of \nsome Republicans\n\n[[Page S9769]]\n\nand many Democrats to give appropriate protection to civil rights. I \nthink this Congress has sufficient wisdom and experience to protect \nAmerica from terrorists and still respect constitutional rights.\n\n  That was a long answer to a short question, I might say to the \nSenator from Illinois. I appreciate his coming to lend some emphasis. \nThere are more people who tune up their television sets, watching this \nlonely discussion, when there is a little colloquy and dialogue as \nopposed to the monotonous tones of the speaker alone.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. If I might, I say to the Senator, I \nrecently joined Senator Allen of Virginia on a trip to Guantanamo. We \nwere met by the admiral in charge of the facility. He made it very \nclear in one of his opening remarks that Guantanamo is not there for \npunishment, but it is there for detention. He said punishment, of \ncourse, would be meted out to those found guilty of crime and \nwrongdoing. But the people being held there are being detained until we \ncan determine their status. If they are, in fact, guilty of terrorism \nor war crimes, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and I would \nquickly agree that they should be held responsible for those activities \nand punished to the full extent of the law. But, in most cases, for the \nhundreds of people in detention there, no charges have ever been \nleveled against them.\n  The writ of habeas, which basically is asking the Government to give \ncause why they are detaining a person, is the way to determine whether \nthis person is being held justly and fairly. I think to eliminate that \nright, which is fundamental in our western civilization, raises a \nquestion as to the outcome for the lives of hundreds of people still in \nGuantanamo in this uncertain situation where they are not charged with \nany crime at all: not charged with terrorism, not charged with a war \ncrime, but being held in indefinite status, many of them, for many \nyears.\n  So I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for raising this important \nissue. It is one that needs to be debated on this floor on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one concluding statement. A group of \nattorneys who came to see me on this issue have been representing \ndetainees. They produced summaries of proceedings before this body. It \nis shocking as to how little information there is in these proceedings \nunder the CSRTs. I am trying to find out now if the information I have \nis not classified and present it in detail to Senators and to Members \nof the House so you can see how little information there is and how \nexplanations are made and how people are detained without any basis, \nand on what appears to be a situation where there is no danger.\n  To the credit of the officials in Guantanamo, many have been \nreleased. But that is not sufficient. The detention of an individual \nunder our laws is to be made by a court. When challenged, that requires \na habeas corpus proceeding.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague again for coming to \nthe floor and raising this issue. For most people, it is a very \ncomplicated constitutional issue. I think it can be reduced to very \nunderstandable principles and values that we share as Americans. When \nyou think back to the earliest founding of the United States, we valued \nso much our personal freedom, our personal liberty, and our rights as \nindividuals, and we created within our Constitution a means to ask a \nbasic question. By the filing of a writ of habeas corpus, we ask this \nquestion, by what right does the Government hold this person? Habeas--\nholding; corpus--body. One of the few words that I remember from the \nLatin I took many years ago. By what right does the Government hold \nthis body, this person?\n  That has been a writ, as they call it, a law that has been recognized \nand respected for generations. It is part of our American body of law. \nWe don't want a circumstance where the Government is wholesale \narresting individuals and detaining them without charging them. There \nwas a time, of course, during our Civil War when President Abraham \nLincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus; arrested, detained, and \njailed many people without charging them. It was then an extremely \ncontroversial decision. In fact, if you read the history of the time, \nthere were even people in the President's own political party who \nthought he had gone too far. President Lincoln argued that he had to do \nit in the midst of a civil war.\n  We look back on it now and wonder if perhaps this was excessive \nconduct in the name of security. We ask the same questions today. Are \nwe doing things in America today that are going too far, things that \ninfringe on our basic values and how we define ourselves as Americans \nin this diverse world? Are we doing things which, on reflection, \nhistory will not judge in a positive way? I think, unfortunately, the \nanswer is, yes.\n  The issue of torture is one such issue. We, for decades and \ngenerations, had held to the standards of the Geneva Conventions. We \nbasically said that civilized countries in the world act differently \nthan those that are not civilized. Civilized countries, even in time of \nwar, will not engage in torture, cruel, inhumane, or degrading \ntreatment of prisoners. That has been a standard which we have lived by \nfor more than a century in the United States, a standard we have \nproudly proclaimed as our own, and a standard by which we have judged \nother nations which we believe have crossed that line.\n\n  After 9/11, there were serious questions raised by this \nadministration as to whether we could continue to live under the \nprinciples, the standards of the Geneva Conventions. For a period of \ntime, there were memos that circulated at the highest levels of our \nGovernment which tried to redefine torture and redefine treatment of \nprisoners. Those memos, sadly, were distributed. It appears that in \nsome isolated cases, they were followed. It also appears that they were \ndiscredited and have been rejected after they had been used as a basis \nfor American treatment of prisoners. We know that now. The facts have \ncome out. Some of the people who were engaged in the preparation of \nthose memos are at the highest levels of our Government today.\n  Those memos, so-called torture memos, suggested things such as one \nvery noteworthy example: the use of guard dogs, turning dogs loose on \nprisoners to frighten them into submission or cooperation. That was a \ndeparture from what the United States had ever done in the past. That \nwas part of a memo which was prepared at the highest levels of the \nWhite House and Department of Defense, a memo which has been \nacknowledged by the Administration, but which is now being repudiated \nby them. They are saying it is no longer being followed.\n  One of the architects of one of those memos is a man named William \nHaynes. Mr. Haynes recommended things we could do to prisoners to try \nto get more information. That was distributed, and not long thereafter, \nwe had the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. One of the photographic images we \ncan all recall is the picture of a guard holding a dog on a leash \nthreatening a prisoner. That guard, an American soldier, was charged \nwith violation of the law and has been imprisoned for that conduct.\n  The irony is that Mr. Haynes, one of the authors of this memo which \nsuggested the use of these dogs, not only was never charged with a \ncrime and was never imprisoned as this soldier was, who was working at \nthe Abu Ghraib prison, but this individual is now being proposed for a \nFederal judgeship, a lifetime appointment to the second highest court \nin the land. So, at one level, we are sending soldiers, privates, \ncorporals, and sergeants to prison, and at the highest levels where \nthese memos were being written, we are rewarding the conduct of those \nwho wrote them and suggesting they deserve a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal judiciary. I believe that is inconsistent and unfair, and \nif we are going to have a standard and a rule of law, it has to apply \nat the highest levels as well as to our soldiers. In this case, it did \nnot.\n  Now we have before us the question raised by the Senator from \nPennsylvania which we may face in the next few days. The question is \nthis: Of the hundreds of people who are now being held in Guantanamo \nwithout any specific charges, what will happen to\n\n[[Page S9770]]\n\nthem? Will we ever have to charge them with wrongdoing? At this point \nin time, few, if any, of them have been charged. Over 100 have been \nreleased, incidentally, after being incarcerated there for long periods \nof time. The writ of habeas corpus is the means by which that detainee \nin Guantanamo and in other settings raises the question: By what right \ndo you hold me in this prison? What crime do you charge me with? What \nis my wrongdoing? That is the writ of habeas corpus. The bill that is \nproposed from the Armed Services Committee would eliminate the right of \nhabeas corpus for those who are currently being detained.\n  I raise this because I have visited this Guantanamo facility, and was \ntold that we are not punishing anyone there because we don't know that \nthey have committed a crime, they haven't been convicted of a crime, \nand we are only detaining them. But, by eliminating the writ of habeas \ncorpus, we are eliminating that prisoner's right to step up and explain \nwhat happened, to tell their side of the story. There is no guarantee \nwe will believe their side of the story. There is no guarantee they \nwill be released. But our basic constitutional principles, the \nprinciples we have followed, have given individuals that right to \nquestion the Government.\n  Earlier today, I was visited by three attorneys from the city of \nChicago, which I am honored to represent. Thomas Sullivan is a former \nU.S. attorney, Jeffrey Colman is active in the practice of law in that \ntown, and Gary Isaac is another lawyer. They came to me because they \nhave been involved in representing the detainees at Guantanamo.\n  Mr. Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney, a former prosecutor, well \nrespected not only in Chicago but around the United States, has raised \nquestions about the treatment of these Guantanamo prisoners. He left \nwith me a description of one of his clients in Guantanamo, a client he \nrepresented pro bono, for nothing. The client's name is Mr. Abdul Hadi \nAl-Siba'i, who was taken into custody in Pakistan in December of 2001. \nMr. Sullivan became his lawyer in 2005. After speaking with him and his \nfamily through interpreters and visiting him at Guantanamo, he learned \nthe story.\n  It turns out Mr. Al-Siba'i had been employed for 20 years as an \nofficer in the police department in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He took a two \nmonths leave of absence in August 2001 to go to Afghanistan to build \nschools and a mosque. He was captured, first by forces in Afghanistan \nand then turned over to the United States. He presented his airline \ntickets to show the journey he had made from Saudi Arabia to \nAfghanistan. The passport showed where he had been. The tickets showed \nthe dates he was required to return, and he requested that the people \nwho were detaining him in the United States verify the information. If \nthey had a question, call the Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, police department \nand they would explain who he was, what his background was, and why he \nwas given this two months leave of absence to go into Pakistan.\n  He was denied that request. The person presiding over his tribunal \nsaid:\n\n       I denied that request because an employer has no knowledge \n     of what their employees do when they are on leave.\n\n  I can't quarrel with that statement, but any good lawyer would tell \nyou that you try to sift through the evidence and testimony to come out \nwith what you consider to be the truth, and that would mean at least \ntaking the time to ask the question: Was this man a police officer in \nSaudi Arabia? Did he notify them he was taking a two months leave to \nwork among the poor in Afghanistan? Those are simple questions which \none would expect to be asked. They weren't.\n  Mr. Al-Siba'i explained what occurred when he arrived in Pakistan, \nwas taken into custody by the Pakistani Army, and turned over to the \nU.S. forces. He said he joined the army in Saudi Arabia when he was 17, \ngot married at 18, and has had a wife and stable job for almost 20 \nyears. He talked about his trip to Sudan during a time of floods when \nhe worked with poor people. He explained what he tried to do--\ncharitable work for those he thought were in need. He went through the \nlong description of the time he spent traveling. He was very open in \nthe course of this tribunal, but at the end of the day, they said: The \ninformation is not good enough; you are going to be detained as a \nprisoner in Guantanamo. That was in 2001.\n  In 2006, 5 years later, without ever facing a formal charge of any \nwrongdoing, without any clear investigation into the circumstances he \ndescribed, he was released from Guantanamo and returned to Saudi Arabia \nwithout any explanation whatsoever.\n  I suggest to those who are following the comments being made on the \nfloor that if an American employee, an American citizen, or an American \nsoldier was held under similar circumstances, we would have a right to \nbe upset. It is one thing for us to acknowledge wrongdoing by an \nAmerican--it can happen--but it is another thing to expect simple \njustice. And simple justice requires that someone be charged with a \ncrime.\n  Just a few hours ago, I was in my office and met with a reporter for \nthe Chicago Tribune named Paul Salopek. Just a few weeks ago, Paul \nSalopek was in Africa doing a story for National Geographic. He \nwandered across the border from Chad to Sudan and was arrested and \ncharged with espionage. He was writing a story for the National \nGeographic about local African tribes. The charge, of course, was not \nwell-founded. Many people came to his assistance, not the least of \nwhich was Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who traveled to Sudan and \npersuaded the President to release him. But here was an American \ncitizen, and many of us were concerned about his safety and future when \nwe knew that the charges against him were preposterous and they didn't \nmake sense.\n  Imagine an American citizen being held, as this Saudi was, for 5 \nyears without a charge. The reason he was finally released was that a \nwrit of habeas corpus was filed to ask whether a charge was going to be \nleveled.\n  So now we have this debate going on in the Armed Services Committee. \nI salute my colleagues, Senator Warner, who was on the floor a few \nmoments ago, as well as Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Senator \nCollins, and many others who have said they agree with the approach \nthat has come out of the Armed Services Committee. It establishes a \nstandard for military commissions so that the 14 or so individuals who \nare going to be tried will be tried under standards that are consistent \nwith American values and American justice. That speaks well of our \nNation. To do otherwise would raise the same questions raised by \nGeneral Colin Powell just a week ago. It would raise a question about \nour moral standing in this world if we don't live by the same standards \nwe preach day in and day out. I think it is a good thing and consistent \nto have those judicial standards and principles of justice in these \nmilitary tribunals.\n  But the same bill coming out of the Armed Services Committee removes \nthe writ of habeas corpus for all of these other detainees, the \nhundreds who are being held. So while this bill would hold people \ncharged with crimes to a higher standard of treatment consistent with \nAmerican law, the bill would completely eliminate the most fundamental \nprinciple of law--the writ of habeas corpus--when it comes to these \nother detainees who may never be charged. That is inconsistent, and it \nis wrong.\n  We should trust our system of government despite our fear of terror, \ndespite our experience on 9/11. We shouldn't lose our way and abandon \nthe most basic principles and values which guide our country. Those \nconstitutional principles have weathered many storms, including a civil \nwar which claimed more lives than any war in the history of the United \nStates. Even now in this age of terror, even now living in a dangerous \nworld, let's not abandon these most fundamental principles.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his earlier comments. I \nhope we have a chance to debate this issue at length on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak \nabout the issue which is before us at the moment; that is, H.R. 6061. \nWe voted on a motion to proceed to debate today and invoked cloture on \nthat motion by getting a substantial number of votes. Now we are in the \nnext phase of the\n\n[[Page S9771]]\n\nrule process in which we would actually move to the bill, debate it, \nand possibly amend it.\n  I voted this morning to move this bill forward because I believe it \nis important for the American people to understand that we are very \nserious about border control. If this bill serves that purpose, then \nthat is a step in the right direction.\n  It is not my intent to come here and say it is a bad bill. It is my \nintent to come to the Senate floor and talk about what we have done to \ndate in the area of border security and that a piece of paper, a piece \nof legislation, does not a safe border make. It establishes the legal \nbasis for which we build upon a foundation for safe border and border \naction, but it is the financing of it, it is the funding of the \nnecessary construction, the supplying and the training of Border Patrol \nmen and women, and creating the devices and vehicles necessary to \neffectively monitor and control our borders that build a safe border.\n  Step 1 is a very critical process this Senate, and the Congress \nitself, has been involved in for some time; that is, the recognition of \na broken immigration system and an unsecured border structure in our \ncountry that has allowed, over two decades, possibly 8 to 10 million \nforeign nationals to come into this country illegally.\n  America didn't awaken to this issue until after 9/11. It awakened \nbecause it found that some who had come, legally and illegally, were \nintent on delivering the citizens of this country an evil act, and that \nhappened. Not only did it kill nearly 3,000 of our fellow country men \nand women, but it launched this country into a new dimension of foreign \npolicy that we had not been involved in or as intent on as we should \nhave been a long while ago--a war against radical Islamic \nfundamentalism and the tools they use in that war known as terrorism.\n  That is where we are today. It has swept our country. It is the \npolitical debate of the day. It is the frustration of the American \ncitizen to try to understand why we are where we are today and what we \nare doing and why young men and women bearing the uniform of the United \nStates of America are dying in a foreign land or foreign lands. All of \nthis issue is really one. It is a combination of understanding the \nworld we live in, and that is a world that is not as safe as we would \nlike it to be, and there are very real enemies out there. But it is \nalso understanding a new world that we live in right here on the North \nAmerican Continent and one that we have ignored for years; that is, \ncreating secure borders and defining and designing a well-run \nimmigration program that responds to our needs and our economy and, at \nthe same time, is fair and responsible to those foreign nationals who \nwould like to come to our country to work.\n\n  I began to work on this issue not just a year ago, not just 2 years \nago, but in 1999. I first looked at it through the eyes of American \nagriculture when they came to me and said: Senator, we have a problem. \nWe have a very big problem. The H-2A program that supplies foreign \nnational workers to agriculture doesn't work. It is broken. It is \nbureaucratic. It is nonfunctional and doesn't meet our seasonal needs. \nAs a result, that Federal H-2A guest worker program only supplies about \n40,000 to 45,000 workers. But we need and have over 1 million in our \nworkforce who are foreign nationals and, frankly, they are illegal, and \nwe know they are. It ought to be fixed because we don't want to base \nour economy as American agricultural producers on an illegal process \nbecause someday it may do us damage.\n  So I began to work, along with several others, to try to build and \npropose changes within the immigration laws to create a legal guest \nworker program. We were doing that in 1999 and 2000. And in 2001, as we \nall know, America's roof literally fell in as we were attacked by the \nterrorist elements of radical Islamic fundamentalism.\n  America became angry and frustrated. We began to find out that our \nimmigration process was broken. I knew about it. I was working on it at \nthe time. What I kept saying to my colleagues in counseling them is, as \nwe secure our borders, let's also redo our immigration laws to identify \nthe illegals who are in our country--treat them justly and fairly but \nidentify them--to see if some of them deserve to stay here and work, \nwhile at the same time making sure we have a system that in the future \nrecognizes the need for immigrant labor in our economy and specific to \nagriculture.\n  We worked on that a long while.\n  This year the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill. Parts \nof it I agreed with and parts I disagreed with. I voted for it to move \nthe process along because I thought it was critically necessary because \nI didn't want to get the cart in front of the horse. I wanted the horse \nin front of the cart, and the horse in front of the cart is border \nsecurity as a first line of defense in monitoring and controlling \nillegals in our country. The second line is a legal process which makes \nsure that those who are here are legal, and those who want to come to \nwork in our economy are legal. And if you don't do them both in tandem, \nI think you create phenomenal problems for our country and our economy.\n  While we have been doing all of this, some would say we have done \nnothing on the border. That is why we need to pass H.R. 6061. If they \nare saying that, they are not looking at the facts, and they don't \nrecognize what has happened.\n  Let me read some of the facts of what we are doing. We have increased \nfunding by $7.97 billion--billion--for border, port, and maritime \nsecurity. We spent $34 billion on the border and port and maritime \nsecurity to date. We have added 3,736 new Border Patrol agents, out of \na total of 14,000, whom we are training and supplying over the next 5 \nyears. And it was the Craig-Byrd amendment of 2 years ago, at the time \nof appropriations on the floor, when real dollars went into the \nprogram--$500 million a year--to train those border patrolmen that we \nare talking about right here at this moment.\n  So if you detain and arrest foreign nationals who are illegal in our \ncountry, what do you do with them? You have to hold them. We didn't \nhave anyplace to keep them. We have now added 9,150 new detention beds \nout of a total of 27,000.\n  We are now building 370 miles of fences in the congested urban areas \nalong our southwestern border with Mexico. We are doing it right now. \nThe legislation before us simply talks about it. Concrete is being \npoured, wire is being strung, and double fencing is being created as we \nspeak. Why? Because many of us thought it necessary 2 or 3 years ago to \nget started in this process that is critically important right now.\n  In the area of border tactical infrastructure and facility \nconstruction--and by that we are talking about surveillance equipment, \nelectronics, sensing devices--$682 million is being spent. The numbers \ngo on and on and on.\n  Why I am here talking about this is because we are today building a \nborder system to secure and control our borders.\n  Just before the Easter recess, I was one of those privileged to be at \nthe White House to talk to our President about our chairmanships. I am \nchairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. And that afternoon the \nPresident said to me: Well, Senator Craig, how are things in Veterans?\n  I said: Mr. President, I don't want to talk about veterans today. I \nwant to talk to you about something that I think is critical and \nnecessary that we do now.\n  He said: What is that?\n  I said: I think you need to declare a state of emergency on our \nsouthwest border, nationalize the Guard, assemble our National Guard on \nthe border and close it.\n  He looked at me with a bit of surprise. He said: How can you propose \nthat? You are the advocate of AgJOBS, Senator Craig. You are the guy \nout there promoting reform in immigration right now.\n  I said very simply and very clearly: Mr. President, we have to build \ncredibility with the American people that we have lost because our \nborders are not secure and we have not controlled them.\n  Now, all of us and all who may be listening know the rest of that \nstory. There are now 6,000 Guard men and women deployed to our \nsouthwest border, and that allows us to more effectively utilize the \nBorder Patrol along our border and to spread our Guard out into the \nbroad expanses of a 2,000-mile border which are maybe less dangerous\n\n[[Page S9772]]\n\nthan the congested areas where the greatest numbers come across. Our \nGuard men and women are not policemen. Our border patrolmen are. They \nare trained. They are officers of the law so they can detain and \narrest. But at the same time, the combination of using our border \npatrolmen, our National Guard men and women, and our Border Patrol is \nthe right combination.\n  The reason I talk about this and set this idea in front of my \ncolleagues is to express what is really going on out there; that is, \nthis country is investing heavily on the southwestern border as we \nspeak. We are spending billions of dollars. Fences are being built, and \nthere are literally thousands of our men and women on that border \nsecuring it.\n\n  Is it working? Yes, it is working. Is our border closed? No, it is \nnot. It is a 2,000-mile border across arid, desolate, and oftentimes \nextremely rugged terrain, and we will have to continue to invest to do \nthat.\n  Let me tell my colleagues and show my colleagues the proof of what I \nam saying. The border is closing. My colleagues will remember that \ncart-and-horse analogy I used a few moments ago, where if we didn't \nclose the border and get a comprehensive legal process to bring migrant \nworkers into our country for the sake of agriculture and other \nindustries, we could do real damage to our economy. So the border is \nclosing, but we haven't passed a comprehensive reform bill. In fact, \nthe politics would suggest we can't get there right now. And most \nassuredly, the U.S. House of Representatives, in my opinion, did the \nwrong thing this summer. They went out and condemned the work product \nof the Senate when they should have been at a conference table trying \nto work out our differences. They should have been trying to solve the \nvery real problem that is now embodied in all of these press releases \nwhich are pouring in from across the country that speak of the crisis \nin American agriculture. It is a crisis born out of the reality of what \nI have just talked about: that a border that should be closed and \nsecured is, in fact, closing and being secured.\n  Let me start with Idaho: ``Potato Growers Struggle Without Immigrant \nLabor.'' The potato harvest is now just starting in the State of Idaho. \nThe packing sheds will soon be full as that marvelous Idaho baking \npotato begins to sell in the world market. There aren't enough people \navailable this year to help harvest those potatoes, and many of those \npeople who are not available are migrant workers. The reason they are \nnot there is because they can't get there. The legal system can't \nfunction quickly enough to get them there, and those who were coming \nillegally aren't coming because the border is closing.\n  Another press release: ``Potato Growers Face Labor Shortage.'' That \nis just in Idaho where tragically enough, and in a real sense, we \nprobably have 30,000 or 40,000 illegal foreign nationals working in \nagriculture and other work areas every year, and our unemployment rate \nis 2.5 percent, which means we are at full employment. But we need that \nkind of labor, and it is not coming.\n  Now let me continue--but only for a moment because other colleagues \nare here on the Senate floor to talk about this issue--down through \nthese press releases. My colleague from California is on the Senate \nfloor. She represents the largest, wealthiest agricultural region in \nour Nation known as the great San Joaquin Valley. There is no other \nagriculture like it in the world. If you haven't been there and \nvisited, it is simply worth your time. Every fresh fruit and vegetable \nknown to any consumer in this country is grown in the great San Joaquin \nValley. I have always marveled at that agriculture. It is also true the \nSenator from California and the San Joaquin Valley probably host more \nillegal workers than any other area in our country. What is happening \nthere today is that crops are rotting in the fields. Fruit is not being \npicked. Vegetables are not being harvested. That kind of agriculture \nthat is intensively hand labor agriculture is suffering. I am told by \nsome we could literally lose the raisin industry of our country, and \nthat would be a tragedy if the politics of the Congress will not allow \nus to get to a legal system to allow that type of workforce to exist in \nour country today.\n  I could walk my colleagues through hundreds of press releases and the \nstories now being told by American agriculture of nobody there to help \nthem pick their crops, to supply the marvelous vegetable stands of the \nproduce sections of America's retail food industry with the abundance \nthat we have all known. We saw it start in February in Yuma, AZ, in the \ngreat Imperial Valley where billions of dollars' worth of vegetables \nare picked in February and March to supply us--lettuce and celery and \nall of those kinds of things that we are used to. A third of it didn't \nget picked this year. That is a crop that is worth $3.2 billion at the \nfarm gate, and a third of it rotted in the fields because we in \nCongress couldn't get our act together. That is a tragedy and it is a \nshame.\n  It is believed between now and the end of harvest, or between now and \nnext year, American agriculture could literally lose billions of \ndollars' worth of fresh produce that would go to the supermarket \nshelves of our country for all of us to eat, all of us. And if it isn't \nthere and there is a limited amount, you know what happens. The price \nstarts heading up.\n\n  Those producers of those products tell me they have advertised in \ntheir communities, they have pled with people to come out and work. \nThey said they would increase their salaries substantially. But nobody \nis there to do the work. Americans do not do stoop labor anymore. It is \na reality that we ought to face. Yet we have not been willing to face \nit.\n  Yes, we need a fence and we are building it. Yes, we need border \nsecurity and we are accomplishing it, and we have not finished. \nClearly, for the safety and security of this country our borders are \nmore important than nearly anything else. But if you cannot feed your \ncountry, if you are going to lose your agriculture, if you are going to \ncause bankruptcies that are no fault of the farmers themselves, then \nyou are doing some very real damage--along with your unwillingness to \nrecognize the reality of a law that no longer works and a work product \nwe are trying to accomplish at this moment.\n  We will probably have to go through an election. We will probably \nhave to get the politics of the election out of the way before the \nHouse and Senate will come to the reality of the problem that is \nclearly before us today because we are just a week and a half from \nadjournment or recess until after the election.\n  The kind of comprehensive work that we should have been doing in \nAugust and we should have been doing in September turned into politics \nand not constructive work. I hope the House bill in front of us is not \nan extension of those politics and politics alone. I hope it really is \nmeant to fit into a total package of border control and comprehensive \nimmigration reform that allows this country and our economy and our \nhard-working agricultural people a legal, transparent, and open guest \nworker immigrant labor force. We need it. We have always needed it. We \nshould not be denying its reality today.\n  The Senate attempted to accomplish that. We argued mightily on \nimmigration reform on the floor of the Senate for nearly a month, and \nwe do not all agree because it is in itself a very contentious issue. \nIt has all aspects of the American culture and the American emotion \ntied into it. But as we studied it I think a majority recognized the \nreality of doing the right thing. The horse and the cart have to be \nconnected. Border control and border security is the first line of \ndefense, and a legal structure behind it that gives employers a legal, \nidentifiable workforce is necessary and appropriate, and they have to \nbe connected.\n  Let me close with this thought: We do not reform immigration laws in \nthis country, we let them go. Politically we will not handle them. But \nwe will continue to tighten a fence until our 2,000-mile land border is \ncomplete and the border closes. There will be a new phenomenon emerge \nin the port of Los Angeles along the coast of California, and they will \nbe called ``boat people.'' Because those who want to come here to work, \nonce we have created the fence across the land surface that they now \ntrek, will find another way to get here. Somebody in a fast speedboat \nwill charge $1,000 a head and they will pick them up in Mexico and \nshoot them around the water and across the waters and into the \ncoastline.\n  My point is simply this. You have to have two things that work here \nto\n\n[[Page S9773]]\n\nmake it work. You have to have border security and you have to have a \nlaw, a law that works, so when that employer hires a foreign national, \nthe ID card is real and they know they are hiring a legal person. I am \nnot going to put American agriculture or any other law-abiding employer \nat risk when they need people to get the harvest out unless we do so in \na way that says we will sanction you if you hire somebody who is \nillegal, but we are going to make sure that you have a workforce that \nis legal and has the kind of transparency of ID and uncounterfeitable \ndocuments that are critical and that are in the Senate bill.\n  Those are some of the issues we need to talk about and we are going \nto ignore now until after the election. Here are the press releases. \nBillions of dollars will be lost in American agriculture this year and \nAmerican consumers will pay an increased price for the quality produce \nthey buy on the fresh fruit shelves of our country. It is a reality. It \nis happening as we speak.\n  I thought it was important that I come to the floor to talk about it. \nMost want to simply ignore it because the politics of the issue is \nsimply too difficult to deal with. It is not too difficult to deal \nwith. We can do both as a great nation. We can secure our borders. We \ncan improve our immigration laws. We can provide a legal and necessary \nguest worker/migrant worker program for the segments of our economy \nthat speak to that type of workforce. It is our responsibility. I hope \nwe do not shirk it or turn our back on it.\n  American agriculture, along with a lot of other segments of our \neconomy, will suffer if, in fact, we do not have the political will to \naccomplish the right and responsible issue and things at hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho on his comments. I subscribe to them \n100 percent. I congratulate him and thank him for the leadership he has \nprovided on the AgJOBS program. I don't think there is anyone in the \nU.S. Senate who knows more about what the needs in agriculture are \nacross this great land than Senator Larry Craig. He has been consistent \nand he has been devoted. I think his expressions here today are really \nthe expressions of virtually everyone in the Senate who knows what is \nhappening in their own State with respect to agriculture today.\n  I also rise joining you, Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the one who moved the AgJOBS program on to the \nimmigration bill that is part of the Senate bill. I come here with a \nplea and that plea is, if there is going to be a border security bill \nbefore the full U.S. Senate, add the AgJOBS bill to it, because it is a \ncrisis and it is an emergency and there is a practical need to do so.\n  It just so happens that there are two amendments at the desk that \nwould do this. There is a Republican amendment on AgJOBS sponsored by \nthe Senator from Idaho, and there is a Democratic amendment on AgJOBS \nsponsored by the Senator from California. They are one and the same. \nThey could be easily added by either one of us and either one of us is \nwilling to cosponsor the amendment of the other. The reason is because \nit is in fact an emergency.\n  This is harvest season out in all the great States. I was once told--\nSenator Craig, you know him well--by Manuel Cunha, of the Nisei Farmers \nLeague, just for raisins alone in my State, it is 4 counties and it \ntakes 40,000 workers to harvest those raisins.\n  The Senator mentioned that California is so large in agriculture. I \nwant the President to know that it is a $31.8 billion industry. That is \nin 2004. It is an enormous industry. We have 76,500 farms in \nCalifornia. I am asking every one of those farm owners to weigh in at \nthis time. Let the Senate know that there is now an opportunity to see \nthat you have a certain, stable workforce. Weigh in with the Senate and \nsay: Put AgJOBS on the border security bill.\n  We have 1 million people who usually work in agriculture. I must tell \nyou they are dominantly undocumented. Senator Craig pointed out the \nreason they are undocumented is because American workers will not do \nthe jobs.\n  When I started this I did not believe it, so we called all the \nwelfare departments of the major agriculture counties in California and \nasked, Can you provide agricultural workers? Not one worker came from \nthe people who were on welfare who were willing to do this kind of \nwork. That is because it is difficult work. The Sun is hot. The back \nhas to be strong. You have to be stooped over. It is extraordinarily \ndifficult work.\n  For a State as big as mine, there is an immigrant community which is \nprofessionally adept at this kind of work. They can pick, they can \nsort, they can prune, they can harvest--virtually better than anybody. \nThis is what they do. This is what makes our agricultural community \nexist.\n  It is very hard for a farmer to hire a documented worker. It is very \nhard to find that documented worker. So if they are going to produce, \nthey have to find the labor somewhere.\n  My State produces one-half of the Nation's fruits, vegetables and \nnuts. One-half comes from California. We produce 350 different crops. \nWe have an opportunity now, with this bill, to get adequate labor for \nthis harvest season on this border security bill.\n  We know the votes are here in the Senate. We know the votes are in \nthe House of Representatives. We know the President would sign the \nbill. Why not do it? Why not do it? Both Senator Craig and I want to \nplead with the leadership of the Senate, allow us to put this amendment \nup before the Senate. We can limit our debate. We know the votes are \nthere. Let me ask the Senator, when this matter came before the full \nSenate; that is, before the immigration bill, how many votes did you \nhave for the AgJOBS program?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe when there was a clear and clean vote on AgJOBS \nalone there were 53 who voted for it that day and there were 4 absent \nwho would have voted for it. I believe there are between 58 and 60 \nvotes for the AgJOBS provision and bill the Senator speaks to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I actually believe, if I might respond, that there \nare 60 votes because of the amendments that we made in Judiciary--which \ncertainly brought me along, and I wasn't there before.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And I think it brought others along as well.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, she makes a tremendously \nimportant point. The original AgJOBS bill that brought the vote I just \nspoke to is not the bill before us now. The amendments that the Senator \nhas brought and the amendment that I brought--because the Judiciary \nCommittee itself changed some of it at the Senator's guidance and \ndirection, and on the floor we added additional amendments--added the \nsafeguards and protections and fines and the requirement of paying back \ntaxes, to cause that illegal, who might become legal through this \nprocess, certain responsibilities that were not in the original bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  If I may, through the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator one \nquestion. He mentioned the H-2A Program which in my State has not been \na widely used program. This is a reform, also, of the H-2A Program, to \nmake it more broadly applicable across the line. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely correct. It identifies and deals \nwith those agricultural workers who have been here for 3 years or more, \nwho are undocumented, who could become legal. That is step one. Then it \ndeals with a reform, streamlining of and a more usable H-2A Program, to \nimplement an effective guest worker program.\n  The point the Senator is making I think is very important for the \nSenate to understand. If we were to pass AgJOBS tomorrow, if it were to \nbecome law, many agricultural workers who were once in the field \nworking but may have moved somewhere else in our economy with the \nopportunity to become legal would return to agriculture. It is not \nletting more across the border. It is causing those who have moved to \nconstruction and housing and other places to say, Gee, you mean I could \nbecome a legal worker if I went back to agriculture and stayed there \nfor 150 workdays?\n  The answer is yes. There could be a near immediate relief brought by \nthe passage of the AgJOBS provision.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator is absolutely right. I think he has made \nan\n\n[[Page S9774]]\n\nexcellent point. We know that many of the workers in agriculture who \nare undocumented have gone on to work, for example, in construction, in \nthe service industry, in the restaurant industry, in the hotel \nindustry, and so on and so forth. But they work in the shadows. They \nwork with fear today.\n  The program that the Senator and I are speaking of is not just a pile \nof programs. This is a 5-year sunset program. But you would see how it \nwould work. You would then have documentation of every individual that \nis legally working in that program.\n  In my State of California, growers are reporting that their \nharvesting crews are 10 to 20 percent of what they were previously due \nto two things: stepped up enforcement, a dwindling pool of workers, and \nthe problem that ensues from both.\n  We have an opportunity to put AgJOBS on this bill, a modified AgJOBS, \nreforming the H-2A program, pilot AgJOBS for 5 years. I will explain \nvery quickly how that works. I think it is important that people \nunderstand this.\n  The first step would require the undocumented agricultural workers \napply for a ``blue card,'' if they can demonstrate that they have \nworked in American agriculture for at least 150 workdays over the prior \nof 2 years. The second step requires that a blue cardholder must work \nin American agriculture for an additional 5 years and work 100 days a \nyear, or 3 years at 150 workdays a year; again, a blue card, biometric, \nwould be documented. For the first time you would know who the worker \nis. The farmer would have certainty that he can hire that worker. If \nthe worker meets this expected work requirement, they will then be \neligible for a green card. Employment would be verified through the \nemployer-issued itemized statement, pay stub, W-2 forms, employer \nletters, contracts, or agreements, employer-sponsored health care, \ntimecards, or payment of taxes. The program is capped at 1\\1/2\\ million \nblue cards over 5 years. It will not have an annual cap.\n  I have explained it. My State alone has a million agricultural \nworkers. How many does Idaho have? I ask he Senator through the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are not quite sure. We believe it could be between \n35,000 and 40,000.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much. That may be a much \nsmaller amount.\n  But virtually every State represented in this Chamber can come \nforward with a like amount of people. Virtually every Member in this \nChamber can come forward with problems they are having with harvesting \nat this particular point in time.\n  I am told there are problems harvesting citrus in Florida, apples in \nNew Hampshire, strawberries in Washington, and cherries in Oregon. In \nWyoming, it has been reported that the labor shortage played a central \nrole in the eminent closure of the $8 million Wind River Mushroom Farm.\n  Let me quickly run through a couple of other things.\n  Perhaps the most impacted are the organic farms, which are highly \nlabor-intensive. Hand-picked crops such as at Lakeside Organic Gardens, \nwhich happens to be in my State, are suffering as fields go untended \nand acres have been torn up because there is no one to harvest them. \nThe situation is so bad that this particular farmer, Dick Peixoto, has \nbeen forced to tear out nearly 30 acres of vegetables and has about 100 \nacres that are compromised because there is no one to weed them. He \nestimates his loss so far this season to be $200,000. That is worse \nthan anything he has seen in 31 years of farming.\n  Some fields in the Pajaro Valley in Santa Cruz County are being \nabandoned because farmers can't find enough workers. Farmers in that \narea say there are 10 to 20 percent fewer workers available to harvest \nstrawberries, raspberries and vegetable crops. That is the great Pajaro \nValley that produces artichokes and acres and acres of row crops. They \nsay we have sustained strawberry and raspberry losses due to shortage \nof labor.\n\n       Strawberries lost are approximately 100,000 cartons for the \n     fresh market, raspberries approximately 50,000 cartons. Due \n     to the shortage of labor, we were unable to harvest 900,000 \n     pounds of lemons and 128,000 pounds of grapefruit.\n\n  These are some examples of what is happening. You can pick up \nnewspapers, the San Jose Mercury News, headline: ``Worker Shortage \nCrippling Farmers.'' It goes on and depicts it.\n\n       Morgan Hill: Farmers are reporting a shortage of labor to \n     harvest crops forcing them to take huge losses. The impact is \n     mixed, varying with the amount and type of crops a farmer is \n     growing. Those growing more fragile crops such as \n     strawberries and peppers have been scrambling to find enough \n     workers to pick the harvest.\n\n  This goes on to say they cannot harvest their yields. Labor pains \nincreasing for the great San Joaquin Valley that Senator Craig spoke \nabout. Manuel Cunha said symptoms of labor shortages are showing up \nwith fewer pickers in the Valley's orchard.\n\n       Between the tree fruit guys, the crew sizes are varying \n     from a crew of 20 to 22, down to 9 to 15. What is happening \n     now is we are starting to see a trend going toward table \n     grapes. The Valley is starting to get into the table grape \n     harvest in the Arvin area. The word I am hearing is that the \n     table grapes may take workers from tree fruits because the \n     free fruit workers are only working so many hours in the day \n     because of the demand. Union-produced labor shortages became \n     more pronounced in the coming weeks with the start of the \n     raisin grape harvest.\n\n  It goes on like this in article after article.\n\n       The Farm Bureau Federation of my State: Headline: ``Labor \n     Shortage Teeters on Critical Edge.''\n\n  As the border with Mexico tightens, and Congress continues to drag \nits feet on passing comprehensive immigration reform, farmers and labor \nexperts say that the California farm labor pool is rapidly shrinking. A \nlag in reporting labor statistics makes it hard to pinpoint exactly how \nshort the labor supply really is, but many growers put the gap again at \nabout a 10 to 20 percent shortage Statewide.\n  This goes on and on, report after report.\n  There is rarely a time where issues come together and it is possible \nto move aggressively on something such as this. This is one of those \ntimes. AgJOBS has been debated on the floor of the Senate. It has been \ndebated in the Judiciary Committee. It has been amended. It has come \nout of part of the immigration bill.\n  Senator Craig and I have worked to see that the amendment at the desk \nremedies all the problems that were brought up in the last floor \ndiscussion. It is ready to go. It can be added to this bill. It will \npass in the House.\n  Why won't the leadership allow this amendment? It would be one thing \nif there was not a crisis out there. It is another thing if there is a \ncrisis. And there is a crisis. Everyone in this body knows that. \nEveryone knows farmers are scrambling. Everyone knows farmers are \nlosing their crops. Everyone knows there is produce on the ground that \ncan't be harvested. Why don't we do something about it? And everyone \nknows that agricultural labor in the United States of America is \nvirtually dependent on undocumented workers. This is a way to document \nthem. This is a way to enhance security. This is the way to get the \nworkforce for our farming communities that we need.\n  I went to ports, and I saw boxes and carton after carton of export \nproducts at the ports. We depend on exporting our fruit. You can't do \nit if you can't harvest it. What happens when the prices begin to rise \nin the markets? And they will. Lettuce that can't be harvested, \ntomatoes that can't be harvested, almonds, raisins, grapes. We had a \nchance to do something about it, and you have Senators standing here on \nthe floor saying we could do something about it now, it will pass, it \nwill be signed, it will go into law.\n  AgJOBS is the one part of the immigration bill about which there is \nuniform agreement. Everybody in both bodies knows that agriculture in \nAmerica is supported by undocumented workers. As immigration tightens \nup, and they begin to pull people and deport them, as farmers have \ntrouble finding them, as they hide in the shadows more, the result is \nour crops go unharvested.\n  We are faced today with a very practical dilemma and one that is so \neasy to solve. The legislation has been vetted and vetted and vetted. \nSenator Craig, I, and a multitude of other Senators have sat down with \nthe growers, with the farm bureaus, with the chambers, with everybody \nwho knows agriculture, and they have all signed off on the AgJOBS bill. \nWhy don't we pass it? What kind of a plea will be heard? How\n\n[[Page S9775]]\n\nmany farmers have to be ruined to prove a point that I don't \nunderstand, that I can't fathom, that I can't believe we turned down \nthis opportunity to solve a real problem.\n  If you want a Republican amendment, it is at the desk. If you want a \nDemocrat amendment, it is at the desk. They are both the same.\n  I am simply here to say, Mr. Leader, let this come to the floor. Mr. \nLeader, take the steps that can save American agriculture right now. \nLeader, pass this bill which has be vetted, which has been debated, \nwhich has been discussed in both Houses, several committees and on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. Simply bring this amendment to the floor. \nDon't fill the tree and now allow this amendment.\n  I say once again, the 75,000 farmers in my State, if there ever was a \ntime to weigh in, this is it. If there was ever a time for you to pick \nup that phone and call every Member of this body and anyone you can and \nsay, Hey, I am a farmer, and I can't find labor to harvest my crop, \nthis is a bill that can help me, and I want you to pass it now. In my \nState, 76,000 farms. If half would do it, if a quarter would do it, if \na tenth would do it, we would get this bill passed. For farms in other \nStates, this is your moment. Stand up, weigh in. We are, after all, a \nrepresentative democracy. We represent people. We represent States. \nThese people and these States have weighed in, in the press, and said: \nWe are in trouble. We need help.\n\n  Now is the time. I say to the Republican leader of the Senate, do not \nturn your back on the farm community of America. This community needs \nundocumented labor to plant, to prune, to clear out weeds, and to \nharvest. That has been the case for years. Give it certitude. A pilot \nprogram; 5 years; 1.5 million blue cards over the 5 years; specific \nrequirements; taxes paid; filing with the Government; fines paid. But \npeople can work and harvest the crops. I say to the Members of this \nSenate, it would be a terrible tragedy if we turn our backs on the \nbreadbaskets of America. We have an opportunity. It is so simple. Just \nenact this AgJOBS program now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow the distinguished \nSenator from California and the distinguished chairman from Idaho. They \nmake a compelling case. I represent an agricultural State in the great \nState of Georgia. I understand the difficulties they have outlined. \nThey have also given me a couple of points to follow on to demonstrate \nhow important it is that this Senate, in fact, embrace comprehensive \nreform but do it in a two-step process where we ensure our borders.\n  The distinguished Senator from California made the following \nstatement: The reason we have so much illegal immigration today is \nbecause Americans don't do the jobs or won't do the jobs. I submit that \nis partially right.\n  The reason we have so much illegal immigration today is because it is \neasier to get into the United States illegally than it is legally. At a \ntime of war on terror, that is a huge problem. We owe it to ourselves \nto fix our immigration system in a tandem, in-step process that \nguarantees security and then reforms immigration to meet the demands of \nAmerican business, American agriculture, and American industry.\n  We do not find anyone trying to break out of the United States of \nAmerica. They are all trying to break in, for a very good reason. This \nis the land of hope, opportunity, and promise. We have to return to the \nday where the way to come to this country is legally and not illegally. \nThe best way to do that is to make illegal immigration into this \ncountry untenable. The way to do that is go from making promises to \nactually causing reality to take place on our border.\n  I support the motion to proceed on this House bill, H.R. 6061. I \nsupport Senator Session's amendment to the original bill in the Senate \nto put up a barrier. I support authorizing them. But I remind my \ncolleagues in this body that we do two things that start with ``a'': we \nauthorize and appropriate. An authorization is a promise, and an \nappropriation is a commitment. It is time in terms of securing our \nborders that this Senate and the body across the hall made a commitment \nand made border security a reality.\n  I commend Chairman Judd Gregg on the tremendous work he has done. \nChairman Gregg is precisely correct. We are making progress toward \nsecuring the border. However, we have not closed the deal. We have not \nfinished the appropriation. We have not gone from the authorization \ncommitment that it will take to do so. Until we do, we can never have a \nmeaningful immigration reform program.\n  I suggested, Senator Cornyn has suggested, Senator Sessions has \nsuggested, and Senator Feinstein just made the statement that this is \ntruly a national emergency. If it is, it is truly a time for an \nemergency supplemental from the President of the United States to fund \nthose things we have all agreed it takes to secure our border.\n  For the sake of clarity, I will go through those for a second: 6,000 \nmore Border Patrol agents, which, by the way, can be accomplished and \ntrained in 24 months; barriers along the border in those geological and \ngeographic areas that demand barriers, as in southern California years \nago. We know how much that cost. That can be accomplished in 24 months. \nWe need the ``eyes in the sky'' referenced in H. Res. 6061, the \nseamless ``eyes in the sky'' so our manpower can be multiplied \ntremendously because we have unmanned aerial vehicles patrolling our \nborder, all 2,000 miles of it, night and day. We need to fund the \njudicial and prosecuting authority along our border to the southwest to \nsee to it that when we make a case, we prosecute. Lastly, we need to \nbuild the detention facilities that end the practice of catch and \nrelease.\n  The beauty of going ahead and making the commitment to do it is, \nimmediately upon doing so, those who are here illegally will comply \nwith whatever program we come up with because they will know they can \nno longer go home. When the border is secure, it works both ways. We \ncan do that. I have not met an American citizen yet in this debate \nwhich has been raging for the better part of the last 5 months in the \nCongress of the United States who wouldn't consider granting legal \nstatus to someone who is here illegally if they have cleared the \nterrorist watch list, if they have demonstrated they have a job, but \nthey don't want to do it until they are sure our border is secure.\n  History is a great teacher. Twenty years ago, Alan Simpson, from \nWyoming, was the author of the American immigration reform bill. The \nAmerican people were clamoring to do something about the 3 million \nundocumented and illegal workers who were in America in 1986. People \nalong our borders were clamoring for border security. We passed the \nSimpson bill. It promised border security. It granted amnesty to those \n3 million.\n  The reality was, we delivered on the amnesty. We looked the other way \non border security. And today, we have a 12 million-illegal-aliens \nproblem. If we do a wink and a nod to border security now and reform \nimmigration to attract more, all we will do 20 years from now is have \nan untenable number of 20, 25, or 30 million.\n  So H.R. 6061 sends a great message. I might add, the reason it got 96 \nvotes with no dissenting votes on a motion to proceed today, most \nMembers of the Senate have gone home. Most have talked the last 5 \nmonths to their constituents. Most know the American people want the \nborder secure. It is a good political vote to authorize those barriers, \nthose fences, and this appropriations. However, it is ultimately our \nresponsibility to see to it that we authorize and appropriate border \nsecurity and do it in tandem with a reformed immigration program.\n  By the way, I am always amused by how everyone said we have to get \nthis new reform program in place and don't make the barrier be a \ntrigger for it. That won't work. The truth is, it takes just as long to \nget the reform program workable as it does to perform those items I \njust delineated to secure the border. In fact, the verifiable, \nnonforgeable, biometric ID that we need, we know we can do it in 18 \nmonths and have implemented in 24 months. That happens to be exactly \nthe same period of time it takes to get the job done on the border.\n  It is time we start parsing on the edges. It is time we stop making \nthis a\n\n[[Page S9776]]\n\nchicken-or-egg proposition. It is not a chicken-or-egg proposition. \nReform of immigration can only take place after we have secured the \nborder. The work it takes to secure the border is exactly the time \nperiod it takes to prepare for the new situation of legal immigration.\n  We are close to a great opportunity to respond to the American people \nand do what is right. I commend my colleagues who come to the Senate \nand support 6061. It will send a great signal. But it is only a \npromise. We need to deliver a reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter to me from Richard A. Smith \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 5, 2006.\n     Hon. Johnny Isakson,\n     U.S. Senator.\n       Dear Senator Isakson: I write to inform you of the grave \n     concern I have with respect to both Houses failure to pass \n     immigration reform legislation. I cannot imagine what more \n     you and your colleagues require to motivate Congress to take \n     action on this pressing matter of national security. More \n     than a full year has passed and still not a shred of evidence \n     that the House or Senate fully appreciate the concern this \n     country has over illegal immigration. The impression is that \n     government has completely failed its citizens on this \n     pressing issue.\n       My vote and support, will go to the party that can address \n     this critically important national security issue. The United \n     States of America is being invaded by a foreign country \n     without firing a single shot and our country's elected \n     officials are apparently incapable of coming to agreement on \n     a solution. I could not be more disgusted with Congress over \n     this issue. You and your colleagues are urged to act on this \n     pressing issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Richard A. Smith,\n                                                Bernardsville, NJ.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will not read all of it, but this is an American \ncitizen who wrote this letter today which I think illustrates the \ncritical need for securing our border and ensuring it is done before we \nopen the gates.\n\n       More than a full year has passed and still not a shred of \n     evidence that the House or the Senate fully appreciate the \n     concern this country has over illegal immigration. The \n     impression is that government has completely failed its \n     citizens on this pressing issue.\n       The United States of America is being invaded by a foreign \n     country without firing a single shot and our country's \n     elected officials are apparently incapable of coming to an \n     agreement or a solution. I could not be more disgusted with \n     the Congress over this issue. You and your colleagues are \n     urged to act on this pressing issue.\n\n  I don't know how many letters have been written that contain thoughts \nalmost identical to those of Richard Smith, but there have been lots of \nthem. They are by far the preponderance of the communications to this \nCongress and this Senate.\n  Let's get H.R. 6061 up for a vote. Let's pass it. Let's make another \npromise toward border security. But let's come back in a timely \nfashion. Let's secure our borders and make the commitment and the \ninvestment that will take place. Let's reform our immigration process \nso the way to come to America in the future is the right way, not the \neasy way because we looked the other way.\n  Anders Bengsten was the father of my grandfather, whose name was also \nAnders Bengsten. He was a potato farmer in Sweden. When the famine hit \nin 1903, he emigrated to the United States of America. In Scandinavia, \nyou don't keep the last name you had there; you take your father's \nfirst name, Isak, and add to it ``son.'' That is why most Scandinavians \nare Isakson, Ericson, Johnson, and Olson. He came to America and became \nAnders Isakson. He fled because of the potato famine. He landed on \nEllis Island. He came legally. I have gone to Sweden and gotten the \nembarkation and legal papers. I have them at home.\n  My father was born in 1916, while Anders was still here legally but \nas an immigrant. My father is an American citizen today because of \nbirthright citizenship. I am a citizen today because Anders Isakson \nbore that son in 1916. The proudest thing I have on my wall in my den \nat home is the May 3, 1926, documents that made Anders Isakson a U.S. \ncitizen when he completed his process, 23 years after coming here \nlegally as an immigrant, to become a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica. There is not a person in this room who respects immigration \nand the right to come to America and the promise of Ellis Island more \nthan I do. I am a living testimony to its promise.\n  It is time we return to a pathway to citizenship that is legal. It is \ntime we stop looking the other way and letting people come to America \nthe easy way and the soft way, and say to those who are learning our \nlanguage, studying our history, those who are pledging allegiance to \nour country and disavowing their previous allegiance, those who are \ncoming the right way ought to be the stars in the crown of American \nimmigration. It is time we secure our border. It is time we reformed \nour immigration so the numbers coming reflect the demands of our \neconomy. It is time we stop making promises. It is time we start \ndelivering. America is too important. This issue is too critical to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ComAir Flight 5191\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the people of Kentucky are still \nreeling from a terrible tragedy that struck less than a month ago. On \nAugust 27, ComAir flight 5191 crashed shortly after takeoff at Blue \nGrass Airport in Lexington. Forty-nine people perished.\n  Grief has descended on scores of families and into countless lives \nbecause of this devastating event. I know I am joined by all \nKentuckians in extending sympathies and prayers to the families and \nloved ones of the victims.\n  As we continue to grieve, people throughout the Commonwealth are \nlooking for answers. The National Transportation Safety Board has begun \nan investigation into the cause of this crash and what recommendations \ncan be made to improve future aviation safety. I think we have an \nobligation to make sure their investigation proceeds smoothly and \nthoroughly and concludes in a timely manner so that all the questions \ncan be answered as completely as possible. I have been personally \nbriefed by the NTSB on the status of the investigation and intend to \nfollow it very closely.\n  I spoke to the President about the crash, and he offered the entire \nState his prayers and is devoting the resources of the Federal \nGovernment toward the investigation.\n  I also expressed concerns to the Transportation Secretary nominee, \nMary Peters. She is aware of our concerns and the need for a thorough \ninvestigation conducted in a timely manner. Today, she will have the \nopportunity to update the committee as well. We also need to hear what \nchanges need to be made to our aviation system to prevent catastrophes \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, it is impossible to overstate the sorrow that has \ndraped over so many lives in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Most of the \npassengers on flight 5191 were from my State. In a variety of different \nplaces across the State, it is rare not to know someone who knew one of \nthe victims.\n  As Kentucky continues to heal, we will take a deep breath, refrain \nfrom jumping to conclusions, and finish a thorough and complete \ninvestigation.\n  Kentuckians have drawn together during this crisis to lend each other \nstrength. I am proud of the outpouring of aid and voluntarism that the \nresidents of the Bluegrass State have shown their neighbors. Grief will \nbe there for a long time to come, but sympathy and support will be \nthere too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9776-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, today, supporters of Israel are \ngathering in New York to show solidarity with our friend and ally, the \nState of Israel, and I am proud to join my voice with theirs\n\n[[Page S9777]]\n\nin support of Israel. As world leaders gather in New York City for the \nGeneral Assembly, the world must know that Americans and all people who \nvalue freedom and the rights and dignity of human beings around the \nworld stand with Israel as it defends itself against unwarranted, \nunprovoked attacks from terrorists and their state sponsors.\n  It is essential for those of us who care deeply about what is \nhappening in Israel now to recognize that Israel's struggle is a \nstruggle on behalf of a future where people will be able to live in \npeace and security. The kidnapping of Israeli soldiers that \nprecipitated the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza have not yet been \nresolved, and it is essential that Israel's abducted soldiers are \nreturned to Israel unconditionally. I have met with family members of \none of the soldiers abducted in Israel near the Lebanese border who \nspoke eloquently and movingly about the importance of securing the safe \nreturn of the captured soldiers. Today I sent a letter to Jacob \nKellenberger, president of the International Committee of the Red \nCross, asking that he do whatever possible to determine the health and \nwell-being of the three soldiers, to ensure that they have their full \nrights under the Geneva Conventions, and to do what he can to secure \ntheir release.\n  Israel's right to exist, and exist in safety, must never be put in \nquestion, and we must continue to stand up to offensive rhetoric and \nterrorist violence that threatens Israel's existence. Iranian President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad, a repeated purveyor of offensive rhetoric, is \ncurrently visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly. It \nis my hope that world leaders will convey the message that through his \nstatements calling for Israel's destruction and support for the \nterrorists who rain rockets on Israeli civilians and abduct its \nsoldiers, President Ahmadinejad continues to lessen his standing as a \ncredible world leader in the community of nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9777-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARMENIAN INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and \ncelebrate the important milestone of the 15th anniversary of Armenian \nindependence.\n  Armenia has a rich history which spans more than 3000 years. \nConsidered one of the cradles of civilization, Armenia was the first \ncountry in the world to officially adopt Christianity as its religion. \nThe Armenian alphabet and language have helped ensure the continuation \nof a vibrant Armenian culture, despite great odds and numerous attempts \nto destroy the Armenian nation and the Armenian people.\n  I was honored to witness the resiliency, courage, and spirit of the \nArmenian people when I visited Armenia as a Member of Congress in 1991, \nin the aftermath of the devastating earthquake. During that trip, my \ncommitment to recognizing the Armenian genocide was further \nstrengthened.\n  In 1915, the Ottoman Turks attempted to annihilate the Armenian \npeople in a brutal genocide. To this day, the Turkish Government \nrefuses to acknowledge the atrocities for what they were--a systematic \ngenocide. Not only were the Armenian people able to survive the \ngenocide, but they kept their small nation alive. It was a great \nvictory when the first Republic of Armenia was formed in 1918 following \nthe Armenian genocide. But again, Armenia faced dissolution when it was \ntaken over by the Soviet Union in 1920; the short-lived independence of \nArmenia ended when it became a Soviet Republic in the USSR.\n  Again, the Armenian people persevered despite their loss of \nindependence and despite more devastation. In 1988, disaster hit when \nan earthquake rocked Armenia, killing approximately 50,000 people and \nleaving more than half a million people homeless.\n  Then, on September 23, 1991, Armenia declared its independence from \nthe Soviet Union and formed the second Republic of Armenia. This was a \nrebirth of the independent state of Armenia and an historic moment for \nan oppressed country. It was a cause for celebration for Armenians \naround the world.\n  I am proud that the United States helped the newly independent \nArmenian nation during its transition to democracy. In December, 1991, \nthe United States formally recognized the independence of Armenia, and \nthe two countries established diplomatic relations with embassies in \neach country in January 1992.\n  But more remains to be done. This 15th anniversary offers an \nopportunity to celebrate the United States' relationship with Armenia \nand to renew our commitment to this country and our calls for Armenian \ngenocide recognition.\n  Following September 11, 2001, Armenia was one of the first countries \nto respond with assistance to the United States. Armenia provided \nembassy protection and clearance for U.S. flight, shared intelligence, \nand froze bank accounts. The U.S. friendship with Armenia remains \ncritical in our fight against terrorism. The United States must never \nforget Armenia's help and must do all it can to help this independent, \ndemocratic nation prosper.\n  On this milestone 15th anniversary, I am honored to recognize \nArmenian independence. I pledge to do all I can to assist Armenia and \nmy Armenian-American constituents in California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9777-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WELCOMING KAZAKSTAN PRESIDENT NURSULTAN NAZARBAYEV\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, next week the United States will welcome \nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev, the leader of the Republic of \nKazakhstan. Fifteen years ago 15 independent states were formed after \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. The international community has \nfollowed the aftermath of these events in that part of the world with \ngreat interest.\n  Kazakhstan has demonstrated important economic gains during this \nperiod. The reforms which have been carried out thus far have allowed \nit to become one of the world's rapidly developing economies with an \nannual growth of 9-10 percent. Additionally, it has become the place \nfor common ground among its various ethnic and spiritual groups.\n  As ethnic and religious conflicts divide regions around the world, \nKazakhstan is working to preserve broad interfaith tolerance by \ncreating the Congress of World and Traditional Religions. This program \nunites a predominantly Muslim country with more than 40 other faiths \nand fosters a dialog which assists in overcoming religious differences.\n  One cannot overlook Kazakhstan's contribution to nonproliferation and \npromotion of global security. Kazakhstan had the world's fourth largest \nnuclear arsenal, and renounced this lethal heritage without any \npressure or coercion.\n  Independent Kazakhstan is a young nation, yet it has shown tremendous \nprogress and occupies a worthy place in the international community. \nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev has made significant contributions to \nthe establishment of strong and friendly relations with the United \nStates.\n  After the tragic events on September 11, 2001, Kazakhstan extended \nits generosity to the people of the United States and after Hurricane \nKatrina it offered its generous support to the people of Louisiana.\n  Today our countries enjoy a solid foundation for the continued \nflourishing of a partnership along the entire spectrum of bilateral \nrelations. Kazakhstan is a dependable partner of the United States in \nthe global war on terrorism. I am confident the upcoming visit of \nPresident Nazarbayev to the United States will deepen and strengthen \nthe strategic partnership between our two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9777-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9777-S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands, CNMI, became a part of the United States 30 years ago with \nhigh expectations, but today they are an American community in deep \ndistress. The CNMI economy is being bled by a rapid decline in its \ngarment industry as the result of new international trade rules, by \nlosses in its tourism industry, and by the loss of over $100 million \neach year in wages that are sent offshore by foreign guest workers. The \ncommunity on Saipan, where 90 percent of the population resides is \nexperiencing increasing problems with water quality and service, the \nelectric system has returned to scheduled outages after years of \nreliable service, and overburdened wastewater systems cause regular \ncontamination of the land, air,\n\n[[Page S9778]]\n\nand water. The Government has recently made layoffs in an effort to \nbalance the budget and has even cut back the number of workdays for \nthose who continue to have jobs. Unemployment is conservatively \nestimated at 14 percent and rising, and a shocking 65 percent of \nchildren receive food assistance. Only 6 months ago, the Government \nasked Congress for an unprecedented $140 million in new appropriations \nto maintain government operations and meet critical needs.\n  There are many reasons for this dire situation; some are temporary, \nothers are systemic. One of the systemic causes of this situation which \nshould be addressed promptly by Congress and the administration is the \nlocal government's labor and immigration policies, particularly their \npromotion of an extremely high population growth rate, 500 percent in \n30 years, and their promotion of the use of alien guest workers instead \nof U.S. citizens for nearly all private sector occupations. In order to \nestablish a stable and sustainable foundation for the CNMI's future, a \nnew Federal immigration and labor policy framework and Federal \ninstitutions are needed to properly control the borders and to properly \nmanage the guest worker program.\n  When the CNMI became a U.S. territory in 1976, most U.S. laws were \nimmediately extended. However, the granting of U.S. citizenship to the \ninhabitants and the extension of U.S. immigration law were not to occur \nuntil ``after termination of the Trusteeship Agreement''; that is, not \nuntil after the international community, acting through the United \nNations, recognized the extension of U.S. sovereignty over the islands \nby terminating the U.N. Trusteeship Agreement.\n  Unfortunately, during the 10-year period between U.S. approval of the \ncovenant in 1976 and U.N. termination of the trusteeship in 1986, the \nCNMI began the importation of foreign workers to exploit a combination \nof immigration, wage, and trade privileges. In 1986, the Reagan \nadministration wrote to the CNMI Governor stating that ``the tremendous \ngrowth in alien labor [is] . . . extremely disturbing'' and urged \n``timely and effective action to reverse the . . . situation.'' The \nadministration warned that ``the uncontrolled influx of alien workers . \n. . can only result in increased social and cultural problems.'' The \nCNMI policy was also inconsistent with the legislative history of the \ncovenant which states that local immigration control was intended to \nrestrict immigration in order to protect the indigenous community from \nbeing overwhelmed by immigrants.\n  Notwithstanding these concerns expressed by the Reagan \nadministration, and later the Bush and Clinton administrations, the \nCNMI continued to import alien guest workers and other, nonworker, \naliens. The population of 16,000 in 1976 has exploded to an estimated \n80,000 today.\n  Mr. President, in 1999, the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Act \nImplementation Act was reported favorably by the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, and it passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous \nconsent in 2000. It would have extended the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, INA, to the CNMI as anticipated under the covenant agreement which \njoined the United States and CNMI in political union in 1976. The \nmeasure was reintroduced in the 107th Congress and was again reported \nfavorably by the Energy Committee. I was pleased that the measure \ncontinued to have bipartisan support at that time, including the \n``strong support'' of the administration.\n\n  On June 21,2006, I joined with my colleague and the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, Pete Domenici, in a letter to the Secretary of the \nInterior, copied to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, asking whether there have been developments that would cause \nthe administration to alter its support for this bill. We have not yet \nreceived a reply.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent \nletter to Secretary Kempthorne, a copy of the original, 2001 letter of \nsupport from the administration, and a copy of a section-by-section \nsummary of the legislation all be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the reasons the Administration \nand Congress should continue to support legislative action are \ncompelling, and I present them here for the consideration of my \ncolleagues and the public. In short, there are five reasons that \nlegislation is needed to more fully implement the covenant agreement \nthat ties the CNMI and the United States in political union: the lack \nof local institutional capacity, national security, ineffective law \nenforcement against organized crime, an unsustainable economic model, \nand inadequate protection for alien workers. I believe that any one of \nthese reasons is a basis for the administration to reaffirm its \nsupport. All five reasons make the case for continued support \noverwhelming.\n  First, congressional action is needed because the CNMIs lack the \ninstitutional capacity to control its borders or to properly manage \nimmigration and guest worker programs. In 1997, reports by both the \nU.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, and by the bipartisan \nU.S. Commission on Immigration Reform found that the CNMI does not \nhave, and never will have, the capacity to properly control its borders \nbecause border control requires sovereign authority to operate overseas \nconsulates, issue visas, and have access to classified national and \ninternational ``watch'' lists. During the Energy Committee's hearings \non this legislation in September of 1999, the General Counsel of the \nINS, Mr. Bo Cooper, was asked, ``Do you foresee any circumstances under \nwhich the government of the Commonwealth could operate an immigration \nsystem that is satisfactory to the Federal Government?'' Mr. Cooper \nresponded, ``No, I do not.'' This fundamental fact has not changed with \ntime, and it alone constitutes a basis for enacting legislation to \nextend Federal immigration control to the CNMI.\n  Second, Federal legislative action is needed because the post-9/11 \nenvironment requires that the United States secure its borders. The \nCNMI is an American community that deserves that same level of \nprotection from attack as other American communities. The United States \nalso has important military assets and training facilities in the CNMI, \nand our Nation's Naval and Air Force bases in nearby Guam are \nincreasingly important both regionally and globally. The threat from \nNorth Korea, tension between Taiwan and China, and terrorist activity \nin the nations of Southeast Asia, all underscore the strategic \nimportance of the Marianas. Yet the lack of institutional capacity to \nsecure the borders underscores the vulnerability of the Marianas, and \nthe Nation. Border control is an inherently sovereign function, and \ngiven the increasing importance of the Marianas, the increased threats \nthey face, and the obligation of the President to protect all U.S. \ncommunities, this function can no longer be delegated to local \nauthorities.\n  A third reason for congressional action is the CNMI's lack of \ncapacity to screen for criminals entering the islands. This deficiency \nhas contributed to the establishment of organized crime elements from \nJapan, China, and Russia in the community and to an increase in illegal \ndrug, gambling, prostitution, and trafficking crimes associated with \nsuch elements. The 1997 INS report found that: ``[There are] serious \ndeficiencies in all facets of the Marianas' current system of \nimmigration enforcement and control'' and ``There appears to be \nuniversal recognition amongst the Mariana Government Authorities that \nvarious organized crime groups, such as the Japanese Yakuza, the \nChinese Triads, and the Russian Mafia have made inroads into the \nMarianas . . . Few of these persons are ever detected at the port-of-\nentry or apprehended while in the Marianas.'' The report recommended \nthat Congress enact legislation to extend the Immigration and \nNationality Act.\n\n  A fourth reason for congressional action is to change CNMI \nimmigration and labor policies that are unsustainable and contribute to \nthe distress the community now faces. The CNMI, promotes the use of \nguest workers to fill virtually all private sector jobs: unskilled, \nskilled, and even professional jobs. In addition, both the CNMI \nGovernment and the private sector earn income from the hiring of alien \nworkers but not from hiring U.S. citizens. Consequently, those U.S. \ncitizens who cannot find increasingly\n\n[[Page S9779]]\n\nscarce Government work are left to go on welfare or emigrate. \nUnemployment is conservatively estimated at 14 percent and rising. An \nastounding 65 percent of children are on food assistance. Also \ncontributing to this unsustainable economic model is the problem of \nwage remittances. For 2005, it was reported that guest worker \nremittances to their home countries was well in excess of $100 million. \nThese remittances are bleeding the community of wealth that is no \nlonger available to buy goods and services, create jobs, and otherwise \nstimulate economic activity for the benefit of the community.\n  The CNMI's labor and immigration policies also contribute to an \nunsustainable economy because they result in huge population growth \nrates which have overwhelmed the community's infrastructure and \nservices. Most of these new residents are very low-wage or no-wage \nmigrants who are a net drain on the economy, consuming more in public \nservices than they contribute in taxes. As a result, water and power \nare rationed; sewage fouls the land, air, and water; and healthcare and \neducation facilities are seriously overcrowded. Each year the economy \nstruggles to support growing numbers of unemployed U.S. citizens, as \nwell as thousands of nonworking alien and illegal alien residents.\n  Finally, local labor and immigration policies contribute to an \nunsustainable economy because the resulting high crime and \ndeteriorating infrastructure create disincentives to investment. Gone \nare the clean and open beaches and the reliable utilities and services \nthat attracted new hotel and tourist investment 20 years ago. Instead, \nthe CNMI has asked the Congress for a $140 million bailout to sustain \nan economic model that is fundamentally flawed.\n  The fifth reason Federal legislative action is needed is to protect \nguest workers from abuse. Abuse of workers was the driving force behind \ncongressional establishment of the Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, \nImmigration, and Law Enforcement in 1994. Following establishment of \nthis program, Interior Department investigations confirmed the \nallegations of outrageous abuses, from widespread and systematic \ncheating of workers out of ages, to improper confinement, to coerced \nabortions. The worst of these abuses have apparently ended, in part \nthrough the efforts of the U.S. Department of the Interior's labor \nombudsman. This office was established under the initiative in 1999 as \na stop-gap measure because the Energy Committee's efforts to enact \nreform legislation had run into insurmountable opposition in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. The Interior labor ombudsman's responsibility \nwas, and remains, to advocate on behalf alien workers; to give them a \nvoice in the face of the inadequately funded and often indifferent \nlocal bureaucracy.\n  Unfortunately, the 2006 ombudsman's report states that while there \nhave been improvements in the treatment of guest workers, ``There are \nstill a number of serious problems that have yet to be effectively \naddressed by local government officials: ensuring the health and safety \nof alien workers; inadequate prevention efforts to curb labor abuses \nthrough periodic regulatory inspections; unacceptable delay in \ninvestigating and adjudicating worker complaints due to failure to \nallocate sufficient resources to the Department of Labor; difficulty \nrooting out corruption within the agencies tasked with regulating alien \nentry and work permitting, and an inability or unwillingness to \nprosecute repeat offenders.''\n\n  Mr. President, if, after 12 years of effort, the chief Federal labor \nofficial in the CNMI still finds such systemic problems in the local \ngovernment's capabilities and commitment to stop the abuse of guest \nworkers, then it is clearly time for Congress to enact reform \nlegislation. Stop-gap measures have only resulted in stop-gap \nsolutions. If foreign-national guest workers continue to be mistreated \nunder the U.S. flag, then it is the duty of the Congress to extend the \nFederal laws and institutions necessary for their protection.\n  I am disappointed with the lack of priority which the Department of \nthe Interior has given the CNMI Initiative during recent years. Since \n2000 the Department has failed to submit an annual report on the \ninitiative. This year the report was finally submitted but only after \nthe Department was twice directed to do so in congressional \nappropriations report language. As for content, the report is \ncompletely inadequate. It was composed only of a statement by the \nInterior labor ombudsman and it failed to include the input of Federal \nlaw enforcement officials or any of the socioeconomic data needed to \nproperly assess socioeconomic and law enforcement trends in the \nislands. Without regular tracking of census and economic data, such as \npopulation, household income, and government revenues and expenditures, \nCongress must rely upon press reports to assess conditions in the \nislands. Nevertheless, the information contained in the Department's \nnarrowly scoped report still leads to the conclusion that conditions \nhave not fundamentally changed with respect to the protection of guest \nworkers, and Federal legislative action is still needed.\n  Any one of these five reasons--lack of institutional capacity, border \ncontrol, law enforcement, unsustainable economics, and inadequate \nworker protection--is sufficient cause for Federal action. All five \nreasons make an overwhelming case. Certain fundamental facts that \nexisted in 2001 when the administration first announced its support for \nlegislation remain unchanged. For example, the CNMI still lacks the \ncapacity to properly operate immigration and guest worker programs. \nOther facts are new and provide further justification for the \nadministration to reaffirm its support. For example, after \n9/11 the United States is at greater risk of attack and must secure its \nborders and protect the U.S. citizens of the Marianas as we protect all \ncommunities on American soil\n  Border security and immigration control are inherent functions of \nnational sovereignty that were intended to be extended to the CNMI \nfollowing international recognition of the extension of U.S. \nsovereignty over the islands. That recognition occurred in 1986. As \npredicted by the Reagan administration 20 years ago, the failure of \nCongress to extend these laws has resulted in unacceptable social and \ncultural problems. Four U.S. administrations have expressed serious \nconcern with these conditions, and two administrations have endorsed \nlegislation to extend the INA with appropriate protections for the \nlocal economy. There have been no developments since 2001 that provide \na basis for the administration to alter its strong support for this \napproach. In fact, the case for extending Federal policies and \ninstitutions to the CNMI to protect the community and to stabilize its \neconomy is more compelling than ever.\n  I look forward to receipt of the administration's reply to the \ncommittee's June 21 2006 letter, and to working with them, Chairman \nDomenici, and representatives of the CNMI on legislation to extend \nFederal immigration policies and institutions to the CNMI as \nanticipated by the covenant and as needed to protect the community and \nrestore its economy to a sustainable future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                  U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2006.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Kempthorne: The U.S. Senate is currently \n     engaged in a debate regarding our Nation's immigration \n     policies, including discussion of border security, labor \n     demand, and the status of persons currently in the country \n     without legal status. As members of the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources which has jurisdiction with respect to \n     the Territories of the United States, we have, over the \n     course of several years, considered these issues with respect \n     to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).\n       On June 5, 2001, the Committee reported legislation, the \n     Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act (S. 507, \n     S. Rpt. 107-28) that would have extended Federal immigration \n     law to the CNMI with certain transition, exemption, and \n     assistance provisions. This legislation was reported with a \n     statement of support by the Administration as set forth in \n     the letter of May 15, 2001 from Assistant Attorney General \n     Daniel J. Bryant to then-Chairman Frank H. Murkowski.\n       Given the passage of time, we are writing to ask whether \n     there have been any developments in the CNMI that would cause \n     the Administration to readdress their statement from 2001. We \n     ask that you please provide a response within 30 days, as \n     Chairman of the Interagency Group on Insular Affairs, and \n     direct any questions that you may have to\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\n     Josh Johnson or Allen Stayman of the Committee staff at 202-\n     224-4971.

Domenici,\n       Chairman.\n     Jeff Bingaman,\n       Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the \n     Department of Justice on S. 507, the ``Northern Mariana \n     Islands Covenant Act.'' We strongly support S. 507.\n       S. 507 would extend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (``CNMI''). \n     It contains special provisions to allow for the orderly \n     application of national immigration law, taking into account \n     the local economy in this newest United States territory. S. \n     507 is identical to S. 1052 from the l06th Congress.\n       We believe that S. 507 would improve immigration policy by \n     guarding against the exploitation and abuse of individuals, \n     by helping to ensure that the United States adheres to its \n     international treaty obligation to protect refugees, and by \n     further hindering the entry into United States territory of \n     aliens engaged in international organized crime, terrorism, \n     or other such activities. Consequently, we support S. 507 and \n     urge its passage.\n       This bill has resource implications for the Executive \n     branch. If it passes, we look forward to working with the \n     appropriate committees to ensure that the necessary resources \n     are dedicated to achieve the purpose of the bill.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please \n     do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of further \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that, from the standpoint of the Administration's program, \n     there is no objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n       Identical letter sent to the Honorable Jeff Bingaman, \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act, 107th Congress.\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short title and purpose. The statement of \n     purpose is intended to guide and direct Federal agencies in \n     implementing the provisions of this Act, and states, in part:\n\n     ``. . . it is the intention of Congress in enacting this \n     legislation: (1) to ensure effective immigration control by \n     extending the Immigration and Nationality Act with special \n     provisions to allow for the orderly phasing-out of the non-\n     resident contract worker program of the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, and the orderly phasing-in of \n     Federal responsibilities over immigration in the Commonwealth \n     of the Northern Mariana Islands; and to minimize, to the \n     greatest extent possible, potential adverse effects this \n     orderly phase-out might have on the economy of the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. . . .''\n\n       Section 2. Immigration reform for the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands. Subsection (a) amends Public Law \n     94-241 which approved the Covenant to Establish a \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political \n     Union with the United States of America by adding a new \n     section 6 at the end.\n       The new Covenant Section 6: provides for the orderly \n     extension of Federal immigration laws to the CNMI under a \n     transition program designed to minimize adverse effects on \n     the economy. Specific provisions are made to ensure access to \n     workers in legitimate businesses after the end of the \n     transition and for the adjustment of those foreign workers \n     who are presently in the CNMI and who have been continuously \n     employed in a legitimate business for the past five years.\n       Subsection (a): provides, except for any extensions that \n     may be provided by the Attorney General to specific \n     industries in accordance with the provisions of subsection \n     (d), for a transition program ending after eight years to \n     provide for the issuance of: nonimmigrant temporary alien \n     worker; family-sponsored, and employment-based immigrant \n     visas.\n       Subsection (b): addresses the special problems faced by \n     employers in the CNMI due to the Commonwealth's unique \n     geographic and labor circumstances by providing an exemption \n     from the normal numerical limitations on the admission of H-\n     2B temporary workers found in the INA. This subsection \n     enables CNMI employers to obtain sufficient temporary \n     workers, if United States labor and lawfully admissible \n     freely associated state citizen labor are unavailable, for \n     labor sensitive industries such as the construction industry.\n       Subsection (c): sets forth several requirements during the \n     transition program which must be met with respect to \n     temporary alien workers who would otherwise not be eligible \n     for nonimmigrant classification under the INA. The intent of \n     this subsection is to provide a smooth transition from the \n     CNMI's current system. The Secretary of Labor will be guided \n     by the Act, including the Statement of Purpose and the \n     explanation in the Committee Amendments section of the \n     Committee Report in establishing the system for the \n     allocating and determining the number of permits. Subsection \n     (j) provides for petitions to adjust the status of certain \n     long-term employees. If any petitions are granted under \n     subsection (j), the number of permits are to be reduced \n     accordingly to the extent that the system adopted by the \n     Secretary of Labor assumed an allocation of permits for the \n     positions held by persons whose status is adjusted under \n     subsection (j).\n       Subsection (d): provides general limitations on the initial \n     admission of most family-sponsored and employment-based \n     immigrants to the CNMI, as well as a mechanism for exemptions \n     to these general limitations. This subsection is intended to \n     address the concerns expressed by this Committee, in \n     approving the Covenant in 1976, regarding the effect that \n     uncontrolled immigration may have on small island \n     communities. This subsection further provides for a ``fail-\n     safe'' mechanism to permit, in cases of labor shortages, that \n     certain unskilled immigrant worker visas intended for the \n     CNMI be exempted from the normal worldwide and per-country \n     limitations found in the INA for such unskilled workers. This \n     subsection does not increase the overall number of aliens who \n     may immigrate to the United States each year.\n       Paragraph (1): of this subsection authorizes the Attorney \n     General, after consultation with the governor and the \n     leadership of the Legislature of the CNMI and in consultation \n     with other Federal Government agencies, to exempt certain \n     family-sponsored immigrants who intend to reside in the CNMI \n     from the general limitations on initial admission at a port-\n     of-entry in the CNMI or in Guam. For example, unless the CNMI \n     recommends otherwise, most aliens seeking to immigrate to the \n     CNMI on the basis of a family-relationship with a United \n     States citizen or lawful permanent resident would be required \n     to be admitted as a lawful permanent resident at a port-of-\n     entry other than the CNMI or in Guam, such as Honolulu.\n       Paragraph (2): generally provides the Attorney General with \n     the authority to admit, under certain exceptional \n     circumstances and after consultation with federal and local \n     officials, a limited number of employment-based immigrants \n     without regard to the normal numerical limitations under the \n     INA. The purpose of this provision is to provide a ``fail-\n     safe'' mechanism during the transition program in the event \n     the CNMI is unable to obtain sufficient workers who are \n     otherwise authorized to work under U.S. law. This paragraph \n     would also provide a mechanism for extending the ``fail-\n     safe'' mechanism beyond the end of the transition program, \n     for a specified period of time, with respect to legitimate \n     businesses in the CNMI.\n       Subparagraph (A): provides that the Attorney General, after \n     consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Governor and \n     leadership of the Legislature of the CNMI, may find that \n     exceptional circumstances exist which preclude employers in \n     the CNMI from obtaining sufficient work-authorized labor. If \n     such a finding is made, the Attorney General may establish a \n     specific number of employment-based immigrant visas to \n     be made available under section 203(b) of the INA during \n     the following fiscal year. The labor certification \n     requirements of section 212(a)(5) will not apply to an \n     alien seeking benefits under this subsection.\n       Subparagraph (B): permits the Secretary of State to \n     allocate up to the number of visas requested by the Attorney \n     General without regard to the normal per-country or `other \n     worker' employment-based third preference numerical \n     limitations on visa issuance. These visas would be allocated \n     first from unused employment-based third preference visa \n     numbers, and then, if necessary, from unused alien \n     entrepreneur visa numbers.\n       Subparagraph (C): deals with entry of persons with \n     employment-based immigrant visas. Persons who are otherwise \n     eligible for lawful permanent residence under the transition \n     program may have their status adjusted in the CNMI.\n       Subparagraph (D): provides that any immigrant visa issued \n     pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid only to apply for \n     initial admission to the CNMI. Any employment-based immigrant \n     visas issued on the basis of a finding of `exceptional \n     circumstances' as described in subparagraph (A) above, would \n     be valid for admission for lawful permanent residence and \n     employment only in the CNMI during the first five years after \n     initial admission. Such visas would not authorize permanent \n     residence or employment in any other part of the United \n     States during this five-year period. The subparagraph also \n     provides for the issuance of appropriate documentation of \n     such admission, and, consistent with the INA, requires an \n     alien to register and report to the Attorney General during \n     the five-year period. This five-year condition is intended to \n     prevent an alien from using the CNMI-only transition program \n     as a loophole to gain employment in another part of the \n     United States. Without this condition, such an alien, as a \n     lawful permanent resident, would be eligible to work anywhere \n     in the United States, thereby avoiding the lengthy (seven \n     years or longer) waiting period currently faced by other \n     aliens seeking unskilled immigrant worker visas.\n       Subparagraph (E): provides that an alien who is subject to \n     the five-year limitation under this paragraph may, if he or \n     she is otherwise eligible, apply for an immigrant visa\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n\n     or admission as a lawful permanent resident on another basis \n     under the INA.\n       Subparagraph (F): provides for the removal from the United \n     States, of any alien subject to the five-year limitation if \n     the alien violates the provisions of this paragraph, or if \n     the alien is found to be removable or inadmissible under \n     applicable provisions of the INA.\n       Subparagraph (G): provides the Attorney General with the \n     authority to grant a waiver of the five-year limitation in \n     certain extraordinary situations where the Attorney General \n     finds that the alien would suffer exceptional and extremely \n     unusual hardship were such conditions not waived. The \n     benefits of this provision would be unavailable to a person \n     who has violated the terms and conditions of his or her \n     permanent resident status, such as an alien who has engaged \n     in the unauthorized employment.\n       Subparagraph (H): provides for the expiration of \n     limitations after five years.\n       Subparagraph (I): provides for not more than two five-year \n     extensions, as necessary, of the employment-based immigrant \n     visa programs of this paragraph, with respect to workers in \n     legitimate businesses in the tourism industry. This provision \n     is designed to ensure that there be a sufficient number of \n     workers available to fill positions in the tourism industry \n     after the transition period ends. The subparagraph also \n     permits a single five-year extension for legitimate \n     businesses in other industries. The provisions are explained \n     more fully under the discussion of Committee Amendments.\n       Subsection (e): provides further detail regarding \n     nonimmigrant investor visas.\n       Subsection (f): provides further detail regarding persons \n     lawfully admitted into the CNMI under local law.\n       Subsection (g): provides travel restrictions for certain \n     applicants for asylum.\n       Subsection (h): deals with the effect of these provisions \n     on other law.\n       Subsection (i): provides that no time spent by an alien in \n     the CNMI in violation of CNMI law would count toward \n     admission and is self-explanatory.\n       Subsection (j): provides a one-time grandfather for certain \n     long-term employees and is more fully discussed in the \n     section of the Report describing the Committee Amendment.\n       Section 2, subsection (b): provides for three conforming \n     amendments to the INA.\n       Section 2, subsection (c): provides for technical \n     assistance to specifically charge the Secretary of Commerce \n     to provide technical assistance to encourage growth and \n     diversification of the local economy and the Secretary of \n     Labor to provide assistance to recruit, train, and hire \n     persons authorized to work in the U.S.\n       Section 2, subsection (d): provides administrative \n     authority for the Departments of Justice and Labor to \n     implement the statute.\n       Section 2, subsection (e): provides for a report to \n     Congress.\n       Section 2, subsection (f): limits the number of alien \n     workers present in the CNMI prior to the transition program \n     effective date.\n       Section 2, subsection (g): authorizes appropriations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9781-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONDEMNING DRIVE HUNTS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the inhumane \nand unnecessary annual slaughter of small cetaceans, including Dall's \nporpoise, the bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, false killer whales, \npilot whales, the striped dolphin, and the spotted dolphin, by Japan's \ndrive fishery.\n  Drive hunts are run by fishers who use scare tactics to herd, chase, \nand corral the animals into shallow waters where they are trapped and \nthen killed or hauled off live to be sold into captivity. The \noverexploitation of these highly social and intelligent animals for \ndecades has resulted in the serious decline, and in some cases, the \ncommercial extinction, of these species.\n  On April 7, 2005, I introduced Senate Resolution 99 to help end this \ninhumane and unnecessary practice and urged participating countries to \nstop the brutal treatment of these animals. Fishers have killed small \ncetaceans along the coastlines of Japan for centuries with no regard \nfor the humaneness or sustainability of the hunt. Currently, up to \n20,000 small cetaceans of several species are killed in Japanese drive \nand harpoon hunts each year. In the last two decades, more than 400,000 \nhave been slaughtered in Japan alone.\n  The cruelty endured by dolphins and whales caught in drive hunts is \nimmense. Aboard motorized boats, drive hunt fishers loudly bang metal \npipes over the side of their boats to disorient the animals and drive \nthem toward shore where they are trapped by nets and stabbed with long \nknives, usually just behind the blowhole or across the throat. Many of \nthe animals eventually die from blood loss and hemorrhagic shock or \ntheir spinal cord is severed.\n  Today, the Humane Society of the United States/Humane Society \nInternational, Animal Welfare Institute, and Whale and Dolphin \nConservation Society are joining with concerned citizens throughout \nthis country and around the world to gather in peaceful demonstrations \nto express their concern for the welfare of these animals. I, too, join \nthem in condemning these brutal and senseless hunts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9781-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JAMES DEANDA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this afternoon I would like to take a \nmoment to mark the passing of a great American--Judge James DeAnda. \nJudge DeAnda died of cancer on September 7, 2006, at the age of 81. He \nwas appointed to the Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1979 \nand served as judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas until his retirement in 1992. Before his \ndistinguished tenure as a Federal trial judge, James DeAnda was a \ntireless civil rights advocate with what has become known as a \n``voracious appetite for justice.''\n  Born in Houston, TX, James DeAnda was the son of Mexican immigrants. \nHe attended Texas A University and served in the U.S. Marines during \nWorld War II before graduating from the University of Texas Law School \nin 1950, when there were only a handful of Hispanic law students. James \nDeAnda returned to Houston after graduation, but he had difficulty \nfinding work because White law firms refused to hire a Hispanic lawyer. \nNot one to be discouraged, James DeAnda joined another Hispanic lawyer \nto form a legal practice dedicated to representing Hispanic Americans.\n  In one of his earliest cases, James DeAnda was a member of the four-\nperson legal team behind Hernandez v. Texas, 1954, the first case tried \nby Mexican American attorneys before the U.S. Supreme Court. In \nHernandez, the Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction of a \nHispanic man by an all-White jury and for the first time gave Hispanics \nstatus as a distinct legal classification deserving of special \nprotection under the Constitution. This case represented a watershed \nmoment in our civil rights history because it opened the door to voting \nrights, education, and employment challenges by Hispanic Americans. \nJames DeAnda himself used this newly attained classification to fight \nthe segregation of Hispanic children within public schools. He was \ninvolved in a number of cases including Cisneros v. Corpus Christi \nIndependent School District, 1970, in which the Supreme Court extended \nfor the first time Brown v. the Board of Education to Hispanics.\n  In 1968, James DeAnda helped found the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Educational Fund, MALDEF. As one of our Nation's leading Latino \nadvocacy organizations, MALDEF played a crucial role in Judiciary \nCommittee hearings on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act this \nyear. Several MALDEF leaders testified before the Senate and House \ncommittees about the continued importance of the Voting Rights Act in \nensuring equal access and fair representation for minority voters. \nMALDEF conducted extensive studies showing the unavailability of \ntranslated voting materials and language assistance to Spanish-speaking \nvoters, despite the legal requirement that they be provided and clearly \ndemonstrated the need for reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  Judge James DeAnda inspired generations of civil rights advocates. \nThe continuing work of the organization he helped to found, MALDEF, \nserves as an enduring legacy to this great American. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9781-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9781-S9782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOLD STAR MOTHERS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, 70 years ago, Congress passed a resolution \nproclaiming that the last Sunday in September be designated as Gold \nStar Mother's Day. As we approach the last Sunday in September, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to recognize the Gold Star Mothers \nthroughout the country and particularly those in the State of Colorado.\n  I hope that we will all take time this Sunday, September 24, to honor \nthese mothers and fathers who have so bravely endured the loss of a son \nor daughter killed while serving in the Armed Forces. Colorado has lost \nmany young\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\nmen and women to combat since the horrendous attacks of 9/11. One day \nis not long enough for us to ever fully honor those parents who have \nhad to suffer the unimaginable pain of losing a child, but we will try.\n  Across the State of Colorado and the rest of the Nation, many of \nthese mothers have come together not only for support but also to \nvolunteer their time serving veterans and families of soldiers, \nencouraging patriotism and national pride, and honoring their children \nthrough service and allegiance to the United States. Through their \nvolunteer efforts, they keep alive the memory and spirit of those whose \nlives were lost in the war. They continue to inspire compassion, \nstrength, and faithfulness for all Americans.\n  To mark this weekend, the Blue Star Mothers of Colorado will be \nhosting Colorado's first annual Gold Star Mother's Day Weekend. There \nwill be several events throughout the weekend celebrating the lives of \nthose soldiers who so courageously gave the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir Nation. Unfortunately I will not be able to attend the ceremony \nmyself, but my wife Joan and I want to send our thoughts and prayers to \nthose who will be attending the event.\n  Words truly cannot express America's gratitude for our Armed Forces \nand their service and sacrifice to this Nation. Those who have fallen \nhave served a cause greater than themselves and deserve special honor. \nTo their mothers and fathers, you too deserve special honor as you \ncontinue to carry on the patriotic duties and legacy that your son or \ndaughter sadly could not. I thank you for your courage and for your \nservice to the United States of America.\n  Over the last 3 years, our Nation has been locked in a terrible \nstruggle against radical extremists across the Middle East. And I will \nreadily admit that this fight is one that we did not anticipate. But I \ndo know that every life given in the name of freedom has not been given \nin vain.\n  While they continually experience many dangerous challenges, our men \nand women of our Armed Forces continue making strides in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We have fought a terrible enemy that has no regard for \nhuman life.\n  Yet despite our challenges, we have seen tremendous progress, \nespecially towards helping to create partners in our fight against \nterrorism worldwide. Indeed, much of our success depends on the men and \nwomen in the new democratic governments formed in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand they are stepping up to the challenge. In Iraq, people from all \nwalks of life--Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds--have participated in multiple \nelections and referendums across the country for the first time in \nIraq's history.\n  Remarkably, after democratic elections in Afghanistan, women are \nholding positions of power in local and national governments, something \nthat was impossible under the Taliban's rule. The sovereign governments \nare working with regional and international partners in achieving \nunited democracies--an achievement only allowed through our fighting \nmen and women in combat.\n  Many remarkable achievements have been made through the sacrifices of \nthe men and women in the military, but perhaps the most important of \nall is what has not occurred in our own country. Since we took military \naction against these Islamic extremists and brought the fight to them, \nwe have not seen an attack on American soil. The sacrifices that the \nsons and daughters of our Gold Star Mothers have made and continue to \nmake are protecting us here on our shores.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen that even after the death of terrorist \nleaders like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi that the forces of the Islamic \nextremists vow that they will continue to wage war on American \ncivilians. Our success against this type of enemy is only ensured by \nthe brave men and women of our Armed Forces. They provide the safety \nand security to our nation, and we are truly grateful for what they \nhave done. While the cost has been high, the cost of doing nothing \nwould be even greater. These words provide little comfort to the \nfamilies that have lost loved ones. But we will always remember those \nwho have lost their lives in support of our freedom, and thank them for \ntheir sacrifice.

Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the fifth \nannual National School Backpack Awareness Day, September 20, 2006. \nToday, the American Occupational Therapy Association, AOTA, in \ncollaboration with more than 350 occupational therapy practitioners \nacross the country will be educating thousands of children and their \nfamilies about how to stay healthy and succeed in school, especially \nhow to prevent backpack related injuries. These organizations are \ntaking real steps towards protecting our children during their most \nformative years.\n  Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants play an \nincredibly important role in our local communities. Occupational \ntherapy practitioners work directly with students, parents, and \nteachers to modify educational environments so that all students can \nachieve academic success. They often develop plans to improve function \nand productivity, so as to maximize independence within the academic \nenvironment. Their knowledge about how children can stay healthy and \nsucceed in school is invaluable. Today's effort to protect them from \nbackpack injuries is much needed, and I know it will have a positive \nimpact on thousands of families.\n  Many children enjoy picking out a backpack at the start of the school \nyear, usually based on a certain color or design, but if worn \nincorrectly or if too heavy, there is a serious potential for injury. \nIn light of this concern, today at schools, stores, hospitals, and \nshopping malls all over the Nation, children's backpacks will be \n``weighed-in.'' This will ensure that children are not carrying more \nthan 15 percent of their bodyweight on their back. According to U.S. \nand international studies, children using overloaded and improperly \nworn backpacks experience neck, shoulder and back pain. Furthermore, \nchildren wearing backpacks improperly suffer from compromised breathing \nand increased fatigue at significantly higher rates than students \nwearing their backpacks properly and with appropriate loads. In our \ngreat State of New Jersey, these ``weigh-ins'' are being conducted at \nnine locations throughout the State. By the end of the day, children \nall over America will be healthier and equipped with information about \nhow to properly load and carry a backpack.\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n\n  National School Backpack Awareness Day is a prime example of how \noccupational therapy works within our schools and communities to \npromote wellness and improve quality of life. I know today will be a \nsuccess and ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating September 20, \n2006, as National School Backpack Awareness Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9783-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       STILLWATER MINING COMPANY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I once heard my home State of \nMontana described as a small town with long streets and I can't think \nof a more apt description. We are all neighbors, and one of our \ncardinal rules is if your neighbor needs help, lend a hand. Last month, \nas fires raged across our State, many of our neighbors needed a hand \nand Montanans from all over Big Sky country pitched into help. Among \nthe first to help out was the Stillwater Mining Company.\n  As many are aware, the massive Derby Mountain Fire caused serious \ndamage around Big Timber, MT. At one time the Derby Mountain Fire was \nthe top priority fire in the country. When the communities around Big \nTimber needed help, the folks at the Stillwater Mining Company rolled \nup their sleeves and figured out how they could help.\n  The Stillwater Mining Company knew what a massive disaster the Derby \nFire had become, and how those fighting the fire needed every pair of \nhands they could get. To get more boots on the ground, the Stillwater \nMining Company provided full pay leave to all of their employees who \nvolunteered to either fight the fire or to assist the fire crews. They \npaid for every meal that the Red Cross served at the Derby Fire. They \nsent their human resource staffers to the area to help manage the \nevacuations. Their computer mapping specialists helped to make highly \nsophisticated fire maps. They sent their own personal bulldozers to the \nfire lines. They sent their sprinkler systems to the front lines to \nsaturate areas to protect homes. They also allowed helicopters to dip \ninto their mining ponds. And all of this was done by the Stillwater \nMining Company while at the same time they were forced to shut their \nmines down for 8 days due to the fire.\n  The Stillwater Mining Company saw a neighbor in need and without \nhesitation they lent a hand. I am proud to call them neighbor, and in \nMontana there is no higher compliment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9783-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF JULIANNE HAMMOND\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Wilmington \ncommunity lost Julianne Hammond--one of our most prominent lawyers and \na good friend to my wife Jill.\n  She was the 28th woman ever admitted to practice law in Delaware and \nworked for 30 years in real estate finance and land use law, changing \nthe landscape of our city with many redevelopment efforts.\n  Juli was a very outgoing, optimistic, happy person, who never let her \nillness get her down even as she battled breast cancer for 18 years. \nShe literally worked until a week or so before she passed away, never \ntalking about how sick she was.\n  She also was a very caring person and wanted to help others in their \nbattles with cancer. That is how we got to know Juli. In 1994, she \nbecame a founding board member of the Biden Breast Health Initiative to \nhelp educate young women on the importance of breast self-exam and \nearly detection. She would assist Jill with special events and raising \nfunds, doing everything and anything to help others.\n  I don't know how she had the time and energy, but Juli also served as \nvice president of the board of the Wilmington Economic Development \nCorporation, a board member of the Land Use Committee for the Committee \nof 100, and secretary of the board of the Wellness Community of \nDelaware.\n  Wilmington and New Castle County will not be the same without Juli. I \nknow my colleagues join Jill and me in extending our deepest sympathies \nto her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9783-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MONTANA'S HEROES\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the great America poet Robert Frost \nonce said that ``good fences make good neighbors.'' In my home State of \nMontana, nothing could be further from the truth. Although our State is \nmore than 600 miles wide, and nearly 300 miles long, we really are one \nbig small town. And when one of our neighbors is in need, we are always \nwilling to roll up our sleeves and lend a helping hand.\n  During this year's fire season, many of our neighbors were in dire \nneed as fires raged across our State. Nearly 1 million acres burned, an \narea larger than the State of Rhode Island. As homes, livestock, crops, \nand land burned, Montanans from one corner of the State to the other \nlost everything they had. But from this destruction and rubble, arose \nmany Montana heroes, and I would like to take a moment to publicly \nrecognize them.\n  On the front lines were all the brave wild land firefighters. These \nmen and women came from all over the country, and even some foreign \ncountries, to put their lives on the line for people they had never \nmet. While it is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and criticize \nsome of their techniques, it is clear that these brave men and women \ndeserve nothing but praise. When I visited the fires and I looked into \nthe men and women's eyes after working 12 hour days in 100 degree heat, \nas they were so exhausted they could hardly stand, I knew that they had \ngiven everything their all, 110 percent, to protect Montanans. These \nmen and women sought no praise or recognition, and whenever they were \ncongratulated they would merely say, ``We're just doing our jobs.'' But \nthese men and women weren't just doing a job; they were saving lives, \nprotecting property, and nothing could be more heroic. Words cannot do \ntheir deeds justice but on behalf of every Montanan, I would like to \noffer my deepest thanks.\n  And these men and women couldn't have done their job without all the \nsupport from different people and agencies throughout the State. All \nthe folks at the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, the \nMontana Department of Emergency Services, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nthe Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Montana State and \nlocal law enforcement, the local governments and county commissioners, \nvolunteer fire departments, and the Northern Rockies Coordinating \nGroup, which coordinated all these efforts, and their Federal partners. \nAll these folks worked tirelessly to manage these blazes. Day or night \nthey were constantly monitoring the fires, providing important updates, \nand making sure the people of the affected communities had every \nresource possible to deal with these disasters.\n  I would also like to recognize all the people who worked behind the \nscenes, the people whose names might not appear in the news, but \nwithout whose effort these fires couldn't have been contained. The \nbusdrivers, the local volunteers, the food service providers, the \npilots, the list could go on and on. Without these services, the damage \nto my home State would have been much worse.\n  Finally, I would like to thank all the Montanans who rolled up their \nsleeves, saw a neighbor in need, and helped out. Whether it was \nranchers helping move livestock, community organizations and churches \nholding clothing drives, or people opening their homes to those who had \nnowhere to go, all these people truly exemplify the Montana spirit.\n  The 2006 fire season will go down in history as one of worst in our \nState's history. Yet it will also go down as a time when neighbors \nhelped neighbors, when people traveled hundreds of miles to lend a hand \nto a friend. It will go down as a time of heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9783-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9783-S9784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF ELLA LITTLE CROMWELL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nrise today in memory of Ella Little Cromwell, a truly remarkable woman \nfrom Hartford who passed away Sunday, September 17. Mrs. Cromwell was \none of the most engaging and charismatic people I have ever had the \npleasure to know. Through tireless effort, Ella Cromwell became a real \npolitical institution in Hartford, and was a leader in many efforts to \npromote justice and equal rights.\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\n  Mrs. Cromwell believed very deeply in the value of political \nparticipation and believed that it was essential for Americans from all \nbackgrounds to become involved in the democratic process in order to \nreach their fullest potential. Growing up in Hartford, she saw that \nthere were various obstacles preventing African Americans and other \nminorities from being involved in the political process, and she \ndedicated her life to helping people overcome those obstacles.\n  Through her hard work with both the Hartford Democratic Town \nCommittee and the Hartford chapter of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, NAACP, of which she served as second \nvice president for many years, Mrs. Cromwell played an active role in \nhelping African Americans develop a stronger voice in the city's \npolitics. A master of both grassroots and retail politics, she was able \nto quickly increase her influence in Hartford politics, and helped to \nelect African-American candidates to local and State level offices. In \nmany ways, her home in Hartford served as a kind of political club, \nwhere prospective candidates would come seeking her support and advice. \nIt was well known that her support could be extremely helpful for any \ncandidate.\n  Also, as a member of the Connecticut Democratic State Central \nCommittee for 38 years, right up until her death, she made certain the \ninterests of her community were represented at the State level as well. \nAlmost every democratic candidate for statewide office would have to \npay a visit to Ella Cromwell.\n  Rarely does an individual have such a meaningful and lasting effect \non her community, but whether with the NAACP or the Democratic State \nCentral Committee, Ella Cromwell never failed to touch the lives of the \npeople around her. What is truly remarkable is the faith she continued \nto show in the power of the political process to effect change in her \ncommunity, and the way in which she would continue to engage in the \nhard, sometimes thankless, work of grassroots campaigning even after \nshe had achieved considerable political influence. Even at the age of \n76 she would campaign door-to-door at the same brisk pace she had \nemployed years earlier as young women first getting involved. Ella \nCromwell truly embodied the democratic sprit upon which our country was \nfounded.\n  With this in mind, I bid a sad farewell to Ella Little Cromwell, and \nI will keep her friends and family in my thoughts and prayers. May her \ncommitment to the well-being of others continue to serve as an \ninspiration for all who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9784-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHIEF ROB STONE: IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of a \ndedicated public servant, battalion chief Rob Stone of the California \nDepartment of Forestry. From the time he became a seasonal firefighter \nat the age of 18, Chief Stone devoted his adult life to providing the \ncitizens of California with safety and service. On September 6, 2006, \nwhile assessing a fire from the air and coordinating ground \nfirefighting efforts, Chief Stone was tragically killed in the line of \nduty when the spotter plane crashed in the rugged forest of the \nMountain Home State Park.\n  Upon graduation from high school, Chief Stone attended the California \nDepartment of Forestry Firefighting Academy to pursue his lifelong goal \nof becoming a firefighter. His prodigious talents were evident as Chief \nStone moved in rank from firefighter to become one of the youngest \nengineers ever in the California Department of Forestry. He was then \npromoted to captain, and his most recent assignment was battalion chief \nof the Porterville Air Attack Base. Chief Stone's commitment to \nexcellence, coupled with his passion for his profession, enabled him to \nbecome a model member of the California Department of Forestry. Chief \nStone's colleagues shall always remember him for his leadership and \ncommitment to his job.\n  Chief Stone is survived by his wife Randi, son Wil, and daughter \nLibbie; parents Cliff and Janet; sister Melissa Martin; brother Marty; \nand his grandmother Louise Lyons. When he was not on duty or spending \ntime with his family, Chief Stone was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed \ngathering cows, hunting, fishing, and camping. Chief Stone served the \nState of California with honor and distinction and fulfilled his oath \nas a firefighter. His contributions and dedication to firefighting are \ngreatly appreciated and will serve as a shining example of his legacy.\n  We shall always be grateful for Chief Stone's exemplary service and \nthe sacrifices he made while serving and protecting the people and the \nland that he loved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9784-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SIERRA OAKS SENIOR AND COMMUNITY CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Whether it is \nproviding free health assessments, offering classes in quilting, \npainting, and computers, or holding a stroke survivors support group, \nthe center upholds the principle that seniors should be afforded the \nopportunity to live independently and thrive in their own communities. \nThe dedicated staff and outstanding group of senior volunteers work \ndiligently to ensure that those who are in need of their support are \ntreated with the care and respect that they deserve. Through the \ncenter, many seniors have acquired invaluable tools to help them lead \nmore active and enjoyable lives.\n  I congratulate the Sierra Oaks Senior and Community Center on its \n20th anniversary and wish its staff, volunteers, and sponsors even \ngreater success as they continue to provide important services to the \nseniors of Tollhouse, Auberry, Shaver Lake, and Prather.

Mr. President, today I recognize the University of \nRedlands. This academic year, the university celebrates its 100 \nanniversary.\n  The University of Redlands was originally chartered in 1907 on a \ntract of donated land by individuals associated with the American \nBaptist Church. It admitted its first student in September 1909 and in \n1910 proudly celebrated its first graduating class of three students. \nThroughout the next century, the University of Redlands has become a \npreeminent institution and today celebrates a century of contribution \nand service through education.\n  With today's growth in population, there is an ever-present strain on \nour Nation's university systems and the ability of students to receive \nmeaningful direct contact with university faculty. The University of \nRedlands has successfully maintained personal instruction throughout \nthe years and continues today to maintain a student to faculty ratio of \n12 to 1. There are currently over 200 full-time faculty and a core of \n200 adjunct faculty who are selected for their expertise and experience \nin their fields. Throughout these past 100 years, the university has \nalso maintained a high level of faculty quality, with 88 percent of the \nfull-time faculty holding a Ph.D. or terminal degree.\n  The University of Redlands has successfully met the ever-changing \nneeds of a diverse population. Over one-third of the university's \nstudents are members of historically underrepresented groups, and the \nstudent body represents all corners of the world and draws students \nfrom across the United States. Most recently, the entering class of \n2006 saw 40 percent of its students from outside of the State of \nCalifornia.\n  The university's success contributes significantly to the growth of \nthe local community. Its faculty and staff make the University of \nRedlands one of the largest employers in the region, helping to \nmaintain a strong local economy. In the past decade, the university\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nhas invested over $140 million in its physical plant, employing many \nlocal craftsmen and laborers. In addition to investing in the local \neconomy and construction, the university invests significantly in its \nstudents, with over $28 million of university funds budgeted for need-\nbased, merit-based or talent-based awards. This contribution has \nproduced an alumni which has made a lasting impact on America, with \n45,000 alumni currently contributing to the betterment of society \nthroughout the world.\n  The University of Redlands' commitment to community outreach is seen \nmost noticeably in its students' service and contributions. Over 80,000 \ncommunity service hours are provided annually by University of \nRedlands' students to help meet local, national and international \nneeds. Meeting these needs has been a fundamental tenet in the \nuniversity's educational philosophy for many years, as it was one of \nthe first educational institutions in the Nation to require community \nservice as a condition for graduation.\n  On its centennial, the University of Redlands looks back on a proud \nhistory of growth and contribution in inland California and the world. \nI applaud the service and dedication of the faculty, staff, and \nstudents of the University of Redlands as they celebrate 100 years of \nimproving lives and education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9785-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRIAN UNITT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize inland \nsouthern California attorney Brian Unitt as he receives the San \nBernardino County Bar Association's Florentino Garza Fortitude Award. \nMr. Unitt is a community leader and an example to us all.\n  The Florentino Garza Award is given to exceptional individuals who \novercome significant obstacles and achieve success in the legal field. \nThis prestigious award takes its name from inland attorney Florentino \nGarza, who overcame a childhood as an orphan and a life as a migrant \nfarmworker to graduate from college and law school and eventually gain \nprominence in the legal profession.\n  Today I recognize the exceptional work of Brian Unitt, who has \novercome blindness to achieve outstanding success in the legal field. \nBrian Unitt was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at a young age. \nThis debilitating condition begins with a degeneration of cells in the \neye's retina, producing reduced vision and eventual loss of sight.\n  Brian Unitt received his law degree from the University of \nCalifornia, Davis, in 1983. Throughout his undergraduate years and in \nlaw school, he took class notes in Braille using a slate and stylus, \nand he typed examinations using an electric typewriter. He passed the \nCalifornia State bar examination on his first attempt and began \npracticing law shortly thereafter in Riverside, CA. In 1996, Brian \nUnitt became partner at that same firm, now known as Holstein, Taylor, \nUnitt and Law.\n  As an attorney, Mr. Unitt practices personal injury law, focusing \nparticularly on appellate work. His experience and dedication over the \nyears has allowed him to be a tremendous advocate for injured \nindividuals, assisting others who have suffered a physical loss. Other \nattorneys who have had the opportunity to know or work with Brian Unitt \nhave described him as ``brilliant in his legal work,'' ``a true scholar \nof the law,'' ``a superb lawyer,'' ``a wonderful, wonderful, brilliant \nplaintiff's attorney,'' and ``civil, professional, and ethical.''\n  Today I salute the life and service of Brian Unitt. His life story is \na true portrayal of a man who overcame tremendous physical adversity to \nassist others in their battle with physical adversity. I applaud Brian \nUnitt and look forward to what I hope will be many years of service to \nthe people of inland California. Please join me in honoring a true \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9785-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9785-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9785-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4583.

Rept. 109-19)]\n\nThe Text of the Committee Recommended Resolution of Advice and Consent \n                     to Ratification Is as Follows\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n       Section 1. Senate Advice and Consent Subject to \n     Understanding, Declarations, and Provisos.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and \n     the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and \n     related exchanges of letters, signed at Washington on March \n     31, 2003 (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as the \n     ``Treaty'') (Treaty Doc. 108-23), subject to the \n     understanding in section 2, the declarations in section 3, \n     and the provisos in section 4.\n       Section 2. Understanding.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following understanding:\n       Under United States law, a United States judge makes a \n     certification of extraditability of a fugitive to the \n     Secretary of State. In the process of making such \n     certification, a United States judge also makes \n     determinations regarding the application of the political \n     offense exception. Accordingly, the United States of America \n     understands that the statement in paragraphs 3 and 4 of \n     Article 4 that ``in the United States, the executive branch \n     is the competent authority for the purposes of this Article'' \n     applies only to those specific paragraphs of Article 4, and \n     does not alter or affect the role of the United States \n     judiciary in making certifications of extraditability or \n     determinations of the application of the political offense \n     exception.\n       Section 3. Declarations.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) Nothing in the Treaty requires or authorizes \n     legislation or other action by the United States of America \n     that is prohibited by the Constitution of the United States.\n       (2) The Treaty shall be implemented by the United States in \n     accordance with the Constitution of the United States and \n     relevant federal law, including the requirement of a judicial \n     determination of extraditability that is set forth in Title \n     18 of the United States Code.\n       Section 4. Provisos.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following provisos:\n       (1)(A) The Senate is aware that concerns have been \n     expressed that the purpose of the Treaty is to seek the \n     extradition of individuals involved in offenses relating to \n     the conflict in Northern Ireland prior to the Belfast \n     Agreement of April 10, 1998. The Senate understands that the \n     purpose of the Treaty is to strengthen law enforcement \n     cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom \n     by modernizing the extradition process for all serious \n     offenses and that the Treaty is not intended to reopen issues \n     addressed in the Belfast Agreement, or to impede any further \n     efforts to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n       (B) Accordingly, the Senate notes with approval--\n       (i) the statement of the United Kingdom Secretary of State \n     for Northern Ireland, made on September 29, 2000, that the \n     United Kingdom does not intend to seek the extradition of \n     individuals who appear to qualify for early release under the \n     Belfast Agreement;\n       (ii) the letter from the United Kingdom Home Secretary to \n     the United States Attorney General in March 2006, emphasizing \n     that the ``new treaty does not change this position in any \n     way,'' and making clear that the United Kingdom ``want[s] to \n     address the anomalous position of those suspected but not yet \n     convicted of terrorism-related offences committed before the \n     Belfast Agreement''; and\n       (iii) that these policies were reconfirmed in an exchange \n     of letters between the United Kingdom Secretary of State for \n     Northern Ireland and the United States Attorney General in \n     September 2006.\n       (2) The Senate notes that, as in other recent United States \n     extradition treaties, the Treaty does not address the \n     situation where the fugitive is sought for trial on an \n     offense for which he had previously been acquitted in the \n     Requesting State. The Senate further notes that a United \n     Kingdom domestic law may allow for the retrial in the United \n     Kingdom, in certain limited circumstances, of an individual \n     who has previously been tried and acquitted in that country. \n     In this regard, the Senate understands that under U.S. law \n     and practice a person sought for extradition can present a \n     claim to the Secretary of State that an aspect of foreign law \n     that may permit retrial may result in an unfairness that the \n     Secretary could conclude warrants denial of the extradition \n     request. The Senate urges the Secretary of State to review \n     carefully any such claims made involving a request for \n     extradition that implicates this provision of United Kingdom \n     domestic law.\n       (3) Not later than one year after entry into force of the \n     Treaty, and annually thereafter for a period of four \n     additional years, the Secretary of State shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting \n     forth the following information with respect to the \n     implementation of the Treaty in the previous twelve months:\n       (A) the number of persons arrested in the United States \n     pursuant to requests from the United Kingdom under the \n     Treaty, including the number of persons subject to \n     provisional arrest; and a summary description of the alleged \n     conduct for which the United Kingdom is seeking extradition;\n       (B) the number of extradition requests granted; and the \n     number of extradition requests denied, including whether the \n     request was denied as a result of a judicial decision or a \n     decision of the Secretary of State;\n       (C) the number of instances the person sought for \n     extradition made a claim to the Secretary of State of \n     political motivation, unjustifiable delay, or retrial after \n     acquittal and whether such extradition requests were denied \n     or granted; and\n       (D) the number of instances the Secretary granted a request \n     under Article 18(1)(c). \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9786-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9786-S9787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ENZI for the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n       *Stephen Goldsmith, of Indiana, to be a Member of the Board \n     of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community \n     Service for a term expiring October 6, 2010.\n       *Andrew von Eschenbach, of Texas, to be Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs, Department of Health and Human Services.\n       *Peter W.

A bill to establish an Advisory Committee on Gestational \nDiabetes, to provide grants to better understand and reduce gestational \ndiabetes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nGestational Diabetes Act of 2006 to bring attention to an important \nhealth issue facing women and children.\n  I don't need to tell anyone that we have an obesity epidemic in the \nUnited States. Too many in our country don't know that eating poorly \nand not taking care of themselves can have significant health impacts. \nFor women, these health issues can become especially significant during \npregnancy.\n  Women who are overweight or obese are more likely to have a C-section \nand are at an increased risk for serious complications with their \npregnancy. And more women then ever are entering their pregnancies \noverweight which can also trigger gestational diabetes.\n  In New York, gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in \nabout 10 years. In New York City alone, gestational diabetes affects 1 \nin 25 women, about 400 women per month. Gestational diabetes affects \nbetween 4 and 8 percent of pregnant women in the United States. Infants \nof women who have gestational diabetes are at increased risk for \nobesity and developing Type 2 diabetes as adolescents or adults.\n  As women we need to pay attention to our health. We are always \nworrying about the health of our children, our husbands, and our \nparents. But we often forget to take care of ourselves.\n  Prevention is critical and I applaud new initiatives from the New \nYork City Department of Health to increase efforts to inform women \nabout gestational diabetes and behaviors that can prevent Type 2 \nDiabetes.\n  Today, I am introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act, also known as \nthe GEDI Act. This legislation will increase our understanding by \ndetermining the factors that contribute to this condition and help \nmothers who had gestational diabetes reduce their risk of developing \nType 2 diabetes.\n  This Act will provide funding for projects to assist health care \nproviders and communities find ways to reach out to women so that they \nunderstand how their health during pregnancy will impact not only their \nchild's health, but also their own.\n  The GEDI Act would expand research to determine and develop \ninterventions that will lower the incidence of gestational diabetes. We \nneed to alert women to the risk before this condition becomes an \nepidemic.\n  We should be doing everything we can to address the growing \nprevalence of gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy. The \nGEDI Act is an important step in assuring that women understand this \ncritical issue.\n  The GEDI Act is supported by: American Association of Colleges of \nPharmacy, American Association of Diabetes Educators, American Diabetes \nAssociation, American Dietetic Association, American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, Association of Asian Pacific Community \nHealth Organizations, Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \nNeonatal Nurses, Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington, Breastfeeding \nTask Force of Greater Los Angeles, Global Alliance for Women's Health, \nInternational Community Health Services, National Association of \nChronic Disease Directors, National Research Center for Women & \nFamilies, Society for Women's Health Research, WithinReach, and Women's \nHealth Council of the National Association of Chronic Disease \nDirectors.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Association\n\n\n                                      of Colleges of Pharmacy,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, August 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of America's 92 accredited \n     colleges and schools of pharmacy let me personally thank you \n     for your concern for the nearly 21 million children and \n     adults with diabetes. The American Association of Colleges of \n     Pharmacy (AACP) supports your introduction of legislation \n     focused on an important cohort of individuals at risk for \n     contracting diabetes--pregnant women.\n       The Gestational Diabetes Act will bring greater attention \n     to a public health problem that left unchecked will overwhelm \n     our society. Coupled with the growing incidence of obesity, \n     gestational onset diabetes requires new, unique approaches \n     and interventions that your legislation can help stimulate.\n       We know that pharmacists are effective in helping diabetic \n     patients improve their health outcomes through self-\n     management programs. These community-based providers have \n     been effective in working with the greater public health \n     community to increase the awareness of pregnant women of the \n     need to increase their intake of folic acid to reduce the \n     incidence of neural tube defects in newborns. Colleges and \n     schools of pharmacy are actively engaged in working with \n     communities to reduce the incidence of public health threats \n     and creating novel health promotion and wellness programs. We \n     encourage you to utilize this significant resource as your \n     legislation continues its way through the Congress and on to \n     final passage.\n       Thank you for your attention to an important public health \n     threat. We look forward to working with you to improve the \n     health of pregnant women by reducing their risk for \n     gestational diabetes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          William G.

Our members include nurses, \n     dietitians, pharmacists, physicians, social workers, exercise \n     physiologists and other members of the diabetes teaching \n     team.\n       Given the growing prevalence of diabetes in all \n     populations, steps taken now will not only address the need \n     to lower the incidence of gestational diabetes but prevent \n     women with this condition and their children from developing \n     Type 2 diabetes.\n       As an organization dedicated to improving the health and \n     lives of people with diabetes, AADE appreciates your \n     leadership on this important legislation and its intent to \n     better understand and reduce the incidence of gestational \n     diabetes.\n       Sincerely,\n                                     Malinda Peeples, RN, MS, CDE,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Diabetes Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, August 3, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Today, almost 21 million children and \n     adults in America have diabetes--including 9.7 million \n     women--and almost one third of them do not know it. On behalf \n     of all Americans living with diabetes in our country, I would \n     like to thank you for the introduction of the Gestational \n     Diabetes Act. The American Diabetes Association \n     enthusiastically supports this important legislation and its \n     intent to better understand and reduce the incidence of \n     gestational diabetes.\n       Gestational diabetes develops in 4-8% of all pregnancies, \n     with the prevalence increasing up to 10% in some populations. \n     Women who have had gestational diabetes or have given birth \n     to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds are at a dramatically \n     increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. \n     The\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\n     Gestational Diabetes Act will allow for better data \n     collection and expand the resources available to fight this \n     dangerous disease. By setting up a national grant program, \n     communities will be able to determine the most efficient and \n     customized approaches to prevent, diagnose and treat \n     gestational diabetes on the local level. Additionally, grants \n     can be used by state-based diabetes prevention and control \n     programs to collect and analyze surveillance data on women \n     with and at risk for gestational diabetes, among other \n     purposes. These components are crucial to stemming the tide \n     of gestational diabetes in America, and lowering the overall \n     incidence of diabetes in this country.\n       Every 24 hours, Americans pay a horrific price to diabetes: \n     4100 people are diagnosed with the disease, there are 230 \n     amputations in people with diabetes, 120 people will enter \n     end-stage kidney disease programs, and 55 people will go \n     blind. During this same time period, there will be 613 deaths \n     due to this epidemic. The American Diabetes Association \n     believes that if we are to truly make strides against this \n     devastating disease, we must improve treatment and research \n     on the communities most impacted by diabetes.\n       The Association applauds your efforts on behalf of \n     Americans with diabetes. We look forward to working with you \n     toward the passage of the Gestational Diabetes Act and other \n     legislation critical to Americans with diabetes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               L. Hunter Limbaugh,\n     Chair, National Advocacy Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Dietetic Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the 65,000 registered \n     dietitians who are members of the American Dietetic \n     Association (ADA), we thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act. While gestational \n     diabetes is one of pregnancy's most common complications, the \n     associated risks for mothers with GDM and their children are \n     startling. In the United States, maternal obesity also is a \n     concern and increases the risk of gestational diabetes, \n     cesarean deliveries, and complications during delivery, \n     macrosomia, congenital defects and childhood obesity. ADA has \n     been in the forefront of this issue by developing evidence-\n     based Nutrition Practice Guidelines for Gestational Diabetes \n     Mellitus.\n       It is the position of the American Dietetic Association \n     that women of childbearing potential should maintain good \n     nutritional status through a lifestyle that optimizes \n     maternal health and reduces the risk of birth defects, \n     suboptimal fetal development, and chronic health problems in \n     their children. The key components of a health promoting \n     lifestyle during pregnancy include appropriate weight gain; \n     consumption of a variety of foods in accordance with the Food \n     Guide Pyramid; appropriate and timely vitamin and mineral \n     supplementation; avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and other \n     harmful substances; and safe food-handling.\n       Women have specific nutritional needs and vulnerabilities \n     and, as such, are at unique risk for various nutrition-\n     related diseases and conditions. Therefore, ADA strongly \n     supports research, health promotion activities, health \n     services, and advocacy efforts that will enable women to \n     adopt desirable nutrition practices for optimal health. Women \n     are at risk for numerous chronic diseases and conditions that \n     affect the duration and quality of their lives. Although \n     women's health-related issues are multifaceted, nutrition has \n     been shown to influence significantly the risk of chronic \n     disease and to assist in maintaining optimal health status.\n       The American Dietetic Association strongly supports your \n     efforts to create a Research Advisory Committee within CDC to \n     address problems associated with gestational diabetes. \n     Registered dietitians can play a unique role in providing \n     medical nutrition therapy for pregnant women with \n     inappropriate weight gain. As a result, ADA would like to \n     work with you in ensuring that a qualified registered \n     dietitian serves on the committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald E. Smith,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton, On behalf of the American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), 51,000 physicians and \n     partners in women's health care, we are pleased to support \n     the GEstational DIabetes (GEDI) Act of 2006. This legislation \n     would provide research, monitoring, screening and training \n     for health care providers on gestational diabetes.\n       Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most \n     common clinical issues facing obstetricians and their \n     patients. A lack of data from well-designed studies has \n     contributed to the controversy surrounding the diagnosis and \n     management of this condition. The GEDI Act of 2006 would \n     provide critical funding for research and community education \n     on this important issue. Because of the expertise and solid \n     scientific evidence we have to contribute, we urge you to \n     ensure ACOG's participation on the advisory committee created \n     by this legislation.\n       Gestational diabetes affects 4 to 8 percent, approximately \n     135,000, of all pregnant women in the United States each \n     year. The increase in obesity in the U.S. has raised the \n     prevalence of gestational diabetes resulting in significant \n     health consequences, including increased risk for developing \n     Type 2 diabetes.

Our mission is to promote advocacy, \n     collaboration and leadership that improves the health status \n     and access of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific \n     Islanders within the U.S. and its territories and freely \n     associated states, primarily through our member community \n     health centers.\n       Diabetes is a serious chronic condition among Asian \n     Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). For FY 2003, AAPCHO \n     member centers, serving primarily AAPIs, reported an average \n     diabetes incidence rate of 11 per 1000 patients, far above \n     the Healthy People 2010 target rate of 2.5 per 1000 patients. \n     The Gestational Diabetes Act will improve treatment and \n     research in the AAPI community.\n       We appreciate your efforts and look forward to working with \n     you to improve the health status of AAPIs with diabetes \n     through the GEDI Act and other legislation concerning \n     diabetes. Please contact me if you have any questions or \n     would like additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jeffrey Caballero,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Breastfeeding Task Force\n\n\n                                       of Greater Los Angeles,\n\n                               Redondo Beach, CA, August 14, 2006.\n     Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     of the Breastfeeding Task Force of Greater Los Angeles, I am \n     writing to pledge our support of the Gestational Diabetes Act \n     and urge the inclusion of breastfeeding in the research and \n     treatment components. Gestational diabetes develops in 4 to 8 \n     percent of all pregnancies, with the prevalence increasing up \n     to 10 percent in some populations. Women who have gestational \n     diabetes are at a dramatically increased risk for developing \n     Type 2 diabetes later in life.\n       We support this legislation because it aims to lower the \n     incidence of gestational diabetes and prevent women afflicted \n     with this condition and their children from developing Type 2 \n     diabetes. Research shows that lactation improves maternal \n     glucose homeostasis, thus delaying or reducing the mother's \n     risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Babies born to mothers \n     with gestational diabetes are at great risk for developing \n     diabetes later in life. When these babies are breastfed, \n     their risk is reduced.\n       In Los Angeles County, approximately 10,000 women are \n     afflicted with gestational diabetes each year. The \n     Breastfeeding Task Force of Greater Los Angeles believes that \n     if we are to improve the lives of these women, we must \n     support and protect breastfeeding in the communities most \n     impacted by diabetes. The Gestational Diabetes Act will \n     improve data collection and expand resources available for \n     prevention, diagnosis and treatment. These activities are \n     critical to battling gestational diabetes in America.\n       The Breastfeeding Task Force of Greater Los Angeles thanks \n     you for your efforts on behalf of the mothers affected by \n     gestational diabetes and their babies. We look forward to \n     working with you toward the passage of the Gestational \n     Diabetes Act and other legislation critical to mothers and \n     babies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Karen Peters,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AWHONN,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 2006.\n     Senator Hillary Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Association of Women's Health, \n     Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) would like to thank \n     you for introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act. AWHONN is a \n     national membership organization of 22,000 nurses, and it is \n     our mission to promote the health and well-being of women and \n     newborns. Our members are staff nurses, nurse practitioners, \n     certified nurse-midwives, and clinical nurse specialists who \n     work in hospitals, physicians' offices, universities, and \n     community clinics throughout the United States. AWHONN \n     supports this\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\n     important legislation and its intent to better understand and \n     reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes.\n       As you know, almost 21 million Americans have diabetes \n     including 9.7 million women. Gestational diabetes develops in \n     4 to 8 percent of all pregnancies with the prevalence rate \n     reaching up to 10 percent in some populations according to \n     the American Diabetes Association. Significant negative \n     health impacts exist for women during and after pregnancy and \n     for infants as a result of gestational diabetes. For example, \n     women and infants run a higher risk for developing Type 2 \n     diabetes in their lifetimes; pregnant women are at risk for \n     preeclampsia; and, newborns at risk for having low blood \n     sugar and severe jaundice.\n       The Gestational Diabetes Act seeks to establish a Research \n     Advisory Committee that will develop multi-site gestational \n     diabetes research projects to expand and enhance monitoring \n     of gestational diabetes by standardizing procedures for \n     accurate data collection and identifications of this \n     disorder. In addition, the bill allows for demonstration \n     grant programs that are focused on the reduction of the \n     incidence rate of gestational diabetes. Finally, the bill \n     calls for an expansion on current research at the Centers for \n     Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health.\n       AWHONN applauds your leadership on this issue, and we \n     support the introduction of the Gestational Diabetes Act. We \n     look forward to working with you towards the passage of this \n     legislation that is critical for improving the research on \n     and treatment of gestational diabetes, which ultimately \n     affects the health and well-being of both women and newborns \n     throughout their lifespan.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Melinda M.

We serve 15,000 patients speaking 35 \n     languages with the majority being women in their childbearing \n     years who are disproportionately affected by diabetes. In our \n     2006 community needs assessment diabetes was identified by \n     doctors and community members as one of the highest concerns. \n     Due to this disproportionate affect and community concern, \n     our clinics offer special services for patients with \n     diabetes. Additionally preventing diabetes from developing \n     and mitigating the harmful effects falls in line with the \n     Healthy People 2010 objectives.\n       Thank you for taking the lead on the important issue of \n     gestational diabetes. With growing rates of obesity and women \n     becoming mothers later in life, this is a crucial time to \n     take action and provide funding for further research.\n       ICHS is proud to support the Gestational Diabetes Act and \n     we commend Senator Clinton for introducing the legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Teresita Batayola,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Chronic Disease Directors,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 2006.\n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Today, almost 21 million children and \n     adults in America have diabetes--including 9.7 million \n     women--and almost one-third of them do not know it. On behalf \n     of all Americans living with diabetes in our country, I would \n     like to thank you for the introduction of the Gestational \n     Diabetes Act. The National Association of Chronic Disease \n     Directors (NACDD), a membership organization of program \n     directors and staff in every state and territorial health \n     department, enthusiastically supports this important \n     legislation and its intent to better understand and reduce \n     the incidence of gestational diabetes.\n       Gestational diabetes develops in 4-8 percent of all \n     pregnancies, with the prevalence increasing up to 10 percent \n     in some populations. Women who have had gestational diabetes \n     or have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds are \n     at a dramatically increased risk for developing type 2 \n     diabetes later in life. The Gestational Diabetes Act will \n     allow for better data collection and expand the resources \n     available to fight this dangerous disease. Creating a \n     national program will allow states to determine the most \n     efficient and customized approach to prevent, diagnose and \n     treat gestational diabetes at the local level. Additionally, \n     grants can be used by state-based diabetes prevention and \n     control programs to collect and analyze surveillance data on \n     women with and at risk for gestational diabetes. These \n     components are crucial to stemming the tide of gestational \n     diabetes in America and lowering the overall incidence of \n     diabetes in this country.\n       Every 24 hours, Americans pay a horrific price to diabetes: \n     4,100 people are diagnosed with the disease, there are 230 \n     amputations in people with diabetes, 120 people will enter \n     end-stage kidney disease programs, and 55 people will go \n     blind. During this same time period, there will be 613 deaths \n     due to this epidemic. The National Association of Chronic \n     Disease Directors believes that if we are to truly make \n     strides against this devastating disease, we must improve \n     prevention and control in the communities most impacted by \n     diabetes.\n       NACDD applauds your efforts on behalf of Americans with \n     diabetes. We look forward to working with you toward the \n     passage of the Gestational Diabetes Act and other legislation \n     critical to Americans with diabetes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 David P.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The National Research Center for \n     Women & Families applauds your leadership in introducing the \n     ``GEstational DIabetes (GEDI) Act of 2006''.\n       We share your concern that gestational diabetes is \n     associated with potentially serious health problems for the \n     mother and child during and after childbirth. Gestational \n     diabetes increases a mother and child's risk for developing \n     Type 2 diabetes. With 135,000 women per year being diagnosed \n     with gestational diabetes and that number steadily \n     increasing, it is necessary to better understand the disease \n     and to prevent the development of Type 2 diabetes. Data \n     collection and monitoring gestational diabetes and obesity \n     during pregnancy are essential first steps. The GEDI Act's \n     data systems, demonstration grants, and research expansion \n     will all aid in lowering the incidence of gestational \n     diabetes and will help prevent Type 2 diabetes.\n       Thank you again for your vision and leadership in drawing \n     attention to this and many other important health issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Diana M.

WithinReach (formerly Healthy \n     Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Washington State) and \n     the Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington State (a program of \n     WithinReach) enthusiastically support this legislation and \n     the need for Americans to better understand and reduce the \n     incidence of gestational diabetes.\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\n       You may not be aware of the connection between early \n     nutrition and its impact on diabetes. Specifically, not \n     breastfeeding increases the risk of diabetes (in both infant \n     and mother). A review of the literature by Schaefer-Graf et \n     al, demonstrate that among children of women who have GDM, \n     having been breast fed for over 3 months is negatively \n     associated with being overweight in early childhood. In this \n     group, the risk of childhood overweight was reduced by 40-50 \n     percent. The effect was most pronounced when the mother was \n     obese.\n       Breastfeeding mothers provide their children with a lower \n     risk of infection and chronic diseases. There is a clear \n     dose-response relationship between duration of breastfeeding \n     and the extent of risk reduction. Breastfeeding improves the \n     health of infants and mothers and can result in cost savings \n     for parents, insurers, employers, and society. The medical \n     and economic value of breast feeding is high. Support from \n     employers, health insurers, health providers, and society are \n     required to reach the goals set forth in Healthy People 2010 \n     including 75 percent of mothers initiating breastfeeding, 50 \n     percent of infants receiving breastmilk at 6 months, and 25 \n     percent of infants breastfeeding at 1 year of age.\n       Most women want to breastfeed and deserve our help in \n     fulfilling their goals, including providing them societal \n     support and sparing them societal experiences that make it \n     difficult to succeed. The GeDi Act and an increased rate of \n     breast feeding will proactively improve the health of \n     Americans, as well as decrease diabetes and its related \n     illnesses and medical costs.\n       WithinReach and the Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington \n     State applaud your efforts and ask that you ensure the \n     important health and economic connection between breast \n     feeding and diabetes is made.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ginny English,\n       Executive Director, WithinReach.\n     Kimberly Radtke,\n       Coordinator, Breastfeeding Coalition of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Chronic Disease Directors,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 2006.\n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Current national behavioral health \n     statistics reveal that 7.2 percent of U.S. women 18 years of \n     age and older have diabetes. This number is underestimated \n     due to 30 percent of women who have diabetes have not been \n     diagnosed. Of the women surveyed, 1.6 percent states that \n     their diabetes was pregnancy related or Gestational diabetes. \n     Gestational diabetes occurs in 4-8 percent of pregnancies and \n     places both the woman and her infant at greater risk for \n     developing type 2 diabetes and is associated with health \n     problems for both woman and child during the pregnancy and \n     childbirth. With the increasing rise in obesity, the \n     prevalence of gestational diabetes is also rising, however \n     genetics, ethnicity, and maternal age are risk factors for \n     the disease. Over the last several decades, the science of \n     diagnosing and treating Gestational Diabetes advanced, but \n     additional research is needed to understand the complex \n     interrelationships of obesity, genetics, ethnicity and \n     diabetes in women.\n       Women and diabetes are major priorities of the Women's \n     Health Council of the National Association of Chronic Disease \n     Directors. The Council is currently studying the issues \n     surrounding diabetes and young women through the ``Pregnancy \n     Risk Assessment Surveillance System.

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. Snowe)) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill S. 3525, to reauthorize the safe and stable families program, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language inserted by the House amendment, \n     insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child and Family Services \n     Improvement Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) For Federal fiscal year 2004, child protective services \n     (CPS) staff nationwide reported investigating or assessing an \n     estimated 3,000,000 allegations of child maltreatment, and \n     determined that 872,000 children had been abused or neglected \n     by their parents or other caregivers.\n       (2) Combined, the Child Welfare Services (CWS) and \n     Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) programs provide \n     States about $700,000,000 per year, the largest source of \n     targeted Federal funding in the child protection system for \n     services to ensure that children are not abused or neglected \n     and, whenever possible, help children remain safely with \n     their families.\n       (3) A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO) reported that little research is available on the \n     effectiveness of activities supported by CWS funds--\n     evaluations of services supported by PSSF funds have \n     generally shown little or no effect.\n       (4) Further, the Department of Health and Human Services \n     recently completed initial Child and Family Service Reviews \n     (CFSRs) in each State. No State was in full compliance with \n     all measures of the CFSRs. The CFSRs also revealed that \n     States need to work to prevent repeat abuse and neglect of \n     children, improve services provided to families to reduce the \n     risk of future harm (including by better monitoring the \n     participation of families in services), and strengthen \n     upfront services provided to families to prevent unnecessary \n     family break-up and protect children who remain at home.\n       (5) Federal policy should encourage States to invest their \n     CWS and PSSF funds in services that promote and protect the \n     welfare of children, support strong, healthy families, and \n     reduce the reliance on out-of-home care, which will help \n     ensure all children are raised in safe, loving families.\n       (6) CFSRs also found a strong correlation between frequent \n     caseworker visits with children and positive outcomes for \n     these children, such as timely achievement of permanency and \n     other indicators of child well-being.\n       (7) However, a December 2005 report by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found \n     that only 20 States were able to produce reports to show \n     whether caseworkers actually visited children in foster care \n     on at least a monthly basis, despite the fact that nearly all \n     States had written standards suggesting monthly visits were \n     State policy.\n       (8) A 2003 GAO report found that the average tenure for a \n     child welfare caseworker is less than 2 years and this level \n     of turnover\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n     negatively affects safety and permanency for children.\n       (9) Targeting CWS and PSSF funds to ensure children in \n     foster care are visited on at least a monthly basis will \n     promote better outcomes for vulnerable children, including by \n     preventing further abuse and neglect.\n       (10) According to the Office of Applied Studies of the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \n     the annual number of new uses of Methamphetamine, also known \n     as ``meth,'' has increased 72 percent over the past decade. \n     According to a study conducted by the National Association of \n     Counties which surveyed 500 county law enforcement agencies \n     in 45 states, 88 percent of the agencies surveyed reported \n     increases in meth related arrests starting 5 years ago.\n       (11) According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and \n     Health, nearly 12,000,000 Americans have tried \n     methamphetamine. Meth making operations have been uncovered \n     in all 50 states, but the most wide-spread abuse has been \n     concentrated in the western, southwestern, and Midwestern \n     United States.\n       (12) Methamphetamine abuse is on the increase, particularly \n     among women of child-bearing age. This is having an impact on \n     child welfare systems in many States. According to a survey \n     administered by the National Association of Counties (``The \n     Impact of Meth on Children''), conducted in 300 counties in \n     13 states, meth is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. \n     Forty percent of all the child welfare officials in the \n     survey reported an increase in out-of-home placements because \n     of meth in 2005.\n       (13) It is appropriate also to target PSSF funds to address \n     this issue because of the unique strain the meth epidemic \n     puts on child welfare agencies. Outcomes for children \n     affected by meth are enhanced when services provided by law \n     enforcement, child welfare and substance abuse agencies are \n     integrated.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 576, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 576) supporting the goals of Red \n     Ribbon Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Murkowski in sponsoring a resolution commemorating the annual \nRed Ribbon Week celebrated October 23-31. Red Ribbon Week encourages \nindividuals, families, and communities to take a stand against alcohol, \ntobacco, and illegal drug use. I hope the rest of the Senate will join \nin supporting this resolution and support this very important campaign.\n  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week, now in its twenty-first year of \nwearing and displaying red ribbons, started following the assassination \nof U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' \nCamarena. In an effort to honor his memory and unite in the battle \nagainst drug crime and abuse, friends, neighbors, and students from his \nhome town began wearing red ribbons. Shortly thereafter, the National \nFamily Partnership took the celebration nationwide. Since then, the Red \nRibbon campaign has reached millions of children, families, and \ncommunities across the country, spreading the message about the \ndestructive effects of drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, this year's theme for Red Ribbon Week is Take a \nStand--Be Drug Free. Schools and community groups across the State are \norganizing a variety of activities including pledges, contests, \nworkshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances, and other \nfamily and educational events all designed to educate our children on \nthe negative effects of drugs and promote a drug-free environment.\n  Research tells us that the longer a child stays drug-free the less \nlikely they will become addicted or even try illegal drugs. This is why \nit is so important to maintain a coherent anti-drug message that begins \nearly in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such \nan effort must involve parents, communities, and young people. Red \nRibbon Week provides each of us the opportunity to take a stand by \nhelping our children make the right decisions when it comes to drugs.\n  In light of the growing epidemic of methamphetamine abuse throughout \nthe Nation and especially in my State of Iowa, this year's Red Ribbon \nWeek holds greater importance. I urge my colleagues to join us in \npassing this resolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising \nawareness about drugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nthat commemorates the 21st Annual Red Ribbon Campaign. I am honored to \nagain seek the Senate's continuing support and recognition of Red \nRibbon Week, which is October 23 through October 31.\n  In 1985, Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by \ndrug traffickers. Shortly after Agent Camarena's death, Congressman \nDuncan Hunter and high school friend Henry Lozano launched ``Camarena \nClubs'' in his hometown of Calexico, CA. In honor of Agent Camarena, \nhundreds of club members wore red ribbons and pledged to lead drug-free \nlives. The campaign quickly gained statewide and then national \nprominence. In 1988, what is now the National Family Partnership \norganized the first National Red Ribbon Week, an eight-day event \nproclaimed by the United States Congress and chaired by then President \nand Mrs. Reagan.\n  With over 80 million people participating in Red Ribbon Week events \nduring the last week in October, it has become the Nation's oldest and \nlargest drug-prevention program. Red Ribbon Week memorializes Agent \nCamarena, and all those who have lost their lives in the war on drugs, \nby educating young people about the dangers of drug abuse, promoting \ndrug-free activities, and supporting everyone who has stood strong \nagainst the daily bombardment of mixed signals sent by the mass media. \nThe Red Ribbon that we will wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of \nzero tolerance for illegal drug use and our commitment to help people, \nespecially children, make the right life-decisions.\n  In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week will be a statewide celebration involving \nthousands of school children and other supporters. On October 23, the \nMunicipality of Anchorage, in conjunction with the Alaska Red Ribbon \nCoalition, which is comprised of the Anchorage School District, the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, the Alaska State Troopers, the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of Alaska, the Alaska National Guard, and many other \norganizations, will hold its Red Ribbon Week kickoff. Among other \nactivities, there will be poetry readings and dance performances, and a \nPublic Service Announcement featuring local youths sending an antidrug \nmessage will be broadcast throughout the State.\n  As people across the country stand together against drugs, I thank my \ncolleagues for joining me in what will hopefully be a continuation of \nthe tradition of congressional support and recognition of Red Ribbon \nWeek.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 576) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 577) designating September 24, 2006, \n     as ``National Good Neighbor Day.''\n\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, September 19, 2006, I join with my \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, in cosponsoring a resolution to \ndesignate September 24, 2006 as National Good Neighbor Day. I am proud \nto promote positive, meaningful friendships between citizens as part of \na long-established tradition begun in 1971 by one of Montana's own \ncitizens.\n  National Good Neighbor Day was started by Becky Mattson of Lakeside, \nMT with the intent of fostering a strong community of friendship and \ninteraction between neighbors. This day also serves to facilitate \ncommunication between senior citizens and children. So often the \ncommunications between America's greatest generation and our youngest \ncitizens is not as strong as it could be, yet, Ms. Mattson has found a \nway to help encourage that important dialogue.\n  Ms. Mattson began this tradition by doing what so many Montanans and \nAmericans do: she wrote a letter to her Senator. That letter, to \nSenator Mike Mansfield, was met with great enthusiasm and as result, \nthe National Good Neighbor Day has become an annual event, taking place \non the fourth Sunday of September. Her efforts have been recognized by \ncountless individuals, and have even been recognized through \nproclamations by three United States Presidents: Carter, Ford and \nNixon. In addition, governors of many States have issued proclamations \nof Good Neighbor Day as well.\n  In the spirit of Ms. Mattson, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate \nand in our communities to reach out and be a good neighbor. I urge \nchildren to visit with senior citizens and to share their life \nexperiences. The efforts of each person matters, not just on this day, \nbut everyday, and will make our communities stronger. I am proud of Ms. \nMattson, and thank her for her contribution in making us all good \nneighbors.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair now lay before the \nSenate the House message to accompany S. 3525.\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n                                S. 3525\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 3525) entitled \n     ``An Act to amend subpart 2 of part B of title IV of the \n     Social Security Act to improve outcomes for children in \n     families affected by methamphetamine abuse and addiction, to \n     reauthorize the promoting safe and stable families program, \n     and for other purposes'', do pass with amendments.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's unanimous approval \nof the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. I am proud to \nhave cosponsored this legislation with Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, \nHatch, and Snowe. The bill reauthorizes and improves the Promoting Safe \nand Stable Families Program and the Child Welfare Services Act.\n  Every child deserves the chance to grow up in a safe and stable home, \nand we need to root out the problems that too often force children into \nthe child welfare system, particularly the growing scourge of \nmethamphetamine, or ``meth,'' abuse. This bill makes some real \nimprovements to our child welfare system and gets us closer to the goal \nof a thriving, secure childhood for every American youngster.\n  In Montana, meth is wreaking havoc on our child welfare system. \nPrevention and intervention are key to stopping the vicious cycle. That \nis why I have worked hard to secure these funds so we can be one step \ncloser to stamping out meth in Montana and around the country.\n  In hearings held earlier this year, the Senate Finance Committee \nheard testimony that ``over 65 percent of all foster care placements in \nMontana are directly attributable to drug use, and of those, meth is a \nprimary factor 57 percent of the time,'' and that ``meth use among \nresidents of the seven Indian tribes in Montana is far in excess of \nepidemic proportion.''\n  I am proud to have worked to include $145 million in competitive \ngrants to address the problem of methamphetamine and substance abuse \nrelated to child welfare and foster care. The funding is targeted to \nregional partnerships that include State agencies and will be available \nfor family-based, comprehensive, long-term substance abuse treatment, \nearly intervention and preventive services, and other innovative \ninitiatives. I also have worked to insure that historically under-\nfunded child welfare programs for Indian tribes received increased \nmonies to help combat new and challenging issues. I am grateful to \nChairman Grassley and others for recognizing these needs and working \nwith me to enact these provisions.\n  The reauthorized Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program will also \nrequire States to provide additional information on efforts to get \nchildren into safe family situations and keep them there. Congress will \nreceive actual spending data on adoption and postadoption services, \nefforts to keep families together, and efforts to provide permanent, \nsafe, and loving homes for children.\n  In addition, the bill supports the training and hiring of more child \nwelfare caseworkers so that more children in foster care will receive \nat least monthly visits. The bill requires States to achieve the \nstandard of monthly social worker visits for 90 percent of foster \nchildren by 2011. This will help ensure proper monitoring of the \ndevelopment of children for whom the State has taken responsibility.\n  It also continues the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program and \ncreates a 3-year demonstration program to help provide mentoring \nservices in underserved areas.\n  The child welfare system protects the most vulnerable people in our \nsociety. It provides a safe harbor for children. It looks out for \nchildren whose birth families, for one reason or another, have not been \nable to provide fertile soil in which to grow. Each year, almost 3,000 \nMontana children enter foster care. They come because of abuse. They \ncome because of neglect. They come because of other serious \ndifficulties in their families.\n  The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program supports efforts to \nrebuild families. And it helps to find permanency for kids when that \nproves impossible. This program is the largest dedicated source of \nFederal funds for services to children and families. Last year, Montana \nreceived a little over $2 million from the program. These funds are \ncritical to Montana's child welfare system, and this legislation is a \npivotal opportunity to ensure adequate support for strong families.\n  I look forward to quick passage by the House so that we can begin to \nbetter safeguard the well-being of our children.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I support S. 3525, the Child and Family Services \nImprovement Act. This is a bill that will reauthorize the Promoting \nSafe and Stable Families Program, legislation that I have worked on \nsince its creation in 1997.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues Senators Grassley, Baucus, Hatch and \nSnowe in support of this bill. Chairman Grassley deserves our deep \nthanks and gratitude for real leadership on this legislation and a \ntruly bipartisan process. The Finance Committee has a strong history of \nbipartisanship on child welfare and foster\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\ncare. And I should note that this bipartisanship is palpable at the \nstaff level as well and the fine staff of the Finance Committee also \ndeserve our thanks for making this agreement possible.\n  The children at risk of abuse and neglect in their own homes are \namong our most vulnerable children. Over the years, progress has been \nmade to promote each child's safety, health and need for a permanent, \nsafe home. But with 518,000 in foster care, there is clearly more work \nto be done for our children.\n  The 2006 Deficit Reduction Act included an additional $40 million per \nyear provided for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program. Our \nlegislation will target this new money to clear needs for our child \nwelfare system. One priority will be to create new competitive grants \nto support regional partnership to combat methamphetamine, ``meth,'' or \nother drug abuses that are affecting the child welfare system. Meth is \ndevastating areas in West Virginia and around our country. When law \nenforcement breaks up a home meth lab, child welfare workers are often \nneeded on site to deal with the children as their parents are taken to \njail. Such children have been exposed to toxins and are at risk of \nhaving been abused or neglected when their parents were high on meth. \nSubstance abuse is a huge problem for families in the child welfare \nsystem, but there is hope that prevention and treatment can help. \nFamily-based comprehensive long term treatment facilities are reporting \nsome impressive results in helping children and families. Other \ninnovative court projects and law enforcement programs are being \ndeveloped. This bill invests real dollars to promote and evaluate the \nmost effective programs.\n  The other priority of this legislation will be to make new \ninvestments to help states achieve what is considered the best practice \nof having monthly caseworker visits to 90 percent of the children in \nfoster care. This standard helps improve outcomes for our most \nvulnerable children, and it is a worthy goal.\n  The bill will also reauthorize and expand the Mentoring Children of \nPrisoners Program, created in 2002 as part of the reauthorization. The \nexpansion is a 3-year pilot program to use vouchers as a new delivery \nmechanism for services in the hope of helping children in rural and \nunderserved areas. Three States, West Virginia, Vermont and Utah, do \nnot have any Mentoring Children of Prisoners grants, but there are \nchildren living there and in rural areas who need a mentor. Under the \nvoucher program, qualified mentoring programs in local communities \ncould get funding to serve such children. This is worth trying as a new \nmodel.\n  Earlier this year, I hosted a roundtable in Beckley, WV on adoption, \nfoster care and child welfare. I met with a judge, local officials and \nparents involved in our system. I heard an inspiring story of a young \nman who was adopted from foster care and has become a spokesperson for \nother children. Following this roundtable, it was very clear to me that \nwe need to provide support and services to families in the system, and \nthis new legislation should help.\n  For years, I have worked with my colleagues to try and improve our \nchild welfare system and foster care. This bill is our next step \nforward. Its costs have been offset, and the priorities of combating \nmeth and substance abuse, as well as more caseworker visits are goals \nthat we all can rally to support. My hope is that this bill will \nprovide the incentives and push for West Virginia and every state to do \nmore for our most vulnerable children.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on April 6, 1917, the United States, after \n     extraordinary provocations, declared war on Germany and \n     entered World War I, the War to End All Wars;\n       (2) at the time of that declaration of war, Indian people \n     in the United States, including members of the Choctaw \n     Nation, were not accorded the status of citizens of the \n     United States;\n       (3) without regard to this lack of citizenship, many \n     members of the Choctaw Nation joined many members of other \n     Indian tribes and nations in enlisting in the Armed Forces to \n     fight on behalf of the United States;\n       (4) members of the Choctaw Nation were--\n       (A) enlisted in the force known as the American \n     Expeditionary Force, which began hostile actions in France in \n     the fall of 1917; and\n       (B) incorporated in a company of Indian enlistees serving \n     in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division;\n       (5) a major impediment to Allied operations in general, and \n     operations of the United States in particular, was the fact \n     that the German forces had deciphered all codes used for \n     transmitting information between Allied commands, leading to \n     substantial loss of men and materiel during the first year in \n     which the military of the United States engaged in combat in \n     World War I;\n       (6) because of the proximity and static nature of the \n     battle lines, a method to communicate without the knowledge \n     of the enemy was needed;\n       (7) a commander of the United States realized the fact that \n     he had under his command a number of men who spoke a native \n     language;\n       (8) while the use of such native languages was discouraged \n     by the Federal Government, the commander sought out and \n     recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in transmitting field \n     telephone communications during an upcoming campaign;\n       (9) because the language used by the Choctaw soldiers in \n     the transmission of information was not based on a European \n     language or on a mathematical progression, the Germans were \n     unable to understand any of the transmissions;\n       (10) the Choctaw soldiers were placed in different command \n     positions to achieve the widest practicable area for \n     communications;\n       (11) the use of the Choctaw Code Talkers was particularly \n     important in--\n       (A) the movement of American soldiers in October of 1918 \n     (including securing forward and exposed positions);\n       (B) the protection of supplies during American action \n     (including protecting gun emplacements from enemy shelling); \n     and\n       (C) in the preparation for the assault on German positions \n     in the final stages of combat operations in the fall of 1918;\n       (12) in the opinion of the officers involved, the use of \n     Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their native \n     language saved men and munitions, and was highly successful;\n       (13) based on that successful experience, Choctaw Indians \n     were withdrawn from frontline units for training in \n     transmission of codes so as to be more widely used when the \n     war came to an end;\n       (14) the Germans never succeeded in breaking the Choctaw \n     code;\n       (15) that was the first time in modern warfare that the \n     transmission of messages in a Native American language was \n     used for the purpose of confusing the enemy;\n       (16) this action by members of the Choctaw Nation--\n       (A) is another example of the commitment of Native \n     Americans to the defense of the United States; and\n       (B) adds to the proud legacy of such service; and\n       (17) the Choctaw Nation has honored the actions of those 18 \n     Choctaw Code Talkers through a memorial bearing their names \n     located at the entrance of the tribal complex in Durant, \n     Oklahoma.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Sac and Fox Indians used their native language, \n     Meskwaki, to transmit military code during Word War II;\n       (2) those individuals, who manned radio communications \n     networks to advise of enemy actions, became known as the Sac \n     and Fox Code Talkers; and\n       (3) under heavy combat action, the Code Talkers worked \n     without sleep to provide information that saved the lives of \n     many Americans.\n\n     SEC. 402.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nAgriculture Committee be discharged and the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3408.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3408) to reauthorize the Livestock Mandatory \n     Reporting Act of 1999 and to amend the swine reporting \n     provisions of that Act.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act was \nenacted by Congress in 1999 to level the playing field for independent \nproducers. This Act is important because it improves market \ntransparency by requiring packers, processors, and importers to provide \ncritical price, contracting, supply and demand information to USDA, \nwhich in turn creates price reports for livestock producers.\n  Since the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program was implemented by \nUSDA, I have heard repeated concerns from producers about the accuracy \nand overall transparency of the program. Since this law was due to \nsunset, to get as many facts as possible for purposes of reauthorizing \nthis important law, Senator Grassley and I requested an audit by the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate the accuracy of the \nprogram. This GAO audit found numerous instances of limited \ntransparency and lengthy lag times by USDA in actions to correct \nproblems when packers failed to report or provide accurate information, \nand instances where USDA was excluding packer data in price reports but \nnot making information about the exclusions available to the public.\n  Thus far, USDA has provided very little information to Congress \nregarding USDA's implementation of the six recommendations made by GAO. \nIn fact, USDA has known of many of the problems described by GAO since \n2001, but failed to act. That is why there needs to be strong oversight \nby the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry to \nensure this program is functioning correctly and that GAO's \nrecommendations are fully implemented.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I also call on Chairman Chambliss to help Senator \nHarkin and me get much-needed answers to what USDA has done to \nimplement the GAO recommendations. There has been a lack of \nbelievability regarding the information generated by the Livestock \nMandatory Reporting program, many producers across Iowa and many parts \nof the Nation feel strongly that the information would be more valuable \nif the program had more credibility through improved transparency.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do believe that some of the GAO recommendations would \nbe better implemented if codified in law. Senator Grassley and I \nprovided numerous farm and livestock groups and the packing industry \ndraft legislation that would address the GAO recommendations and other \noutstanding producer concerns. This process has been difficult and has \ntaken considerable time given the complexity of issues and diversity of \nthe groups. Since a full consensus was not reached among these parties, \nthe legislative changes will not be approved this year. Senator \nGrassley and I ask that Chairman Chambliss be willing to help us \nachieve these needed legislative changes in the next Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Last year, Senator Harkin and I introduced legislation, \nthat passed the Senate by unanimous consent, that would extend the \nLivestock Mandatory Reporting Act for one-year to allow additional time \nto review the GAO recommendations and develop needed modifications to \nthe law to improve the functioning and operation of the program. \nUnfortunately, the House refused to take up the bill and the law \nexpired. I conditioned my support of any multi-year extension or \nrevision of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program on carrying out \nthe GAO study results. Now we are at a crucial point with the \nlegislative session coming to a close. Senator Harkin and I realize \nthat we are facing strong opposition from the packing industry on \nmoving a Senate version that includes the GAO recommendations. I ask \nfor assurances from Chairman Chambliss that he will work with Senator \nHarkin and me to move our proposed legislative changes forward.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I agree with Senators Harkin and \nGrassley about the importance of the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act \n(LMRA) to producers. For over a year, I have worked with the Senators \nfrom Iowa in their attempt to craft consensus language to which all \ninterested parties could agree. I agreed to wait for a report from the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, even though there was concern \nthat the report would be released after the expiration of this \nimportant mandatory program. Since that time, packers have continued to \nconsistently report on a voluntary basis limiting potential disruptions \nto the information provided by LMRA to the marketplace. While I \nunderstand my colleague's interest in implementing the recommendations \nfrom GAO, I am also concerned that all stakeholders--producers and \npackers--have comfort and assurance in this program and that any \nchanges made to the program will minimize potential litigation and the \nfalse reporting of data.\n  I intend to work with Senators Harkin and Grassley to ensure that \nthere is another opportunity to find consensus among interested parties \nin implementing further changes to the program. Next year provides an \nexcellent opportunity to debate this and other issues of importance to \nthe livestock industry during the farm bill reauthorization process. In \naddition, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry \nwill conduct a hearing in the spring of 2007 that will focus on \nlivestock issues which will allow us to explore any needed changes to \nthe Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act.\n  Although the Senators from Iowa and I have worked diligently with \nlivestock groups and the packing industry to address the concerns of \nall interested parties, we were not able to reach an agreement. Given \nthe limited time before adjournment, I ask my colleagues to support \nH.R. 3408, which has passed the House, and will reinstate the mandatory \nprovisions of this much needed program. As I said previously, I will \ncontinue to work with the Senators from Iowa next year on the farm bill \nto arrive at consensus legislation that all stakeholders can support.\n  Finally, I would like to commend all of the industry groups that have \nworked on this issue for over a year. The countless hours of \nnegotiations, meetings, and debate are healthy and represent the \nAmerican legislative process at its best. The complexity of this issue \nhas unfortunately made it impossible to accommodate all the changes \nrequested by the Senators from Iowa, but I commend them for recognizing \nthe importance of this program for not only producers in Iowa, but \nproducers across this great Nation. H.R. 3408 will provide price \ndiscovery and transparency to the marketplace, allowing all producers \nto confidently receive fair prices for their livestock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Chairman Chambliss for his patience throughout\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\nthis process and willingness and commitment to help Senator Grassley \nand me to get GAO's recommendations implemented. His commitment to help \nus pursue our legislative proposals next year is sincerely appreciated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3408) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9853-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I was in my office and listened to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Idaho talk about the bill that is \nbefore the Senate, the so-called fence bill. I have great respect for \nthe distinguished senior Senator. We have served together in the House \nand the Senate. He talked with great emotion about the agricultural \nworkers and how people are losing crops as a result of not having \nsufficient agricultural workers and that it was extremely important \nthat we have agricultural worker legislation.\n  I heard my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, talk about agricultural workers and how important they \nare. She gave vivid illustrations of how they are important. I agree \nwith both, but I am stunned that the Senator from Idaho appears to only \nbe talking and not being meaningful in what he is saying about \nagricultural workers.\n  ``Congress Daily PM,'' which is a publication put out on a daily \nbasis by the National Journal, says as follows:\n\n       Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, would like to \n     offer his amendment which would streamline certification for \n     migrant farm workers, language that was included in the \n     Senate's immigration package.\n\n  Listen to this one, though, this final sentence:\n\n       Craig spokesman said the Senator would not offer his \n     amendment if it would hold up consideration of the House-\n     passed bill.\n\n  We have a bill before the Senate. No one has any intent of holding up \nthe bill, but there are some important amendments that people want to \noffer. According to the Senator from Idaho, he feels his agricultural \nworkers provision is pretty important. Then why shouldn't we be able to \noffer some amendments on this? Why shouldn't we be able to offer one \namendment, an agricultural workers amendment? Why shouldn't we be able \nto offer two amendments, three amendments with time on them?\n  I am told the majority leader is going to fill the tree--that is a \nbuzzword around here for having the majority lock up this legislation \nso no amendments are possible.\n  My friend from Idaho cannot have it both ways. He cannot be \nrighteously indignant about the fact we are not having an opportunity \nto help agricultural workers and then, in effect, throw in the towel \nand say he is going to do nothing about it.\n  He is part of the majority party; we are not. We cannot do much about \nit, but he can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9853-7", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9853-S9854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that I \nappreciate very much Senator Stabenow, Senator Reed, and Senator \nSarbanes coming here today and talking about something we haven't \ntalked about much in recent weeks. The Republicans wanted to make this \nSeptember ``security month.'' So we have devoted all of our time \ntalking about the failure of the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism. \nWe know that the war in Iraq has been a diversion to the real war on \nterror, but that is what they want to talk about.\n  I am so grateful that my friends came and talked about the economy. \nIt\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\nis an issue that deserves to be a top priority of this Congress but has \nbeen ignored for years--the need to strengthen America's middle class. \nOur country has always been a land of opportunity. As a nation, we take \npride that all Americans, no matter where they begin in life, have the \nopportunity to work hard, get ahead, and prosper. It is called the \nAmerican dream, and it is what our country is all about.\n  Unfortunately, while it is still possible for Americans to do well, \nit is getting harder and harder all the time. America's middle class \nfaces ever increasing obstacles. Incomes are going down, but costs are \ngoing up. More and more middle-class families are being squeezed, and \nthis Congress has done nothing to stop that.\n  Let's look at the facts. There really is a middle-class squeeze under \nthis Republican administration. Real household income has declined \nduring the tenure of President Bush. It has declined by $1,273 a year. \nThat is pretty significant. This is median inflation adjusted household \nincome. It was $47,599 in 2000. Here is what it is 5 years later, \n$46,326. That is not a record anyone should boast about.\n  The rich have been able to do much better. The average tax break for \nsomebody over $1 million is about $38,000, where for someone under \n$50,000, the tax break has been about $6.\n  In addition to the household income declining, basic costs of the \nmiddle class have gone up. The rich are getting richer, the poor are \ngetting poorer, and the middle class is getting squeezed.\n  The cost of going to college in these 5 years has gone up 44 percent. \nHealth insurance premiums, when one can find health insurance, has gone \nup 71 percent. We are up to over 47 million Americans now with no \nhealth insurance and millions of others who are underinsured. Energy \ncosts certainly have gone up. Parents are paying $3,700 more than they \nwere 5 years ago. Health insurance, if one can buy it, is up $4,500 in \nthe last 6 years. You are paying more.\n  This story only tells half the story. As families struggle to afford \nwhat they need, they also find themselves less secure. Since President \nBush took office, 3.7 million more Americans are without employer-\nsponsored retirement plans. Almost 7 million more Americans are without \nhealth insurance, and millions more are carrying significant debt.\n  Since 2000, household debt has increased by 35 percent, or more than \n$26,000. When we put all this together--declining incomes, skyrocketing \nprices, rising insecurity--it is no wonder the economy remains a top \nconcern for the American people. The kitchen-table concerns are issues \nthat matter most to families, yet they are also the issues that are \nroutinely ignored or made worse by this Congress that has been given \nthe name ``do-nothing Congress,'' and rightfully so.\n  Just listen to Washington Republicans to see how out of touch they \nare. They are convinced the economy is doing great. They believe we \nshould stay the course. We not only want to stay the course in the war \nin Iraq, according to the President, we want to stay the course with \nthe economy, even as families struggle like never before.\n  We can do better than the Republican record of failure--much better. \nWe can take a new direction, and it starts by putting the middle class \nfirst for a change.\n  Democrats have developed a variety of proposals addressing the \nmiddle-class squeeze, but every time the Republican majority has \nblocked our efforts so they can help special interests.\n  As to rising gas prices, we proposed a ban on price gouging. The \nprices have dropped down. They are going to go back up. There is \nnothing that has changed substantially. All we need is a problem in \nNigeria or another storm. The majority blocked our price-gouging \nlegislation. They blocked it on behalf of the oil and gas industry. \nBut, of course, they should, Mr. President, because this is the most \nenergy-friendly administration we have had in the history of our \ncountry.\n  To lower the cost of prescription drugs, Democrats proposed repealing \nthe Republican ban on negotiating for lower prices in Medicare, but the \nmajority blocked that on behalf of the pharmaceutical lobby.\n  To bolster middle-class incomes, Democrats proposed ending tax breaks \nthat encouraged companies to outsource jobs overseas, but the majority \ncontinues to support these tax breaks at the behest of multilevel, \nmultinational corporations.\n  To cut college costs and help more Americans get ahead, we proposed \nmaking college tuition deductible from taxes. That is gone. The \nmajority pushed through the largest student aid cut in the history of \nour country and allowed the college tuition deduction to expire even \nwhile pushing for huge tax breaks for special interests and \nmultimillionaires.\n  The bottom line is that all too often in Republican Washington, \nspecial interests rule while the middle class is left behind. As I \nsaid, the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the \nmiddle class are getting squeezed, and it has never been so apparent as \nduring these last 6 years. America literally cannot afford to stay the \npresent course.\n  While Washington Republicans have been ignoring the plight of the \nmiddle class, they have been digging our Nation into a budget hole that \nwill take decades to correct. As Senator Conrad has explained so \npowerfully, since 2001, our national debt has exploded from $5.8 \ntrillion to $8.5 trillion. The debt will double to $11.6 trillion by \n2010.\n\n  The debt owed to foreigners has already doubled. The United States \nhas borrowed more from overseas interests--that is foreign countries--\nduring the Bush Presidency than we borrowed during all previous \nPresidencies combined. I think that is irresponsible, and our children \nand our grandchildren will pay the price.\n  We have several Democratic Senators who are experts on the economy \nwho have come and spoken. Senator Sarbanes, who sadly will retire at \nthe end of this year, has been a wonderful Senator. He has handled the \nBanking Committee with expertise, and I so appreciate his coming to the \nfloor today and talking about this issue. Our Democrat on the Joint \nEconomic Committee, Jack Reed, has done a wonderful job.\n  But I want to return to my main point. We need a new direction in \nAmerica, one that strengthens the middle class. We believe it is long \npast time Washington focused on the people who work hard every day, \nplay by the rules, and are the backbone of our Nation. They are being \nignored, and they need our help. Our goal is not for Government to \nspend more; it is for families to spend less--less for college, less \nfor health care, less for fuel, less for energy--all while enjoying an \nopportunity to succeed and prosper in the global economy and a chance \nat the American dream.\n  Mr. President, for 10 years, to show how little this Republican-\ndominated town feels about the poor, we have been unable to increase \nthe minimum wage. When President Clinton was President, we tried and a \nfilibuster by Republicans stopped us. The minimum wage--we believe \nCongress and Washington should focus on ways to help make the American \ndream come true, to help all Americans achieve their dreams. But to do \nthat, we need to change course by, at long last, standing up to special \ninterests and standing up for the common good. That is the Democratic \nvision. That is the new direction we seek. America's middle class in \nour Nation deserves no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9854-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9854-S9857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO PROSPER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been very interested in the remarks \nof the distinguished Democratic leader, my friend, and I approach this \nissue from not just a slightly different perspective but from a very \ndifferent perspective. I think it is important that we get our facts \nstraight.\n  The robust health of the U.S. economy becomes more apparent with each \npassing day. Yet it is something about which we hear precious little \nexcept criticism, especially on the Senate floor. I would like to take \njust a few minutes to remind my colleagues about some of the positive \naspects we are seeing about the state of the economy.\n  As we complete the fifth year of economic expansion, all signs \nindicate that the economy is as strong as it has ever been, and that we \ncan expect continued economic growth for the foreseeable future. When \nPresident Bush became President, we were in the\n\n[[Page S9855]]\n\nthroes of an economic recession at the end of the Clinton years. He \ninherited that, and the first year of his Presidency was filled with a \nrecession. But in the last 5 years, we have had an economic expansion. \nThe U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the first \nhalf of this year, and that is an impressive clip at any time, but \nparticularly so for a mature economy approaching full employment.\n  Economic forecasters estimate the gross domestic product in the \ncurrent quarter will come close to 3 percent. While initially we may \nnot welcome a reduction in the rate of growth, a 3-percent rate is \nactually very positive news. This is because a growth rate of around 3 \npercent would put us at a level of growth that many economists believe \ncan be sustained indefinitely without risking inflationary pressures. \nIt is mystifying to me that an economy this strong that has grown \nsteadily for 5 full years now is not being recognized by everyone for \nwhat it is; namely, a remarkable jobs-producing machine. We have \ncreated 3.5 million jobs in the last 3 years and have more people \nemployed today than ever before in the history of this country.\n  The unemployment rate is only 4.7 percent, a level that is below any \nrate seen in the United States between 1970 and 1997. Think about that: \na rate below any rate seen in the U.S. between 1970 and 1997.\n  No matter how one cuts the numbers, the news on the job front of late \nhas been good. The number of long-term unemployed is down, as is the \nunemployment rate for teenagers, women, African Americans, Hispanics, \npeople without a high school degree, and people with only a high school \ndegree.\n  While energy prices might have pushed the Consumer Price Index up a \nbit earlier in the year, I believe there was never a risk of higher \ninflation, and the financial markets now discount this possibility \nalmost entirely. As Nobel Laureate Friedman put it:\n\n       Inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. As long as the \n     Federal Reserve commits to contain inflation, we should not \n     worry.\n\n  I think Ben Bernanke has demonstrated his determination to keep the \nscourge of inflation under control, and for that he deserves \ncommendation. I believe his decision today to leave the short-term \ndiscount rate where it is makes perfect sense, given the recent data.\n  The benefits of sustained economic growth, the likes of which we have \nseen over the last 5 years, cannot be overstated. We are just now \nbeginning to reap its benefits in the form of higher incomes for \nAmerican workers. Median household incomes, stagnant since the 2001 \nrecession, went up by 1.1 percent after adjusting for inflation in \n2005. Now, that is median household income.\n  Contrary to the gloom and doom we are hearing from the other side on \nthis floor, it went up by 1.1 percent, after adjusting for inflation in \n2005. That is after the adjustment for inflation.\n  The preliminary data for 2006 suggests that income growth has \naccelerated strongly, with even the New York Times reporting an \nestimate that inflation-adjusted wages and salaries have gone up an \nannual rate of 7 percent thus far this year. This is a pattern that \nwould be entirely consistent with what we witnessed during the \nexpansion of the 1990s, one that ultimately lifted millions of \nhouseholds out of poverty. Yet all we hear is doom and gloom. That is \nwhat happens when people want to gain power.\n  The Federal Government has also benefitted from the sustained \neconomic growth. Tax revenues--and this is with the tax cuts that we \nput in, and because of the tax cuts we put in over the past 5 years--\nhave grown at the fastest rate since the inflationary 1970s. You can't \ndiscount that, no matter how much doom and gloom you spread all over \nthis body. Revenue went up by nearly 15 percent last year, and as we \napproach the end of the current fiscal year, it is likely it will go up \n12 percent this year. That is phenomenal.\n  In 2006, we will collect over a half of a trillion dollars more than \nwe did in 2004--a truly awesome amount. The budget deficit has shrunk \nrapidly over these same 2 years, from $412 billion in 2004 to roughly \n$260 billion in 2006. Now, it is still too high, but as a percentage of \nGDP, it is one of the lowest over the last 40 years. That can't be \ndiscounted, in spite of the doom and gloom that we hear consistently on \nthis floor.\n  The Congressional Budget Office was forecasting a budget deficit of \n$100 billion larger than that as recently as March. Let me repeat, $100 \nbillion larger than the $260 billion it was projected to be as recently \nas last March. Again, the strong budget growth we have benefitted from \nof late is reminiscent of what occurred in the late 1990s once the \neconomy reached full employment and productivity growth picked up. It \nis also instructive to look at exactly where the additional tax \nrevenues are coming from.\n  Now, let's get this straight because I get so tired of hearing the \nrich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. That is a \nslogan that really is pure folly. The top 1 percent of all earners--the \ntop 1 percent of all earners--receive about 16 percent of all income \nbut pay over 34 percent of all taxes. Let me repeat that. The top 1 \npercent of all earners receive about 16 percent of all income but pay \nover 34 percent of all taxes. The top 10 percent of all earners are \npaying two-thirds of all the taxes paid in this country--the top 10 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, 97 percent, all but 3 percent, 97 percent of all \nincome tax revenue comes from the top 50 percent of all wage earners. \nThat doesn't sound to me like the rich are getting richer. What the \nother side always seems to forget is that, in this great country, the \nmiddle class consistently rises to a higher position because of the \nopportunities in this country if we continue to provide opportunities \nfor economic growth through tax rate reductions and other \nmethodologies.\n  When you say that the top 50 percent of all earners pay 97 percent of \nall income tax revenues, this means that the bottom half of income \nearners in this country are paying only 3 percent of all income taxes \ncollected. Many of them do not pay anything. Many of them get money \nfrom the Federal Government for living. No one can correctly say that \nthe rich are not paying their share of taxes.\n  Let me go over that again. The top 1 percent pay 34 percent of all \nincome taxes. The top 10 percent are paying two-thirds of all income \ntaxes. The top 50 percent pay 97 percent of all income taxes. The \nbottom 50 percent pay only 3 percent, and many of those do not pay \nincome taxes at all.\n  No one can correctly say that the rich are not paying their share of \ntaxes or that this economy is not a good economy. We all wish it could \nbe even better, but when you have an economy as diverse as ours, as \ncomplex as ours, it is hard to say that this is not a good economy.\n  Those who have complained that income growth lagged behind the rest \nof the economy in the early years of the current economic expansion \nwere absolutely correct. I share their frustration that it takes so \nlong for income growth to permeate throughout all income levels. It is \nnot enough to tell someone who is out of work or has been forced to \ntake a pay cut that once the unemployment rate falls a bit more wages \nshould pick up.\n  The Government should do what it can to help lift people out of \npoverty. Republicans and Democrats agree on this. It is not just the \nDemocrats. We all agree on that. So to present this like only Democrats \ncare, that is pure bunk.\n  However, the answer to this problem is not to take actions that would \njeopardize economic growth. The solution is to keep the economy as \nstrong as possible while making sure that those who get hurt by a \nfaltering economy have the means to get up again, to help those who are \nunderemployed or who are unemployed. We improved and expanded the \nearned-income tax credit, provided new funds for training and \neducation, and during the recession we increased the duration of \nunemployment insurance.\n  Let's be honest about it. Both Republicans and Democrats care for \nthose who are suffering or those who have not been doing as well. But \nthe Democratic solution seems to be, let's increase taxes so we can \nspend more from the Federal Government. We know what that is going to \ndo. That is going to stifle this economy and economic growth and hurt \nall those who are paying into the system. Above all, it will hurt those \nwho aren't paying into the system, who are the poor. That seems to be \nthe only solution they have. They\n\n[[Page S9856]]\n\ndon't dare say that is their solution, but it is.\n  Should the Democrats take control of the Congress, you can absolutely \nbet that the tax cuts that we enacted will not be continued and that \nthe economy is going to go into the tank. You can absolutely guarantee \nit.\n  Ultimately, it is productivity growth that improves the standard of \nliving, plain and simple. Productivity growth has been exceptionally \nhigh for the last decade, and I aim to work to keep it that way by \nencouraging companies to invest in new plant and equipment, by \nencouraging workers to invest in training and education, and to do my \npart to say that Government keeps spending and taxes low and allows our \nbusinesses to compete as best they can.\n  The rewards may not be immediate. But the incredible engine that is \nthe U.S. economy owes its success to these simple precepts.\n  Mr. President, I also know, and I notice the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada made the point, that energy is a very important matter to \nus. He said gas prices are going to go up again. That is going to be \ntrue if we do not have a consistently good energy policy. In the \nRepublican energy bill, I put five bills in there myself. One to give \nincentives to recover the almost 1 trillion barrels of oil from oil tar \nsands and oil shale deposits in western Colorado, southern Wyoming, and \neastern Utah. There are 3 trillion barrels of oil there, but we, \naccording to the experts, can recover 1 trillion barrels of oil.\n  To put that in perspective, the whole Middle East's proven reserves \nare 760 billion barrels. So we have more oil in tar sands and oil shale \nthan all of the Middle East. The problem is it is going to cost us \nabout $34 a barrel under current methodology and current technology to \nproduce that oil, where it costs only 50 cents a barrel for Saudi \ncrude.\n  If we move in that direction, we are going to be able to be less \ndependent upon other countries' oil, especially countries that hate the \nUnited States of America, like Venezuela--at least the leadership does. \nI don't think the people of Venezuela do.\n  We also put in better permitting language. The radical \nenvironmentalists have made it almost impossible to get permits to be \nable to develop these resources.\n  Third, we put in that bill incentives to develop our geothermal \nresources. It is estimated that Utah geothermal wells alone could \nproduce electricity for upwards of 22 million homes. That is about 66 \nmillion people. That is almost the whole West, right from one small \nState. Big in geography, small in population: only 2.5 million people. \nThe fact is we can do that. Now the incentives are in that bill. They \nare not as good as I would have had them, but they are better than what \nwe had before that bill.\n  Most people do not realize that we have lost 250 oil refineries over \nthe last 40 years and only built one. It is almost impossible to build \nan oil refinery because of radical environmentalists. The fact is, we \nhave to build more oil refineries as long as we are dependent on oil \nrefineries for our major source of fuel, for automobiles, trucks, \ntrains, planes, et cetera. We have to wake up and start doing some of \nthese things.\n  Last but not least, my little CLEAR Act is in that bill to give \neconomic incentives to develop alternative fuels, alternative-fuel \nvehicles and alternative-fuel infrastructure. It is a little bill that \nhelped drive the hybrid auto industry into existence. Now we are \ntalking about plug-in hybrids. We are talking about hydrogen cars. To \nget the hydrogen--we only have 9 million tons of hydrogen in this \ncountry. We need 150 million tons before we can actually make that a \nviable fuel and put it in real cars. We are capable of doing it now, \nbut it would be the equivalent of about $3.60 a gallon of gas.\n  We are going to have to develop cookie-cutter nuclear powerplants so \nwe can develop this hydrogen and have totally clean fuel in our \ncountry, from hydrogen cars that will work just as well as gasoline-\ndriven cars. We are a few years away from that, but it is possible to \ndo that if he we wake up and start really thinking about the \nenvironment the way we should.\n  If there is such a phenomenon as global warming--I believe there is--\nthis will be one of the ways of making our contribution to reducing the \ngreenhouse gases, among other things.\n  We hear a lot of complaints on the other side about the economy. My \ngosh, these figures have not been met hardly at all in the last 50 \nyears--until now. I think the President, the Republican Congress, and a \nnumber of Democrats who have supported us deserve a lot of credit for \nat least having us where we are. Can we improve? We hope so, and we are \ngoing to do everything in our power to do it, but I know one way we \ncan't improve is increasing taxes, increasing Government or having more \nGovernment controls, having more regulations, which always seems to be \nthe case when the Democrats take over the Congress. It is certainly \ngoing to be the case if they do it this time, and I don't believe the \nAmerican people are going to put up with that.\n  I think what I am saying here today is that we cannot listen to \ncliches and slogans and doom-and-gloom prophecies. We have to work hard \nto get things done. We have the elements here to do it.\n  There were comments made about the minimum wage, that we haven't had \nan increase in 10 years. The so-called trifecta bill would have \nincreased it to $7 an hour, and maybe, if it was a true debate, the \nDemocrats could have won on even a higher minimum wage. All we asked \nfor is that we have some modest estate tax reform, which almost \neverybody admits would be beneficial to the economy at large and to our \nfamilies, and especially small businesses that could lose their \nbusinesses--small farmers, family farmers, who could lose their farms. \nBut, no, that was stopped by a filibuster, which has become the \nprincipal means of obstruction ever since the George Mitchell days when \nhe filibustered.\n  I thought he was a great majority leader. Don't anybody misconstrue \nwhat I am saying. He was, but he was tough. But he started to \nfilibuster everything he disagreed with, or the Democrats disagreed \nwith. Of course, here we are today doing the same thing.\n  I would like to see us get rid of partisanship, where we can work \ntogether in the best interests of our country, without the mouthing off \nabout how bad one side or the other side is, and really do what we were \nreally sent here to do. I admit that we are in an election year and \npeople want to win. So things are said that probably wouldn't be said \nin a non-election year. I would like to even tone that down a little \nbit and let's recognize the economy is a good economy. Could it be \nbetter? I doubt under the circumstances, but we can all work to try to \nmake it better.\n  Are some people suffering in our society? I said in my remarks today \nthat there are, and we ought to work to try alleviate that. We have \ndone a lot to alleviate that.\n  As I have said, the bottom 50 percent only pay 3 percent of all \nFederal income taxes, and many of them don't pay taxes at all. A goodly \nnumber of them get help from the Federal Government. And that is from \nboth parties, not just the Democratic Party. That is because in the \npast we have worked in bipartisan ways to do these things.\n  I hope we can continue that. I wish we could get rid of the \nobstructionary tactics that we have had on judges and some other issues \nover the last number of years.\n  I wish we could get behind whoever the President the United States \nis, and especially right now. President Bush is trying to do the best \nhe can to stem the tide of terrorism in the world, but he also is doing \na good job with regard to the economy with hopefully our help.\n  Whoever the President is the next time, I hope, whether it is a \nDemocrat or a Republican, that we can work together in the best \ninterests of our country. It would be a wonderful, pleasant change from \nthe last 10 years that I have seen. Both parties are at fault. I am not \nsaying equally, but both parties have reason to improve. All I can say \nis, how do you knock an economy that is clearly as good as this one is \nand continue to bad-mouth it when in fact the facts all show otherwise? \nI don't know how they can continue to drumbeat this day in and day out \nby some on the other side who know that is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9857]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9854-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9854-S9857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO PROSPER\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

The problem is it is going to cost us \nabout $34 a barrel under current methodology and current technology to \nproduce that oil, where it costs only 50 cents a barrel for Saudi \ncrude.\n  If we move in that direction, we are going to be able to be less \ndependent upon other countries' oil, especially countries that hate the \nUnited States of America, like Venezuela--at least the leadership does. \nI don't think the people of Venezuela do.\n  We also put in better permitting language. The radical \nenvironmentalists have made it almost impossible to get permits to be \nable to develop these resources.\n  Third, we put in that bill incentives to develop our geothermal \nresources. It is estimated that Utah geothermal wells alone could \nproduce electricity for upwards of 22 million homes. That is about 66 \nmillion people. That is almost the whole West, right from one small \nState. Big in geography, small in population: only 2.5 million people. \nThe fact is we can do that. Now the incentives are in that bill. They \nare not as good as I would have had them, but they are better than what \nwe had before that bill.\n  Most people do not realize that we have lost 250 oil refineries over \nthe last 40 years and only built one. It is almost impossible to build \nan oil refinery because of radical environmentalists. The fact is, we \nhave to build more oil refineries as long as we are dependent on oil \nrefineries for our major source of fuel, for automobiles, trucks, \ntrains, planes, et cetera. We have to wake up and start doing some of \nthese things.\n  Last but not least, my little CLEAR Act is in that bill to give \neconomic incentives to develop alternative fuels, alternative-fuel \nvehicles and alternative-fuel infrastructure. It is a little bill that \nhelped drive the hybrid auto industry into existence. Now we are \ntalking about plug-in hybrids. We are talking about hydrogen cars. To \nget the hydrogen--we only have 9 million tons of hydrogen in this \ncountry. We need 150 million tons before we can actually make that a \nviable fuel and put it in real cars. We are capable of doing it now, \nbut it would be the equivalent of about $3.60 a gallon of gas.\n  We are going to have to develop cookie-cutter nuclear powerplants so \nwe can develop this hydrogen and have totally clean fuel in our \ncountry, from hydrogen cars that will work just as well as gasoline-\ndriven cars. We are a few years away from that, but it is possible to \ndo that if he we wake up and start really thinking about the \nenvironment the way we should.\n  If there is such a phenomenon as global warming--I believe there is--\nthis will be one of the ways of making our contribution to reducing the \ngreenhouse gases, among other things.\n  We hear a lot of complaints on the other side about the economy. My \ngosh, these figures have not been met hardly at all in the last 50 \nyears--until now. I think the President, the Republican Congress, and a \nnumber of Democrats who have supported us deserve a lot of credit for \nat least having us where we are. Can we improve? We hope so, and we are \ngoing to do everything in our power to do it, but I know one way we \ncan't improve is increasing taxes, increasing Government or having more \nGovernment controls, having more regulations, which always seems to be \nthe case when the Democrats take over the Congress. It is certainly \ngoing to be the case if they do it this time, and I don't believe the \nAmerican people are going to put up with that.\n  I think what I am saying here today is that we cannot listen to \ncliches and slogans and doom-and-gloom prophecies. We have to work hard \nto get things done. We have the elements here to do it.\n  There were comments made about the minimum wage, that we haven't had \nan increase in 10 years. The so-called trifecta bill would have \nincreased it to $7 an hour, and maybe, if it was a true debate, the \nDemocrats could have won on even a higher minimum wage. All we asked \nfor is that we have some modest estate tax reform, which almost \neverybody admits would be beneficial to the economy at large and to our \nfamilies, and especially small businesses that could lose their \nbusinesses--small farmers, family farmers, who could lose their farms. \nBut, no, that was stopped by a filibuster, which has become the \nprincipal means of obstruction ever since the George Mitchell days when \nhe filibustered.\n  I thought he was a great majority leader. Don't anybody misconstrue \nwhat I am saying. He was, but he was tough. But he started to \nfilibuster everything he disagreed with, or the Democrats disagreed \nwith. Of course, here we are today doing the same thing.\n  I would like to see us get rid of partisanship, where we can work \ntogether in the best interests of our country, without the mouthing off \nabout how bad one side or the other side is, and really do what we were \nreally sent here to do. I admit that we are in an election year and \npeople want to win. So things are said that probably wouldn't be said \nin a non-election year. I would like to even tone that down a little \nbit and let's recognize the economy is a good economy. Could it be \nbetter? I doubt under the circumstances, but we can all work to try to \nmake it better.\n  Are some people suffering in our society? I said in my remarks today \nthat there are, and we ought to work to try alleviate that. We have \ndone a lot to alleviate that.\n  As I have said, the bottom 50 percent only pay 3 percent of all \nFederal income taxes, and many of them don't pay taxes at all. A goodly \nnumber of them get help from the Federal Government. And that is from \nboth parties, not just the Democratic Party. That is because in the \npast we have worked in bipartisan ways to do these things.\n  I hope we can continue that. I wish we could get rid of the \nobstructionary tactics that we have had on judges and some other issues \nover the last number of years.\n  I wish we could get behind whoever the President the United States \nis, and especially right now. President Bush is trying to do the best \nhe can to stem the tide of terrorism in the world, but he also is doing \na good job with regard to the economy with hopefully our help.\n  Whoever the President is the next time, I hope, whether it is a \nDemocrat or a Republican, that we can work together in the best \ninterests of our country. It would be a wonderful, pleasant change from \nthe last 10 years that I have seen. Both parties are at fault. I am not \nsaying equally, but both parties have reason to improve. All I can say \nis, how do you knock an economy that is clearly as good as this one is \nand continue to bad-mouth it when in fact the facts all show otherwise? \nI don't know how they can continue to drumbeat this day in and day out \nby some on the other side who know that is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9857]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/20/senate-section/article/S9857-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
