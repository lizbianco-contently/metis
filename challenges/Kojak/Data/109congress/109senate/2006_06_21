Mr. President, in a couple of minutes we will resume work \non the Defense authorization bill. This morning we have an order for 90 \nminutes of debate prior to the two votes related to the minimum wage. \nFollowing those votes, Senator Levin will offer an amendment related to \nIraq on which there will be 5 hours of debate. Many Senators have \nexpressed a desire to speak during that time, and we may be able to set \nup blocks of controlled time in order to line up speakers. Following \ndebate on the Levin amendment, we will set that amendment aside and \nbegin debate on Senator Kerry's Iraq language. Although there is no \nlimit for debate on that amendment, we anticipate that we will lock in \na debate structure for that amendment as well. This is our second week \nof consideration of the bill, and last night, to ensure that we will \nfinish the bill in a reasonable time, we filed cloture on the Defense \nauthorization bill. Senators will have until 1 o'clock today to file \ntheir first-degree amendments.\n  With respect to the Iraq language, it is my expectation that we will \nvote on the Iraq amendments prior to the cloture vote which would occur \non Thursday. Senator Warner and Senator Levin have cleared a large \nnumber of amendments and will continue to work to clear additional \namendments as we go forward. In addition, there will likely be germane \namendments debated and voted once cloture is invoked.\n  Having said that, I look forward to constructive debate throughout \nthe day and evening on the two Iraq amendments before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6189-7", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate is now in the middle of an \nimportant debate on Iraq, but it wasn't so long ago that we found \nourselves in an important debate on another issue, immigration reform. \nIt took weeks of negotiations for the Senate to develop the basic \nframework for legislation that both Democrats and Republicans could \nsupport. Then it took several more weeks to work through dozens of \namendments and pass a bill, a comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n  The day we finally passed immigration legislation, I came to the \nfloor to say it was a good day for the Senate but a day not for \ncelebrating. News reports from all over the country this morning show \nwhy I was right. For example, from the Washington Post today:\n\n       House Republicans have largely given up on passing a broad \n     rewrite of the nation's immigration laws before the November \n     elections. House GOP leaders said today they would hold \n     hearings even before naming conferees.\n\n  The truth is out. For all their tough talk about securing our \nborders, House Republicans have no intention of actually accomplishing \nthe goal. They want to defeat comprehensive immigration reform of the \nkind we passed in the Senate, a bipartisan bill, and House leaders are \nwilling to sacrifice the security of the American people to accomplish \nwhat I believe are their selfish goals.\n  Let's be perfectly clear. This idea of field hearings is just a \nfront, an attempt to delay, impede, and obstruct a bipartisan effort to \nstrengthen our borders and fix our immigration system. The House \ndoesn't need hearings to write a bill because they have already passed \ntheir bill. They don't need hearings to name conferees. The only reason \nfor hearings is to pander to the rightwing base of their party and \navoid the hard work of negotiating a final bill with the Senate for the \nAmerican people.\n\n  It has been clear for weeks now that House Republicans have no \ninterest in passing an immigration bill this year.\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\nBut even as House leaders speak more and more openly about their \nopposition to comprehensive reform, we have heard only silence from the \nWhite House. The President went on national television and pledged his \nsupport for comprehensive reform. Now we will see if his actions match \nhis words. I know the President is overseas, but I am confident there \nis reliable telephone service in Vienna. I respectfully suggest that \nPresident Bush pick up the phone and tell the Speaker and the majority \nleader of the House to stop stalling. He needs to persuade them that \nour national security depends on action, a conference, and final \nlegislation.\n  Meanwhile, here in the Senate, I am waiting for assurances from the \nmajority leader that the conference committee on immigration reform \nwill address only immigration reform, not tax breaks for corporations \nor billionaires. I am confident the majority leader can provide those \nassurances. He has told me he wants to; he just hasn't done so.\n  Democrats are ready to roll up their sleeves and get this bill done. \nWe are determined to move forward. I have a list of Democratic \nconferees in my pocket. I also happen to know that there are a fair \nnumber of Republicans who want to move forward. I spoke yesterday to \ntwo of my Republican colleagues who said they are willing to sign a \nletter saying that if anything comes back from conference with anything \nother than the tax measures that are in this bill, they will not \nsupport the conference report.\n  Unlike same-sex marriage and flag burning, immigration reform is an \nissue that affects real people every day. It is a national security \nissue. It is an economic issue, an issue that my constituents want us \nto deal with. It is an issue all Americans want us to deal with. \nCertainly no one wants to do it the way the House did it, by making \nfelons out of immigrants, by making criminals out of humanitarian \nworkers who operate soup kitchens, or the clergy who offer these \nimmigrants religious counseling or, from a Catholic perspective, have \nthem be given the holy sacraments. It is untoward what their bill does.\n  The way the Senate did it, by beefing up security on the borders and \nforcing employer sanctions and giving out undocumented aliens who are \nhere a way to get right with the law and to have strong employer \nsanctions, is what the American people want and deserve.\n  The Senate has worked its will. The House has worked its will. It is \ntime to let the conference committee go forward and come up with a \nproduct. It is my hope President Bush won't let a few extreme \nRepublicans hold our border security hostage. It is my hope the House \nleaders will abandon their delaying tactics once and for all.\n  Some have said that the immigration bill is on life support. Well, we \nDemocrats don't believe that. We want to breathe life into this \nprocess. This legislation is imperative. It is important. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues won't put this on life support. If so, they will \nhelp us revive this most important issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I join my leader urging the House to move forward \npromptly. Would the leader not agree with me that at the current time \nour borders are effectively broken and that only means a real potential \ndanger to our national security, and that our legislation that passed \nin the Senate would address that aspect of the immigration issue? Would \nthe Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, there is no finer example of how \nlegislation should move forward than what we did in the Senate. The \nPresident got involved. We applauded him. We had Democrats and \nRepublicans working together. What we did was extraordinary. I heard an \ninterview on National Public Radio this morning where the acting head \nof the Immigration and Naturalization Service was saying that he \ndoesn't want a fence on the entire border with Mexico. Well, the Senate \nworked its will. We agreed. We have a fence in certain places, but we \nhave security. Security was our No. 1 issue. We took care of security. \nWe took care of a guest worker program that is badly needed, a pathway \nto legalization. We took care of enforcing employer sanctions. We have \na piece of legislation that every American should be proud of. It \nshould not be demagogued, and that is what is happening in the House.\n  We need to work together. It is so important that we do something. I \nhold up the Senate legislation as a model for how we should move \nlegislation. We should have a conference with the House and have a \nfinal product. I am calling on the President today to continue his \npartnership with us on this legislation, not concede that we can't get \nthis done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for another brief question, \nthe Senator would agree with me that effectively our borders are \nbroken. The employer enforcement program that exists today is in \ntatters, as we have seen from the GAO report. There is continuously \nthis Third World underground economy that is operating effectively out \nof control. All those issues were addressed effectively and in a \nbipartisan way in the Senate.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that if the House continues to \navoid a conference and the hopeful aspect of a reasonable compromise, \nwe fail the American people in dealing with these extremely important \npublic policy issues in a bipartisan way?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as an example on employer sanctions--they \nare in such desperate shape--last year there were three enforcement \nmeasures taken. In our bill, we provide for 7,000 new hires that will \ndeal only with employer sanctions. That is one example. The other \nexample is that with border security, which is in desperate shape as we \nspeak, I have been there. I have seen what happens. There are 24 lanes \nof traffic coming in at the San Ysidro border security point, 24 lanes \nof traffic every day, 24 hours a day. They don't have enough help \nthere. We have given them help so they can do their job. That is \nanother example.\n  I feel so desperate, desperate for the American people. I feel \ndesperate for my State. We have problems. This bill would address our \nproblems in Nevada.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator realizes, we have $25 billion for border \nsecurity and other immigration enforcement. Evidently, the House \ndoesn't believe that is something that ought to get passed if we are \nnot going to have a resolution of that issue, $25 billion in terms of \nenforcement spending that is authorized. If we don't get that passed, \nwe don't have that $25 billion; am I correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right. I want to say to my \nfriend, people are calling for bipartisanship in the Congress.\n  Here we had it in the Senate. We have the Senator from Massachusetts \nwho has a certain political philosophy and the Senator from Arizona \nwith a certain political philosophy; they have locked arms with \nDemocrats and Republicans of all political philosophies, and we came up \nwith a tremendous piece of legislation.\n  If there is something wrong with our legislation, let's go to \nconference on it. We would be happy to visit with them. Let's not say \nwe are not going to work with you. We want to have a conference and \nwork out legislation that will protect our borders and give the \nAmerican people what they need. We have to do this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a final question. Would the Senator agree with me \nthat the time for talking has ended and the time for action ought to be \nnow?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I have in my pocket the names of our conferees. We are \nready to roll; we are ready to go to work.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's leadership time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nrespond to a question from my friend from Florida.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator agree, given the fact that \nthe Senate position is often described as amnesty, that indeed amnesty \nis the current situation of the law--a law that passed in the 1980s \nthat is not enforced by the Government, that is not obeyed by the \npeople nor the employers of this country and which, in effect, grants \namnesty to 12 million people who are illegally in this country and that \nthe whole point of the Senate bill\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nis to remove this amnesty under the present condition and return those \nwho are going to be here working in a legal status? Would the Senator \nthink that is a fair characterization?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is very clear we worked very hard to make \nsure there was no amnesty and that there was a path to legalization. \nThe people had to have a job, pay their taxes and stay out of trouble, \nlearn English and pay penalties and fines and then move to the back of \nthe line. What we did legislatively was nothing short of miraculous to \nget it passed in this body. It would be a disaster for this country not \nto move forward on this with the tremendous amount of work we have \ndone. As I have said, on a bipartisan basis we did that. Here is a \nSenate action that was not in a partisan vein but in a bipartisan vein.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6191-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6191-S6274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the consideration of S. 2766, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2766) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2007 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 4241, to name the act after John \n     Warner, a Senator from Virginia.\n       Kennedy amendment No. 4322, to amend the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the \n     Federal minimum wage.\n       Enzi amendment No. 4376, to promote job creation and small \n     business preservation in the adjustment of the Federal \n     minimum wage.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be \n1\\1/2\\ hours equally divided for debate between the Senator from \nWyoming, Mr. Enzi, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy or \ntheir designees.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in a short while, we will have an \nopportunity in the Senate to vote on whether we are going to provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage that will affect approximately 15 million \nAmericans. We have not, as has been pointed out in our discussions \nyesterday and the day before, increased the minimum wage in the last 9 \nyears. Even the $5.15 an hour, the current minimum wage, has lost, \nsince 9 years ago, about 20 percent of its purchasing power.\n  The men and women who earn the minimum wage are men and women of \ndignity. They take pride in doing the jobs they do, although they do \nvery menial work at the bottom rung of the economic ladder. They work \nas teachers assistants in our schools. They work in the nursing homes \nlooking after the men and women who have made this country the great \ncountry it is. They provide the essential services in many of the \nbuildings of our Nation, where American commerce is taking place. They \nwork and they play by the rules and still they fall further and further \nbehind.\n  I think there is a broad agreement in this body--there should be--\nthat if you are going to work in the United States and you are going to \nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, you should not have to live in \npoverty. But these individuals do. We have seen what has happened to \nthe minimum wage over recent years. The minimum wage jobs are not jobs \nthat get you out of poverty. Minimum wage jobs are jobs that keep you \nin poverty. That is a rather dramatic difference from what we have had \nhistorically when we had Democratic and Republican administrations all \nvoting for an increase in the minimum wage and an expansion of minimum \nwage coverage.\n  So that is the issue that is going to be before us, whether we are \ngoing to go over a 2-year period and raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an \nhour. There are those who are strongly opposed to it. We heard some of \nthose voices yesterday. They say let's let the market decide on these \nissues. Let's let the market make the judgment and decide whether $5.15 \nis fair or whether we should see even a reduction. We have a number of \nStates that have no minimum wage whatsoever, none. It is amazing. Six \nStates have no minimum wage. One State has minimum wage of $2.65 an \nhour.\n  I think Americans have made the judgment that a minimum wage ought to \nbe a minimum wage and people who work ought to be able to at least get \nthe essentials in life. Of course, that is impossible today with the \nexplosion in costs. We have seen the explosion of costs taking place, \nwhether it is gasoline, education funds, health care or whether it is \nfood, but we have not seen an increase in the minimum wage. We have \nseen an increase in salaries of the Members of the Senate. That has \ngone through. We have seen that over the last 9 years.\n  We have increased our salaries with the cost of living by some \n$30,000, but we refuse to provide an increase in the minimum wage for \nprimarily women because 59 percent of these individuals who would \nbenefit are women. They work hard. Many of those women have children. \nSo it is a women's issue and a children's issue. It is also a family \nissue. We hear a great deal in the public discourse about family \nvalues, about our value system in the United States. Is X, Y, and Z \npublic policy issue consistent with our values? Certainly, if you are \ntalking about having someone who is going to work 40 hours a week, a \nwomen who works hard and is trying to raise a child, whether they are \ngoing to be able to have any family time together effectively or \nwhether that woman is going to have to work two or three jobs and have \nlittle or no time with that child is a family issue and is a values \nissue.\n\n  Americans understand that. So this is a values issue. The leaders of \nour great religions understand it.\n  That is why the members of the churches in our country have been in \nstrong support--and I will come back to that in a minute--of an \nincrease in the minimum wage. It is also a civil rights issue because \nso many of those men and women entering the job market at this level \nare men and women of color. It is a children's issue, a women's issue \nand, mostly I as I have said many times and continue to say, it is a \nfairness issue. Americans understand fairness. Work hard and play by \nthe rules in the richest country in the world and you should not have \nto live in poverty. Yet we find that at the end of the year, these \nfamilies are $6,000 below the poverty line and they are falling further \nbehind.\n  This is it. We'are not going to get another chance. Arguments will be \nmade that, well, you should not offer it on this particular \nlegislation. This is the Defense authorization bill. We say: Look, Mr. \nRepublican leader, give us a chance to have a direct up-or-down vote on \nthe increase in the minimum wage. You have your alternative on it. Give \nus a freestanding bill and I have indicated that we would withdraw this \namendment, but we have been unable to get that.\n  All of us understand legislatively that we are moving more and more \nrapidly into the appropriations, and there is going to be a point of \norder made against legislating on appropriations. This legislation is \nappropriate for a very basic and fundamental reason. That is why our \nmen and women who wear the American uniform are fighting in Iraq and \nfighting in Afghanistan--to defend American values and ideals. One of \nthe American values is fairness here at home. It is treating people \nfairly for a day's work. That is an American value. That is one of the \nvalues these Americans are fighting for. That is why it is appropriate \nhere. I don't know offhand, though, if we had more time--and I will \nfind out next time we debate this issue because even if we get $7.25 an \nhour, we are still failing to meet the needs of working poor. I don't \nknow how many servicemen are in the military serving overseas whose \nparents are earning the minimum wage, but there are scores of them.\n  So this is about the values we hold in this country and the values \nworth protecting by the military of this country. That is what it is \ntalking about. We understand there are important debates going on \nthrough noontime, and as far as I am concerned, they can go on through \nthe evening. The idea that we are taking a few moments this morning to \ntalk about an issue that affects some 15 million of our fellow \ncitizens--this Senate could find plenty of time to debate the estate \ntaxes, plenty\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nof time to debate flag burning. I don't know when the last flag was \nburned in my State of Massachusetts, but we have plenty of time to deal \nwith that. We have had plenty of time on the Federal marriage \namendment. But we don't want to deal with an increase in the minimum \nwage that affects 15 million people.\n\n  There you are. There are the priorities. It could not be clearer. So \nwe know where we stand. We are always asked how we stand on different \nissues: What do you believe in?\n  We will have a very good opportunity this morning to indicate what we \nbelieve in. That is basically the framework of this issue.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Thirty-four minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 more minutes.\n  Mr. President, this letter is from the heads of 33 major religious \ngroups calling on Congress to do its moral duty to raise the minimum \nwage. This is the Let Justice Roll, which is an organization of faith \nand community leaders:\n\n       As leaders of our respective faith communities, we call on \n     Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage in the 109th \n     session. For too long, the ranks of the working poor have \n     grown in this country. For too long, low-wage workers have \n     been unable to support themselves and their families, even \n     though they work several jobs, trying to make ends meet. \n     Poverty has become a disease, striking at the very heart of \n     the United States, attacking the most vulnerable, even as the \n     wealthy few continue to accumulate far more than their \n     reasonable share. It is unacceptable that such a state of \n     affairs be allowed to continue, as year after year, Congress \n     fails to pass an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n       Prophetic voices through the ages have called upon their \n     nations to show justice to the poorest and most vulnerable in \n     society. The Prophet Amos exhorts the people of Israel, \n     ``Hate evil and love good, and establish justice. Let justice \n     roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing \n     stream.'' Then, and now, the assembled people of God are \n     called upon to establish justice for low-wage workers, whose \n     cries are so often heard across our land.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the \nsigners be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Living Wage Campaign,\n\n                                                 November 7, 2005.\n       Dear Members of Congress: As leaders of our respective \n     faith communities, we call on Congress to raise the Federal \n     minimum wage in the 109th session. For too long, the ranks of \n     the working poor have grown in this country. For too long, \n     low-wage workers have been unable to support themselves and \n     their families, even though they work several jobs, trying to \n     make ends meet. Poverty has become a disease, striking at the \n     very heart of the United States, attacking the most \n     vulnerable, even as the wealthy few continue to accumulate \n     far more than their reasonable share. It is unacceptable that \n     such a state of affairs be allowed to continue, as year after \n     year, Congress fails to pass an increase in the Federal \n     minimum wage.\n       Prophetic voices throughout the ages have called upon their \n     nations to show justice to the poorest and most vulnerable in \n     society. The Prophet Amos exhorts the people of Israel, \n     ``Hate evil and love good, and establish justice. Let justice \n     roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing \n     stream.'' Then, and now, the assembled people of God are \n     called upon to establish justice for low-wage workers, whose \n     cries are so often heard across our land.\n       The situation among America's minimum wage workers is \n     particularly dire. A minimum wage employee--making $5.15 an \n     hour, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns $10,700 \n     a year--$5,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of \n     three. The real value of the minimum wage today is nearly \n     $4.00 less than it was in 1968. Indeed, in order for the \n     minimum wage to have the same purchasing power as it did in \n     1968, the Federal minimum would have to be raised to more \n     than $9.00. This situation is unconscionable, as the wealth \n     of our Nation continues to be built on the backs of the \n     working poor.\n       In his Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?, our \n     modern-day prophet, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     says, ``There is nothing new about poverty. What is new, \n     however, is that we now have the resources to get rid of \n     it.'' It is time to heed the call of the prophets, both \n     ancient and modern. It is time to recognize that a minimum \n     wage should be a fair, just, and living wage.\n           Signed,\n         Kim Bobo, Executive Director of Interfaith Worker \n           Justice; The Reverend Dr. Robert W.

Mr. President, when we asked people to sign on as \ncitizen cosponsors of the Fair Minimum Wage Act, 1,000 religious \nleaders answered the call. They took a stand to say that minimum wage \nis a moral issue that must be addressed. They have come together from \nall denominations, all walks of life to send this important message.\n  I will take a couple more moments.\n  First, I remind my colleagues in the Senate that support for an \nincrease in the minimum wage is going like a wildfire across the \ncountry. This chart indicates in red those States which have increased \nthe minimum wage above the Federal Government minimum wage. Look at \nthis: Arkansas and Illinois.\n  The States in yellow are those States where the minimum wage will \nlikely be on the ballot this fall.\n  Illinois, Florida, North Carolina--red States--passed an increase in \nthe minimum wage in both houses, but they have not been reconciled. \nNorth Carolina, Arkansas, the home of Wal-Mart, increased the minimum \nwage.\n  This is happening in the countryside. I remind the Senate again, with \nthe failure to increase the minimum wage, what the impact has been on \nfamilies and on the poor.\n  From 2000 to 2004, we failed to increase the minimum wage and 1.4 \nmillion more children have fallen into poverty. If we look at what has \nbeen happening to families, 5.4 million more Americans are in poverty \nover the last 4 years. This does not bring it up to 2006. This would \ncontinue to grow. It is 5.4 million now. The best estimate is we have \n1.4 million more children who are now in poverty.\n  In terms of the industrialized nations of the world, this is what has \nhappened: We have the highest child poverty rate in the industrialized \nworld, and we haven't increased our minimum wage.\n  I remind my colleagues what has been happening in other countries.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\nTony Blair said 7 years ago that he was going to end poverty in Britain \nby 2020. There were 4 million children living in poverty, and he said, \nas a matter of national direction and vision, that he was going to \neliminate poverty for children by 2020. This is what they have done. \nThey will have a minimum wage of $9.80--$9.80--an hour this October. \nThey have moved 1.8 million children out of poverty over the last 4 \nyears. The United States has refused to increase the minimum wage, and \nwe have put 1.4 million children into poverty. That is completely \nunacceptable.\n  This is the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. How \nmuch time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes 48 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have \nconsumed 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I didn't expect to hear the Democratic \nleader talk about the immigration bill this morning and his and Senator \nKennedy's desire to rush it through the House of Representatives, \ncalling for action now. It is a very bad bill, and it impacts directly \nthe issues we are talking about today--wages for working Americans. I \nam going to talk about that issue and ask our colleagues to give \nserious thought to the matters I will raise.\n  With regard to our colleagues who claim they are concerned about \npoverty among American workers, I ask those Members--Senator Reid and \nSenator Kennedy--who proposed the immigration bill and tried to rush it \nthrough this Senate without any amendments to consider some of the \nconcerns of their own allies, economists and professors, who believe \nthat if passed, it would damage the wages of American workers.\n  I agree that we have a troubling condition in our country. People \nhave referred to it often as the wage gap, that higher income people \nseem to be doing well, but there has been a lag in performance among \nlower income workers. That has caused quite a bit of concern. I am not \nsure exactly what the economic numbers show on that, but repeatedly, we \nhave been told often from our Democratic colleagues--but not so much \nlately--that there is a growing gap in income. Why is this occurring? I \nwish to share some thoughts about it because I believe it is important.\n  Let me mention this: I don't want the American worker to have a \n$7.25-an-hour job; I want them to have a $15-an-hour job, a $30-an-hour \njob. That is what we want in an economy that is growing and prosperous. \nWe want a full-employment economy where people can choose jobs that \nfulfill their highest aspirations and pay them a good wage, with good \nretirement and good health care, and we are creating a growing economy \nthat nurtures that. But for some reason, the wages in some job markets \nhave not kept up as well as they should.\n\n  I will read from a number of experts on this matter and ask my \ncolleagues to think about it, not what I say but what the experts say. \nI am looking at a Washington Post article from Jonathan Weisman, March \n31, dealing with this precise issue of minimum wage and immigration. It \nis titled ``Immigration Divides Allies, Guest Worker Plan Sets \nDemocratic Supports Against Organized Labor.'' It starts off saying \nthis:\n\n       A growing body of economic research contends that the \n     recent surge of foreign workers has depressed wages for low-\n     skilled workers, especially for high school dropouts, and has \n     even begun displacing native-born workers.\n\n  Then the article quotes Professor George Borjas, an economist at \nHarvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has \nwritten a definitive book on immigration, ``Heaven's Door.'' He says:\n\n       What immigration really does is redistribute wealth away \n     from workers toward employers.\n\n  I did mention my good friend Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has \nbeen a champion for civil rights, and a champion for helping us fight \npoverty, and he cares about this issue very deeply. He sincerely does. \nBut I suggest he is not always perfectly correct on how to fix it. We \ncan have a legitimate debate about how to improve the wages of working \nAmericans, and that is what we need to be talking about.\n  The article says:\n\n       Kennedy, the Senate's liberal lion and an unflagging ally \n     of organized labor, says the [immigration] legislation he co-\n     wrote would help all low-wage workers by applying minimum-\n     wage laws and other . . . protections.\n\n  The AFL-CIO disagrees. According to John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO \nPresident:\n\n       Guest-worker programs cast [American] workers into a \n     perennial second-class status and unfairly put their fates \n     into their employers' hands, creating a situation ripe for \n     exploitation. . . .\n\n  He goes on:\n\n     ``They encourage employers to turn good jobs into temporary \n     jobs at reduced wages and diminished working conditions and \n     contribute to the growing class of workers laboring in \n     poverty.''\n\n  That was Mr. Sweeney. Mr. Weisman, the staff writer for the \nWashington Post, then quotes Professor Borjas:\n\n       But some of those macroeconomic gains have come at the \n     expense of low-wage workers, especially the 10 percent of the \n     labor force that dropped out of high school. In recent years, \n     competition from low-skilled immigrant workers has reduced \n     the wages of high school dropouts by as much as 8 percent, \n     Borjas said.\n\n  How about another professor, Andrew Sum, director of Northeastern \nUniversity's Center for Labor Market Studies. The article says quotes \nhim:\n\n       Looking at annual earnings, the percentage losses are in \n     the double digits, said Andrew Sum, director of Northeastern \n     University's Center for Labor Market Studies, because jobs \n     that once provided year-round employment are increasingly \n     becoming temporary.\n       A Northeastern University study found that nearly 86 \n     percent----\n\n  Listen to this, I say to my colleagues, this is important for us.\n\n       A Northeastern study found that nearly 86 percent of all \n     newly employed workers hired from 2000 to 2005 were \n     immigrants. For men, the statistics were more stark. In that \n     time, the labor market for men rose by 2.66 million while \n     2.77 million foreign-born men found work.\n\n  Listen to that: The Northeastern study found that foreign-born \nworkers filled all of the new jobs created for men between 2000 and \n2005, plus some other jobs.\n\n       In other words, Sum said, immigrants have begun replacing \n     native-born male workers.\n\n  In the immigration bill floor debate, if we not forced the Democratic \nside to allow us to have some amendments and reduce some of the \nincredible increases in immigration under the bill as presented, it \nwould have been shocking what the immigration bill would have done to \nthe jobs and wages of American workers. Even after successful \namendments that cut the numbers of low-skilled workers allowed to come \nin the future, the Senate bill will still, over 20 years, virtually \ntriple the number of people coming into our country legally, not \ncounting those who will continue to come illegally. That will \nundoubtedly impact our economy. That is why the House of \nRepresentatives needs to examine this bill very carefully before we go \nto conference.\n  How about this one? Professor Sum is quoted again in the Post \narticle: ``Young guys are being displaced by immigrants,'' he said. \n``Some of my good liberal friends take issue, but if you're a young \nworker under 25, poorly educated, probably African American, the higher \nthe share of new immigrants in your community, the worse your \nemployment prospects are becoming.''\n  How about Carol Swain, a law professor and political scientist at \nVanderbilt University? She is also quoted in the Post article:\n\n       ``What they're doing is increasing the pool of people \n     eligible to compete for the very limited resources that are \n     available for the people at the bottom. . . .The obligation \n     of the nation should be for the people who have been here for \n     decades.''\n\n  How about the famous economics professor Robert Samuelson? He wrote \nan article in May in the Washington Post titled ``Still Dodging \nImmigration's Truths.'' He quotes approvingly\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nfrom the testimony before our Judiciary Committee of Barry Chiswick, \nUniversity of Illinois, an immigration scholar, most respected, who \nsaid the presence of immigrants in the labor market:\n\n       Increases competition for low-skilled jobs, reducing the \n     earnings of low-skilled native-born workers. Because of their \n     low earnings, low-skilled immigrants also tend to pay less in \n     taxes than they receive in public benefits. . . . Hardly \n     anyone is discussing these issues candidly. We can be a \n     lawful society and a welcoming society simultaneously [as \n     President Bush has said] but we cannot be a welcoming society \n     for limitless numbers . . . without seriously compromising \n     our own future.\n\n  Part of the future he is talking about, is the future of the American \nworker. Samuelson goes on to say, and I quote the line from Professor \nSamuelson's article: ``Competition among them [low-skilled workers] \ndepresses wages.'' He is talking about the additional flow of illegal \nimmigrants into our country, or legal immigrants, for that matter. \nIncreasing competition for the American worker by increasing the number \nof immigrant workers available in the labor market will depress the \nwages for the American worker.\n  In another article, Professor Samuelson, says this. He notes that \nillegal immigrants already here represent only about 4.9 percent of the \nlabor force, and in no major occupation are immigrants a majority. They \nare 36 percent of insulation workers, 28 percent of drywall installers, \nand 20 percent of cooks who are drawn here by wage differences, not \nlabor shortages. He writes about how most new illegal immigrants get \nwork by accepting wages below the prevailing rates. What would happen, \nhe asks, if new, illegal immigration stopped and wasn't replaced by \nguest workers? Well, some employers would raise wages to attract U.S. \nworkers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. He goes on to say: Facing greater \nlabor costs, some would find ways to minimize costs. But he goes on to \nask this question, and let me quote Professor Samuelson:\n\n       What is wrong with higher wages for the poorest workers? \n     From 1994 to 2004, the wages of high school dropouts rose \n     only 2.3 percent after inflation, compared with 11.9 percent \n     for college graduates. The number of native high school \n     dropouts with jobs declined by 1.3 million from 2000 to 2005. \n     Some lost jobs to immigrants. Unemployment remains high for \n     some groups; 9.3 percent for African Americans.\n\n  I know that is true in my State. Although we have a great \nunemployment rate in Alabama--under 4 percent--we still have a far too \nhigh rate among the African-American community. And 12.7 percent for \nwhite teenagers, he notes. He says this: Poor immigrant workers hurt \nthe wages of unskilled Americans; the only question is how much. One \nestimate, he said, was 10 percent.\n  We discussed these issues in the Judiciary Committee. We had one \nhearing on it. We had a number of professors, including Professor \nFreeman, the Ascherman Professor of Economics at Harvard. He said these \nthings about the jobs and wages of American workers:\n\n       One of the concerns when immigrants come in is they may \n     take jobs from some Americans and drive down the wages of \n     some Americans and obviously, if there are a large number of \n     immigrants coming in, if they are coming in at a bad economic \n     time, that is very likely to happen.\n\n  Professor Chiswick, University of Illinois at Chicago said the \nfollowing:\n\n       The large increase in low-skilled immigration has had the \n     effect of decreasing the wages and employment opportunities \n     of low-skilled workers who are currently resident in the \n     United States.\n\n  He said this:\n\n       Over the past two decades, the real earnings of high-\n     skilled workers has risen substantially. The real earnings of \n     low-skilled workers have either stagnated or decreased.\n\n  These economists are telling us what other people will not. We are \nbeing told by the business community that there is this incredible \nshortage out there--they can't find workers so they have to have \nforeign workers--but now we know the earnings of low-skilled workers \nhave stagnated and decreased. Why? If a business wants to find more \nworkers, they will usually increase wages, not decrease them.\n  He goes on to say--my time is about up, but I have quite a number of \nothers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator's additional comments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes to respond to my \nfriend from Alabama, and then I see the Senator from Connecticut on the \nfloor.\n  The Senator from Alabama has made the best case for comprehensive \nimmigration reform because if you are not going to have the \ncomprehensive reform, you are going to have the continuation of the \npressure of driving wages down, as we find our employers hiring the \nundocumented workers. It has been his administration--according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the Republican administration--that has \nrefused to enforce employer sanctions against the employers who are \ncurrently doing it. There have been three cases in the last 4 years, \n$220,000 in fines. If he is so worried about this, I would say, Why \naren't we after the Labor Department to try to do something about it?\n  Second point: For those who are going to come into the United \nStates--and they ought to be able to come into the United States as \nworkers, if there is a job an American does not take--there is going to \nbe the labor protections, which do not exist today. There is going to \nbe prevailing wage protections, there are Davis-Bacon protections, if \nthey work in contract, if they work in construction, and service \ncontract employees. None of that has been mentioned by the Senator from \nAlabama. That is an entirely different current situation. And we are \ngoing to have 7,000 inspectors to make sure that it is enforced, which \ndoes not exist now and is a principal reason why we have the kinds of \nresults the Senator from Alabama refers to.\n  Mr. President, he has made the best case possible for passing a \ncomprehensive program so that those conditions would not exist.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 26 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could have 10 or 12 minutes, if that is appropriate.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why don't we start with 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, does the Senator from Alabama want 30 \nseconds? I will be glad to take this at another time when we have the \ntime. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I would note we \nwrestled before Y2K as to how many high-skilled foreign workers the \nU.S. needed to let in for that period--you and I both discussed that in \nthe Judiciary Committee and whether it would adversely impact the wages \nof high-skilled American workers. I would say that the current rate of \nimmigration, legal and illegal--and I believe there is a growing \nconsensus that supports this view--has depressed the wages of low-\nskilled American workers. I would ask the Senator if he would dispute \nthe fact that the immigration bill he introduced would have greatly \nincreased the number of immigrants into the country and wouldn't that \nhave further adversely impacted the wages of low-skilled American \nworkers?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 15 seconds in response. The legislation \nwe have introduced would require that there be a job that an American \nworker has not been interested in and refused to accept. Those are the \njobs individuals would be eligible for under the guest worker program. \nI look forward to continuing this debate with my friend from Alabama.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking, again, my \ncolleague from Massachusetts and others who have fought so long and \nhard over the last decade to have an increase in the minimum wage in \nour country, from the $5.15 that was adopted about a decade ago, to the \nsuggestion today that\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nwe raise it by $2.10. To many, $2.10 is nothing more than a cup of \ncoffee at a high-priced coffee shop today or a few sodas or a sandwich \nalong the way, but it makes a difference, Mr. President.\n  An increase in the minimum wage of $2.10, after nearly a decade, will \nadd some $4,400 to the incomes of people who are depending upon the \nminimum wage to provide for themselves and their families. Remember \nwhom we are talking about. The overwhelming majority of minimum wage \nworkers are not teenagers, but are adults--working people trying to \nraise families, 60 percent of whom are women, many of whom are raising \nchildren on their own. So this $2.10 increase after nearly a decade, an \nadditional $4,400 per year, means a great deal.\n  We are told by those who do the math on all of this that the increase \ncould buy as much as 15 months of groceries for that families, 8 months \nof rent, 20 months of childcare--an issue that I worked with our \ncolleague on many years ago--the importance of having a decent \nchildcare program. As you are saying to these people, you have to stay \nat work and you have young children, where do the children go? The \naverage cost of childcare rises all the time for people in this \ncountry. How do you expect someone making a minimum wage of $5.15 per \nhour who has two or three young children to keep them in a safe place \nwith that kind of an income level? That $4,400 would be a tremendous \nhelp at that income level. That is the kind of difference we are \ntalking about.\n  A group called America's Second Harvest has recently reported that \nthey provide emergency hunger relief services to more than 25.3 million \nlow-income people in the United States each year. That is an 18-percent \nincrease since 1997. No other organization in our country does as much \non a national level as Second Harvest does.\n  The numbers are quite clear. Over the last 4 or 5 years, we have \nwatched an increase in children living in poverty in the United States \nclimb by 1.4 million. What we are talking about is some 13 million \nchildren today who are living in poverty. Of the 37 million in our \ncountry, 13 million children who, through no fault of their own, \nthrough the accident of birth, are born into difficult circumstances. \nThose poverty numbers are going up. They are not going down.\n  What do we do about these children? How do we guarantee this child \nwill get a good education? How do you learn anything in a school today \nif you are going to that school hungry? Talk to any grade school \nteacher in America in any community you wish and ask them the simple \nquestion: What is the difference between a child who has a decent meal \nin the morning and one who doesn't, in terms of their ability to learn, \nand they will tell you categorically that a child who is hungry doesn't \nlearn.\n  We talk all the time about making sure America is going to be strong \nand vital and economically competitive in the global marketplace of the \n21st century. If we continue increasing child poverty at the rate it is \nincreasing now, this country will have a very difficult time, in my \nview, of meeting the competitive challenges it will face in this \ncentury.\n  So this proposal does make a difference--a huge difference--in the \nlives of people who struggle every day, good Americans out there who \nare trying to keep their families together. How does anyone expect a \nfamily today, particularly a family with two or three children, to live \non a full-time salary of $10,700 a year? That is what you get with \n$5.15--$10,700 per year. I don't know of anyone who believes that you \ncan meet your obligations of housing and food, of medical care you may \nneed. You have to make terrible choices at that level.\n  I am not suggesting that $7.25 is going to solve all of those \nproblems. But the cost of living has gone up. Everyone knows that. What \nhas happened to gasoline prices and energy prices over the last number \nof months?\n  We have increased our salaries as Members of Congress by over $31,000 \nsince 1997. Again, I have supported a number of those increases. How do \nwe look in the mirror and say: A $31,000 increase for a Senator, a \nCongressman. Yet we can't provide a $2.10 per hour increase for someone \nmaking the minimum wage? How do we answer that question? We know the \ncost of living has gone up. We see it every single day. Minimum wage \nworkers see it in a more painful way.\n  So I hope my colleagues, in the next 45 minutes when we have a chance \nto vote on this issue, vote for the Kennedy amendment. Raise the \nminimum wage that $2.10 and give these people a chance. Let's bring \nthese poverty numbers down. All of us, regardless of party, ideology or \nanything else, ought to be committed to see to it in the United States \nof America that child poverty doesn't go up, it goes down. These are \ninnocents. They didn't do anything except be born into a circumstance \nnot of their choosing. We owe them and we owe the future of this \ncountry a lot better than they are getting. After one long decade of \nincreasing prices, $2.10 is very little to ask. Democrats and \nRepublicans ought to be able to come together around that request.\n\n  I hope that we can make that kind of difference. My colleague from \nMassachusetts and others want to be heard on this issue. I have great \nrespect for my colleague from Wyoming who chairs our committee and does \na terrific job, and we work together on many issues. But my hope is we \naccept the Kennedy amendment.\n  I didn't go into the problems of the alternative proposal, but it \nwould mean that millions of children will get a lot less than they will \nif you adopt the Kennedy proposal of $2.10. This is a time when we \nought to be doing what we can to strengthen those in our country who \nneed some help now. That is all we are asking.\n  I have some 350,000 people in my State who show up at food shelters \nto get some assistance. That is in the most affluent State of the \ncountry on a per-capita basis, and even the State of Connecticut faces \ndifficulties on this issue.\n  I know my colleagues from less affluent States see the problem in a \nfar more dramatic way. It is not lost on me that States that have the \nlowest minimum wage at the State level have the highest levels of child \npoverty. With all the money we spend here, this is little to ask.\n  Small business is interested. A poll conducted among small businesses \nfound that 86 percent of small businesses responded that an increase \nlike this in the minimum wage is acceptable to them. In fact, studies \nin other countries have pointed out that their economies have not been \nadversely affected by this.\n  If small businesses said an increase is warranted, we as Members of \nthe Congress ought not be holding back. If people who pay this wage \nbelieve it is the right thing to do, Members of Congress ought to join \nwith them.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment--$2.10 to make \nlife a little easier for people out there struggling every day to make \nends meet. This is the United States of America. These children deserve \nbetter. Their families deserve at least an opportunity to get out from \nunder the tremendous burdens they are facing every day. I urge adoption \nof the amendment when the vote occurs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his proposal which I think is a \nvery thoughtful and effective way of addressing many issues, which \nespecially single women in the workplace, especially single moms in the \nworkplace have today. These are issues which are not addressed by the \nKennedy amendment.\n  Whether it is $1.10 or $2.05, that is an important debate because it \nwill have an important effect on how many jobs are created, and the \nimpact on job creation and jobs is what we are talking about here. If \nyou start losing jobs because you raise the minimum wage too quickly, \nso fast that small employers can't afford it, that is going to have an \neffect on people's opportunity to work.\n  I think the Senator from Wyoming has put forth a much more balanced \napproach as to what number the minimum wage should be raised by, but \nthat is not what is going to make the workplace a more tolerable event \nand a\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\nmore acceptable event for the single mother who has kids at home. What \nwould help a lot in this area is additional language in the Enzi \nproposal which is called ``family time.'' It is resisted aggressively \nby the other side of the aisle, and I don't understand it.\n  We just heard an impassioned plea from the Senator from Connecticut \nabout working moms, single mothers--especially single mothers in low-\npaying jobs who have a very difficult time maintaining the quality of \ntheir household and taking care of their kids. Yet they resist a \nproposal which all Federal employees have had the right to since 1978, \nwhich is called ``family time.'' They stiff-arm the working mother in \nthis country.\n  This may have been acceptable because the unions demanded that they \ndo this back in the 1950s and 1960s, when there were not that many \nsingle mothers working in the workplace. But today there is a huge \nparticipation in the workplace from single mothers. Back in 1940, only \n28 percent of the workplace were women. Today, 60 percent of the \nworkplace are women. You have almost 7.3 million single mothers in the \nworkplace, raising a family and trying to take care of their kids' \nneeds at home. The Enzi proposal says to those mothers, if you want to, \nyou can work out an agreement with an employer--the employer can't \ndemand that you do it, it is entirely up to you to sign on to that \nagreement; it is at your discretion; you can't be compelled to \nparticipate in this--where 1 week you can work up to 10 extra hours and \nthe next week you work 10 less hours.\n  Why is that important, especially to a single mother? Because they \nmay have a child who is going to have to have some sort of operation, \nthey may have a child who has some sporting event that goes on for a \nperiod of days, or has a rehearsal, or just a period in their life \nwhere that child needs their mother at home for a greater period of \ntime. This doesn't just apply to single mothers, it applies to working \nfamilies, husbands and wives, but it is a really important right a \nsingle mother should have in the workplace. It is so important, in \nfact, that we gave it to Federal employees back in 1978. Yet year in \nand year out the concept of family time has been resisted by the other \nside of the aisle.\n  They come forward with these statements of compassion, which are very \ncompelling and which are well delivered--especially by the Senator from \nConnecticut for whom I have great regard--but if they truly believed in \nthat they would have incorporated in their bill the flextime proposal \nwhich Senator Enzi has put in his proposal. That is where real \ncompassion is. That is going to affect a lot of people. Literally \nmillions of working parents will be positively impacted if the Enzi \nbill passes.\n  Sure, the minimum wage is important. But there are a lot more people \nwho are going to be affected by the family time language in this bill \nand improve their quality of life and their ability to raise their \nchildren well than by the increase in the minimum wage. The family time \nwill apply to everybody who works in the workplace, especially--well, \neverybody who works on a fixed, 40-hour week.\n  If you want to look at the essence of what will really help an \nAmerican family, and especially an American family with a single \nbreadwinner in it--not a single breadwinner but a single person \nworking, single mother specifically--if you want to look at what will \nreally help that family, you have to look at the Enzi bill and the \nfamily time language.\n  Let me again explain what it does. It says, over a 2-week period, at \nthe discretion of the working mother or the working father--or if they \nare both working, if they are together and they are both working--they \ncan reach an agreement with their employer which says, 1 week I can \nwork an extra 10 hours and, in exchange, the next week--or up to an \nextra 10 hours--I can work less 10 hours.\n  The impact of that is just huge on a family. It is not necessary they \ndo it. They can continue their 40-hour week if they wish. But there are \na lot of events that occur in the raising of children where you do need \nthose extra hours to be at home, where you do need those extra hours to \ntake your child on something that is really important to them--a trip \nor an event that maybe involves a number of days, a 3-day basketball \ntournament or a 3-day recital event, or maybe just a situation where \nyou need that extra day to be at home and make sure your children have \nyou there.\n  This opportunity, this benefit which we make available to all Federal \nemployees, should clearly be available to people who are not in the \nFederal Government. Senator Enzi has, in a very reasonable way, put \nthis language in his bill. I actually think this is much more important \nthan the issue of this fight between the $1.10 and the $2 or $2.05 or \nwhatever, because it is going to impact so many more people. Just on \nthis issue alone you should vote for the Enzi bill because if you \nreally want to improve the quality of the workplace, especially for the \nsingle mother, this bill will do it through the family time language he \nhas put in here.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for bringing this package \nforward. I think this package, just because this language is in there, \nis dramatically better, dramatically more compassionate. We hear a lot \nof language about compassion. It is dramatically more attentive to the \nneeds of children in this country and proper parenting of children in \nthis country than the package that has been brought forward from the \nother side. Why don't we include this on the other side? We know why \nthey don't: Because labor unions are against it. It is a knee-jerk \nreaction on the part of organized big labor to this language. But we \nshould not allow that sort of knee-jerk reaction to control our ability \nto give working mothers and families the opportunity to have this sort \nof benefit, which will clearly improve the ability of those people to \ntake care of their children and to raise their children and to be good \nparents and do what they want to do, in order to make sure they are \navailable when their kids need them.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming. I think he has put together \nan excellent package. I hope everyone will support it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator has 16 minutes and 14 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  I listened very carefully to the Senator from New Hampshire talk \nabout flextime. Flextime is something that those of us on this side of \nthe aisle support. But that is not what is in the bill. That is not \nwhat is in the bill. The Federal Government has what they call core \ntime--core agency hours. That means that they have to work from 11 to 2 \nor 11 to 3, and then the other hours they can make the judgment whether \nthey want to use that, in terms of flextime. That is the kind of \nproposal that makes some sense. That is what we would support. But that \nis not in this legislation.\n  The person who decides whether Mrs. Smith is going to get the time \noff to go to see her child's play or to see the ballgame is going to be \nthe employer--period. Make no mistake about it. That is the way it is \nwritten here on page 4 of their legislation. If we are talking about \nproviding a degree of flextime--we have been through this; we \nunderstand what it is--flextime is not the time that is allocated just \nby the employer when the employer makes the sole judgment and decision, \nas they do under the Enzi proposal--No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator from New Hampshire says, let's let that person \nwork 50 hours a week this week and maybe 30 hours a week the next week. \nHere it is on page 4, which says:\n\n     in which more than 40 hours of the work requirement may occur \n     in a week of the period, except that no more than 10 hours \n     may be shifted between the 2 weeks involved.\n\n  That means you can work 50 hours 1 week and 30 hours at the present \ntime. What is the current law? The current law is, if you work 50 hours \n1 week and then 30 hours the second week, you get the overtime for the \n10 hours here. Do you think that is in the Enzi proposal? No. It is not \nthere. They have eliminated it. You work the extra hours and you don't \nget the extra pay. Some deal--some deal for someone. That is called \nflextime. If you can sell that, you can sell the Brooklyn Bridge.\n  This is what you are doing. Instead of giving the person the \novertime, as has\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\ngone on under the Federal Labor Standards Act, that has been \neliminated.\n  There is something else that the women of the country who are \nconcerned about equal pay for equal work ought to understand. In the \nlegislation under the Enzi amendment, because of the fact that you \nraise the exemption for companies that will be covered from $500,000 to \n$1 million, and because you eliminate the Federal Labor Standards Act \nprotection for those who are involved in interstate commerce--that is \nall spelled out on page 13--that means 10 million workers will not have \nthe protections of the minimum wage or the Federal Labor Standards Act, \nwhich means that the equal pay for equal work protections that are \nthere for 4 to 5 million women will not be there.\n\n  Does America understand the difficulty we have had in this Chamber \ntrying to get equal pay for equal work, let alone equal pay for \ncomparable work? We have been able to get it under the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, and that is being eliminated for 4 to 5 million women.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator has spent a lot of time on this issue over the \nyears. We have modified the Fair Labor Standards Act several times over \nthe last 40 years. In each of those cases, as I recall, we modified the \nlaw to expand the number of people who would be covered by the minimum \nwage and the overtime pay and equal pay for equal work. This would be \nthe first time, as I understand it, that we would be taking the \nopposite direction; the very first time that we are going to shrink the \nnumber of people who would have the right to overtime pay, thus, \nexcluding some 10 million people who would otherwise be covered by the \nminimum wage.\n  Am I correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  For those who are even thinking about voting for the Enzi proposal, \nyou are eliminating the protections, and you are getting the serious \ncutbacks. That is why the $1.10 increase would impact 1.8 million. Ours \nwould be 6.6 million directly and 8 million on top of that.\n  The Senator makes a very good point.\n  This is not a base increase for the minimum wage.\n  This would be gutting the minimum wage protections for millions of \nAmericans.\n  That is a fine ``how do you do.''\n  Mr. DODD. Every time we have modified the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nwe were expanding the opportunity for workers. I believe this would be \nthe first time in the history of our country that we actually go in the \nopposite direction. Those in poverty would be excluded from getting the \novertime pay and protections for equal pay for equal work.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator stated it correctly. We are having a \ndiscussion and debate about the fact that we haven't increased the \nminimum wage in 9 years.\n  As the Senator pointed out and as I have pointed out, we have had \nthis explosion of poverty with children, an explosion of poverty with \nminimum wage workers, and an explosion of hunger. What we do have as an \nalternative is an increase in reduction of protection, unlike the \nhistorical debate for an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and my colleague, the able Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue before us. The \nlast time the minimum wage was raised was in September of 1997. If we \nfail to increase the minimum wage before the end of the year, we will \nhave gone the longest time without adjusting it since it was first \nenacted in 1938. That is a dismal performance on the part of the \nCongress.\n  Since 1997, inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of \nthe minimum wage. It is now the lowest it has been in more than 40 \nyears. To match the last increase, in terms of purchasing power, the \nminimum wage would have to be increased 25 percent above what it is \nnow. And as we fail to act, the purchasing power of the current minimum \nwage continues to be eroded by the steady march of inflation--\ncontributing to two serious problems in our society, rising poverty and \nincreased inequality.\n  Thirty years ago, a worker paid the minimum wage who worked 40 hours \na week for 52 weeks made enough to keep a family of three out of \npoverty. Now that worker is 35 percent below the poverty level.\n  People at the bottom of the wage scale have been falling further and \nfurther behind the rest of the workforce. In the 1950s and 1960s, the \nminimum wage averaged about 50 percent of the average wage. Today, at \n$5.15 an hour, the current minimum wage is only 31 percent of the \naverage hourly wage. If we fail to act, minimum wage earners will \ncontinue to fall further behind.\n  Nearly 15 million Americans would benefit from raising the minimum \nwage to $7.25 an hour. 6.6 million would benefit directly because they \nmake less than $7.25 an hour. Based on past experience with minimum \nwage hikes, another 8 million who make a little more than $7.25 an hour \nshould enjoy a wage increase as well.\n  There are those who say only teenagers benefit from an increase in \nthe minimum wage. However, eighty percent of the workers who would \nbenefit from raising the minimum wage--12 million of those 15 million \nworkers--are adults.\n  As Congress fails to act, States are raising the minimum wage \nthemselves. My own State did that last January. And various studies \nindicate that job growth has been faster in the States that have raised \nthe minimum wage than in those that have not raised the minimum wage. \nEconomic studies by leading economists found that increases such as the \nproposed minimum wage hike would not reduce employment, which is an \nargument that is made against this amendment.\n  A hike in the minimum wage, in fact, has been found to reduce \nturnover of employees which has several advantages. You get a more \nexperienced and productive workforce, lower costs for recruiting new \nworkers, and lower costs for training new workers.\n  In fact, a letter in support of raising the minimum wage was signed \nby over 500 economists, including four Nobel laureate winners.\n  Last week, the House Appropriations Committee accepted an amendment \noffered in the committee by my able colleague, Congressman Hoyer, to \nraise the minimum wage to $7.25. It was accepted by the committee on a \nbipartisan basis. The bill had been scheduled to come to the House \nfloor this week, but it has been pulled from consideration. News \nreports suggest--I hope wrongly--that the House leadership wants to \navoid a debate on the minimum wage until after the November elections.\n  Mr. President, we should pass the Kennedy amendment to raise the \nminimum wage. It will lower poverty, reduce inequality, and provide \nvital income gains to 15 million workers and their families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I \nappreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate one more time. \nI want to make a couple of points as clearly as I can.\n  First of all, the debate we have heard this morning is a classic \ndebate about two very different philosophies--one that believes in the \nmarketplace, the competitive system we have in the United States of \nAmerica of competition and entrepreneurship, and the second is the \nargument that says Government knows better in the top-down mandates \nwork.\n  In 1970, Republicans tried wage and price controls to control \ninflation. They worked miserably. Democrats have tried, time and again, \nfor wage controls, and they failed to have the intended consequences. \nThey have because you are interjecting yourself into\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\nthe marketplace but only in one segment.\n  Second, the Senator from Massachusetts yesterday held up Europe as an \nexample of how higher minimum wages work.\n  I have just returned from two of those European countries--Germany \nand France.\n  I would like to make the clear point as to why the Senator from \nWyoming is right and, with all due respect, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is wrong.\n  High minimum wage laws in the countries of France and Germany have \ncaused the following:\n  France's unemployment is 10 percent more, or two times that of the \nUnited States of America. Unemployment for youth in France is over 20 \npercent.\n  We have seen on the nightly news--and I saw firsthand when I was \nthere--the tremendous economic problems the Government of France is \nhaving in driving its own economy. And it has declared itself its own \nworst enemy but could not get concessions to pull back some of these \nmandates. Therefore, the French economy is growing at 1.6 percent a \nyear this year, a rate less than half that of the United States, with a \nminimum wage rate that is compounded over that of the United States.\n  Our great trading partner and great friend, Germany, has an \nunemployment rate of 11 percent.\n  Those are the two countries that were cited yesterday as the example \nas to why the higher minimum wage works.\n  In fact, they are an example of it not working.\n  Second, with regard to State minimum wages going up, that is \nprecisely where our Constitution, our country, and our Founding Fathers \nbelieved these decisions should be made; that is, at the State level.\n  In fact, the Senator from Connecticut talked about raising the \nFederal minimum wage to a level less than the minimum wage in the State \nof Connecticut today and much less than what it goes to next year. It \nis right for the States to control those minimum wages.\n  Lastly, I have heard three times about the survey of small businesses \nwhere 86 percent say this is not an issue that is being quoted as a \nreason why we shouldn't even be debating this.\n  I ran a small business. I understand small business. The reason it \nwasn't an issue for 86 percent of them is mostly because people pay \nmore than the Federal minimum wage anyway.\n  That is the name of the game in this country--for the marketplace to \ndictate.\n  But go find out who those 14 percent are. I will tell you. They are \nthe people affected by the unintended consequence of a raise in the \nminimum wage. The 68 percent are either independent contractors or \nhigher skilled workers, where the Federal minimum wage rate is not in \neffect in the first place. But those 14 percent are in the tourism \nindustry, in the construction industry, in the maintenance industry, in \nthe short-order cook industry or in the fast food industry. They are \nthe ones who are getting their foot on the ladder.\n  Go interview those 14 percent, and you will find that the economic \nstudy I quoted yesterday is, in fact, correct. Every increase in the \nminimum wage will cost some of them their jobs.\n  In our free enterprise system, there are three components to the \nprice of a product. One is the cost of goods, the second one is the \ncost to sell the goods, and third is the profit. If you raise the cost \nof goods sold, which you do by raising the wage rate, you either have \nto lower the marketing, lower your profits or increase your \nproductivity.\n  What will every business do? First, they will increase their \nproductivity. They will try to ask more of their workers so the \nmandated increase in their wages is neutralized by employing less \npeople.\n  I commend the Senator from Wyoming on his legislation. It is a 21st \ncentury approach to the American workforce and the free enterprise \nsystem. And I respectfully oppose the proposal of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I have listened patiently through 4 hours yesterday and quite a bit \nof time this morning. There are some things that need to be said.\n  I appreciate the comments from our side of the aisle and from \neverybody who has gone before me. I particularly appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator from Georgia because some of those things have \nbeen grating on us a little bit as we have listened to what has been \nsaid. We have seen the charts which show that small businesses in this \ncountry are in favor of that kind of a tax increase.\n  I spoke to the Federation of Independent Businesses yesterday \nmorning. They do the most complete job of surveying their members than \nany association that I know of. They do not back anything unless there \nis a strong consensus by their members.\n  They are opposed, by their vote, to the minimum wage increase that \nSenator Kennedy is suggesting.\n  I do not know where they find that 86 percent. But I have seen \nsurveys before that are able to manufacture the kinds of numbers that \npeople want to have.\n  From the manufacturing members, I suggest that it sounds reasonable \nto people.\n  I saw a chart over here last night that showed the average CEO in \nAmerica is making $11.8 million compared to what a minimum wage person \nis making.\n  That is an average CEO. What do you suppose the good ones are making? \nEleven million eight hundred thousand dollars a year for the average \nCEO in this country? I think that must be the average CEO in the top \n100 companies in the world. But that is apples and oranges when you are \ntalking about the minimum wage.\n  We have heard some pretty big numbers about how many people are in \npoverty and under the minimum wage.\n  The purpose is to take the 1.9 million people who are at the minimum \nwage and get them higher wages. We all agree on that. What we don't \nagree on is how to do that.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts earlier today said minimum wage jobs \ndon't get you out of poverty; that they keep you in poverty.\n  That was his quote this morning. I absolutely agree with that. What \nwe need to do is get higher skills in this country. We need to reduce \nthe number of dropouts in this country. It is dropouts who are working \nat the minimum wage. It is people who have made some choices that put \nthem in a position where they have to take the lower paying jobs. We \nneed to change that.\n\n  When I first came to Washington, welfare reform was going into \neffect. The newspapers were full of stories that on the day that went \ninto effect, people were going to drop through the cracks. It was going \nto be this tragedy for American people. After it happened, there were \nnot many stories on that. That is because the tragedies did not happen. \nPeople improved their lot in life with jobs.\n  I happened to be in an ice cream shop where they shared the tables \nfairly closely. This was fine, but it made it impossible for me not to \nhear the conversation at the table abutted up to my table. It was a \nwoman and her husband talking to a sister who had a child with her. She \nwas talking about the change that welfare reform had made in her life \nbecause she had gotten some additional training, she had gotten a good \njob, and she was so pleased with her job she was going to shift some \nhours so she could be at work when her sister was in training. She \nwould take care of that child who was sitting there so her sister could \nhave the same kind of benefit she had.\n  That is the way we change America. We get people better jobs. We take \ncare of things so people can get better training.\n  Better training reminds me of the Workforce Investment Act. I have \nbeen trying to get the Workforce Investment Act through this process \nfor 3 years now. That is a bill that would train 900,000 people a year \nto higher paying jobs. That is what we want, higher paying jobs. Do you \nthink we have been able to get it through the process? No. For 2 years \nwe were not able to get a conference committee. Now we are being \nblocked from having it brought to the Senate for debate. That would \nsolve a lot of the problems.\n  We talk about the difference in wages between men and women. We had a \ngreat hearing in our Committee on\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. I liked one of the people whom \nSenator Kennedy selected to give testimony, a lady from New York City. \nShe was talking about the value of taking nontraditional jobs. She \nhappened to be a stone mason, a person who works with bricks, rock, and \nmarble. She makes things beautiful. She started with basic \nconstruction, and she worked her way up to where she was hanging marble \non skyscrapers. She shared with us the progression in pay she had \ngotten. She is making more than I am. She made that progression rather \nrapidly, but she had to take a job that was nontraditional for women. \nShe wears a hard hat and safety toes and goes up skyscrapers. You do \nnot necessarily have to do that to make more money.\n  I always point out in Wyoming we have a shortage of people to work. \nThat shortage is providing power for this country. Over a third of the \ncoal that is mined in this country is mined in Campbell County, WY, \nwhich is where Gillette is. That is where I am from. Their problem now \nis getting people to drive haul trucks. They are big trucks. Two of \nthem would not fit in this Chamber. They would be as high as the \nceiling. They are big equipment. They have power steering, power \nbrakes, enclosed cabs with air conditioning. They drive almost like a \ncar. If a person can drive and pass a drug test, they can start at \n$60,000 a year and get the training to work on that truck. That is way \nabove minimum wage, folks. That is $60,000 a year. If they want to put \nin some overtime--they would not be allowed flextime at the present \ntime--they can make more than that.\n  We need to have people look at some of the nontraditional jobs and \nlook at some of the other areas of the country. If they are in an area \nwith a lot of people and not many jobs, they will have lower paying \njobs. We need to get more job training. We need to have the people be \nwhere the good-paying jobs are. They would find pretty good quality of \nlife, too.\n  I need to correct a couple of other things. First of all, we make \nsome of these charts sound as if everyone working at minimum wage is a \nsingle mom with lots of kids. That does not fit with the statistics. \nThere are 1.9 million people at the minimum wage. Fully 85 percent of \nthe minimum wage earners live with their parents--I would think most of \nthe parents hope that means they are teenagers--or they have a working \nspouse or are living alone without children. So 41 percent live with a \nparent or relative, 23 percent are single or are the sole breadwinner \nin a household with no children, and 21 percent live with another wage \nearner. A lot of those are teenagers. Yes, they are in poverty if that \nis all they are making.\n  I have had some minimum wage jobs. I don't know how many in this \nChamber have had minimum wage jobs. I worked in the summers and while I \nwas going to college, even when I was considerably younger than that. \nOne of the things I discovered was if I was interested in what I was \ndoing and I learned as much as I could about it, I was not at the \nminimum wage very long. I got a promotion. I got more pay. But of \ncourse the reason I got more pay is because I was able to do more \nthings. I was more skilled. Minimum wage equals minimum skills.\n  McDonald's takes a real rap for starting people at minimum wage, and \nI have a friend named Jack Preiss who owns several McDonald's. He \npointed out to me he has three of his employees who started at minimum \nwage who now own 20 McDonald's.\n  That is the way we want America to work. We do not want minimum wage \njobs that don't get you out of poverty. They keep you in poverty. Yes, \nwe want higher skills, better jobs, and the opportunity for people to \nhave higher wages. If people are locked into the fact they are going to \nhave a minimum wage job their whole life, they are going to have a \nminimum wage job their whole life. But there are options. There are \nopportunities out there. And there could be more if we could do the \nWorkforce Investment Act.\n  Flextime is one of six provisions in this bill that make a difference \nto small business.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senator \nKennedy's amendment to increase the minimum wage. Not only is it the \nright thing to do for working families, but my State has shown that a \nliving wage is compatible with a growing economy.\n  The facts speak for themselves, and they speak loudly. Let's just \ntake three numbers: 9, 37, and 50.\n  Nine is the number of years since the minimum wage was last \nincreased. This is the longest time the Nation has gone without raising \nthe minimum wage since it was implemented in 1938. The real value of \nthe current minimum wage is already $4 below what it was in 1968.\n  Thirty-seven is the millions of Americans--37 million--who are \ncurrently living in poverty, including 13 million children.\n  Fifty is the percent by which poverty has increased in the past \ngeneration--freezing out an ever larger portion of our working citizens \nfrom the advantages of a higher standard of living that most of us \nenjoy.\n  I believe these numbers are a very strong signal that we are long \npast the time for the Nation, as a whole, to raise the level of the \nFederal minimum wage. I am proud that my home State of Washington has \nthe highest minimum wage in the country, and it is indexed yearly to \nensure that our workers are properly compensated for their hard work.\n  We in Washington State offer direct proof that a living minimum wage \nis compatible with a growing economy. May marked our 34th consecutive \nmonth of job growth. Our unemployment rate, even with the highest \nminimum wage in the country, is essentially at the national average. \nOur poverty rate stands at 11 percent, which is significantly below the \nnational average of 12.5 percent. Our median household income stands at \n$48,000, much higher than the national average of $43,000. Good labor \npolicies make for good labor productivity and a healthy state economy.\n  Ever since the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 1938, opponents \nhave kept raising the same baseless arguments. Even 68 years ago, \nopponents tried to paint a bleak picture of disastrous effects, like \n``factories closed,'' ``industries forced into bankruptcy,'' and \n``people who will be thrown out of employment.'' It wasn't true then. \nIt is not true today. The fact is that this wage provides more economic \nopportunities for people to support their families and contribute to \ntheir communities.\n  Opponents often cite a negative impact on jobs as their prime \nargument to oppose an increase in the minimum wage. This tired argument \nis simply not true. In fact, the 4 years following our last minimum \nwage increase marked the strongest economic growth in three decades, \ncreating almost 12 million new jobs. In contrast, during the past 4 \nyears we have only seen the creation of about 4.7 million new jobs.\n  As elected representatives, it is our job not only to represent the \npeople in our States, but also to stand up for the millions of \nAmericans whose voices cannot be heard. Just since 2000, the number of \nAmericans living in poverty has increased by a stunning 5.4 million \npeople. A minimum wage employee, working 52 weeks a year for 40 hours a \nweek, makes almost $6,000 below the Federal poverty guidelines for a \nfamily of three. At this rate, it will be a long time before we see \nsignificant progress against the scourge of poverty for America's \nfamilies.\n  By raising the minimum wage to $7.25, we can put an extra $4,400 a \nyear into the pockets of these workers, enabling them to better support \ntheir families. This meager amount can make a world of difference to \nthe poor among us. It could mean 19 months of utilities, 15 months of \ngroceries, 8 months of rent or tuition for a community college degree. \nThese are the basics, not the luxuries, of life today.\n  It is important to continually remind ourselves who is going to \nbenefit from an increase. Here are some numbers to help set the record \nstraight. This amendment will benefit nearly 15 million Americans, 80 \npercent of whom are adults, not teenagers trying to earn some extra \nspending money. In fact, more than one-third of these adults are the \nsole source of income for their families. And let's not forget the 7 \nmillion children of those minimum wage workers who will benefit from \nthis increase.\n  This Congress has substantially cut the tax rates for the wealthiest \npeople\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\nin this country, saving them millions of dollars over the last 5 years. \nBut so far, this Congress has been unwilling to spend a few cents more \nto help the poorest of our working citizens.\n  I have carefully considered all aspects of this amendment and have \ncome to the conclusion that we have no acceptable alternative. I see \nthe growth of the job market and the strong economy in my State. I see \nhow we have worked in Washington State to ensure that low-wage workers \nshare in this success. I know that this is what our Nation needs. We \nshould follow the lead of my State and the other 20 that have already \nincreased their minimum wages and allow all Americans to share in these \nbenefits.\n  Overall, this slight increase in the minimum wage would allow a \nsignificant portion of our Nation, people who are working hard and \nplaying by the rules, to have an increased opportunity to share in the \nAmerican dream. They will be able to better support their families and \nwill not have to make unacceptable decisions like whether to buy \ngroceries or pay the rent.\n  If any of my colleagues oppose this amendment, I would like them to \nconsider living on $10,700 a year--and not just living on it, but \nrather, trying to raise a family of 4 on that low income. That would \nmean having about $7 a day per person, not adding in all the bills. Now \njust think about how much you spent on your last meal. If we think of \nthe debate that we are having in these terms, it is clear that raising \nthe minimum wage is the right thing to do.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to \nincrease the minimum wage. Let's show them that we have got our \npriorities straight, and let's finally give low-income workers the \nraise that they are long overdue. It is the right thing to do for \nworkers and the right thing to do for our economy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a very important week in the \nSenate. For much of the week our focus has been on the war in Iraq--a \nnecessary debate that is long overdue. But, today our focus is on a \ndifferent kind of war: the war on poverty.\n  Since President Bush took office, the number of Americans living in \npoverty has increased by 5.4 million, and today 37 million Americans \nlive in poverty, 13 million of whom are children. What is even more \ndisturbing is that over 70 percent of children in poverty live in a \nhome where at least one parent works. So we have a situation in which \ntoday in America, millions of children are living in poverty despite \nthe fact that they are in homes with a working adult. In fact the \nreality is that among full-time, year-round workers, poverty has \nincreased by 50 percent since the late 1970s.\n  This may be surprising, but if you take a minute to look at what is \ngoing on, it is not hard to understand. Consider a single mother of two \nworking a minimum wage job 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year. Without \ntaking any time off for illness or vacation--she earns just $10,700 a \nyear--nearly $6,000 below the Federal poverty line for a family of \nthree.\n  This is an outrage. And it is not how things should be in America. No \nAmerican working a full time job should live below the poverty line. If \nyou work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to make a good \nlife for yourself and be able to get ahead. That is the American dream.\n  Unfortunately, instead of helping people achieve the American dream, \nour leadership in Washington has repeatedly turned its back on them. \nCongress has failed to give minimum wage earners a raise in almost a \ndecade. In fact, the real value of the minimum wage--taking into \naccount the impact of inflation--has dropped. Since 1997 when we last \nraised the minimum wage, the real value of the minimum wage has fallen \nby 20 percent--effectively reversing all the gains made by the last \nincrease. Never before in the history of the minimum wage have we let \nso much time lapse before adjusting the minimum wage.\n  Members of Congress understand the concept of real value. After all, \neven though Congress has failed to increase the minimum wage since \n1997, it has given itself eight annual pay raises. This is \nindefensible. No Member of the House or Senate should have the gumption \nto argue in support of a pay raise for themselves and against a pay \nraise for hardworking Americans.\n  The Congress should follow the lead of the 12 States that have raised \ntheir minimum wages since January 2004. In fact, 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia--representing 45 percent of the U.S. population--\nhave set minimums above the Federal rate of $5.15. The State of \nWashington has the highest minimum wage in the country at $7.63 as of \nJanuary 1, 2006. Oregon's is $7.50. My own State of Massachusetts is \nconsidering a minimum wage of $8.25. And the city of Santa Fe, NM has a \nminimum wage of $9.50.\n  Of course, not all States have taken the minimum wage so seriously. \nThirty-three States have a minimum wage at or even below the Federal \nlevel. That is why we need a Federal minimum wage. The value of an hour \nof the same work should not vary State to State. We have a national \npoverty crisis, and we need a national solution.\n  It is time for Congress to get its priorities straight.\n  America's minimum wage isn't rising, but other basic costs for \nfamilies are. Since President Bush took office, the cost of family \nhealth insurance has risen more than 70 percent, or an average of \n$4,500 per family. Six million more Americans are uninsured because \nthey cannot afford coverage.\n  Since President Bush took office, gas prices have more than doubled. \nIn many places the price of gas exceeds $3.00 per gallon--something \nmany working Americans have to buy just to get to work. In my home \nState of Massachusetts working families have faced gas price increases \nof $1.41 a gallon--a 94 percent increase. Yet rather than rewarding \nwork, the Republican leadership would rather reward oil and gas \ncompanies with sweetheart deals.\n  Since President Bush took office, the cost of a 4-year college \neducation has increased by nearly $8,000, or 57 percent, at public \nuniversities and nearly $21,000, 32 percent, at private universities. \nYet instead of working to ensure that American families can afford to \nsend their kids to college, our Republican leadership is more \ninterested in working to cut $12 billion from college student aid, \nincreasing the costs of loans; and freezing Pell grants for higher \neducation.\n  These are the wrong priorities. Raising the minimum wage is not just \nan economic issue; it is a moral issue. It is a question of values. And \nthis is a values debate I think we need to have. The question is \nwhether we value those who work hard and play by the rules and whether \nwe will fight to ensure they receive a livable wage.\n  Don't be fooled by the side-by-side amendment that my colleague from \nWyoming has introduced. It does not value those who work hard and play \nby the rules. Yes, it increases the minimum wage by $1.10, but it is \nloaded with poison pills that actually decrease the number of people \nwho are eligible for the minimum wage. It cuts overtime pay, and would \ndeny more than 10 million workers the minimum wage, overtime pay, and \nequal pay rights they currently receive. Rather than giving hard-\nworking Americans a step up, it would force many more further into \npoverty. That is hardly the American way.\n  Before I end, I would like to take a moment to dispel a common myth \nabout the minimum wage. Some argue that increasing the minimum wage \nwill hurt small businesses. That is simply not the case. A new study \nfrom the Center for American Progress and Policy Matters in Ohio found \nthat the ``11 States with a minimum wage above the Federal minimum wage \n. . . had higher rates of small business growth between 1997 and \n2003.'' That is right--more growth. Small business employment in those \nStates grew by 9.4 percent while small business employment in States \nwith the Federal minimum wage grew by only 6.6 percent. What this \nreport reveals is that having a higher minimum wage does not impair the \ngrowth of small businesses.\n  This is not new news. In 1999, a Levy Institute survey of small \nbusinesses revealed that more than three-quarters of the firms surveyed \nsaid their employment practices would not be affected by an increase in \nthe minimum wage. In fact, jobless rates fell after the last minimum-\nwage increase.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to give the working people of \nAmerica the respect they deserve. It is time for Congress to give \nworking Americans a pay\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\nraise. It is time for us to get our priorities straight. I am proud to \ncosponsor my colleague, Senator Kennedy's, amendment to increase the \nminimum wage. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in its favor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in support of giving 56,000 \nNevandans a raise by increasing the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 an \nhour.\n  My colleagues have done an excellent job of making the case for this \nraise. My side has pointed out it has been nearly 10 years since the \nminimum wage was last increased. We have communicated that the current \nwage is woefully inadequate, that someone who works full-time and makes \nthe minimum wage lives below the poverty line. We have also talked \nabout how minimum wage workers don't make enough to provide their \nfamilies adequate housing, food, and essentials like clothing. We have \ntalked about all the facts. So what I wish to do now is appeal to the \nSenate's sense of fairness.\n  All of us in the Senate, don't we believe that someone working full \ntime should be able to live a life out of poverty? I believe the answer \nis yes, and I believe that is reason enough for us all to vote yes to \nincreasing this wage. Three times in the last Congress the Republican \nleadership brought down a minimum wage bill rather than have an up-or-\ndown vote. We can't wait any longer. There are only a few weeks left in \nthis Congress, and those 56,000 Nevadans deserve a raise.\n  I know the majority has a proposal to raise the minimum wage by about \na dollar an hour but it is not enough. It doesn't impact nearly enough \nAmericans and won't make a big enough difference. Whereas an increase \nto $7.25 will help over 5 million Americans, the majority amendment \nwill help only 2. Moreover, our amendment will mean an additional \n$4,370 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families. An \nincrease of this size can help offset the cost of high gas prices, not \nto mention the costs of health care, food, and other needs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to pass a graduated increase of \nthe minimum wage to $7.25 per hour.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of efforts to \nincrease the Federal minimum wage and urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of Senator Kennedy's amendment to increase the Federal minimum \nwage to $7.25 an hour over the next 2 years. This much-needed increase \nwould benefit over 7 million Americans directly and approximately 8 \nmillion Americans indirectly. The Federal minimum wage has not been \nincreased in almost 9 years and action by Congress is long overdue. The \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities notes that after adjusting for \ninflation, the value of the minimum wage is at its lowest level since \n1955. As the costs of housing, health care, energy, and education \ncontinue to skyrocket, we must raise the minimum wage to provide \nmillions of hard-working Americans the respect and dignity their work \ndemands.\n  I think it is unconscionable that in the almost 9 years that we have \nnot raised the minimum wage, Congress has voted to increase its own pay \nby $31,600. Most recently, last November we allowed the $3,100 pay \nraise to go through for Members of Congress. People will find it hard \nto understand why Members of Congress received substantial pay raises \nat a time when the real value of the minimum wage has eroded by 20 \npercent since 1997. As my colleagues know, I have long fought against \nautomatic congressional pay increases and will continue to do so. I \nhave introduced legislation that would put an end to automatic cost-of-\nliving adjustments for congressional pay. We have Americans who are \nworking full time, 52 weeks a year and they cannot afford health care, \nhousing, and child care. They don't have the power to automatically \nraise their pay--they are dependent on Congress to raise the Federal \nminimum wage. But instead of working to raise the minimum wage, we in \nCongress have worked to protect our automatic pay raises.\n  Over 20 States and the District of Columbia have responded to \ncongressional inaction and have passed or are in the process of passing \nState minimum wage increases above the Federal level. I am proud to \nreport that my State of Wisconsin is one of these States that have \npassed a minimum wage increase. Last June, Wisconsin raised its minimum \nwage to $5.70 an hour and earlier this month, raised its minimum wage \nagain to $6.50 an hour. The State Department of Workforce Development \nestimates that this modest two-step increase will benefit an estimated \n200,000 low wage workers in Wisconsin.\n  While this increase is a step in the right direction, it is still not \nenough to even ensure that minimum wage employees can pay for \naffordable housing in Wisconsin. The National Low Income Housing \nCoalition estimates that the fair market rent for a two-bedroom \napartment in Wisconsin is $647 a month and calculates that a full-time \nminimum wage employee needs to work 77 hours a week, 52 weeks a year to \nafford a two-bedroom apartment. Mr. President, 77 hours a week is \nalmost the equivalent of two full-time minimum wage workers and the \nnumber of hours of work required to cover the costs of an apartment are \neven higher in States with higher housing costs. It is a disgrace that \nin many cases, minimum wage workers cannot afford adequate housing or \nare forced to pay a huge share of their income to cover housing costs.\n  Housing costs are not the only necessity of life that minimum wage \nworkers have to provide for themselves and their families. They also \nhave to purchase groceries, provide health care, pay for higher \neducation, pay for increasingly expensive gas and electric costs, and \nprovide child care for their children. Some Americans may think that \nthe majority of minimum wage workers are teenagers in the first job; \nthat perception is incorrect. The Economic Policy Institute notes that \nover 70 percent of minimum wage workers are adults and in Wisconsin, \nover 80 percent of minimum wage workers are adults. Moreover, of these \nadult minimum wage workers, over 30 percent are the sole breadwinners \nof their families.\n  More and more of these working Americans find themselves mired in \npoverty or living on the cusp of poverty. Currently, there are 37 \nmillion Americans living in poverty, including 13 million children. \nAmong full-time, year-round workers, poverty has increased by 50 \npercent in the late 1970s. Minimum wage workers who work full time earn \n$10,700 a year, which is almost $6,000 below the Federal poverty \nguidelines for a family of three. No American should work full-time, \nyear-round and still live in poverty. This modest increase in the \nFederal minimum wage will not eliminate poverty, but it will provide \nhard-working Americans with a much-needed increase in their wages. This \nincrease would provide more money for workers to purchase prescription \ndrugs, to pay utilities and rent, to provide child care for their \nchildren, and to invest in higher education opportunities. This \nincrease is needed because the majority of the poor people in our \ncountry are working and are holding down low-paying jobs with stagnant \nwages that do not allow them to finally break free from poverty.\n  Opponents of this amendment argue that it hurts the economy and job \ngrowth. In the 4 years after the last minimum wage increase, nearly 12 \nmillion new jobs were created. In the last 4 years, only 4.7 million \njobs have been created and the real value minimum wage continues to \nerode. A 1998 Economic Policy Institute study did not find significant \njob loss associated with the 1997 minimum wage increase. Additionally, \nthe Center on Wisconsin Strategy examined job growth after the June \n2005 increase in Wisconsin's minimum wage and found that Wisconsin had \nan average growth of 30,000 more jobs, not a job loss. History shows \nthat minimum wage increases have not had a negative impact on \nunemployment.\n  I was proud to vote for the 1996-1997 increase bringing the minimum \nwage to its current level of $5.15 an hour and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment by Senator Kennedy to increase the minimum \nwage to $7.25 an hour. When the minimum wage was established in 1938, \nits purpose was to ensure that American workers were fairly compensated \nfor a day's work. But today, the minimum wage isn't living up to that \npromise. Far more work needs to be done to support hard-working \nAmerican families, and Congress can start by increasing the minimum \nwage.\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 38 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Enzi says this debate is grating \non the Republican side of the aisle. Sorry, that is how it is when you \nare on the wrong side of the truth. It is grating to have to hear the \ntruth as Senator Kennedy and others have spoken of.\n  It has been 9 long years since there has been an increase in the \nminimum wage. It is a disgrace. While we see our friends on the other \nside fight for the CEOs of oil companies, in the Committee on Commerce, \nthey would not even swear them in. They are all on that side. When it \ncomes to working families, forget about it.\n  Then Senator Enzi implies this does not have anything to do with \nwomen. Women make up 59 percent of the workers who would be affected as \na result of raising the minimum wage; 1.4 million working mothers would \nbenefit directly, 760,000 single moms would get an immediate raise, and \nover 3 million kids have parents who would get an immediate raise.\n  What has happened to family values on the other side of the aisle? It \nseems to me it is just so many empty words.\n  Then they scare you and say the economy will suffer. All you have to \ndo, again, is look at the facts and look at the truth. In the 4 years \nafter the last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced \nits strongest growth in over three decades. All the talk about how bad \na minimum wage increase is for the economy is not true.\n  I say to my Republican friends, support the Kennedy increase in the \nminimum wage. The truth shall set you free.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 additional minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has said: Let's have an up-or-down \nvote. There are a lot of things around here that we talk about having \nan up-or-down vote on. We have not been able to have up-or-down votes, \nand it is always because there are some other amendments that might \nmake the bill better. Sometimes they are even germane to the bill we \nare talking about.\n  The one we are talking about, the amendment we are putting this on \nnow is Department of Defense. Yes, you can make some arguments about \nhow this is defense related, I guess, but what we would normally do, if \nwe were serious on an issue such as this, is bring it up as a separate \nissue and allow amendments to it. But that is not going to happen \nbecause there are a few things in my bill that the other side of the \naisle would not like to have.\n  One of those is flextime. They show that chart where the person could \nmake 50 hours this one week and get overtime and then make 30 hours in \nthe next week. That is not how the real world works either. They would \nearn 40 hours in one week, which would not be overtime, and 40 hours in \nthe next week, which would not be overtime. That is still the same 80 \nhours. With the agreement of the person asking for the flextime, they \ncould put the 50 hours in one week, the 30 hours in the other week, \nhave the extra day to do whatever they want with their kids.\n  If flextime is a bad idea, why did we let the Federal employees do \nit? The problem in my State is with the person who works for a private \nindustry in Wyoming who is married to someone who works for the Federal \nGovernment because the Federal Government lets them do the flextime \nthat the Senator from Massachusetts says steals overtime. If it stole \novertime, does anyone think our Federal employees would be interested \nin it? No; they have other values.\n  When we did flextime for the Federal Government, Senator Kennedy \nvoted to ensure that the Federal employees would have access to \nflextime, to have the scheduling options necessary to balance work and \nfamily life. Senator Kennedy, along with 11 other Democrats, \ncosponsored the Nickles bill that extended flextime and comp time to \nState and local employees. If it is a bad idea, why would they do it \nfor Federal employees and State and local employees? And why don't we \ndo it for the private employees? The argument is, nasty employers would \nnever let them have the time.\n  That is a terrible rap for business. Small business understands the \nneeds of their people better than big business because they work with \nthem every day, they go to church with them every weekend, they are in \ncivic organizations with them, their kids go to the same schools, and \nthey are the ones who have to deliver the bad news that they are not \ngoing to be allowed to do that flextime, and they cannot afford to do \nit a different way.\n  Sometimes the employees in small business make more than the \nemployers in small business. Those are some of the CEOs whom I am \nworried about, the ones who have to wake up in the middle of the night \nand say, How am I going to make payroll this week? I would like to be \npaying my people more, but I don't know how I am going to pay them at \nall.\n\n  That is a reality in small business. I know small businessmen across \nthe country who are hearing me say that are saying: He's got it. He \nunderstands our problem. What can you do to help us?\n  So we put together some provisions that in a normal situation we \nwould be able to debate one of those at a time and decide on some of \nthem and reject some of them. That is how it ought to work. But it is \nnot just as simple as saying we can get everybody and all the kids out \nof poverty if we were just to raise the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, I have 2 minutes 50 \nseconds left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are going to be two votes, and the \nfirst vote will be on my increase in the minimum wage; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just about 5 minutes from now the \nSenate will have an opportunity to make a judgment as to whether we are \ngoing to offer a helping hand to some 15 million Americans who are at \nthe lower end of the economic ladder who are earning the minimum wage \nand just above.\n  These workers are men and women of dignity. They take pride in their \nwork. They are overwhelmingly women. If you care, this is a women's \nissue, having an increase in the minimum wage. It is a children's issue \nbecause a great majority of the women have children.\n  So many of these mothers look in the eyes of their child, and they \nwonder if they are going to be able to feed that child. They are \nworried whether that child is $80 sick, when they hear that child cry \nin the night because they know they have to pay $80 to go to an \nemergency room.\n  They know they cannot afford a birthday present for their child, to \nbe able to go to a neighbor's house, to be able to enjoy the things \nevery child who is a son or a daughter of a Member of Congress can \nenjoy.\n  That is what is happening out across America. It is a women's issue, \na children's issue; it is a civil rights issue because so many of those \nworkers are men and women of color. It is a family issue. It is a \nvalues issue. Don't talk to us on the other side of the aisle about \nfamily values. This is it.\n  This is an issue of decency and fairness. Americans understand \ndecency. Americans understand fairness. Americans understand that if \nyou work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, you should not \nlive in poverty. And that is what is happening. Nine years they have \nwaited. Nine years they have waited--but not the Members of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, $30,000 we have increased our salary, and in 9 years \nwe have refused to provide an increase for the men and women who are \nworking on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. That is obscene.\n  We have a right to alter that and change that now when the roll is \ncalled. Let's say that we stand for those workers who are working hard, \ntrying to make a difference for their families, playing by the rules. I \nhear from my friend from Wyoming they should not be on the Defense \nauthorization bill. How many soldiers who are over there fighting in \nIraq, mothers or fathers, might have been earning the minimum wage? \nWhat are they fighting for? They are fighting for American values.\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\n  American values are to treat people fairly and with respect. Increase \nthe minimum wage, and we will have taken a very important step down \nthat road.\n  Mr. President, I understand my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would quote the Senator from Massachusetts \nagain who said: Minimum wage jobs don't get you out of poverty, they \nkeep you in poverty. Until we get a Workforce Investment Act passed \naround here that increases job training for 900,000 people a year so \nthey can get higher-skilled jobs so they can get the jobs of the \nfuture, not the jobs of the past, we are going to have problems with \nthe minimum wage and poverty.\n  We need to be able to give people more choices, not less choices. \nThere is a definite difference in philosophy. We think that free \nenterprise can work and that it is working and that it does work, and \nalso that States rights work. States are changing the minimum wage to \nmatch the economy of their State. Although, if they have really good \njobs, they will attract people, I hope. We are having a little problem \nattracting people to Wyoming, and those are not for the minimum wage \njobs, those are for outstanding jobs.\n  So people need to think a little bit about more training or moving a \nlittle bit to get better jobs and get out of the minimum wage rut that \nwill cause a spiral. As we increase the minimum wage, we also cause an \nupward spiral that eliminates the value of that minimum wage.\n  I ask you to vote against the Kennedy amendment and to vote for my \namendment.\n  Something that has been overlooked is my amendment includes a $1.10 \nincrease in the minimum wage over 18 months.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nJune 13, 2006, to Senator Kennedy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United States Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n           Islands, Office of the Resident Representative to the \n           United States,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2006.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I understand that you have offered an \n     amendment to the Department of Defense bill that would raise \n     the minimum wage in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands (CNMI). While I am a proponent for an increase in our \n     minimum wage as a step in creating opportunities for our \n     young indigenous people to find jobs in the CNMI, I want this \n     done in a rational and democratic manner. I object to the \n     manner in which your amendment was offered, and find it \n     rather arbitrary and capricious.\n       The Northern Marianas joined this great country because of \n     the principles of democracy that are at the heart of almost \n     everything that is done. I will assume that your effort was \n     prompted out of the same frustration that has fueled your \n     colleague Congressman George Miller's desire for a quick fix \n     to a complex problem. I had hoped those days were behind us. \n     It is my desire that we enter into a new era of CNMI/Federal \n     relations, an era which includes open discussion, dialogue, \n     and a shared commitment to reform and to promote sustainable \n     development in the CNMI.\n       You may not be aware that the CNMI's economy is on the \n     verge of collapse. Unemployment is at 14%, the economy is \n     down 23%, and this downward trend is showing no sign of \n     reversing in the near future. An increase in our minimum wage \n     implemented without economic considerations will surely \n     destroy what is left of our fragile economy. I strongly \n     believe that an appropriate increase must be a component in \n     our economic recovery, but done in isolation will insure that \n     recovery is impossible. Please don't take out your \n     frustration with former CNMI and Congressional leaders on the \n     CNMI as a whole. Your amendment may help a few, but will \n     surely further increase unemployment and the number of \n     business failures. Where is the American commitment to \n     compassion and fairness?\n       I invite you to come to the CNMI and hold discussions with \n     employers, employees, and the CNMI Enterprise Group, an NGO \n     formed to promote sane and sustainable economic relief. I ask \n     that you support my request for a sound and responsible study \n     of the CNMI economy, and help us, not punish us.\n       The CNMI is without a Delegate in the House of \n     Representatives. This fact alone prevents us from \n     experiencing the democracy that our people have chosen. The \n     rights of the people of the CNMI are unrepresented in the \n     halls of Congress, and we must rely on members like yourself \n     to see that they are treated with the same respect and \n     integrity that the citizens of your state enjoy. I hope that \n     we have the opportunity to discuss this matter further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pedro A. Tenorio,\n                                          Resident Representative.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSchumer be granted 5 minutes to speak as in morning business, and the 5 \nminutes would come off our time on this side from the Iraq amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I simply wish to acquaint Senators with the fact that \nwe are beginning a 5-hour debate on the Levin amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And within that period of time, speaking for my time, I \nwill manage the time, but I would be anxious to have those colleagues \nwho wish to participate to indicate to me the periods which would be \nmost convenient for them, and I will do my very best to accommodate all \nof the speakers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I would make the same statement on behalf \nof our side, that Senators who do wish to speak in support of my \namendment let us know, and we will try to work in as many as possible. \nThere is a great demand for time, but it would help us a great deal to \nknow who it is who seeks to speak, and we will try to sequence people \nto the best of our ability for the convenience of everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n            Homeland Security Funding Shortages for New York\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues from \nMichigan and Virginia for their graciousness. I am about to speak at a \nhearing that is occurring across the hall in the House on homeland \nsecurity funds.\n  As you know, Madam President, homeland security funds were struck a \ncruel blow against the city and State of New York. Despite the fact \nthat we are the epicenter of terrorism, despite the fact that every day \nthe New York Police and Fire Departments have to go all out to protect \nus, our funding was cut by 40 percent in the city funding and 36 \npercent in New York State funding. It came as a total shock and \nsurprise to all of us, particularly since Secretary Chertoff had \npromised that he was going to rectify the funding inadequacies and \nrestore New York to full funding. He did that for 1 year, but then we \nwent right back to receiving an inadequate amount.\n  Just recently we learned from Mr. Suskind's book that New York \nsubways were targeted with cyanide by al-Qaida. The bottom line is very \nsimple. There are threats against New York regularly, and every week \nand every day the brave police officers and firefighters and others in \nNew York are on vigilance to make sure we are not struck by terror. All \nof a sudden the funding is cut--a slap in the face to this Nation's \npromise for New York.\n  At today's hearing, there is a gentleman who is missing: Secretary \nChertoff. He should be testifying and answering questions, not sending \na subaltern to answer those questions, but he should be there himself \nbecause he made commitments to New York, commitments that have not been \nlived up to by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  There are so many questions about why funding was cut. Just take the \nrationale that they want to fund systems more than they want to fund \npersonnel. First, against cyanide, there are no systems to be funded. \nCyanide can be made easily. We don't have any kind of detector. The \nonly way to guard against the threat that occurred in 2003 is better \ntraining and more personnel on the subways. That is what New York City \ndid.\n  Second, New York did apply for funding in terms of equipment. The so-\ncalled ring of steel, which would have protected downtown, was part of \nNew York's grant. Yet the funding was cut. Secretary Chertoff bounces \nfrom rationale to rationale to rationale as to why our funding was cut, \nbut none of them are satisfactory.\n  Unfortunately, there is terrorism in the world. Unfortunately, New \nYork City has always been, is today, and will continue to be the No. 1 \ntarget of terrorists. And for this Department of Homeland Security and \nthis Government to abdicate its responsibility and not provide New York \nwith the funding that it needs is an absolute disgrace. The funding \ncut, the percentage that we went down is just unpardonable.\n  I am urging Secretary Chertoff to come clean and to testify before \nthe House and the Senate and to answer the questions that New Yorkers \nand all Americans of goodwill have. He is not there today. He should \nbe. But make no mistake about it. As a united delegation, Democrats and \nRepublicans together, we will press the issue to both try and get the \nkind of funding we deserve this year out of other pots of money and \nchange the formula for next year so that this kind of poor treatment of \nthe No. 1 target of terrorists in America--New York--will not continue.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their graciousness, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4320\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4320 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Reed, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Salazar, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n     Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 4320.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4320\n\n  (Purpose: To state the sense of Congress on United States policy on \n                                 Iraq)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1209. UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``United \n     States Policy on Iraq Act of 2006''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Global terrorist networks, including those that \n     attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, continue to \n     threaten the national security of the United States and are \n     recruiting, planning, and developing capabilities to attack \n     the United States and its allies throughout the world.\n       (2) Winning the fight against terrorist networks requires \n     an integrated, comprehensive effort that uses all facets of \n     power of the United States and the members of the \n     international community who value democracy, freedom, and the \n     rule of law.\n       (3) The United States Armed Forces, particularly the Army \n     and Marine Corps, are stretched thin, and many soldiers and \n     Marines have experienced three or more deployments to combat \n     zones.\n       (4) Sectarian violence has surpassed the insurgency and \n     terrorism as the main security threat in Iraq, increasing the \n     prospects of a broader civil war which could draw in Iraq's \n     neighbors.\n       (5) United States and coalition forces have trained and \n     equipped more than 116,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, and \n     airmen, and more than 148,000 Iraqi police, highway patrol, \n     and other Ministry of Interior forces.\n       (6) Of the 102 operational Iraqi Army combat battalions, 69 \n     are either in the lead or operating independently, according \n     to the May 2006 report of the Administration to Congress \n     entitled ``Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq'';\n       (7) Congress expressed its sense in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (119 Stat. 3466) that \n     ``calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq''.\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\n       (8) Iraq's security forces are heavily infiltrated by \n     sectarian militia, which has greatly increased sectarian \n     tensions and impeded the development of effective security \n     services loyal to the Iraq Government.\n       (9) With the approval by the Iraqi Council of \n     Representatives of the ministers of defense, national \n     security, and the interior on June 7, 2006, the entire \n     cabinet of Prime Minister Maliki is now in place.\n       (10) Pursuant to the Iraq Constitution, the Council of \n     Representatives is to appoint a Panel which will have 4 \n     months to recommend changes to the Iraq Constitution.\n       (11) Despite pledges of more than $8,000,000,000 in \n     assistance for Iraq by foreign governments other than the \n     United States at the Madrid International Donors' Conference \n     in October 2003, only $3,500,000,000 of such assistance has \n     been forthcoming.\n       (12) The current open-ended commitment of United States \n     forces in Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis \n     making the political compromises and personnel and resource \n     commitments that are needed for the stability and security of \n     Iraq.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in \n     order to change course from an open-ended commitment and to \n     promote the assumption of security responsibilities by the \n     Iraqis, thus advancing the chances for success in Iraq--\n       (1) the following actions need to be taken to help achieve \n     the broad-based and sustainable political settlement so \n     essential for defeating the insurgency and preventing all-out \n     civil war--\n       (A) there must be a fair sharing of political power and \n     economic resources among all the Iraqi groups so as to invest \n     them in the formation of an Iraqi nation by either amendments \n     to the Iraq Constitution or by legislation or other means, \n     within the timeframe provided for in the Iraq Constitution;\n       (B) the President should convene an international \n     conference so as to more actively involve the international \n     community and Iraq's neighbors, promote a durable political \n     settlement among Iraqis, reduce regional interference in \n     Iraq's internal affairs, encourage more countries to \n     contribute to Iraq's extensive needs, and ensure that pledged \n     funds are forthcoming;\n       (C) the Iraq Government should promptly and decisively \n     disarm the militias and remove those members of the Iraqi \n     security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq Government is in \n     doubt; and\n       (D) the President should--\n       (i) expedite the transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     to a limited presence and mission of training Iraqi security \n     forces, providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces, \n     protecting United States infrastructure and personnel, and \n     participating in targeted counterterrorism activities;\n       (ii) after consultation with the Government of Iraq, begin \n     the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq \n     this year; and\n       (iii) submit to Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with \n     estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \n     United States forces from Iraq, with the understanding that \n     unexpected contingencies may arise;\n       (2) during and after the phased redeployment of United \n     States forces from Iraq, the United States will need to \n     sustain a nonmilitary effort to actively support \n     reconstruction, governance, and a durable political solution \n     in Iraq; and\n       (3) the President should carefully assess the impact that \n     ongoing United States military operations in Iraq are having \n     on the capability of the United States Government to conduct \n     an effective counterterrorism campaign to defeat the broader \n     global terrorist networks that threaten the United States.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the current open-ended commitment of U.S. \nforces in Iraq is unsustainable and counterproductive, contributing as \nmuch to Iraqi instability as it does to Iraqi security.\n  Our troops have performed magnificently in Iraq. We are all deeply \ngrateful for their professionalism and their sacrifices. But, \nultimately, as our military commanders have repeatedly said, stability \nin Iraq can only come through a political settlement by the Iraqis, and \nthe best way to bring about that political settlement is to make it \nclear, in words not yet spoken by the administration, that our \ncommitment is not open-ended, and that a phased redeployment of our \nforces from Iraq will begin by the end of this year.\n  The administration's refrain that we are in Iraq as long as the \nIraqis need us is creating a dependency of unlimited duration and gives \nthe Iraqis the impression that their security is more in our hands than \nin theirs.\n  The hallmarks of the administration's open-ended policy are the \nPresident's extraordinarily broad and vague description of our \nmission--nothing less than ``complete victory,'' as he put it, along \nwith the President's explicit commitment to stay until the Iraqis can \n``govern themselves, sustain themselves, and defend themselves.'' The \nPresident's statement that American force levels in Iraq ``will be \ndecided by future Presidents'' reinforced that unlimited commitment, as \ndid Secretary Rice's statement that we will stay in Iraq ``as long as \nwe are needed.''\n  The President of Iraq, Mr. Talabani, reflected the Iraqi perception \nof the administration's policy when he said that U.S. forces are \n``ready to stay as long as we ask them no matter what the period is.'' \nThat is what the President of Iraq says he understands our policy to \nbe, that U.S. forces are ``ready to stay as long as we,'' the Iraqis, \n``ask them, no matter what the period is.'' We must change that Iraqi \nperception and the open-ended commitment which led to it, and that is \nwhat our amendment would do.\n  Our amendment urges the President to begin the phased redeployment of \nU.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2006--to begin the phased \nredeployment of U.S. troops by the end of 2006. Our amendment also \ncalls for a number of actions to help achieve the broad-based and \nsustainable political settlement so essential for defeating the \ninsurgency and preventing all-out civil war.\n  It calls for adoption by the Iraqis of a fair sharing of political \npower and economic resources among all the Iraqi groups so as to invest \nthem in the formation of an Iraqi Nation. That can be done by amendment \nto the Iraq Constitution or by legislation or other means, but it needs \nto be done within the timeframe provided for in the Iraqi Constitution; \nnamely, 4 months from the beginning of the functioning of their \nparliament.\n  An international conference needs to be convened so as to more \nactively involve the international community and Iraq's neighbors in \npromoting a durable political settlement among Iraqis and by reducing \nregional interference in Iraq's internal affairs. It is also important \nto encourage more countries to contribute to Iraq's extensive needs and \nto ensure that pledged funds are forthcoming.\n  Our amendment also points out that it is critically important for the \nGovernment of Iraq to promptly and decisively disarm the militias and \nremove those members of the Iraqi security forces whose loyalty to the \nIraqi Government is in doubt.\n  Now, what does our amendment urge the President to do relative to our \ntroops in Iraq?\n  First, after consultation with the Government of Iraq, begin a phased \nredeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of this year.\n  Second, submit to Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with estimated \ndates for the continued phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, \nwith the understanding that unexpected contingencies may arise.\n  Third, expedite the transition of U.S. forces in Iraq to a limited \npresence and mission of training, providing logistical support, \nprotecting U.S. infrastructure and personnel, and participating in \ntargeted counterterrorism activities.\n  Our amendment does not establish a fixed ending date for \nredeployment. It doesn't set out fixed milestones once the phased \nredeployment has begun. So while it does not establish a timetable, it \ndoes establish a fixed, but not precipitous, time for the beginning of \na phased redeployment--by the end of this year.\n  Beginning the phased redeployment of American troops in 2006 would \nsend a very clear message to the Iraqis: We have been in Iraq over 3 \nyears. We have lost 2,500 brave Americans and suffered more than seven \ntimes that number of casualties to make it possible for Iraq to become \na free Nation. You, the Iraqis, must now decide whether you want a \ncivil war or a nation.\n  Madam President, sending that message to the Iraqis and ending the \nopen-ended U.S. policy towards Iraq will prod the Iraqis to take the \nnecessary steps to end the dominance of the militias; will reduce the \nIraqi dependence on the U.S. security blanket which deters tough \nchoices by the Iraqis; will change the perception that we are \npermanently occupying Iraq, a perception which plays into the hands of \nterrorists; will reduce the number of U.S. targets for terrorists and \ninsurgents; and will reduce the strain on U.S. forces.\n  Supporters of our amendment are just as determined to maximize \nprospects for success in Iraq as are the opponents of our amendment. We \ndo not accuse opponents of our amendment of wanting failure or of \nadvocating surrender to chaos and terror. We do believe that \nmaintaining the status quo\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nand the open-ended commitment, which is the hallmark of that status quo \nand that open-ended commitment, and adhering to a bumper sticker slogan \nof ``stay the course'' is a recipe for continuing instability and \nfailure.\n  Success isn't assured in any event, but letting the Iraqis know that \nwe are not there for as long as they want us is key to avoiding a \nculture of dependency. The bottom line is that our open-ended policy \nand presence has become a deterrent to the very success that we want to \nbring about. Although the administration policy is aimed at providing \nsecurity, it is a major contributor to instability.\n  The Iraqi leaders themselves have set a 6-month goal for making major \nprogress in assuming their security responsibility. Iraqi Prime \nMinister al-Maliki said on May 22 that his government could take over \nsecurity for 16 of Iraq's 18 provinces by the end of this year.\n  On June 11, the Iraqi National Security Adviser, Mr. Rubaie said:\n\n       I believe by the end of this year the number of the \n     multinational forces will be probably less than 100,000 in \n     this country.\n\n  That amounts to a reduction of at least 30,000 U.S. forces by the end \nof this year. Mr. Rubaie repeated that position in an op-ed in \nyesterday's Washington Post. He, again, is the National Security \nAdviser to the Prime Minister. Our amendment's call for the beginning \nof a phased redeployment by the end of this year fits the very goals \nIraq's leaders have set for themselves.\n  Listen to what Mr. Rubaie wrote about the many benefits of Iraq \nreducing the number of coalition forces. This is benefits to Iraq of \nour reducing the number of coalition forces in Iraq:\n\n       It will remove psychological barriers and the reason that \n     many Iraqis joined the so-called resistance in the first \n     place. The removal of troops will also allow the Iraqi \n     government to engage with some of our neighbors that have to \n     date been at the very least sympathetic to the resistance \n     because of what they call the coalition occupation.\n\n  ``Moreover,'' Mr. Rubaie said:\n\n     the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's \n     government in the eyes of its people . . . the drawdown of \n     foreign troops will strengthen our fledgling government to \n     last the full four years it is supposed to.\n\n  Mr. Rubaie's words are similar to those of General George Casey, the \ncommander of the U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, who told Congress \nlast fall:\n\n       Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of \n     occupation, contributes to the dependency of Iraqi forces on \n     the coalition, extends the time it will take Iraqi security \n     forces to become self-reliant, and exposes more coalition \n     forces to attack at a time when Iraqi security forces are \n     increasingly available and capable.\n\n  That is our commander talking about the disadvantages of having a \nlarge number of troops remain in Iraq.\n  Regardless of one's views on whether it was wise to attack Iraq--and \nI for one thought it was unwise, and so voted--and regardless of one's \nviews on whether the war has been well managed--and I have been \ncritical of the administration's management--all of us want to maximize \nthe chances for success in Iraq. To maximize the chances for success in \nIraq, the Iraqis must take control of their country. Our approach, our \namendment, maximizes the chance for success.\n  Last year, by a bipartisan vote of 79 to 16, the Senate adopted an \namendment stating that:\n\n       [C]alendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty.\n\n  The Senate language remained in the bill and was signed into law. Our \namendment implements that policy direction. The Iraqis are standing up. \nU.S. and coalition forces have trained and equipped more than 250,000 \nIraq security forces. More than two-thirds of Iraq's Army combat \nbattalions are either in the lead or operating independently, according \nto the administration's May 2006 report to Congress. It is now time for \nthe United States to set a date for the beginning--the beginning of a \nstanddown.\n  Last fall, General Casey said that our presence in Iraq ``fuels the \ninsurgency'' and that ``beginning to reduce our presence in Iraq'' as \nconditions warrant would result in ``taking away one of the elements \nthat fuels the insurgency.'' That is our commander speaking. Conditions \nnot only warrant the beginning of a reduction of our presence, \nconditions are such that only a phased, orderly redeployment beginning \nby the end of this year will maximize the chances of succeeding in \nIraq.\n  By making clear that a phased redeployment of our forces from Iraq \nneeds to begin this year, we will send a clear message to the Iraqis \nthat our presence is not an open-ended security blanket and that they \nneed to assume responsibility for their own future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the principal cosponsor, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, a member of our committee, is waiting to speak. I would just \nlike to inquire the following of my colleague.\n  I have found in our many years in this body that the most effective \nmeans to convey a message, the most effective way for the persons \nbeyond this Chamber to follow proceedings on the floor, is often \nthrough a colloquy where we not just read speeches but we begin to \nexchange interpretations of what is before this body by virtue of your \namendment and get the responses.\n  Might I inquire of my colleague of his willingness to permit the \nSenator from Virginia, at such time as the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas completed, to get up and propound questions chargeable to my side \nand responses that you wish to make, to the extent you wish to make \nthem, chargeable to your side? Is that a procedure about which I can be \npersuasive to my colleague, which I find to be a very effective way to \ndeal with this?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, am I responding on the time of the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, you are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am perfectly happy to engage in a colloquy at the \ninstigation of the Senator from Virginia. Indeed, I will probably have \nsome questions which I would want to propound to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  On the other hand, I cannot agree that a colloquy which he instigates \nwould be divided in terms of the time consumption. The usual policy \naround here is the persons who begin a colloquy have that colloquy \ncharged to their time. I have more speakers than I have the time to \nallocate. It would be unfair to them for me to say that the time \nconsumed in my answering the questions of the Senator from Virginia \nwould come off the time for their remarks.\n  I am not only happy to engage in a colloquy, I look forward to it, \nbut I would want to follow the usual procedure, which is that those \npersons who wish to ask questions of somebody have that colloquy taken \nfrom their time rather than from the time of the person of whom they \nare asking the questions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would have to respectfully disagree with \nwhat is usual. Time and time again, Senators get up and allocate \nbetween themselves the question and answer. I have to take it we are \nconfined primarily, I imagine, to the reading of speeches by \nindividuals and limiting the ability to have a colloquy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will allow a comment on that, we are not \nconfined to that at all. I expect, when I ask questions of the Senator \nfrom Virginia or others who oppose this amendment, that their answers \nwould come from my time and not from their time. I would apply the same \nrule to me as I suggest would be applied to the questions of the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has made clear his statement. I yield the \nfloor as a courtesy to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator Levin, and \nSenators Feinstein and Salazar, to offer this amendment. Too often, the \nBush administration deals simply in slogans. We have heard them so \noften, so many times: mission accomplished; stay the course; don't cut \nand run; we will stand down when they stand up; complete victory. But a \nmilitary operation such as this requires much more than slogans. It \nrequires sufficient personnel and adequate equipment. It requires \ncoherent strategic policy, and it requires detailed plans.\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\n  At critical junctures in this effort in Iraq, this administration has \nbeen extraordinarily insufficient in all of this. We had insufficient \npersonnel on the ground with the collapse of the government of Saddam \nHussein. We opened up regions of Iraq so that insurgents could begin to \nform and begin to conduct this attack against their own people and \nagainst our people. Too often we went out to Iraq, visited the country, \nand were confronted by our own soldiers who complained that they didn't \nhave armored humvees and body armor.\n  I believe there has never been a really coherent strategic policy \nhere. We heard the initial defenses of the approach to Iraq as we were \ngoing after weapons of mass destruction. They were not there. We are \ngoing to go after the heart of terrorism, when in fact the terrorists' \nconnection to Saddam Hussein was tangential at most. Then, we are going \nto build an oasis of freedom and transform the Middle East. It is not \nan oasis today in Iraq.\n  Certainly there were not detailed plans. We entered into this \noccupation without sufficient planning, without sufficient resources in \nso many different ways. The faults continue to plague us today. \nInsufficient resources to run detention facilities contributed in a \nsignificant way to Abu Ghraib, and that, as even the President admits, \nhas been an extraordinary blot on our record and inhibits us today in \nour ability to achieve a stable Iraq.\n  There is something else that you need to conduct military operations, \nand that is public support. Today, a majority of Americans would like \nto see a deadline to withdraw our forces from Iraq. They are not \nunpatriotic. They are not without grit and determination. They are \nterribly concerned, and they are looking for leadership.\n  But I believe this leadership comes in not adopting some type of \narbitrary timetable or deadline; it comes from adopting what is the \nmost coherent and realistic policy we can today to stabilize the \ncountry of Iraq, to assist them in this stability, and to begin the \nphased redeployment of our forces from Iraq to begin this year. To \nbegin, not with an arbitrary timetable or deadline, but to begin with \nthe notion that these decisions will be based upon the advice of \nmilitary commanders and based upon the conditions on the ground. But we \nmust begin. We must begin because we have to send a strong signal to \nthe Government of Iraq that they must take their future in their own \nhands, that they must make difficult choices about their constitution, \nabout sharing political power, about eliminating sectarian elements \nfrom their security forces, and a host of other difficult problems. \nThis rests upon the fundamental reality of the situation. Ultimately, \nit will be the Iraqis who stabilize their country and reform their \ncountry. We can help. We have helped. But it is up to them, and it must \nbegin now.\n  Also, this approach which we are proposing recognizes another \nreality. Our military forces, our Army and our Marine Corps, have been \nunder tremendous pressure. They have done a magnificent job. The young \nmen and women who wear the uniform of the United States have performed \nin an extraordinary fashion. But for some of them, it will be their \nthird deployment to Iraq. Others have gone to both Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The wear and tear on these young Americans and their \nfamilies is significant. The wear and tear on our equipment is \nsignificant. There is a $50 billion pricetag just to repair the \nequipment that has accumulated over the last several years in Iraq. So \nwe have to recognize also that our forces need a signal that their \nmission will be coming to a conclusion, not in the next Presidency but, \nbased upon a careful deliberation by the commanders, we hope in the \nnear future.\n  We also have to recognize that our threats are not confined to Iraq \nalone. Today we are all waiting anxiously to see what the North Koreans \nmight do with respect to a scheduled--or at least a tentative launch of \nan intercontinental missile. We are today engaged in serious \nnegotiations with our European colleagues with respect to the situation \nin Iran. We have seen in the last few weeks an Islamic government \ntakeover on the streets of Mogadishu and Somalia. We have seen other \nareas of concern and conflict. Our commitment in Iraq, frankly, \nconstrains our flexibility to deal with all these issues.\n  Senator Levin and I have come forward today with a proposal that we \nbelieve will be an approach that begins a policy that we can achieve, \nthat it is necessary for us to achieve, so we can move forward to begin \nto transition the burden from American military shoulders to those of \nthe Iraqis. It begins with a phased redeployment which we believe \nshould commence this year. Let me hasten to add again: There is no \nspecific timetable. There is no deadline. This is based upon the advice \nof our military officers in the field. This is not cut and run or cut \nand jog or cut and anything else. It is an attempt to articulate a \npolicy based upon the reality of Iraq, the reality of our present \nmilitary forces, and the reality of a world which is engaged in \nconflicts in many different places.\n  In the past weeks, we have seen some progress in Iraq--the \ninstallation of a government, the naming of a Prime Minister of \nInterior, and the naming of a Prime Minister of Defense. We have seen \nthe death of Zarqawi. But still we recognize how turbulent and \nuncertain and how hostile the environment remains for our soldiers and \nthe Iraqi security forces.\n  We have about 127,000 forces there in the last 3 years, or more. We \nhave seen more than 2,500 of these young Americans killed and more than \n18,000 wounded. Their sacrifices have to be respected and honored--not \nsimply with force but with wisdom and with a policy that will work, a \npolicy that is attuned with what is happening in Iraq and around the \nglobe and not a policy based upon bumper stickers that have been \ntrotted out at a moment's notice.\n  We recognize that we have an interest certainly in Iraq in terms of \nsucceeding. And this plan we hope and we believe will be a success. We \nare putting together a plan--more of a policy than a plan--because the \nplanning is the province of the President, as it should be, as \nCommander in Chief. But a policy of redeployment beginning now is the \nright direction. It will require the President to begin to outline \nthose steps. It will also require the Government of Iraq to begin to \ntake responsibility for their own situation. It will require them to \nbegin deliberations for constitutional changes. These changes are \nnecessary to ensure that this is an inclusive Government in Iraq, that \nthe Sunni community feels that they can have a future in the new Iraq.\n  It also recognizes that we have to have a sharing of political power \nin Iraq so that Iraq will succeed.\n  In addition, the Iraqis must address the issue of sectarian militias, \nand the infiltration of security forces by sectarian elements have to \nbe dealt with and dealt with decisively.\n  We also have to recognize that ultimately these decisions will be \nmade and must be made by the Iraqis.\n  In this proposal there is a clear signal to the Iraqis that they must \nmake these decisions beginning now for their future and, we hope, for a \nstable region and a much more stable world.\n  We also understand that we have to bring together the international \ncommunity.\n  Since October of 2002, I have argued that this unilateral approach to \nIraq is not destined for success; that we have to have a multinational \napproach to be successful. We have carried the burden both militarily \nand in many other ways. It is time that the administration engage and \nenergize the regional neighbors and the broader international community \nto help address the issues that are presented to us all throughout the \nworld by Iraq.\n  We understand, on a financial basis, that this is an expensive \nundertaking.\n  Originally, the administration suggested that this would be $50 \nbillion or $60 billion. We understand now that we have already spent \n$320 billion, and the end is not in sight.\n  In a recent study by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize economist, if \nyou added all the costs, all the costs of rehabilitating our equipment \nwhen comes home, all of the cost of veterans' benefits and caring for \nthose who have served so well, the price will reach perhaps $1 \ntrillion, if our commitment extends until 2010.\n  Also, the international community has to do much more. The \ninternational community has pledged $8 billion, and only $3.5 billion \nof that money has been forthcoming. They need to do more, and we need \nto make them do more.\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\n  This approach of going it alone has to end. And part of our amendment \nis to request that we engage in a much more multilateral approach to \nIraq.\n  We have trained 116,000 Iraqi soldiers, sailors, 148,000 Iraqi police \nand highway patrol and other Ministry of Interior forces. There are 102 \noperational Iraqi combat battalions in their Army, and 69 are either in \nthe lead or operating independently.\n  We have made progress. We hope that they are ready, but we think that \nwe have made enough progress to begin our redeployment. Again, the pace \nof that redeployment will be set by our military commanders.\n  As General Casey pointed out:\n\n       As we are able to draw down our forces, we will receive \n     additional benefits. A reduction in American forces will \n     essentially push more Iraqi troops to the front lines. This \n     is about the dependency.\n\n  Those are General Casey's words.\n  As long as we are there to do the heavy lifting, we will do the heavy \nlifting. That is an important point to be made and emphasized again and \nagain.\n  The Government of Iraq was formed. Their National Security Adviser, \nMr. Rubaie, stated this week in an editorial that Iraq's position is \nthat it have full control of the country by the end of 2008, and this \nwill mean a significant foreign troop reduction. We envision U.S. troop \npresence by the year's end to be under 100,000 with the most of \nremaining troops to return home by 2007. The eventual removal of \ncoalition troops will help the Iraqis who now see foreign troops \noccupying rather than as liberators. Moreover, the removal of foreign \ntroops will legitimize the Iraqi Government in the eyes of its people.\n  I do not know if my colleagues will come and accuse the Iraqi \nNational Security Adviser of cutting and running on its own country. \nPerhaps they will, but they will be wrong.\n  That is what a leading figure in the Government of Iraq is \nsuggesting. A phased redeployment beginning this year, hopefully \nconcluding by the end of 2007--but again we will leave that up to our \nmilitary commanders. The benefits will be that the Iraqis will step \nforward, and also this notion of occupiers will be diminished \nsubstantially.\n  From many different perspectives, this is the right policy at the \nright time. I hope that our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will \nembrace this policy.\n  I retain the remainder of any time I have and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I remember so well last year when we debated an \namendment of great importance, and our colleague from Michigan laid \ndown an amendment. Then I took that amendment and rewrote certain \nportions of it. A great majority of the Senate--I can't remember \nexactly how many but a vast majority of the Senate--supported that.\n  I have waited patiently for this amendment. It was given to me \nyesterday. I have studied it ever so carefully. I didn't denounce the \namendment. I said it was a serious amendment. It is a serious \namendment. It deserves serious thought.\n  But, regrettably, there is no way in which I can truthfully say to my \nside of the aisle and others that this amendment can be revised or \nmodified such that we could hope to get what we achieved last year--a \nlarge majority of the Senate supporting the amendment.\n  That is unfortunate because we start out on a basis of where we could \nwell end up today along strong partisan lines. That comes at a time \nwhen our Nation--indeed, the world and, most importantly, the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces--would like to see the Senate and, indeed, \nhopefully, the Congress standing behind them with strong \nbipartisanship. But I fear that it is going to be lost with this \namendment.\n  First, I carefully point out to those who are following this debate \nthat this amendment in effect is nonbinding. It is the sense of the \nSenate, or Congress, as the case may be. But nevertheless it sends \nsignals. It sort of states what this body feels should be done by the \nPresident of the United States as he continues to exercise his \nconstitutional powers--I underline ``constitutional powers.'' He is the \nCommander in Chief, not Members of the Senate--constitutional powers in \ncarrying forward the actions of our Armed Forces, and the actions of \nour Government as we try to support the newly elected unified \nGovernment of Iraq.\n  As the nature of this free advice may be, my burden--and those of us \non this side--is to point out how this can be misconstrued as the \nmessage crosses the ocean and as the Congress is trying to order the \nPresident to do certain things. That is not going to be the case.\n  I have had recently the opportunity to have some private \nconversations with the President of the United States. My gray hair \nindicates that I have been privileged to serve in this institution now \nin my 28th year and before that for a number of years in the Department \nof Defense. I have worked with, I say with a sense of humility, many \nPresidents through many chapters of American history. But I must say I \nhave yet to find any President with a stronger resolve, a stronger \nconviction to do what he believes is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people, employing the forces of our men and women of the Armed \nForces, employing every means this Government has to bring about \nsolutions which he has outlined time and time again in Iraq and, \nindeed, Afghanistan. It is remarkable, unwavering, listening to advice, \ntaking into consideration the views of others but clearly looking into \nthe future, a future that generations long after we are gone will look \nback on this chapter of American history and I believe will decide that \nwe pursued the correct course. Hopefully, those generations will be \nenjoying the measure of freedom that we have today. But that will only \ncome to pass if the Congress of the United States provides this \nPresident the support that he needs.\n  Therefore, it may be in the nature of free advice, but I want to \nclearly indicate to all following that there is much to be done to try \nand explain where I see there is fault in this amendment.\n  Last week, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to establish \nan arbitrary deadline of a timetable for withdrawal of United States \nforces from Iraq. An arbitrary deadline of a timetable would have been \na serious strategic error, and a historic mistake of withdrawing our \nforces prior to the Iraqis being able to defend themselves. It would \nencourage terrorism, embolden al-Qaida, and threaten American security.\n  Regrettably, the various courses of action that spring forth from the \nDemocratic side of this aisle concern me greatly. They may not say it \nis a timetable.\n  It is interesting that in the course of the presentation of this \namendment in the media, I have watched my colleagues from that side of \nthe aisle explain what it is they are going to put before the Senate \ntoday. Time and time again, they keep saying it is not a timetable; it \nis not a timetable.\n  Why must they keep saying that the language is clear, that it is not \na timetable?\n  But let us start with the key paragraph in the amendment of my good \nfriend and long-time colleague.\n  I repeat it. It is on page 6.\n\n       Submit to the Congress a plan by the end of 2006 with \n     estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \n     United States forces from Iraq.\n\n  Folks, I don't mean to demean this, but that is the English language. \nIt reads very clearly. It is a timetable, no matter how many times \npeople protest it is not a timetable. It is the English language \nwritten with clarity.\n  We cannot accept that.\n  Our colleagues today on this side of the aisle will vigorously give \ntheir views as to why we cannot accept that.\n  Foremost in my mind is the loss of our men and women of the Armed \nForces, now 2,500 in number, that have given the ultimate that any \nhuman being, any soldier, any sailor, any marine, any airman can give \nand that of their families.\n  I wonder how these individuals would look at this clause and find any \nother conclusion to draw but that this is a timetable--a timetable that \ncould well cripple the ability of this new government created by the \ncourageous actions of the Iraqi people time and time again in \nelections, after a hard fought political situation, in which emerges, \nhopefully, a strong Prime Minister.\n\n  They are just beginning to take full seizure of the reins of \nsovereignty, something this Nation has not had for\n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\na very long time. As they are seizing those reins, we are asked to \nstand in the Senate and to lay out in writing for all those who want to \ndestabilize this new government the timetable on which we will remove \nour Armed Forces.\n  Of course, there is a collateral question that is not addressed in \nthis amendment. Maybe my colleague will address it. The United States, \nalbeit, is the principal force of military. Great Britain, commensurate \nwith the size of their armed forces and their nation and their \npopulation, has made a very significant contribution, as has Poland, \nand I could enumerate the other nations; modest though they may be, \nthey are there. How are they to respond to this amendment? Are they to \ngo on and pursue the missions they have laid out or are they to devise \na timetable? That is one of the many unanswered questions I find in \nthis amendment. Perhaps my colleagues will be forthcoming.\n  The major events certainly of the last 10 days--the elimination of \nal-Zarqawi, a terrorist without parallel in the contemporary times of \nall mankind, his elimination, the formation of this new government--has \ngiven a momentum forward. It has spawned a measure of hope among the \nIraqi people. It has spawned a measure of hope within our Armed Forces \nthat there is clear proof our many sacrifices to date are beginning to \nproduce concrete, visible results that cannot be challenged.\n  We are moving toward establishing a secure and prosperous nation that \nwill be an inspiration for the entire region of that world, and it is \nhard to think at this time we would take any action in this Senate to \nset back that momentum. The only way we are going to see our troops \ncome home is if they seize that sovereignty, exercise that sovereignty, \nproduce their own security and begin to reestablish their \ninfrastructure.\n  I do not see this amendment in any way helping. I see this amendment \nas impeding the progress.\n  Give this new government a timetable. I ask my colleague, give them a \ntimetable if you have to give a timetable to establish their goals, \nseize the reins of sovereignty. Do not broadcast through this amendment \na timetable with regard to our forces.\n  We all know there have been some very difficult days, tragic hours, \nthe most recent of which is the loss of our two brave soldiers seized, \nand although not fully confirmed, certainly the probability is they \nwere badly abused, not treated as prisoners of war but badly abused by \nsomeone in Iraq. Who knows who they may have been? Obviously, the \ninsurgents, presumably al-Qaida.\n  Our President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and our military \ncommanders have all stood and said forthrightly, these are painful \nlosses. Each one of these individuals I know and have worked with \npersonally. They feel the loss of life. They feel for the injured. They \nfeel for their families. But to attain the freedom, not just for the \nIraqis but for this country, from terrorism, that pain has to be \nendured, those losses are likely to continue. I commend all for being \nforthright that the days ahead pose challenges and further losses.\n  Any amendment requiring phased redeployment as our policy on a \ntimetable to begin in 2006 sends that signal that begins to set back \nthe progress we have achieved to date. That phrase about the timetable \nof redeployment will be examined with utmost care by those who are \ntrying to destabilize this government--be they al-Qaida, insurgents, \nor, unfortunately, the sectarian violence. They are likely to say, we \nwill wait out the timetable and then we will resume the violence and \nwith every means we can to destabilize this government. That will be \nthe result of this amendment.\n  This is an inopportune time because in the last 10 days we witnessed \nthe death of the most prominent terrorist in Iraq, the complete \nformation of the Iraqi Government, a historic meeting in Baghdad \nbetween President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki, more raids against \nal-Qaida cells in Iraq, and a plan for the way ahead for this new \ndemocratically elected government in Iraq. We have the momentum. We \nmust take advantage of this moment and this opportunity and move \nforward.\n  I know other colleagues are anxious to speak. I want to share this \ntime.\n  I pose a question to my distinguished colleague from Michigan about \nanother paragraph in his amendment. This one I find particularly \npuzzling. It is written, again, in very clear language, so I feel the \nmeaning of it is written explicitly on page 5.\n  It says that the President of the United States should do the \nfollowing:\n\n       (i) expedite the transition of United States forces in Iraq \n     to a limited presence . . .\n\n  What do you mean by ``limited presence''?\n\n     . . . limited presence and mission of training Iraqi security \n     forces . . .\n\n  That we are doing with every bit of vigor we can possibly muster.\n\n     . . . providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces . . \n     .\n\n  We are doing that as best we can.\n\n     . . . protecting United States infrastructure and personnel, \n     and participating in targeted counterterrorism activities;\n\n  Does that mean we limit our force structure to the special ops \nforces? What is it that the balance of our forces do? Do they begin to \nrotate back under this timetable?\n  I hope at some point in this debate those questions can be fully \nanswered because the President is the Commander in Chief. He makes the \ndecisions with regard to how our Armed Forces are employed utilizing \nthe advice of the professional military commanders to direct \nspecifically the actions to carry out the missions to achieve our \ngoals.\n  I say to my good friend, this paragraph D, the President should \nexpedite the transition, what is the nature of the transition of United \nStates forces in Iraq to a limited presence?\n  I see no contingency phrase in this as there is elsewhere in this \namendment. If they were to have a tremendous insurrection, what do we \ndo if we have transitioned our forces? Does that mean they are moved \nsomewhere? Does that mean they stay in their bases?\n  This paragraph, in effect, is usurping the rights under the \nConstitution of the Commander in Chief to direct the day-by-day \noperations and deployment and disposition of our Armed Forces. I hope \nin the course of this debate they will find time to explain with \ngreater clarity what is meant by that paragraph.\n  After consultation, No. 2, ``with the Government of Iraq, begin the \nphased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq this year,'' to \nme, again, lays down a marker that something is in the hip pocket \nregarding a timetable.\n  Yes, we start with the government, and the Senator from Michigan \ncited some of the current government officials and some of the \nstatements they have made. I freely say some of those statements do \nraise questions in my mind, but this government has only been in \nbusiness a bare month. We have to give them time. We have to give the \nnew Congress of the Iraqi Government an opportunity to voice its views \nin conjunction with those of the government officials.\n  This word ``after consultation . . . begin the phased redeployment,'' \nhow about if the government said we did not want a phased redeployment \nat this time? What would be the purpose of the consultation if they \nsaid, We do not want it at this time?\n  That statement, in effect, has been stated time and time again while \nthere have been remarks that, yes, we hope you will lure your forces \naway, the bottom line is, they know they cannot survive with this new \ngovernment if we begin any major withdrawal of forces in the coming 2 \nor 3 months while this government is taking root.\n  That is clear. No one disputes that.\n  But you say ``consultation,'' then ``begin the phased redeployment . \n. . from Iraq.'' That is not my idea of consultation. My idea of \nconsultation is to take into consideration the viewpoints of both \nsides.\n  So we come back to submit to Congress a plan by the end of the year \n2006 with estimated dates for the continued phased redeployment of \nUnited States forces from Iraq with the understanding that unexpected \ncontingencies may arise.\n  That is fortunate to have that in there, but that is sort of lost \nbecause of the prominence of the first sentence. That is what is going \nto be read and interpreted by the insurgents, all those who want to \nbring down this new government. That signal must not be sent by the \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me inquire of colleagues on this side \nwho wish to speak. We started this morning by according the Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from Rhode Island their opportunities. I \nhave spoken on this side. I know Senator McCain has just arrived, and \nSenator Cornyn.\n  So I say to Senator McCain, I think you were the first on the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think Senator Cornyn was.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield to Senator McCain and ask to be \nrecognized following him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that Senator McCain follow me, and \nthen we will rotate to this side and back to Senator Cornyn.\n  So at this time, I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that \nrecognition be given to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am wondering if we could sequence \nspeakers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why don't you designate someone?\n  Mr. LEVIN. After Senator McCain is done, we would then seek to \nsequence the Senator from New York immediately after the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. WARNER. Following that, Senator Cornyn will speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And then Senator Salazar is here.\n  Mr. WARNER. He would follow Senator McCain and the distinguished \nSenator from New York and the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let's leave it at that----\n  Mr. WARNER. Then the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because Senator Feinstein is now on the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. You designate that Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank you. And I express my appreciation \nfor the courtesy of the Senator from Texas who was on the floor before \nI was, and I appreciate his courtesy very much. I intend to take about \n12 minutes, if that is agreeable to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we grant 12 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by \nthe Senators from Michigan and Rhode Island and the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Massachusetts. These amendments share the same \nproblem: calling for a withdrawal of American troops tied to arbitrary \ntimetables rather than conditions in-country.\n  The amendment we are debating now states the sense of Congress that \nthe President should begin the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from \nIraq this year and that he should submit to Congress a plan with dates \nfor this redeployment. I believe such a move would be a significant \nstep on the road to disaster.\n  There is an understandable desire, 3 years after our invasion, to \nseek a quick and easy end to our intervention in Iraq. We face real \ndifficulties there, we have made serious mistakes, and the costs have \nbeen very high. But these would pale in comparison to what is likely to \nunfold should we follow the course advocated by this resolution.\n  The violence we see on Iraqi streets today illustrates one \nfundamental fact: Iraqi forces are not yet capable of securing the \ncountry on their own. On the contrary, even with current troop levels, \na level of violence in Iraq remains unacceptably high. To withdraw our \nforces would have one, all-too-predictable outcome--the violence \ncurrently constrained by our security operations around the country \nwould rise commensurately. If the main enforcer of Government \nauthority--coalition troops--draws down prematurely, the only questions \nwill be the degree to which the increased violence engulfs the country \nand whether full-scale civil war erupts.\n  Much has been said about the effect of an American withdrawal on the \nIraqi Government, and the sponsors of this amendment argue that a \nwithdrawal would somehow force the Government to take on \nresponsibilities it currently evades. But consider for a moment the \neffect of a withdrawal timetable on individual Iraqis outside the \nGovernment. An Iraqi Shi'a living in Baghdad or perhaps a Sunni living \nin Kirkuk learns that the Congress has called on our President to begin \nwithdrawing troops this year and to present a timetable by which they \nwill all return home. This knowledge changes the calculation made by \nindividuals like these, decisions critical to the eventual security of \nIraq. It makes joining the police forces or the Iraqi Government look \nlike an increasingly bad bet. Participation in a militia appears better \nby comparison. And by changing these calculations across the country, \nwe have made the goal of stability in Iraq more difficult to achieve. \nBy signaling that an end to the American intervention is near, we will \nalienate our friends, who fear an insurgent victory, and tempt \nundecideds to join the antigovernment ranks.\n  Not every Member of this body agreed with the decision to topple \nSaddam Hussein, but when our country went to war, we incurred a moral \nduty to not abandon the people of Iraq to terrorists and killers. If we \nwithdraw prematurely, risking all-out civil war, we will have done \nprecisely that. I can hardly imagine that any U.S. Senator would want \nour Nation to suffer that moral stain.\n  But the implications of premature withdrawal from Iraq are not moral \nalone; they directly involve our national security. Greater instability \nin Iraq would invite further Syrian and Iranian interference, \nbolstering the influence of two terror-sponsoring states firmly opposed \nto America's policy. Iraq's neighbors--from Saudi Arabia to Israel to \nTurkey--would feel their own security eroding and might be induced to \nact. This uncertain swirl of events would have a damaging impact on our \nability to promote positive change in the Middle East, to say the \nleast.\n  Withdrawing before Iraqis can bring stability to the country on their \nown would turn that land into a failed state in the heart of the Middle \nEast. We have seen once before a failed state emerge after U.S. \ndisengagement, and it cost us terribly. In pre-9/11 Afghanistan, \nterrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with impunity. We \nknow that there are today in Iraq terrorists who are planning attacks \nagainst Americans. We cannot make this fatal mistake twice.\n  Whether or not Members of this body believe that Iraq was part of the \nwar on terror in 2003, it is simply incontrovertible that the war on \nterror is being fought there today. Al-Qaida is present in Iraq. \nJihadists continue to cross the borders. Suicide bombers target \nAmerican troops, Government personnel, and civilians. If we leave Iraq \nprematurely, the jihadists will interpret the withdrawal as a triumph \nof their brutal tactics against our power. And I do not believe they \nwill stop with Iraq.\n\n  The letter released last year from Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's \nlieutenant, to Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi draws out the implications. The \nZawahiri letter is predicated on the assumption that the United States \nwill leave Iraq and that al-Qaida's real game begins as soon as we \nabandon the country. In his missive, Zawahiri lays out a four-stage \nplan--establish a caliphate in Iraq, extend the ``jihad wave'' to the \nsecular countries neighboring Iraq, clash with Israel--none of which \nshall commence until the completion of stage one: expel the Americans \nfrom Iraq. Zawahiri observes that the collapse of American power in \nVietnam, ``and how they ran and left their agents,'' suggests that ``we \nmust be ready starting now.'' We cannot let them start, now or ever. We \nmust stay in Iraq until the Government there has fully functioning \nsecurity forces that can keep the insurgents at bay and ultimately \ndefeat them.\n  Some argue that it is our very presence in Iraq that has created the \ninsurgency and that if we end the occupation, we end the insurgency. \nBut, in fact, by ending military operations, we are likely to empower \nthe insurgency. The fighting is not simply against coalition forces; \nrather, the insurgents target the Iraqi Government, opposing militias, \nand various sects and ethnicities. There is no reason to think that an \nAmerican drawdown would discourage these fights.\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\n  Those who support a withdrawal might wish to examine the assumptions \nthat lie behind their suggestion. What if we withdraw and the violence \nactually worsens, full-scale civil war ensues, or terrorists enjoy \nsafe-haven to plan attacks against America and our friends? Do we then \nface the options only of tolerating this situation in perpetuity or \nreinvading the country?\n  A few observers have argued that the United States has an option of \nsomehow pulling our troops from Iraq but still managing things from \nafar. This is nonsense. The United States will have no leverage to \nmanage things once we have left the country. The battle in Iraq, which \nis likely to remain counterinsurgency in character, is ill-suited to \nthe extensive use of air power, which would be the foremost instrument \navailable to us from outside. We could no more prevail in Iraq from \noutside than we could win the war in Vietnam by continuing to bomb the \nNorth. As tempting as it is to seek a solution that would let us both \ndraw down our troops and preserve our military options in Iraq, that \nsolution does not exist. The options on the table have been there from \nthe beginning: withdraw and fail or commit and succeed.\n  Don't take my word for it. Ask those whose security is at stake every \nday. The Iraqi Government does not want us to set an arbitrary timeline \nfor withdrawal. As the Iraqi Minister for National Security wrote in \nyesterday's Washington Post, more important than some series of dates \nis the achievement of set objectives for restoring security. Similarly, \nour friends in the neighborhood fear a precipitous American withdrawal. \nAllies in Europe and Asia encourage us to see this war through to its \nend.\n  Because we cannot pull out and hope for the best, because we cannot \nwithdraw and manage things from afar, because morality and our security \ncompel it, we have to see this mission through to completion. Drawdowns \nmust be based on conditions in-country, not an arbitrary deadline \nrooted in our domestic politics.\n  Our domestic politics do have an effect on the war in Iraq, and again \nI fear that this amendment would have a deleterious effect. Anyone \nreading it gets the sense that the Senate's foremost objective is the \ndrawdown of American troops. The sense they should get is that \nAmerica's first goal in Iraq is to win the war--that is what they \nshould get--and that all other policy decisions support and are \nsubordinate to the successful completion of our mission. Like the \nsponsors of this legislation, I hope we bring home American troops as \nsoon as possible. But suggesting to the American people that withdrawal \nis at hand, we risk once again raising unrealistic expectations that \ncan only cost domestic support for America's role in this conflict, a \nwar we must win.\n  None of this is to say that success in Iraq will be quick or easy. On \nthe contrary, this war is long and it is hard and it is tough. We will \nsee significant achievements, like the killing of Zarqawi and the \ncompletion of the Iraqi Cabinet, but we will see steps backward as \nwell, like the continuing violence in Baghdad and the insurgency in \nRamadi. No one should have any illusions about the costs of this \nconflict as it has been waged thus far or as it will be waged as we \nmove ahead, but neither should anyone have illusions about the role of \nIraq in the war on terror today. It has become a central battleground \nin our fight against those who wish us grave harm, and we cannot wish \naway this fundamental truth. We cannot fall prey to wishful thinking \nthat we can put the costs and the difficulties and the frustrations \naside by ignoring our challenges and responsibilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nRockefeller be added as a cosponsor of our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the information of Senators--if I could \nget Senator Warner's attention--the order on our side will be Senators \nClinton, Feinstein, and Salazar.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the same order with the addition of \nSalazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Levin amendment \nof which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. At a moment when \n130,000 soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen, active duty, Guard and \nReserve are serving bravely in Iraq and when the debate in Congress \nover our Nation's Iraq policy has grown particularly divisive and \nheated, I believe it is time for the Members of this body to put \npolitics aside and choose between success and the status quo.\n  By playing politics and blindly following the President, too many are \ndeaf to the hue and cry about the failures of this administration in \nthe execution of its policies. And too often, our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle in both Chambers are asking politically \nmotivated questions, not engaging in the kinds of fruitful discussion \nthat asks the tough national security questions we need to address and \nanswer.\n  I think it is time to choose whether we believe we have the right \nroadmap for success in Iraq. While our troops are serving bravely and \nwith our national security in the balance, it is time to choose what is \nmore important--a strategy to win in Iraq or a strategy for Republicans \nto win elections here at home.\n  There are no easy answers as to how we solve the problems created by \nthis administration. There are no easy answers as to how we work to \nenable the Iraqis to hold their country together and to keep it from \nbecoming a terrorist refuge and launching pad.\n  I simply do not believe it is a strategy or a solution for the \nPresident to continue declaring an open-ended and unconditional \ncommitment, nor do I believe it is a solution or a strategy to set a \ndate certain for withdrawal without regard to the consequences. \nInstead, I support this responsible way forward, a roadmap for success \nthat will more quickly and effectively take advantage of Iraqi oil \nrevenues, build up Iraqi infrastructure, foster Iraqi civil society, \nchallenge Iraq's neighbors to do more to ensure stability in Iraq, and \nallow our troops to begin coming home.\n  We all know that our troops are in harm's way right now in a volatile \nregion of the world for which America has significant interests at \nstake. We are at a profound turning point for our Nation. We are \nentrusted by our constituents, both those who serve and those who do \nnot, to do what we think is right for them, for our States, and our \ncountry.\n  Let's be clear about what this debate is about. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle believe that the status quo is working in Iraq. \nThey do not believe we need a fundamental change in policy. They choose \nto continue blindly following the President.\n  We Democrats disagree. We believe we need a new direction in Iraq \nthat will increase the chances for success on the ground. I may \ndisagree with those who call for a date certain for withdrawal, but I \ndo not doubt their patriotism. I may disagree with those who believe in \nan unconditional commitment without end, but I do not doubt their \npatriotism either.\n  Sadly, however, there are those who do doubt the patriotism of many \nwho raise serious questions about this war. They choose to tar all who \ndisagree with an open-ended, unconditional commitment as unpatriotic, \nas waving the white flag of surrender.\n  They may not have a war strategy, but they do have an election \nstrategy. This is the road they took America down in 2002. It was a \ndead end for our country then; it is a dead end now.\n  The politically motivated resolutions put forth by leading \nRepublicans to gain tactical partisan advantage are a disgrace. In so \ndoing, they have broken faith with those who serve and those of us who \nsupport our troops and who work for the success of this mission.\n  It is wrong, plain and simple, to turn this serious debate about our \npolicies and national security into a partisan squabble designed to \nmislead voters.\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nThis is politics at its worst, played over war. And that is no way to \nhonor the service and sacrifices of our troops and their families or to \nfind a better way forward in Iraq.\n  Like many in this Chamber, I have traveled to Iraq and to \nAfghanistan. I have met there and here with tough, smart, patriotic men \nand women who fill me with tremendous pride. They have been performing \nmagnificently under difficult conditions. They have paid a heavy price \nsince the war began in 2003.\n  Last week we had a moment of silence to mark the day that the number \nof American servicemembers killed in Iraq reached 2,500. And more than \n18,000 others have been wounded. As of June 17, New York has lost 116 \nsoldiers. The combined number of New York soldiers killed and wounded \nis 1,038.\n  I have spent time with wounded soldiers and Marines. I spent time on \nSaturday with grieving families, mourning lost loved ones. I have tried \nto answer the questions they ask. I have shared the grief they feel. \nThose who have not lost a loved one or seen him or her return injured \nstill are anxious every day while a parent or a child or a spouse \nserves far from home. Not a day goes by that I do not pray for the safe \nreturn of every man and woman now stationed in dangerous places around \nthe world--not a single day.\n\n  This is not a time for partisanship. It is past time for this \nadministration to level with the American people, for this Congress to \nfind its voice and fulfill its constitutional duties to check and \nbalance the executive branch, and for the Iraqis to chart a clear and \nresponsible path to stability and peace.\n  I call on our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to fairly and \nhonestly consider the Levin amendment as an alternative to the status \nquo, when we know that the status quo has not, is not, and will not \ncreate the conditions needed for the Iraqis to achieve the stability \nand security they seek and for us to bring home our troops.\n  The conflict in Iraq has now gone on longer than U.S. fighting in the \nKorean war before the armistice. We ought not to attack one another for \nasking the tough questions and presenting alternatives about how to \nachieve success, limit the loss and sacrifice of our young men and \nwomen.\n  As we debate our next steps in Iraq, it is critical that we recognize \nand fix, as best we can, the mistakes that have already been made and \nnot repeat them. The Bush administration misused the authority granted \nto it, choosing to act without allowing the inspectors to finish the \njob in order to rush to war, without a plan for securing the country, \nwithout an understanding of the insurgency or the true human, \nfinancial, and strategic cost of this war, all the while viewing the \ndangerous and unstable conditions in Iraq through rose-colored glasses \nand the prism of electoral politics here at home.\n  It is time to put policy ahead of politics and success ahead of the \nstatus quo. It is time for a new strategy to produce what we need, a \nstable Iraq Government that takes over for its own people so our troops \ncan finish their job.\n  That is what the Levin amendment does. It calls for a comprehensive \nroadmap to achieve peace and stability. It also sets into motion the \nsteps that should be taken for Iraq to move itself forward and become \nmore capable of defending its territory, ending the sectarian violence, \nand purging the insurgency.\n  The Levin amendment does put us on a responsible path by calling for \nstronger nonmilitary actions, such as a conference of neighboring \nnations, greater rebuilding efforts, and better internal political \nreconciliation, by requiring the Iraqis to disarm road militias and \ntake over more of their own security.\n  The only way the new Iraqi Government can gain credibility is by \nproving they can handle an increasing share of the security of the \ncountry with fewer, not more, U.S. troops.\n  It is clear in the Levin amendment that we recognize the President's \nrole as Commander in Chief. It is the President who will make these \ndecisions. What the amendment attempts to do is to provide a different \nroadmap, to set some conditions in contrast to the unconditional, open-\nended commitment that we have had for the last 3 years and 3 months.\n  In yesterday's Washington Post, one expert laid out such a roadmap \nwhich described the importance of reducing our military presence in \nIraq so as to enhance the legitimacy of the Iraqi Government in the \neyes of both Iraqis and Iraq's neighbors. That expert was Iraq's own \nnational security adviser.\n  I commend the entire article to be read because as the national \nsecurity adviser sets forth a roadmap for the way out of Iraq, he makes \nvery clear that the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's \ngovernment in the eyes of its people. That is not an American. That is \nnot a Democrat. That is an Iraqi in this new government who recognizes \nwhat some, apparently, in this Chamber refuse to, which is, yes, we \nneed conditions. The current policy has no conditions. It is \nunconditional.\n  The Levin amendment sets forth conditions, sets forth the kind of \nsteps and benchmarks that we as Americans in positions of \nresponsibility have every right to expect that the Iraqis will step up \nand meet. Clearly, that is also the position of the new Iraqi \nGovernment. In fact, one can read this statement and find much in the \nLevin amendment that supports the position put forth by the Iraqi \nnational security adviser.\n  No war since Vietnam has stirred the emotion to the extent of our \npeople as this one. I hear it all the time as I travel from one end of \nNew York to the other. People stop and ask if there will be an end to \nthe loss of American lives. They wonder what the goal is; how do we \ndefine success? The rhetoric on the other side is all about symbols and \nslogans, but how do we define success?\n  They believe that we in Congress should not be wasting this country's \ntime with partisan political slogans while we have troops in the field. \nThey grieve over the mistakes that have been committed by an \nadministration that failed at every turn to see the difficulties ahead \nof it or the benefits of using all the nonmilitary means available to \nit.\n  Of course, there are always unexpected events in war that can change \nthe best plan or put some detours into the roadmap. The Levin amendment \ntakes that into account. But I believe we must end the current open-\nended, unconditional policy and focus on clear goals on all fronts and \nto make that absolutely clear to the Iraqi Government.\n  If we do that, we can begin to bring our troops home this year. That \nis why I fervently believe members of both parties should support this \nresolution.\n  How much time do I have left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to start my remarks this afternoon \nby recognizing the ultimate sacrifice paid by one of our soldiers, one \nof my fellow Texans, who gave his life this week in Iraq.\n  PFC Kristian Menchaca, age 23, of Houston, joined the military last \nyear and was soon deployed to Iraq as part of the 1st Battalion, 502nd \nInfantry, 2nd Brigade, of the 101st Airborne based in Fort Campbell, \nKY.\n  According to military reports, Menchaca and his fellow soldier, PFC \nThomas Tucker of Oregon, were part of a unit checking vehicles near the \nEuphrates River south of Baghdad. They were taken when their checkpoint \nwas attacked and, as we now know, they died in service to their Nation, \nand their bodies have since been recovered.\n  Private First Class Menchaca is described by his family in various \nreports as a man who loved basketball and Mexican food. His cousin, \nSylvia Grice, is quoted as saying:\n\n       He talked about how happy he was that he was serving his \n     country. Everyone he met liked him. He had that kind of \n     personality. He liked to help people. He was just the kind of \n     person that you enjoyed being with.\n\n  Private First Class Menchaca was married in September of last year, \nand he often talked of joining the Border Patrol when he finished his \nmilitary service.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for a grateful Nation when I say I am \nthankful for the service of good men and women like Private First Class \nMenchaca who serve our country day in and day out and who place \nthemselves in harm's way in the service of\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\nfreedom. I am glad there are people like Private First Class Menchaca, \nwho was happy to serve his country, not knowing perhaps that that \nservice to his country would end in the ultimate sacrifice for the \ncause of freedom.\n  Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate so far on the \namendments on the floor. I cannot help but be struck by those who would \ncast the only options available to America, when it comes to what is \nnow the central front in the global war on terror in Iraq, as open-\nended, unconditional commitment versus arbitrary deadlines. We have \nmore choices than that, and it is indeed the policy of our Government \nat the present time not to offer open-ended, unconditional commitments, \nor to set arbitrary deadlines that serve as an encouragement to the \nenemy, knowing that if they hunker down long enough and wait us out \nlong enough, the American people will lose their resolve and simply \ngive up.\n  Mr. President, our policy is one based on conditions on the ground, \nand based on the sound advice of our professional military experts, \npeople such as GEN John Abizaid, head of Central Command, and General \nCasey, head of the coalition forces in Iraq. These are the professional \ngenerals--those with knowledge of the facts on the ground--who are \nmaking the judgments and recommendations to the President and the \nSecretary of Defense and to this Congress about what our policy should \nbe, and that policy is based on conditions on the ground.\n  Those who suggest that our only choice is between open-ended, \nunconditional commitments and arbitrary deadlines are presenting us \nwith a false choice, one that, in the end, simply looks a lot like \ngiving up. I speak in opposition to any proposal to impose an arbitrary \ndeadline for the removal of our troops from Iraq and to speak about \nwhat I believe and know others of my colleagues believe is our need to \nwin the war on terror and, while doing so, to stand beside the Iraqi \npeople as they work to build their fledgling democracy and work to \nexpand their growing ability to secure themselves.\n  The fundamental question we have before us today is: Are we going to \nbase our military strategy in Iraq on an arbitrary timetable for \nwithdrawal based upon defeatism, a policy of retreat, a policy of \nappeasement, a policy of surrender, or are we going to rely upon the \nmilitary judgment of those who are currently leading us to victory in \nIraq?\n  It is clear, as in all wars, that our Nation is being tested. This is \nnot so much a test for our professional military, which is the \npreeminent fighting force in the world today and no doubt the premier \nfighting force that the world has ever known--there is no military \nforce that can defeat the United States of America--the only thing that \ncan defeat the United States of America, when it comes to the global \nwar on terror, is America itself, if we lose the courage of our \nconvictions, if we simply give up.\n  On October 11, 2002, 77 Members of this body voted to authorize the \nuse of force to remove Saddam Hussein in Iraq. I will be interested to \nsee, when we vote on these various amendments, how many of our \ncolleagues have simply lost the courage or conviction they displayed \nthen, in saying it was important to remove a terrible, bloodthirsty \ntyrant from Iraq. I have stood on the mass burial grave sites in Iraq \nwhere at least 400,000 Iraqis lie who were victims of that bloodthirsty \ndictator.\n  We know that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was in Iraq more than a year before \nAmerican forces went in. We all know that Saddam Hussein, with his \nfantasies of developing weapons of mass destruction, teamed up with \nterrorists and presented a clear and imminent threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the United States.\n  We have much unfinished work to do. But we must not forget to honor \nthe sacrifices of those 2,500 people, like Private First Class Menchaca \nof Texas, who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Are \nwe going to tell those brave patriots and their families that they have \nsacrificed in vain, that we were not really serious about our \ncommitments both to the American people, to preserve their safety and \nsecurity, as well as to our allies, the Iraqi people? I hope not.\n  There is no victory in arbitrary withdrawal from Iraq, and victory \nmust remain our sole resolve. Any suggestion that a withdrawal from \nIraq would somehow accelerate or pressure the Iraqi Government, and \nIraqis themselves, into supporting democracy more fervently is simply \ninconsistent with the facts. The people who are probably most anxious \nfor the American and coalition forces to leave Iraq--second only to the \nAmerican people's desire to have their sons and daughters come home--\nthe people most eager to see them come home, beyond their family \nmembers, are probably the Iraqi people themselves. But they understand \nthat they are not yet prepared to defend themselves against the \nterrorists, against the insurgents, against the sectarian strife that \nis currently racking that country. Yet we find that the armchair \ngenerals in Washington, DC, are hardly in a position to determine the \nbest military strategy. How could it be any other way? Who is in a \nbetter position to determine what that strategy should be, based on \nconditions on the ground, than those professional military men and \nwomen who study this issue daily, who live with it daily, and who have \ntremendous experience? Surely, they have a better idea about how we can \nwin the war in Iraq than the armchair generals in Washington who are \nresigned to defeat and simply giving up.\n\n  The Senator from New York quoted from a Washington Post article of \nyesterday and suggested that the National Security Adviser in Iraq had \nsomehow endorsed the provisions of the Levin amendment. But I want to \nquote one sentence that clearly refutes that suggestion. The National \nSecurity Adviser said:\n\n       This roadmap on foreign troop withdrawals is based not just \n     on a series of dates but, most important, on achievement of \n     set objectives for restoring security in Iraq.\n\n  In other words, Iraq's National Security Adviser understands the \nfoolishness of setting arbitrary deadlines that have no relationship to \nachievement of set objectives for restoring security in Iraq. Do we all \nwish that our troops could come home sooner rather than later? Of \ncourse we do. But it is simply foolishness and folly to impose an \narbitrary timetable on our forces, requiring them to withdraw from Iraq \nbefore the job is done and while the going gets tough.\n  I have in my hands a report from the U.S. Department of State that is \n19 pages long. Anybody with access to the Internet could copy this or \nview it online. It is called ``Significant Terrorist Incidents, 1961 to \n2003; A Brief Chronology.'' It is 19 pages long. I ask our colleagues \nwho counsel retreat, who counsel self-defeatism, what do they think is \ngoing to happen if we leave Iraq prematurely, before the Iraqi security \nforces can defend themselves in that new democracy? What do they expect \nwill happen? I think what we know will happen is that power void would \nbe filled by those who are currently fighting and killing innocent \npeople in Iraq and who, given the opportunity, would use that failed \nstate, if we were to retreat prematurely, as a platform to plot, plan, \nfinance, and export terrorist acts to the United States and elsewhere \naround the world.\n  It is pure folly to think that the terrorists somehow would simply \ngive up if we decided to come home prematurely, or that Iraq could \nstand on its own to fight and defend itself and have any chance of \nnursing this fledgling democracy into full maturity.\n  Just yesterday I heard some of the Members on the other side of the \naisle say that they, too, thought that troop withdrawal should be based \nupon the judgment of military commanders. But they added: As long as \nthe generals agree with them, that withdrawal will take place within 6 \nmonths.\n  Another one of our colleagues who has a resolution that has been much \ndiscussed announced he would extend his initial proposal of a 6-month \ndeadline to a 1-year deadline. I wonder what sort of wisdom he acquired \nover the course of a weekend that told him, no, the arbitrary deadline \nshould not be 6 months but should now be a year. What sort of new \ninformation did he acquire that led him to the conclusion that a \nwithdrawal in 1 year was better than a withdrawal 6 months from now?\n  It is clear that such arbitrary decisions have no basis in military \nstrategy. According to one news story last week, there were colleagues \nof ours on the other side of the aisle who were up all hours searching \nfor a troop withdrawal position on the war on terror that would unite \ntheir political party.\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\n  My question is: Can they really be serious? Can they really be \nserious that they are still searching for some unifying position? It \nappears that they have no unifying position, and they have no plan to \nlead the victory in Iraq, or to lead the American people during one of \nthe toughest fights that our Nation has ever endured.\n  It is indeed a time of testing for our Nation, and we must pass the \ntest, not just for the safety and security of the Iraqi people, but for \nour own safety and security, and for the safety and security of our \nchildren and our children's children.\n  So far, it appears that the only thing the critics can agree on is \ntheir willingness to criticize the efforts in the global war on terror, \nto harp on those things in a way that is not productive and certainly \nnot helpful. And it has the consequence, unintended or not, of \nundermining public support and confidence for our efforts in Iraq and \nin the global war on terror.\n\n  So it makes me wonder--and I am sure the American people must be \nwondering--are they more interested in the upcoming elections not in \nIraq, but in America in November, or are they more interested in \nwinning the global war on terror without regard to politics or \nelections?\n  It is important that we put the situation in Iraq in perspective. We \nare moving forward. Every single day we are making progress. The Iraqi \npeople and their military forces are reaching out and taking \nresponsibility in their own country and the hope we are extending to \nthem for democracy and freedom.\n  Just over 3 years ago, Saddam Hussein ruled that country. We all know \nhe killed hundreds of thousands of his own people whose only crime was \nto oppose his tyranny. Our military performed flawlessly in their march \nto Baghdad and overthrew Saddam Hussein. Then, in January 2005, the \nIraqis held elections for a transitional national assembly to begin the \ndrafting of the Iraqi Constitution. They overwhelmingly approved that \nConstitution in October of 2005. And then in December of 2005, they \nheld elections for a permanent national assembly.\n  The Iraqi Parliament then approved the Cabinet, including the most \ncontroversial post of Defense and Interior Ministers. I remind my \ncolleagues that the Iraqi voter turnout during last year's elections \nfor their national assembly and referendum on their Constitution was \nrespectively 58 percent, 77 percent, and 63 percent. It is clear that \nthe Iraqi people are participating in their political process and \nbuilding their own institutions that will eventually allow them to \ngovern themselves and determine their own future.\n  On the security side, we have trained more than 260,000 Iraqi \nsecurity forces and these forces are daily becoming more and more \ncompetent. They are now leading daily operations against insurgents and \nal-Qaida and the sectarian strife in Iraq.\n  We know there is a price to be paid, and I guess in the end, the \ndifference between those who would retreat prematurely and simply give \nup and those of us who believe the fight is worth fighting for and the \nsacrifices that this Nation has made in the cause of freedom are \nunfortunate but worth it, the differences between those who believe war \nis bad and must never be fought and those who believe that war is bad \nbut sometimes must be fought for the right reasons.\n  It is dispiriting that some politicians reading the polls in Iraq \nwant us to set an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal, and this despite \nthey have no plan for success for winning the war or what to do in the \nvacuum that will be created once we give up.\n  We know that terrorists remain on the attack and, given our \nwillingness to retreat, will simply take advantage of that \nvulnerability and attack America and other innocent people again.\n  In conclusion, I think the policy of retreat and defeatism and simply \ngiving up is not one that serves our Nation well. It does not serve the \ninterests of the Iraqi people, and it would simply be the wrong \ndecision for this Senate to make at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from Texas \nfor his powerful message and also for his work on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee where he has labored long and hard and well into the \nfuture, I hope. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as has been said, more than 2,500 \nbrave men and women of America's fighting forces have now been killed \nin Iraq. Another 18,500 have been wounded. The victims of this violence \ninclude two American soldiers captured in an ambush at a checkpoint \nsouth of Baghdad who were brutally tortured, killed, and left \nsurrounded by roadside bombs. I join with all of my colleagues in \noffering our deepest sympathies.\n  Yet with American troops now caught in the middle of raging sectarian \nviolence, it is all too likely that such heinous acts will go on and \non. This war, originally projected to last but a few months, has gone \non for 39 months with no end in sight.\n  Our Nation is spending $2.5 billion a week on the conflict, and the \nviolence has worsened.\n  Iraqis have suffered greatly. More than 30,000 civilians have been \nkilled, including 4,000 in the past 3 months alone. And another 90,000 \nIraqis have had to flee their homes and their country to avoid the \nbloodshed.\n  In the past 5 days alone, according to news reports, nearly 100 \ncivilians have been murdered in car bombings, shootings and other \nattacks, despite a new security crackdown by Iraqi and American forces.\n  For example, on Friday, 16 people were killed and 28 wounded when a \nshoe bomber blew himself up inside the Buratha mosque during religious \nservices.\n  Saturday, one of the bloodiest days yet in recent months, over 40 \ncivilians died in a series of car bombs and mortar attacks around \nBaghdad.\n  Day after day and month after month, we see that an open-ended \ncommitment of United States forces neither controls nor abates the \ninsurgency but, rather, it appears to inflame it.\n  What is becoming very apparent is that the murderous conflicts that \nbloody Baghdad and other cities daily can only be reduced by Iraqis--\nIraqis who are willing and able to come together and stop this brutal \nand ruthless violence.\n  So I rise today to say that the time has come for the United States \nto recognize that United States troops cannot abate this kind of \nsectarian violence; only Iraqis can.\n  Late last year, Congress approved and President Bush signed into law \nan amendment that was in this very Defense authorization bill. That \namendment pointed out that:\n\n       Calendar year 2006--\n\n  That this year--\n\n     should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating \n     the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States \n     forces from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, 79 Senators from both sides of the aisle voted for \nthis amendment, and I believe the amendment presented today that we are \ndebating right now is the right way to follow up on this earlier Senate \ninitiative. It is not cut-and-run by any stretch of the imagination.\n  When President Bush staged his brief visit to Baghdad last week, he \ntold Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki that he came to look him ``in \nthe eye.'' Now it is time for the President of the United States to \nlook the American people in the eye.\n  As a nation, we have had enough repetition of slogans and \nreassurances that have become increasingly hollow in the continuing \nblast of roadside bombs and the rattle of automatic gunfire. No longer \nwill ``we stand down when they stand up'' suffice for policy. No, Mr. \nPresident, we want you to recognize this.\n  Three years ago, the United States may have been misguided into war \nin Iraq, but now most certainly the country must not be misguided about \nthe realities in Iraq today and the need to change our mission.\n  What is victory in a land torn by its own warring factions? Is it \nquite possibly allowing Iraqis to solve Iraqi problems and to remove \nthe shibboleth of an ongoing occupying army making decisions that \nshould be left to Iraqis?\n  Despite what may have been said these past few days, our amendment is \nnot about cutting and running. Rather,\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\nour amendment acknowledges that staying the course is a strategy that \nshows no promise of success, and it is time to change that strategy.\n  There remains a thunderstorm of conflicting forces over much of Iraq. \nQuesting for dominance are al-Qaida, nationalistic Baathists left over \nfrom the days of Saddam's tyranny, and an array of rival religious \narmies.\n  The battle lines are as uncertain and diverse as are the competing \nobjectives of the various combatants. True, there have been some other \npositive developments. Iraq finally put a constitutional government in \nplace last month, 5 months after the December 15 election.\n  After extensive deliberation and debate, the Iraqi Government is \nfinally functioning, but much work remains to be done by the Iraqi \npeople and their elected leaders, for only they can ultimately defeat \nthe forces that have left the Iraqi nation on the brink of civil war. \nThere are now over 260,000 Iraqi military and police personnel who have \nbeen trained and equipped, well over three-quarters of the way to \nreaching the Pentagon's stated goal of establishing an Iraqi force of \n325,000 troops. Of the 102 operational Iraqi Army combat battalions, 69 \nare either in the lead or operating independently. That is over 60,000 \nsoldiers.\n  Now that Iraqis have assumed the reins of control, it is critical \nthat the United States not be caught in the middle of the ongoing \ncarnage, sectarian violence, and civil strife.\n  I believe strongly that our mission in Iraq needs to change--train \npolice and military, provide necessary infrastructure assistance, \nadvise when asked--but now that the entire Iraqi leadership is in \nplace, it is time for the phased redeployment promised last year in \nthis bill to begin.\n  Our amendment calls on the administration to prepare and present to \nCongress and the American people by the end of this year a plan \noutlining the steps needed to proceed with the redeployment of our \ntroops, either back to the United States or to other critical areas of \npotential terrorist conflict around the globe.\n  This amendment would place the Senate on record asking that the \nPresident expedite the transition of U.S. forces in Iraq to a limited \npresence and confine the mission to training and providing logistical \nsupport to Iraqi security forces.\n  We request the President to begin the phased redeployment of forces \nthis year. It would ask that the President submit a plan to the \nCongress by the end of 2006 with estimated--estimated--days for the \ncontinued phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. Is this too \nmuch to ask 3 years and 3 months into the most costly conflict the \nUnited States has yet entered into?\n\n  It would also ask the President to convene an international \nconference to bring together the international community to discuss and \nimplement a strategy to assisting Iraq's development and \ninfrastructure.\n  This amendment also calls on the Iraqi Government to, one, achieve a \nbroad-based and sustainable political settlement within its own groups \nof people; two, share political power and economic resources among all \nIraqi groups; three, develop a unifying constitution; and, four, disarm \nthe militias and remove members of the Iraqi security forces whose \nloyalty to the new government is in doubt.\n  Moreover, and most importantly, it is increasingly clear that the \nIraqis themselves wish to see a structured downsizing of American \ntroops in their country. Why don't we listen?\n  Senator Clinton eloquently pointed this out, and it bears repeating. \nThe new Iraqi National Security Adviser first said a week ago, and then \nmore recently in a Washington Post op-ed just yesterday, that the Iraqi \nGovernment hopes that by year's end, United States troop levels will be \nunder 100,000, and that most of the remaining troops will return home \nby the end of 2007.\n  We don't make accusations of the Iraqi National Security Adviser. I \nhave a hard time understanding why the opposite side makes accusations \nof us when we simply say we agree with the Iraqis, whose business it is \nto know this, chart this, advise this, and carry this out.\n  He states unequivocally that Iraq's ambition is to have full control \nof his country by the end of 2008. He says: The removal of coalition \ntroops from Iraqi streets will help the Iraqis, who now see our troops \nas occupiers rather than the liberators they were meant to be.\n  Members, this is the Iraqi National Security Adviser saying that the \nIraqi people now see our troops as occupiers rather than the liberators \nthey were once meant to be. This is a point worthy of serious \nconsideration by this body.\n  Al-Rubaie goes on to suggest that such a drawdown: ``Will legitimize \nIraq's government in the eyes of its people'' and ``strengthen it to \nlast the full 4 years it is supposed to.'' A drawdown, he says, will \nlegitimize Iraq's Government in the eyes of its people and strengthen \nit to last the 4 years it is supposed to. Why don't we listen?\n  And he concludes yesterday's op-ed by stating--and I find this \neloquent:\n\n       Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United States and \n     the coalition, take responsibility for its own decisions, \n     learn from its own mistakes, and find Iraqi solutions to \n     Iraqi problems, with the knowledge that our friends and \n     allies are standing by with support and help should we need \n     it.\n\n  This is exactly what this legislation would do. If the Iraqi National \nSecurity Adviser is willing to put forward goals and timetables for the \ndownsizing of the American troop presence in Iraq, why shouldn't the \nPresident of the United States?\n  I hope this body will join together in a bipartisan fashion, as we \ndid last year, and call for the redeployment and transition of the \nUnited States mission in Iraq beginning this year. Three years and 3 \nmonths. This hasn't been 30 days, it hasn't been 60 days or 90 days. It \nhas been 3 years and 3 months with ``stay the course,'' and things get \nworse and worse. Now we have the National Security Adviser in Iraq \nsaying essentially exactly what the amendment before us today says. Are \nwe going to listen to him or do we think we know better?\n  I believe this is the right thing to do for our troops who have \nsacrificed so much. It is the right thing to do for their families who \nwait anxiously for them to return home. It is the right thing to do for \nthe overwhelming majority of the American people who have stated \nclearly their desire for a change of course in Iraq.\n  I believe it is the right thing to do for the Iraqi people. They are \nprepared to stand up. They are prepared to handle their own destiny. I \nbelieve Iraq should be for Iraqis.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself just a minute or two. I \nlistened carefully, as I do to all the comments made by my colleagues, \nand I believe I heard my distinguished colleague from California say \nthat the most costly war ever is the one we are engaged in.\n  I would like to remind my colleague and all those listening and all \nin America--we deeply grieve the 2,500 lives we have lost thus far and \nthe 18,000 wounded--but I remember so well when I was but 17 or just \nturned 18. I was in the Navy during the last battle of World War II; \njust one of those battles in World War II. I was in the training \ncommand at that time awaiting my orders to go to the Pacific. It began \non Easter Sunday morning, and it ended 81 days later. One battle, 81 \ndays, in 1945. Let me tell my colleague what America suffered. Twelve \nthousand men, and I expect some women, were killed or missing and never \naccounted for; 38,000 were wounded, 763 aircraft were lost, 368 U.S. \nnaval ships either sunk or were severely damaged.\n  We have to be cautious and put this conflict in context with the \nsacrifices that Americans have made. That was just one battle in World \nWar II. The casualties eventually went over a half a million. That was \nonly one battle.\n  As we look at this conflict, yes, we grieve the losses, but we have \nto maintain this steadfast commitment, as we did in World War II, to \nput an end to this tyranny of terrorism. If not, we will not see \ncasualties like Okinawa in any military conflict in the years to come \nbetween soldiers, sailors, airmen, and their counterparts, but we could \nsee those casualties here at home if these terrorists acquire weapons \nof mass destruction or are given places in the world to have their \ntraining camps, and if they perceive that this Nation is in any way \nwavering its commitment to fight terrorism in every aspect we can.\n  So I would say to my dear colleague, I don't think this is the most \ncostly\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\nwar ever, as I believe the record will reflect.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I respond to that?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would respond just for a brief moment. I believe \nthe total cost of World War II was $210 billion in real dollars. The \ncost thus far of just Iraq has been $320 billion; and if we include \nAfghanistan, my understanding is it is about $370 billion. So I did not \nmean it in terms of lives lost; I meant it in terms of dollars spent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, that was not clear in the statement that you made. \nYou used the word ``cost.'' I did not put down the cost of all the \nmilitary equipment of the wars. But I think when we look at cost, we \nshould think of lives expended. And we are here today exercising that \nfreedom from that generation of World War II, the generation that \nfought in Korea, the generation that fought in Vietnam, and the \ngeneration that is fighting today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to start my remarks in \nopposition to this resolution by sharing the story of Marine First \nLieutenant David Lewis from Spring, TX. Following participation in the \nCorps of Cadets at Texas A University, he was commissioned on August \n10, 2001. He wanted to serve his country, and he found very quickly \nafter he graduated that he would have that opportunity.\n  Lieutenant Lewis has served two terms in Iraq, two tours in Operation \nIraqi Freedom I and II. During his second tour, on August 5, 2004, \nLieutenant Lewis was badly wounded in Najaf, while leading his platoon \nof 35 Marines into conflict against a group of insurgents. A rocket-\npropelled grenade grazed off his helmet and exploded, leaving him \nblinded and severely wounded. He survived the blast, and following \nnumerous surgeries after returning home, he has regained partial vision \nin one eye. He was awarded the Purple Heart, and the Navy and Marine \nCorps Commendation Medal with V for his service.\n  But he still wanted to serve his country. He was frustrated by the \nnegative image of the war portrayed by the media. So Lieutenant Lewis \ncame to Washington and applied for a job on my staff. And I am very \npleased to report that he is sitting with me on the floor today, a \nvaluable member of my staff.\n  Lieutenant Lewis, like so many of his brothers and sisters in the \nArmed Forces, has sacrificed for our country, none more than the three \nwho were ambushed just last week and have given the ultimate sacrifice \nfor our country. Private First Class Menchaca from Houston, TX, Private \nFirst Class Tucker from Madras, OR, and Specialist David Babineau from \nSpringfield, MA. We are horrified by what we have heard of the deaths \nof Private First Class Menchaca and Private First Class Tucker. My \nthoughts and prayers go out to them and their families. But I cannot \nimagine anything worse than what has already happened to those two \npeople and their families, along with Specialist Babineau and \nLieutenant Lewis, I cannot imagine anything worse than for us to pass a \nresolution that says we are going to stop our commitment because we \njust can't take it anymore. It is like saying, the cause for which they \nhave paid such a price really wasn't worth sticking with it.\n  This war on terror must be won at all costs. If we step back and say \nwe are willing to walk away because times are too tough, we have \njeopardized the 2,502 who have given the ultimate sacrifice in this war \non terror. Furthermore, we are giving away the security of future \ngenerations. We are saying that we are not going to protect freedom \nbecause it might be too tough.\n  If we did this, the terrorists would surely be emboldened. They \nattacked us, according to Osama bin Laden, on 9/11 because of our \nreaction to previous attacks: The USS Cole, the bombings of our \nembassies in East Africa, Somalia, the bombing of Khobar Towers, and \nthe first attacks on the World Trade Center. We treated it like this \nwas going to be a criminal case, and we had to have justice in court. \nThe terrorists got the message that America's attention span wouldn't \nlast very long, not long enough certainly to see through an entire war \non these people who would take away the freedom of our children.\n  I cannot imagine telling the terrorists that if times get too tough, \nif you are too horrible, if you do things that we cannot even imagine \nbecause we are a civilized society, we are going to turn around and run \naway. I cannot imagine saying that America will not have the stamina to \nstand up and fight and win a war at all costs for the freedom of future \ngenerations.\n  That is the message we would send to our enemies. What about the \nmessage we would send to our allies? You know, this resolution and \nprevious resolutions have called on President Bush to get more \ninternational involvement in the war on terror. I know President Bush \nhas tried to get international involvement, and we have international \ninvolvement. But what country would ever step up to the plate and be by \nthe side of the United States of America in the future if we say: We \nare going to set a timetable, and if it gets too tough we are going to \nleave, but we sure appreciate your coming and being with us, until it \ngets too hard? That cannot be the role of the greatest country on \nEarth. If we show that kind of weakness, we will no longer have allies, \nand we will certainly have plenty of enemies.\n  If we establish a timetable for redeploying our troops from Iraq by \nthe end of the year or by July of next year, we are handing the enemy \nour playbook. We would be saying that in 194 days our commitment is \ngoing to end. Why they picked 194 days to say that our attention span \nwould last, I don't know. But it would be 194 days for the Government \nof Iraq to get up and going, for the security forces to be trained, 194 \ndays to root out the insurgency, and 194 days to stand beside our \nallies and by the Government that is forming in Iraq. That is not the \nrole of the United States of America.\n  It has been mentioned on the floor that there is an opinion piece in \nthe Washington Post yesterday from an Iraqi adviser saying Iraq needs \nto learn from its mistakes and Iraq needs to stand on its own. No one \nwants Iraq to be able to stand on its own more than the United States \nof America. We have shown that. But does anyone in this body believe \nthat Iraq is totally in control of Iraqis today? Does anyone believe \nthere are not insurgents and agitators from other parts of the world? \nAl-Qaida? Iran? Other terrorist organizations that have come into Iraq \nfor the specific purpose of destabilizing that country?\n  If you do believe it is just Iraqis who are there and if everyone \nelse leaves they will be able to settle their differences, then this \nresolution would be just fine. But that is just a fantasy. Of course \nthere are insurgents from other parts of the world. Of course there is \nal-Qaida right in the middle of Iraq. The last thing the terrorists \nwant is a stabilized Iraq. That is why they are fighting so hard. So we \nwould say to this fledgling Government that has just been able to get \non its feet but is still struggling, that has trained soldiers but not \nnearly enough because the insurgents continue to bomb their police \nheadquarters and recruiting headquarters, we would say to them: We are \ngoing to leave you on your own and hope for the best.\n  Can you imagine what would happen in Iraq if America says we are \nleaving at the end of this year, we are going to start to pull out \ntroops, and then we are going to finish by July of next year or \nwhatever date would be determined by the authors of this amendment? Who \nwould be in control of Iraq? Anybody who believes that it would be \nIraqis, with the condition they are in, is just not looking at the \nreality. So I cannot think of anything worse that I could say to the \nfamily of Private Menchaca, from Houston, TX, or his 18-year-old wife \nwho is with her family, than--the very week that this young man paid a \nterrible price for a cause he believed in--that we are not really \ncommitted to the cause. I cannot imagine anything more disheartening to \nLieutenant Lewis, who has already served twice in Iraq and wanted to \ncome and do more for his country, than to say: I am glad you are \ncommitted, but the Senate just isn't there with you.\n  No. No. The United States of America and the Senate representing the \n50 States of this Nation must not pass a resolution that would walk \naway from our commitment to the cause of freedom for the citizens of \nthe United\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nStates, because that is what is at stake here. It is not the Iraqi \npeople alone in this fight. We are fighting terrorists on their turf. \nWe have not had an attack in the United States of America because we \nhave been vigilant in keeping them on their turf, containing them on \ntheir turf, and building up our homeland security at the same time. We \nmust keep the word and the commitment of the greatest Nation on Earth, \nand we must keep the trust of the people that we are going to keep the \nwill to fight for freedom for their children and their children's \nchildren. That is what is at stake in this resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to think of the consequences of cutting and \nrunning from a fight that is much bigger than the stabilization of \nIraq. It is for the freedom and the way of life of Americans and our \nallies throughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would you advise the managers as to the \nallocation of time still remaining under the control of each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1 hour 14 minutes; the \nminority has 1 hour 26 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Salazar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Levin-Reed amendment on our Iraq policy.\n  The United States of America has already invested mightily in helping \nthe Iraqi people. It is now time for the United States to make a clear \nand specific statement that the Iraqi people must assume the \nresponsibility for finding Iraqi solutions to the challenges they face.\n  Indeed, that is exactly what the Iraqi government has said it wants. \nJust a few days ago, the new Iraqi National Security Advisor, Mowaffak \nal-Rubaie, stated that the Iraqi government anticipates some drawdown \nin U.S. troop numbers by the end of this year and continuing in 2007. \nHe also said:\n\n       The removal of troops will also allow the Iraqi government \n     to engage with some of our neighbors that have to date been \n     at the very least sympathetic to the resistance because of \n     what they call the ``coalition occupation.''\n\n  Finally, he made the statement:\n\n       The removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's \n     government in the eyes of its people.\n  The security adviser continued and essentially said that there would \nbe a gradual transition from the American troop presence there in Iraq. \nSo our amendment builds on what the Iraqi Government is telling us that \nthey want.\n  America has invested life, blood, and treasure in Iraq over the past \n3\\1/2\\ years. Mr. President, 2,506 U.S. servicemen and women have been \nkilled; Over 18,500 servicemen and women have been wounded: and some \n$320 billion taxpayer dollars have been appropriated.\n  We all recognize that U.S. forces cannot and should not remain in \nIraq indefinitely. Yesterday the House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly to retain language indicating that the U.S. will not \nconstruct permanent bases in Iraq precisely because they wanted to send \na signal to Americans and to Iraqis--we don't plan on staying forever.\n  Last year the Senate joined together in calling for 2006 to be the \nyear of transition in Iraq. That was a positive step, one that helped \nbring unity and cohesion to a debate too often marked by partisan \nrancor. Now we can take another constructive step together by \nsupporting this well-thought-out amendment.\n  The Levin-Reed amendment affirms the statement that the Senate made \nlast year: 2006 should be a year of transition in Iraq. It asks the \nPresident to present a flexible plan for that ongoing transition--one \nthat can give some shape and direction to the oft-repeated mantra that \n``as the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.''\n  Let me just outline what this amendment does.\n  It states that an open-ended commitment in Iraq is unsustainable, and \nurges the following actions be undertaken to help the American people \nand the Iraqi people achieve success.\n  The Iraqis should take steps to promote more power sharing in Iraq, \nincluding through Constitutional changes, to avert civil conflict.\n  The President of the United States should convene an international \nsummit on Iraq to increase burden-sharing in efforts to stabilize the \ncountry.\n  The government of Iraq should disarm militias and insist on integrity \nin the Iraqi armed forces and police.\n  The U.S. President should begin the transition of U.S. forces to a \nlimited, three-fold mission. That mission would involve continued \ntraining of Iraqi forces, protecting U.S. assets and personnel, and \ntargeted counter-terrorism activities, and by the end of 2006, the \nPresident should submit a plan to Congress for continuing the phased \nredeployment.\n  The U.S. should continue heavy diplomatic engagement in Iraq for the \nforeseeable future.\n  The President should assess the impact that our operations in Iraq \nare having on the overall US campaign against terrorism worldwide.\n  One thing that has become apparent in recent months is that many \nAmericans are losing confidence in our Iraq policy--not in our \nservicemen and women, but in our policy. I know that history tells us \nthat the U.S. is most successful in undertakings of this magnitude and \ndifficulty when the American people are wholeheartedly behind the \neffort. It is my sincere hope that this amendment, and the plan for \nphased redeployment appropriate to conditions on the ground that it \ncalls for, will help contribute to success in Iraq by giving the \nAmerican people new confidence that we are moving toward a clear \ndestination, along a distinct path.\n  It is precisely because I recognize that stability in Iraq is \nimportant, and because I want this mission to succeed, that I am \npleased to cosponsor this amendment. The only path to sustainable \nstability in Iraq requires Iraqis assuming responsibility for their own \nsecurity and making the political accommodations necessary to avert \ncivil war. The U.S. cannot do this for them. An open-ended policy in \nIraq is not helping matters--it is letting extremist and divisive \nelements hide behind the cloak of nationalism, and it is providing a \nrationale for postponing tough choices which must be made by the Iraqi \npeople.\n  And so those who would rather engage in mudslinging, those who would \nrather politicize this vital national security issue than deal with the \nreality that the only choices before us are tough choices, need to \nthink again. We all in this Chamber, I believe, want success in Iraq. \nWe need to work with the democratically-elected Iraqi government to get \nthere. This amendment is in step with their vision.\n  I want to succeed in Iraq, and I also want our broader foreign policy \ngoal to succeed--the goal of defeating the terrorist networks that wish \nto do us harm. It is precisely because I am concerned about the \nconsequences for our national security of an open-ended commitment to \nkeep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq that I support \nthe Levin-Reed amendment. The fight against terrorism is a global \nendeavor, and for years Iraq has been sucking up most the resources, \nthe troops, and the political will and capital in this room. This \namendment calls on the administration to responsibly assess and adjust \nour policies so that we don't strain our military to the breaking point \neven as a global struggle rages on for years and perhaps decades to \ncome.\n  The very fact that this amendment is likely to be criticized from \nboth sides in the Iraq debate is, in my view, an endorsement of its \nlanguage. This amendment rejects any call for an immediate withdrawal, \nbecause that would be irresponsible and would not serve our national \ninterests. A failed Iraqi state would further destabilize an already \nvolatile region, creating a lasting haven for terrorists. Our national \nsecurity imperatives mandate our commitment to Iraq's success. There is \nno cutting, there is no running in this language. There is no deadline. \nThere is no arbitrary timeframe.\n  But it also rejects the fingers-crossed, stay the meandering-course \napproach favored by those whose strategy seems to involve little more \nthan hoping for the best. Optimism is a terrific attitude, but it's not \na policy.\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\n  Success in Iraq is dependent on several factors: controlling \nviolence, creating a stable government of national unity, delivering \nbasic services and the promise of economic development to the Iraqi \npeople, and establishing strong and supportive relations between Iraq \nand its neighbors in the region. If any of these pillars are missing, \nIraq's future becomes uncertain and unstable. America can help, but \nultimately the Iraqis must achieve these goals on their own.\n  This amendment calls for us to begin shifting that responsibility, \neven as we work to shore up international cooperation and support and \nreaffirm our commitment to intense ongoing engagement.\n  Since I became a United States Senator, I have twice traveled to Iraq \nto get a better sense of the status of our mission. Each time, I have \nbeen overwhelmed with admiration for our servicemen and women who are \nserving so honorably, and who, along with their families, are \nsacrificing so much.\n  I am so proud of our troops and we must do right by them. Sitting on \nour hands while policy drifts from one goal and mission to another with \nno end in sight just isn't good enough. By the end of this year, we \nwill have been in Iraq nearly as long as we were engaged in World War \nII, but as sectarian violence is on the rise, the picture is getting \nmurkier and murkier. Congress needs to get into the mix--but to get in \nresponsibly. I hope that my colleagues, both those who support this \namendment and those who find fault with it, will engage in this debate \nin that spirit. Our men and women in uniform, and the American people, \ndeserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, since the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, \n2,808 American men and women have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Of that \nnumber, 63 are Oregonians, or those who have Oregon ties. There are 63 \npatriots among that total.\n  I rise today to honor them, but I also feel compelled to come here \nthis afternoon to pay particular honor to Tom Tucker who recently lost \nhis life and to do what I can through my words to assuage in some \npossible way, if possible, the grief of his parents, Wes and Meg Tucker \nof Madras, OR. Army PVT Thomas Tucker was born in Pineville, OR, in \ncentral Oregon, in the beautiful rimrock country of that part of our \nState. He grew up in Madras and graduated from Madras High School in \n1999. He worked in a variety of jobs before feeling the call to serve \nhis country and enlisted in the U.S. Army in July of 2005. He was \nattached to the First Battalion of the 502nd Infantry Regiment of the \nSecond Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. He has been in Iraq since \nFebruary of 2006.\n  When word came through that he had been taken hostage by al-Qaida \nfighters in Iraq, I called his father Wes. I wasn't very far into the \nconversation when it was clear to me that I was talking to a dad who \nwas also a patriot, was proud of his son and fearful for the \nconsequences that may befall him.\n  The worst-of-all news came out when the whole country, and \nparticularly my State, learned not only that Thomas had given his life \nbut that he had been tortured, that his body had been defiled and had \nbeen booby-trapped to take the lives of other American soldiers.\n  I have no words sufficient to tell the Tucker family how truly sorry \nI am for the extent of their loss. Yet I stand in awe and amazement \nthat this morning on the NBC ``Today'' program there came Wes Tucker's \nface. And he said: ``Our son, as far as we are concerned, has died for \nthe freedom of everyone in the United States.''\n  I could not agree with him more.\n  Wes and Meg Tucker are made of sterner stuff. They did not blame the \nPresident. They did not blame the military. They simply acknowledged \nthat their son was in the service of his country knowing the risk and \nwilling to sacrifice it all.\n  I salute them, and I will never forget them or their son.\n  I am told by news accounts that Madras, OR, a town of 6,000 people, \nhas now become a family of 6,000 people, gathering around the Tucker \nfamily, to offer whatever consolation they can and the support that is \nrequired, to let the Tucker family know that their son is an American \nhero now and forever.\n  Many wonder, what did Tom die for? I believe, as his father said, \nthat he died for his country, that he died for freedom's sake, and the \ncause of freedom is one that comes with a very high price. It has hit \nhome hard in Oregon today.\n  Al-Qaida is a serpent with many heads. It found Tom, and in finding \nhim revealed the ugliness, the barbarity, the brutality of the enemy \nthat we face.\n  Understand, al-Qaida's words in this war, their purposes, their \nintentions, their objectives are to create--these are not George Bush's \nwords, these are their words--a new califate in the Middle East such as \nexisted for several centuries, ranging from Spain as far as Pakistan, \nto establish sharia law.\n  If you want to know what sharia law is, look at the governments of \nthe Taliban and the brutality that attended their government. It is for \nthe extermination of the state of Israel, and it is for the holding \nhostage of western civilization. I believe Tom Tucker died in \nopposition to these hideous aims of our enemies on Earth today.\n  Anyone who believes that America does not have a stake in this is \ndeeply mistaking themselves.\n  During my first term in the U.S. Senate I served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I wasn't on that committee long until I was simply \namazed and overwhelmed in terms of my schedule by the number of foreign \nleaders who sought out an audience in my office seeking trade, aid, and \nmilitary alliance with the United States.\n  I used to wonder, why do they come to us? Why must we solve their \nproblems? It was evident because they knew America had values for which \nit was willing to pay a high price.\n  So I have to ask, why us? And history's answer is, why not us?\n  In the 20th century, the United States of America and a number of our \nstalwart friends--the British come quickly to mind--have filled the \nvoid to stop tyranny when our defense, first, our interests, our values \nand our allies required our help. It is no different now in 21st \ncentury.\n  We all want our kids to come home. I pray for that daily. And I am \nthankful that their numbers are declining and that they are coming \nhome.\n  What this debate is about and the difference we share with our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle is simply the wisdom of \nannouncing a date for withdrawal.\n  As I have studied history, I have never found an instance whereby \nvictory is won by announcing retreat. Wisdom counsels, I believe, that \nwe hold our cards closer to our vest.\n  Al-Qaida is counting on us to go home just as they cite in their Web \nsites our retreat from Beirut, our inaction in the face of innumerable, \noutrageous terrorist attacks during the 1990s--and they took it all for \nweakness.\n  I want our kids to come home. But I want us to see the ugly face of \nal-Qaida and understand the deadliness and earnestness of their \npurposes and how antithetical they are to the future of this Nation and \nto the future of our children and to the civilization that we enjoy in \nsuch abundance in this blessed land.\n  Al-Qaida is counting on us to set a date. It is for that reason that \nI will vote against any amendment that sets a date.\n  I want to express to my colleagues on the other side that the \nrhetoric is too heated. When I hear things like ``Bush lied, kids \ndied,'' or even on our side, ``retreat''--and whatever the mantra is--\nmy soul cries out for something more dignified.\n  I don't believe their dissent is unpatriotic. I simply believe it to \nbe unwise. It is a tactical mistake of monumental proportions.\n  I do not know how long the war on terror will go. But I do know that \nwe have an interest in it. We learned that interest on 9/11. We learn \nthat interest with the death of every soldier.\n  I yield the floor with a plea that we keep our tactics to ourselves \nand that we understand that America will not be defeated but that we \ncan defeat ourselves.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  I urge opposition to the Levin amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto say to my colleague, what a truly heartfelt, remarkable set of \ncomments. I thank the Senator for contributing to this important \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I begin my remarks, by coincidence, I am \nfollowing my good friend from Oregon, Gordon Smith. It is purely by \ncoincidence that we are lined up to address our thoughts on this \nimportant and most critical issue facing our country. I say to my \ncolleague from Oregon, my opening comments are exactly the Senator's \nclosing comments.\n  I plead with my colleagues during the remaining hours of this debate \nto try to stay away from the personal attacks and the mindless use of \nlabels that we are tempted to gravitate to in order to impassion our \nconstituencies. Such approaches do little to contribute to an \nunderstanding of the important subject before the Senate.\n  The Senator from Oregon eloquently described the loss of Thomas \nTucker and of Kristian Menchaca from Houston, TX, the insane and \nhideous loss of life, and how it occurred. These young men and the \n2,500 others who have lost their lives, along with the 18,000 who have \nbeen permanently injured, deserve better than some of the rhetoric and \nsome of the discussion I have heard over the last number of days in \ntalking about this issue.\n  I believe all 100 Senators in this Chamber care deeply about what \nhappens to our men and women in uniform. I don't question for a single \nminute the patriotism of a single colleague. While we may disagree \nabout how to successfully conduct our policies with respect to Iraq, we \nall deserve to give to our constituencies an intelligent discussion of \nthese matters rather than resort to language of ``cut and run'' or \n``lie and die'' or other such talk. It is that kind of rhetoric which \ncauses most of our constituents to become disgusted with Congress.\n  I may disagree with my colleague from Oregon over the Levin \namendment. In fact, I am a cosponsor of this amendment, and I believe \nCarl Levin and Jack Reed have put us on the right track, which I am \ngoing to explain. I can fully respect those with a different point of \nview in all of this, while disagreeing with them. I do not question for \na minute any Senator's goals or patriotism. I hope the rest of my \ncolleagues over the remaining hours will conduct themselves \naccordingly. Before giving your speech, read the speech of Gordon Smith \nand then decide whether you are going to engage in the kind of talk you \nmay have prepared in your remarks in this Senate.\n  I thank Carl Levin, Jack Reed, and others who put this amendment \ntogether, which I have asked to be a supporter of. It is a major step \nin getting our Iraq policy headed in the right direction. I also thank \nour colleagues who met on numerous occasions over the last several \nweeks, to have discussions about how best to frame this amendment. They \nwere thoughtful discussions which I was pleased to participate in with \nSenators Carl Levin, Joe Biden, Harry Reid, Jack Reed, Dianne \nFeinstein, Dick Durbin, John Kerry, and Russ Feingold. The Levin \namendment is a consensus product of those conversations. Any one of us \ndeveloping an amendment on this subject might have done it somewhat \ndifferently, emphasized some ideas more than others, included more \nspecificity in the information we are seeking from the President with \nrespect to benchmarks and a timeframe for the significant redeployment \nof U.S. forces from Iraq. But I believe that the amendment that emerged \nfrom that process is useful for a serious and important debate on the \nneed to begin the process of redeploying our forces this year from Iraq \nand turning over full responsibility for governing that country to \nIraq's democratically elected leaders.\n  I believe very strongly that it is very appropriate we begin any \ndiscussion about Iraq by first commending our men and women in uniform \nwho have served so nobly there. Whatever else your views may be, it is \ncritically important that they know this great Senate respects and \nhonors their service. Our men and women in uniform have performed with \nhonor, bravery, and skill in attempting to bring order and stability \ninto the post-Saddam Iraq. They have put themselves in harm's way, as I \nsaid a moment ago. More than 2,500 of our sons and daughters have given \ntheir lives serving our Nation. Thousands more have suffered life-\naltering injuries. The American people and the Iraqi people owe them, \nmore than any other group, in my view, a great debt of gratitude for \ntheir service.\n  We in Congress must continue to provide them with every resource to \nensure they return home safely and as expeditiously as possible. \nWhatever disagreements may arise during the course of our debate about \nthe administration's Iraq policy, those disagreements should in no way \nbe interpreted as criticisms of our troops. Every one of my colleagues, \nas I said a moment ago, cares deeply and respects deeply the service of \nthese men and women in uniform.\n  Our disagreement with the President and his administration is that we \nbelieved we were misled in 2002 about the rationale for going to war in \nIraq. There was hyped intelligence, cherrypicking of intelligence data \nto paint a picture of a threat, in my view, that did not exist at the \ntime. That is and was unconscionable.\n  After the war began, the President continued to mislead America about \nthe course of the war, the adequacy of planning, the postwar \nreconstruction, and the bill the American people would be asked to pay \nfor the cost of U.S. involvement. Key members of the administration \nplayed critical roles in disseminating information that was inaccurate.\n  I have said on a number of occasions that if I had known then what I \nknow now--namely, that Saddam Hussein possessed no weapons of mass \ndestruction--I would not have given the President my vote for a \nresolution to use force in Iraq. I doubt there would have been a vote \nhad all Members been aware of the information we now know exists.\n  Having said all of that, it is not possible to turn back the clock. \nWe are where we are with respect to our involvement in Iraq. Sectarian \nviolence has now outpaced that of foreign jihadists and ex-Baathists \nand insurgents as the greatest threat confronting American and Iraqi \nforces and Iraqi civilians. Ethnic mistrust, according to a recent \ncable from our Ambassador in Iraq to Secretary of State Rice, is \nincreasingly ripping that country apart at the seams. That is from our \nAmbassador in Baghdad.\n  According to that same cable from our Ambassador--and I am not \nquoting, but this is the substance--the Iraqi people largely blame, \nunfortunately, the United States for the current situation, seeing \ntheir own Government as a puppet of the United States and believing \nthat much of the violence in Iraq is being allowed by the United States \nas a type of retribution for the problems we faced in our mission to \nIraq. Those are not my views but the views expressed by the American \nAmbassador in Baghdad writing to the Secretary of State saying this is \nhow we are perceived. I strongly object to that kind of conclusion, but \nthat is the conclusion of our Ambassador.\n  Iraq's economy is also in a shambles. Three years after major combat \noperations ended, the Iraqi infrastructure remains inadequate by every \nmeasure. Oil production, electricity generation, and the availability \nof clean water are all below prewar levels. Schools and hospitals lack \nadequate supplies and personnel. No matter how the administration tries \nto paint the picture, the reality which we all accept and know is that \nthe chaos in Iraq is transparent and it is growing.\n  Most importantly, Iraq's elected Government is now poised to \nfunction, but only after 5 months of political haggling over key \nCabinet and sub-Cabinet posts. That is the reality, colleagues, that \nthe U.S. policy must now address in Iraq.\n\n  To be fair, there has been some good news. Over the last 10 days, \nparticularly with the announcement that U.S. forces were able to detect \nand eliminate the Jordanian terrorist Abu\n\n[[Page S6220]]\n\nMus'ab Al-Zarqawi, al-Qaida's henchman in Iraq and the architect of the \nbrutal attacks against U.S. military personnel and Iraqi civilians \nalike. We can be justifiably proud, and should be, of how the United \nStates and Iraqi forces, together, carried out this extremely dangerous \nand important mission. It is also a positive development that the Iraqi \nGovernment is now as its full capacity, with all Cabinet positions \nfilled, particularly the critical national security posts. That is the \ngood news. It is important to cite that as well.\n  Now that this Government of Iraq is a reality, it is also an \nimportant and appropriate moment for U.S. policymakers to take stock of \nour policy in Iraq and consider the next steps to turning over full \nresponsibility to Iraq's democratically elected government.\n  Let me remind our colleagues, last year, President Bush signed into \nlaw as part of the fiscal year 2006 Defense Authorization Act a \nprovision that states:\n\n       Calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant \n     transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \n     forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \n     sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for the \n     phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.\n\n  I commend, as I should have at the outset, the chairman of the \ncommittee, my good friend from Virginia, John Warner. He has done a \nwonderful job allowing debate in the committee, bringing witnesses \nforward, allowing dissent to occur where appropriate, and authoring \nthis language last year in that Defense authorization bill which the \nPresident signed into law calling for this year to be a year of \ntransition. Those words were important. They were not crafted in a \ncavalier fashion; they were put together carefully in a bipartisan \nfashion as a message to the American people and to the Iraqi people and \ntheir Government. This year--2006--would be a year of transition for \nIraq's leaders to assume greater responsibility over security matters \nand other challenges facing their country.\n  There have now been national elections in Iraq. A permanent broad-\nbased government has been formed. It is important that the Iraqis now \ntake on a significant role in establishing domestic security. \nUltimately, a solution in Iraq will not be achieved through U.S. \nmilitary action alone but, rather, through the political will and \nsubstantive action on the part of the new Iraqi Government to bring \nvarious factions in their country together.\n  In short, the future of Iraq ultimately rests with the Iraqi people, \nnot with U.S. military might, not with the size of our treasury, but on \nthe resolve of the Iraqi people and their leaders. That is where their \nfuture rests. Let's be clear however about our role in that process.\n  We should continue to assist this nascent Government in Iraq during \nthese difficult times. But at the same time, we must also refocus the \nnature of that assistance if we are going to succeed and if Iraq is \ngoing to succeed. Iraq's problems are essentially political problems \nthat call out for political solutions. It is becoming increasingly \nevident, I think to all of us, that a continuing substantial U.S. troop \npresence in and around Iraqi cities is not the answer at all. In fact, \nthe road to any success in Iraq will be contingent on a lessening of \nU.S. military presence, if, in fact, the U.S. Ambassador is right in \nhis message to our Secretary of State. And having visited Iraq on two \noccasions I believe he is right.\n  We have won the larger war against Iraq's dictator but at no small \ncost. It has been a successful effort in that regard. Saddam has been \ntoppled and is on trial. A new democratically elected Iraqi Government \nis now in place. Al-Zarqawi has been killed. Those are successes.\n  The remaining mission, however, of stabilizing Iraq and bringing \nfactions together is something that can only be done by Iraq's new \nGovernment and its citizens. An indefinite and prolonged U.S. troop \npresence in that country is quickly reaching a point of diminishing \nreturns.\n  I am a realist and an optimist. I recognize American involvement in \nIraq and the gulf region will be required for years to come. It is a \nvery important neighborhood in which we have very important interests. \nIt is a dangerous neighborhood, as well. And we have vital national \ninterests at stake there. But we have other important global interests, \nas well; among these combating the threat of global terrorism and \nterrorist organizations. Global terrorism is and remains our greatest \nthreat.\n  In that context, I don't think it is unpatriotic or otherwise \ninappropriate for the supporters of the pending amendment to ask \nPresident Bush to tell the American people, tell the U.S. Congress, \nwhen and how he plans to successfully conclude the U.S. military \npresence in Iraq so that U.S. forces can be redeployed to more \neffectively combat global terrorism and protect our vital national \ninterests.\n  Why was it reasonable and appropriate for the administration to set \ndeadlines for Iraqis and unreasonable to set deadlines for itself? The \nBush administration set a deadline for the establishment of an interim \ngovernment, a deadline for writing a Constitution and for holding a \nreferendum to approve it, and a deadline for holding elections for a \npermanent Iraqi government. Guess what. It worked. The Iraqi political \nleadership met the challenges. It wasn't always easy and the process \nwasn't perfect, but it produced results because we insisted upon those \ndeadlines. In fact, I would argue had we not set deadlines, I believe \nwe would be facing a very different picture in Iraq today.\n  I believe U.S. interests in Iraq can be advanced by developing \nbenchmarks and a timeframe for getting done what needs to be done to \nproduce the success we all need and want in Iraq. I don't mean to \nsuggest that U.S. forces should in any way be precipitously redeployed \nfrom Iraq next week or next month--that would be a mistake, in my \nview--but I do believe it is imperative for planning purposes to think \nabout benchmarks and a realistic timeframe within which U.S. force \nlevels can be significantly reduced below the current level of 130,000.\n\n  The benchmarks are fairly obvious: a unity government that equitably \nrepresents the interests of and distributes resources to all sectors of \nIraq; professionalism of Iraq's security and police forces; disbanding \nof sectarian militias; the creation of a gulf regional security \numbrella to enhance stability and deter unwanted interference by \nIraqi's neighbors; and greater international participation and \nresources in Iraq's reconstruction agenda.\n  These are all obvious and necessary benchmarks. The more quickly the \nbenchmarks are realized, the more hopeful we can be for Iraq's future.\n  It is both realistic and, in my view, possible to achieve these \nbenchmarks within the next 12 to 18 months. Whether we achieve them \ndepends on the determination of the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi \npeople to assume responsibility for their shared future--not on the \nmilitary might of the United States.\n  And in conjunction with such progress, I think it is also realistic \nand possible to undertake the phased strategic redeployment of our \nforces from Iraq to other nations in the gulf and to other regions \nposing significant terrorist threats to our country. The details of any \nredeployment should appropriately be left to our military commanders on \nthe ground to work out, in consultation with Iraqi leaders. This is a \nvery critical and central point. Let me repeat it. The details of any \nredeployment should be appropriately left to our military commanders on \nthe ground to work out, in consultation with Iraqi leaders. But we must \nno longer remain in an open-ended commitment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 additional minute to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. The Iraqis are going to have to take responsibility for \ntheir future. This, in my view, is a strategy for success in Iraq. This \nis a reasoned and responsible approach. It is realistic. This is not \ncut-and-run. The alternative is for more of the same, in my view--\nendless occupation, violence, instability, and the erosion of America's \nglobal leadership and national security.\n  I do not underestimate the challenges facing the Iraqi people. They\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\nwill need to make an extraordinary effort in the coming months and \nyears to secure their future. But we have been giving them the \nnecessary tools to do so. Let's not forget when the President signed \nthe Defense authorization bill into law last year, again, those words: \nThis should be the year of transition.\n  We have given the Iraqis the necessary tools. Now it is up to them. \nThe sage words of Benjamin Franklin, following the success of the 1787 \nConstitutional Convention come to mind in thinking about Iraq at this \nmoment in history. When Franklin was approached by a Mrs. Powell of \nPhiladelphia on the streets of Philadelphia and said to him: What have \nyou given us?--Ben Franklin said to that woman: Mrs. Powell, we have \ngiven you ``a republic, if you can keep it.'' The Iraqi people are \nasking a similar question of us: What have we given them? We have given \nthem a republic, if they can keep it. But it is up to them to keep it.\n  I urge the adoption of the Levin amendment. It puts us on the right \nroad for success.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the terrorists have had a very \ndifficult almost 5 years since 9/11. That was clearly the high-water \nmark, their attack on America, the killing of over 3,000 people.\n  Ever since that day, they have been on defense because the President, \nwith widespread support in the Congress, decided to go on offense. And \nfor the last 4\\1/2\\ years, we have been killing terrorists, capturing \nterrorists. Many are hiding in their caves. We have liberated 50 \nmillion people in Afghanistan and Iraq. The number of rogue regimes, \nwhich numbered four when President Bush took office--at that time there \nwas Libya, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea--is now down to two. Libya and \nIraq no longer threaten their neighbors. The terrorists have had a very \ndifficult 5 years.\n  Now, the President made it clear at the beginning of this war--and we \nall agreed--that there was not going to be a sort of clear end date. I \nhave heard this conflict compared, by many of our colleagues, to the \nlength of time in Korea or the length of time in World War II. It seems \nto me those comparisons are not apt. They do not apply to the current \nwar in which we are engaged.\n  No one predicts a kind of ticker-tape parade at the end of this \nconflict. We are dealing with international gangsters who move across \nborders, who are adept at using the Internet and other modern means of \ncommunication.\n  The best way, then, to measure success in the war on terrorism is \nthis: Have we been attacked again here at home since 9/11? While none \nof us would confidently predict that will never happen again, it is \ntruly remarkable that we have not been attacked again since 9/11. I \nwonder why that is. Just good luck? A quirk of fate? Or good policy? It \nis no accident we have not been attacked again since 9/11. We have been \non offense going after the terrorists where they are so they have to \nconfine their mischief to their territory and not here.\n  So it is a statement of the obvious that they want us out of Iraq. \nThey saw what happened in Beirut in the 1980s. They saw what happened \nin Somalia in the 1990s. In fact, they are anticipating it, and we have \ntheir own words. We have their own words. Ayman al-Zawahiri, No. 2 to \nOsama bin Laden, in a message to the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed 2 \nweeks ago in Iraq--last year intercepted by us--this is what al-\nZawahiri had said to say: The Jihad in Iraq requires several \nincremental goals . . . The first stage: Expel the Americans from Iraq. \n. . . The second stage: Establish an Islamic authority . . . in order \nto fill the void stemming from the departure of the Americans, \nimmediately upon their exit and before un-Islamic forces attempt to \nfill this void. . . . The third stage: Extend the Jihad wave to the \nsecular countries neighboring Iraq . . . the mujahedin must not have \ntheir mission end with the expulsion of the Americans from Iraq . . . \ntheir ongoing mission is to establish an Islamic state, and defend it, \nand for every generation to hand over the banner to the one after it \nuntil the Hour of Resurrection. . . . The Americans will exit soon, God \nwilling.\n  We do not have to guess about what their goals are. They have been \nquite clear about it--quite clear about it.\n  So here we are debating which kind of exit date, which kind of \nannouncement of imminent departure we are going to send in a message to \nthem.\n  Our good friend from Massachusetts, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, has had no less than four different plans over the last \n12 months or so. The first plan of the Senator from Massachusetts was \nto withdraw 20,000 troops by the end of 2005 and the bulk of troops out \nby the end of 2006. That was Senator Kerry's first plan.\n  Senator Kerry's second plan: to withdraw if the Iraq Government was \nnot finalized by May 15 of this year. The third plan of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, which we had an opportunity to vote on last week, \nwas to have all the troops out by the end of this year. Fortunately, \nonly six Senators--six--voted to have all the troops out by the end of \nthis year.\n\n  And tomorrow we will have Senator Kerry's fourth plan, which is to \nhave the withdrawal consummated by July 1 of next year--about a year \nfrom now.\n  So four different plans--a kind of floating withdrawal date. But the \none thing all the plans have in common is they send a message to the \nother side that if you can hang on until a date certain, we are on the \nway out.\n  We heard the distinguished Senator from Oregon mention earlier he had \nnot been able to find a single time in history in which setting a \nspecific time for withdrawal produced a positive result.\n  One thing we know for sure, if they drive us out of Iraq, they will \nsoon be back here. If they drive us out of Iraq, they will soon be back \nhere. And they have already demonstrated they had the capacity, the \nintelligence, to carry out catastrophic attacks on us here at home.\n  We all regret and have great anguish over the death of every single \nAmerican soldier. And it is a fact that we have lost 2,500 of our \nfinest in this war. We revere human life, unlike the gangsters in \nBaghdad who mutilated two of our soldiers in the last couple of days.\n  But it is noteworthy that in liberating 50 million people in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, we have lost fewer soldiers than we had Americans \nkilled in one day on 9/11, 2001, and fewer soldiers than we lost in \nNormandy on one day in World War II.\n  We hurt with every loss, but the losses have been quite minimal given \nthe enormity of the task. And the job, of course, has not been \ncompleted. We have to keep on offense, keep after the terrorists, or \nthey will be back here.\n  So I think this is an extremely important debate. I am glad the \nSenate is having it. We have sort of different versions of what kind of \nnotice we are going to give to the enemy--that we are either on the way \nout by a certain day or beginning to pack up to go next door or pack up \nto go somewhere else by a certain time.\n  All of those are not good messages for our own troops, who are \ninvolved in trying to win the conflict, not a good message to the new \nIraqi Government, which is trying to establish itself and get control \nof Baghdad, and the worst possible news to every terrorist anywhere in \nthe world, just aching for an American defeat, after almost 5 years of \na tough situation for them, because they know a lot of their colleagues \nare dead, they know some of their colleagues are at Guantanamo, they \nknow a bunch of their colleagues are hiding in caves, and they know all \nthe rest of their colleagues are occupied on their turf and not on \nours.\n  They would love to get back on offense. They would love to come back \nover here and kill Americans right here at home. But as long as we are \nforward deployed, as long as we are taking out the terrorists where \nthey are, we are winning the war on terror. But we need to keep \nreminding ourselves what the war was about. It was about protecting us \nhere at home. And so far, I would have to say the policy has been \nextraordinarily successful.\n  This is a great debate. We are going to hear from a number of our \ncolleagues over the next day or so. When we finally have votes on both \nthe Levin amendment and the Kerry amendment, I hope they will be \ndefeated, and it will be made clear to the terrorists, once again, that \nwe do not intend to send\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nthem a notice, do not intend to send them a notice that we are on the \nway out by a certain date.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to support the Levin-Reed \namendment, and I also intend to support the Kerry amendment.\n  Both amendments make clear that Democrats are united in our belief \nthat it is time to shift to the Iraqis the responsibility for their own \nfuture and to begin to withdraw our troops from Iraq. It is wrong for \nthe Republican-controlled Congress to be a rubberstamp for the \nPresident's failed policy. We cannot ignore our responsibility to our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  America was wrong to go to war in Iraq in the way we did, when we \ndid, and for the false reasons we were given. There was no immediate \nthreat. There was no persuasive link to al-Qaida. Saddam Hussein was \nnot close to acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  But as my brother Robert Kennedy said in 1968:\n\n       Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation.\n\n  Mindless determination and foolish consistency don't make a better \noutcome likely. With each passing day, the American people are growing \nmore and more impatient with the war in Iraq.\n  They want a policy worthy of the sacrifice of our men and women in \nuniform, not sloganeering and accusations of ``cut and run.'' The \nAmerican people don't want our troops deployed in Iraq indefinitely, \ndefending the same flawed strategy. Staying the course is not an \nacceptable strategy when the course is a failed course.\n  Our military forces have now been deployed in Iraq for 39 months, \nmore than 3 years. That's longer than the 37 months of combat in the \nKorean war. By the end of this year, it will be longer than it took to \nfight and win World War II.\n  The American people want a realistic strategy for our troops to be \nredeployed out of Iraq, and this amendment provides it. It sends clear \nmessage: now that a democratic government has been elected by the Iraqi \npeople, it is time for American troops to begin to come home.\n  We need to view disengagement as part of the solution in Iraq. Our \noverwhelming military presence and our open-ended military commitment \nhave only fueled the insurgency, made America a crutch for the Iraqi \nGovernment, made our country more hated in the world, and made the war \non terrorism harder to win.\n  The best hope for the success of the new Iraqi Government to succeed \nis for us to begin disengaging from Iraq, and they from us. The Iraqi \nGovernment must begin to make its own decisions, make necessary \ncompromises to avoid full-scale civil war, and take responsibility for \nits own future.\n  As Iraq's National Security Adviser wrote in the Washington Post \nyesterday: ``Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United States \nand the coalition, take responsibility for its own decisions, learn \nfrom its own mistakes, and find Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems.''\n  Iraq has had elections, a permanent government has been established, \nmore than 200,000 members of Iraqi security forces have been trained, \nand it is time to begin bringing Americans home. The Levin amendment \nand the Kerry amendment can help us achieve that goal and prevent our \ntroops from being caught in an endless quagmire.\n  The cost of this war in blood and treasure has been far too great. \nMore than $320 billion has already been spent, with no end in sight. A \nrecent estimate by Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz \nsuggests the total cost will exceed $1 trillion.\n  Our military is stretched to the breaking point. Many soldiers have \nbeen deployed more than three times to Iraq.\n  More than 2,500 American lives have been lost, including more than 50 \nsons of Massachusetts. More than 18,000 of our troops have been \nwounded. Clearly, despite the death of Zarqawi, al-Qaida terrorists and \ninsurgents remain determined to kill American soldiers.\n  Despite what Vice President Cheney says about the insurgency being in \nits last throes, the insurgency rages on. Last month, 68 American \nsoldiers were killed in Iraq. Insurgents attacked American soldiers 90 \ntimes a day.\n  We always knew that deposing Saddam Hussein would be easy, but the \nadministration should have foreseen that winning the peace would be \ndifficult. Unfortunately, for our men and women in uniform, the \narrogance of the administration blinded it to the cold, hard realities \nthat our troops would face every day in Iraq.\n  Alarm bells had been ringing, but the Bush administration ignored \nthem.\n  As General Hoar, former head of the Central Command, warned before \nthe war, in September 2002, winning the peace would be bloody. He said: \n``In urban warfare . . . It looks like the last 15 minutes of Saving \nPrivate Ryan.''\n  General John M. Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, warned, before the war, in September of 2002: ``I think if it \ngets to urban warfare, and the likelihood is certainly great that it \ncould . . . it could get very messy. The collateral damage could be \nvery great, and our own casualties could increase significantly.''\n  In fact, in their 1997 book, A World Transformed the first President \nBush and his National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft explained why \nthey didn't go on to Baghdad in the first gulf war. They wrote that it: \n``would have incurred incalculable human and political costs . . . We \nwould have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. The \ncoalition would instantly have collapsed, the Arabs deserting it in \nanger and other allies pulling out as well. Under those circumstances, \nthere was no viable exit strategy we could see. . . . Had we gone the \ninvasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an \noccupying power in a bitterly hostile land.''\n  Those words eerily describe what happened when the current President \nBush ignored that wise advice and invaded Iraq.\n  We must not forget that ultimately this is a debate about real people \nwho are risking their lives every day. With this amendment and the \nKerry amendment, we provide a realistic way out of the quagmire in \nIraq, and I urge my colleagues to support both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. There is \na lot of interest in this debate throughout the world. I am sure \neverybody at home is probably not sitting on the edge of their seats \nlistening to what I am saying, but in many ways this debate will define \nthe U.S. relationship with the Middle East and the world at large for a \nlong time.\n  The authors of this amendment are as patriotic as anyone I have ever \nmet. They are fine Senators. They are smart. They are trying to do what \nthey believe is in the best interest of the country and the world at \nlarge. The problem I have with the amendment and the reason I rise in \nopposition to it is that there is an underlying premise about this \namendment that we need to set timetables to send a signal to the Iraqi \npeople to do their part and to get on with the transition and to stand \nup faster and to get political solutions to hard problems faster so \nthat we can come home, and without this amendment, the Iraqi people may \njust draw this thing out and rely on us too much.\n  I understand your concern, but I take a different view of the Iraqi \npeople. I am here today publicly to say that I could not be more proud \nof standing with the Iraqi people and their Government than I am now. \nWhat we have asked of them, they have delivered. Senator Dodd was \nright. Every time we tried to set deadlines, they delivered. They \ndelivered on some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable. If \nyou want to run for office in Iraq--it is tough in America; they say \nawful, bad things about us in this body when we run--they try to kill \nyou, and they come after your family. So to those\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\nIraqis who have joined the police force for the right reasons, to those \nwho are serving in the military for the right reasons, to those \npoliticians trying to bring that country together with a unity \ncoalition government, my hat is off to you. I admire you. I am proud to \nstand by your side. I have no desire to leave you in a lurch. I have \nevery confidence that you want us gone as much as we want to leave, but \nyou understand your capacity is limited right now.\n  The National Security Adviser said there is a roadmap for us to \nleave, and the Iraqi people want to have the ability to chart their own \ndestiny sooner rather than later.\n  To my friends in the Senate, if the U.S. Congress sets a timetable, \nit is a rebuke of the Government in Iraq. It is a vote of no confidence \nin the Iraqi people, and it will be seen as such on al-Jazeera and \nthroughout the Middle East.\n  There will be a timetable for us to leave. It will be performance \ndriven, and it will be authored by the Iraqi people themselves. The day \nthey set the timetable and they set the benchmarks, it will empower \ntheir Government and their people and it will diminish the terrorists. \nIf we set those timetables and the benchmarks, it will diminish the \nIraqi Government, all of the efforts of the Iraqi people, and empower \nthe terrorists.\n  I hate to say that I disagree with my good friends, but I do. We are \ngoing to come home one day. That day is not so far away. History will \njudge us by not when we left but by what we left behind. I want to \nleave behind a regime capable of pulling off something no one else has \nbeen able to do in the Middle East, a functioning democracy so the \nShias and Sunnis and Kurds can live together under the rule of law and \nthey can take out their differences at the ballot box and the \ncourtroom. It has been 3\\1/2\\ years almost. They have come a long way. \nWe have been at this over 200 years. We still have our problems. Under \nthe best of circumstances it is very difficult to bring people together \nof different backgrounds, religions, and ethnic groups. We had our own \nCivil War. It started in my State. When we wrote our Constitution, \nafter 11 years, women couldn't vote. African Americans were not even \nrecognized as people. We have come a long way, and it has taken us a \nlong time to get there.\n  Our Iraqi friends, the moderates are fighting and dying for their own \nfreedom. They have come a long way in 3\\1/2\\ years. I am begging this \nbody, let us not, as a body, set a timetable that would diminish their \nsacrifice and not recognize it for what it is. The truth is, the Iraqi \nGovernment and the Iraqi people are doing historic things in the \nMideast that no one else has been able to accomplish. They are not \nlazy. They are not indifferent. They are not letting us fight their \nwar. They are fighting it alongside us and dying. They are dying in \nlarger numbers than we are. If they pull this off with our help, the \nworld will be eminently safer. If they fail, moderate forces in the \nMideast will be less likely to rear their head and stand up against \nterrorists, and the terrorists will seize the moment in the decades to \ncome.\n  Never has so much been at stake for mankind and with so few people \nsacrificing. Stand with the Iraqi people. They want us out, but don't \ndiminish their sacrifice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation in Iraq \nand to ask several questions about the withdrawal proposals being \noffered by the other side.\n  Why would we risk our success by a premature withdrawal? Why would we \nrisk handing over Iraq to the terrorists when they are on the run? Why \nwould we send a message to the families who had loved ones die fighting \nfor freedom that it was all in vain? Why would we pass legislation that \ncalls for the withdrawal of our troops and that undermines everything \nwe have achieved? These same questions are being asked by many of my \nconstituents in Colorado.\n  According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, a key newspaper in \nColorado's western slope:\n\n       President Bush and Congress are right not to set a date \n     certain for moving all the troops out of Iraq. That would \n     signal terrorists they only need to hide out until the \n     Americans leave, then reignite their attacks. . . . And it \n     would tell others that our commitment to freedom in the \n     Middle East is limited.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Grand Junction \nDaily Sentinel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Daily Sentinel, June 18, 2006]\n\n             It Would Be Folly for Congress To Cut and Run\n\n       Days after President George W. Bush told the new prime \n     minister of Iraq that the United States would not abandon the \n     fledgling democratic nation to terrorists, both houses of \n     Congress gave the president much-needed overwhelming support \n     for his position.\n       Late Thursday the Senate voted 93-6 to reject a deadline by \n     the end of this year to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq. \n     On Friday, the House voted 256-153 to kill a deadline for \n     withdrawal from Iraq.\n       No one wants to keep American military personnel in that \n     dangerous country indefinitely and risk more than the 2,500 \n     U.S. military personnel who have already sacrificed their \n     lives there. Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that \n     the United States may be able to start reducing its military \n     presence before long.\n       The raid on the safehouse of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi proved to \n     be successful far beyond the death of one important leader. \n     It provided a treasure trove of computer documents and other \n     intelligence that led to more than 400 additional raids and \n     the arrests of more than 700 suspected terrorists.\n       What's more, 140 of the additional raids and many of the \n     arrests were handled entirely by Iraqi forces, without back-\n     up from U.S. troops, a sign that the Iraqi forces are \n     becoming more capable of protecting their country.\n       Additionally, with an Iraqi Cabinet finally in place, the \n     government has initiated much-needed security efforts in and \n     around Baghdad. Those measures haven't eliminated terrorist \n     attacks, but they may be slowing them.\n       Even so, Bush and Congress are right not to set a date-\n     certain for moving all of the troops out of Iraq. That would \n     signal terrorists they only need to hide out until the \n     Americans leave, then reignite their attacks. And it would \n     tell others that our commitment to freedom in the Middle East \n     is limited.\n       There was, to be sure, a good deal of politics involved in \n     the Republicans' push for a vote on Iraq. But it was not \n     entirely the GOP's doing.\n       It was Democrats such as Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts \n     and Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania who have been loudly \n     calling for an immediate troop withdrawal from Iraq. With \n     congressional elections in November, it makes sense to let \n     voters see how their senators and representatives feel about \n     withdrawing now.\n       Nobody should read these votes as unqualified support for \n     Bush administration and the mistakes it has made, especially \n     in underestimating the strength of the terrorists. But the \n     votes do recognize it would be wrong to abandon the Iraqis \n     even as they are beginning to take control of their country. \n     And that's good news, not so much for either party's election \n     prospects, but for the ongoing efforts to overcome the savage \n     forces of Islamofascism.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Relationships between the 3rd Armored Cavalry and the \nlocal community were so strong that the Iraqi mayor of the city of Tall \nAfar actually traveled to Colorado Springs to present these soldiers \nwith a proclamation from the city.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full copy of the proclamation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Office of the Mayor, City of Tall`Afar\n\n\n           In the Name of God the Compassionate and Merciful\n\n       To the Courageous Men and Women of the 3d Armored Cavalry \n     Regiment, who have changed the city of Tall`Afar from a ghost \n     town, in which terrorists spread death and destruction, to a \n     secure city flourishing with life.\n       To the lion-hearts who liberated our city from the grasp of \n     terrorists who were beheading men, women and children in the \n     streets for many months.\n       To those who spread smiles on the faces of our children, \n     and gave us restored hope, through their personal sacrifice \n     and brave fighting, and gave new life to the city after \n     hopelessness darkened our days, and stole our confidence in \n     our ability to reestablish our city.\n       Our city was the main base of operations for Abu Mousab Al \n     Zarqawi. The city was completely held hostage in the hands of \n     his henchmen. Our schools, governmental services, businesses \n     and offices were closed. Our\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\n     streets were silent, and no one dared to walk them. Our \n     people were barricaded in their homes out of fear; death \n     awaited them around every corner. Terrorists occupied and \n     controlled the only hospital in the city. Their savagery \n     reached such a level that they stuffed the corpses of \n     children with explosives and tossed them into the streets in \n     order to kill grieving parents attempting to retrieve the \n     bodies of their young. This was the situation of our city \n     until God prepared and delivered unto them the courageous \n     soldiers of the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment, who liberated \n     this city, ridding it of Zarqawi's followers after harsh \n     fighting, killing many terrorists, and forcing the remaining \n     butchers to flee the city like rats to the surrounding areas, \n     where the bravery of other 3d ACR soldiers in Sinjar, Rabiah, \n     Zumar and Avgani finally destroyed them.\n       I have met many soldiers of the 3d Armored Cavalry \n     Regiment; they are not only courageous men and women, but \n     avenging angels sent by The God Himself to fight the evil of \n     terrorism.\n       The leaders of this Regiment; COL McMaster, COL Armstrong, \n     LTC Hickey, LTC Gibson, and LTC Reilly embody courage, \n     strength, vision and wisdom. Officers and soldiers alike \n     bristle with the confidence and character of knights in a \n     bygone era. The mission they have accomplished, by means of a \n     unique military operation, stands among the finest military \n     feats to date in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and truly deserves \n     to be studied in military science. This military operation \n     was clean, with little collateral damage, despite the \n     ferocity of the enemy. With the skill and precision of \n     surgeons they dealt with the terrorist cancers in the city \n     without causing unnecessary damage.\n       God bless this brave Regiment; God bless the families who \n     dedicated these brave men and women. From the bottom of our \n     hearts we thank the families. They have given us something we \n     will never forget. To the families of those who have given \n     their holy blood for our land, we all bow to you in reverence \n     and to the souls of your loved ones. Their sacrifice was not \n     in vain. They are not dead, but alive, and their souls \n     hovering around us every second of every minute. They will \n     never be forgotten for giving their precious lives. They have \n     sacrificed that which is most valuable. We see them in the \n     smile of every child, and in every flower growing in this \n     land. Let America, their families, and the world be proud of \n     their sacrifice for humanity and life.\n       Finally, no matter how much I write or speak about this \n     brave Regiment, I haven't the words to describe the courage \n     of its officers and soldiers. I pray to God to grant \n     happiness and health to these legendary heroes and their \n     brave families.\n                                   Najim Abdullah Abid Al-Jibouri,\n                                 Mayor of Tall`Afar, Ninewa, Iraq.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Let me read a portion of the proclamation as written by \nthe Najim Abdullah Al-Jibouri, Iraqi mayor of Tall Afar:\n\n       To the Courageous Men and Women of the 3rd Armored Cavalry \n     Regiment, who have changed the city of Tall' Afar from a \n     ghost town, in which terrorists spread death and destruction, \n     to a secure city flourishing with life. . . . Our city was \n     the main base of operations for Abu Mousab Zarqawi. The city \n     was completely held hostage in the hands of his henchmen. . . \n     . Their savagery reached such a level that they stuffed the \n     corpses of children with explosives and tossed them into the \n     streets in order to kill grieving parents . . . this was the \n     situation of our city until God prepared and delivered unto \n     them the courageous soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry \n     Regiment, who liberated this city, ridding it of Zarqawi's \n     followers after harsh fighting.\n\n  The commander of Iraq's 3rd Army Infantry Division, MG Khorsheed Al-\nDosekey, wrote the following in a letter to our soldiers:\n\n       Your ability to plan, the excellent coordination, the \n     overall supervising and the right decisive decisions along \n     with your great leadership have helped us build up the \n     individual soldier and increase his abilities. Your \n     leadership and devotion to duty have helped form an army from \n     the gathered people. Your behavior and your actions have \n     built strong friendships that will last a lifetime.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             3rd Iraqi Army Infantry Division,\n\n                                            Headquarters in AKMTB.\n     3rd Armored Calvary,\n     Regiment Headquarters.\n       Bravery, strength, determination, correct thought, \n     flexibility, knowledge, and impartiality. These are the \n     features of your regiment's leadership that are displayed \n     through participation with our division headquarters, our \n     troops, and their units in all the daily occasions. Your wise \n     daily, operational, and successful leadership was the \n     decisive factor in achieving victory. We noticed clearly the \n     main features for victory in your leadership. They are the \n     same for each people or army who are looking for victory, and \n     it is the common purpose of your troopers and faith in their \n     goal along with their principles, high morals and focus on \n     their mission, coupled with perfect logistics support and \n     impartiality and sincere leadership that makes you the right \n     people for this mission.\n       Your abilities to plan, the excellent coordination, the \n     overall supervising and the right decisive decisions along \n     with your great leadership have helped us to build up the \n     individual soldier and increase his abilities as well as \n     those for the platoons, companies, battalions, brigades and \n     division. It is said that heaps of construction materials \n     cannot build a house and the gathered people cannot be \n     considered an army. Your leadership and devotion to duty have \n     helped us form an army from the gathered people.\n       Your behavior and your actions have built strong \n     friendships that will last a lifetime. Your behavior is a \n     feature of the wise leadership, which is the tree and the \n     reputation you leave behind is the shadow of the tree.\n       So we present our heartfelt thanks, appreciation and \n     respect to you as we touched during this past period of \n     cooperation and coordination and fighting side by side. We \n     also offer the thanks of the division's staff, NCOS, and \n     enlisted. You will disappear from our eyes, but you will stay \n     in our hearts.\n       We send our greetings to the 3rd ACR fighters and to their \n     families and we wish all of you to get back home safely under \n     victory's flag.\n           With God's Care,\n                        Major General Khorsheed Saleem al-Dosekey,\n                               3rd IA Infantry Division Commander.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is the message from the Iraqi people for the heroic \nefforts fighting for freedom. I know most if not all the Members of \nthis body share in their appreciation for the valiant service of our \nmen and women in uniform. I was pleased last night when we passed my \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment which commends the members of our Armed \nForces for their outstanding service to our Nation in Iraq and for \ntheir commitment to the highest ideals and values of our Nation. It \nalso honors the families of our servicemembers who have given so much \nin the fight against terror. Our soldiers deserve our support and our \ntrust.\n  In conclusion, I ask, why would we risk all this by a premature \nwithdrawal and set a specific date for withdrawal?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Carper is on his \nway over. He is next on our side. I wonder if I may inquire how much \ntime remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 50 minutes 40 \nseconds. The Senator from Virginia has 41 minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is the other side ready?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest that the Senator from Virginia \nis next, to be followed then by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I may list the sequence on our side so it \nwould be understood that after Senator Carper, we would expect Senator \nLautenberg and then Senator Murray, Senator Obama, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Durbin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will go from one side to the other. I \nhave waiting the Senator from Virginia, Senator Hagel, Senator Roberts, \nSenator Bond, and Senator Thune. I will try to get them all in order of \nappearance. The Senator from Virginia is next on our side. I will sort \nout the sequence of the others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, before I speak on these amendments, I will \nshare with my colleagues three amendments I have introduced.\n  The first amendment will double the current referral bonus from \n$1,000 to $2,000, which will encourage more men and women to enter the \nU.S. Armed Forces.\n  The second amendment will provide statutory authority to the Army to \npay $8,000 dollar enlistment bonuses to individuals who enlist in \nOfficer Candidate School. The Army has made this promise--and this \namendment provides statutory authority to fulfill that promise.\n  And finally, I have offered--with Senators Craig, Hutchison, Burns \nand Snowe as cosponsors--an amendment that will provide financial \nprotection to the 25.6 million military personnel and veterans whose \npersonal data and Social Security information were stolen from the home \nof a Veterans Affairs employee in May of this year.\n  Under the terms of my amendment, the VA would be required to provide \ncredit monitoring and data theft protection to these veterans at no \ncost to\n\n[[Page S6225]]\n\nour veterans. My amendment is supported by the VFW.\n  I spoke to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson earlier today, \nand he informed me that he had announced that the VA will provide \ncredit monitoring and data theft protection, and at no cost to the \nservicemembers and veterans. I thank Secretary Nicholson for making \nthis sound and responsible decision.\n  I also rise in strong opposition to the amendments brought forth by \nSenators Kerry and Levin which, in my view, is a vacillating strategic \nplan of retreat. We don't need a plan of retreat. We need to have a \nsteady, strategic plan for success in the war on terror and, in \nparticular, in the theater of Iraq. We need to honor our troops and \nhonor their families, whether they are serving now, or those who have \nfallen in the midst of this battlefront in Iraq.\n  We need to move forward in Iraq, and we need to unite all Americans \nbehind our mission, unite Americans behind a strategic plan for \nsuccess, bringing Americans together, and also our NATO partners and \nother allies, and get the neighbors of Iraq together, whether they be \nJordan, Turkey, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia--they are all important--rather \nthan Senator Kerry's plan, which is a plan for retreat, a tuck-tail-\nand-run approach. That is not what is need.\n  We want to see this new unity, diverse Government elected by the \npeople of Iraq, have a chance to stand on its own feet and defend its \nown interests. We want to see measured, tangible success as quickly as \npossible, and we want to bring home our troops as soon as possible. But \nI believe some on the other side of the aisle are too anxious, and that \nwould be retreating. This is not the sort of steady leadership that I \nbelieve would unite the American people.\n  Moreover, I think this approach can embolden our enemies. It would \nshow a weakened resolve in the midst of this war on terror. The \nterrorists always talk about the United States and Mogadishu or the \nBeirut bombing and how Americans will retreat. We don't need to be \nemboldening our enemies. Moreover, it can cause discouragement and \ndismay to the Iraqi leaders who are bravely trying to stand up for a \nfree and just society. It also can be a discredit to the United States \nin the eyes of some of our allies. Our European allies came out \nstrongly in support of us today, for example, in our negotiations with \nIran and telling the Iranian leaders: You ought to take the carrot, \ntake the right approach. It is important as we deal with the Iranians \nthat the United States shows there is a resolve and a commitment to \nsticking to a path of security and peace.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I was on a bipartisan delegation to Iraq. \nEveryone we spoke with, whether they were Kurds, Sunnis, or Shiites, \nwas grateful to the United States for liberating them from that \nrepressive regime. We asked what would happen if we left in 6 months. \nThey all said it would be a ``disaster.'' That was the word we heard \nmore than anything else. Even the Sunni speaker of the new assembly, \nwho was once imprisoned by the United States, said that if the U.S. \nmilitary left--as a Sunni who was once imprisoned and was against the \nUnited States being there in the first place--he said to us, as he said \nsubsequently to the President, that: We are grateful, and the U.S. \nmilitary presence in Iraq is helpful to them. If we left, then those \nwho would come in would be the Iranians, the Syrians, or potentially, \nof course, in the north, the Turks.\n  We are making progress. We are fighting vile terrorists. We need to \nunderstand who we are fighting. These terrorists are beheading men and \nwomen in Iraq. Meanwhile, the United States and our coalition partners \nare trying to give the Iraqis the chance to vote, to have a say on \ntheir public servants in that country.\n  We are also making progress on the security fronts. General Casey \nrelayed to us that, right now, maybe a quarter of military operations \nare led by Iraqis. He said that by the end of the year, as much as \nthree-quarters of the military operations will be led by the Iraqis, \nwith the United States being in a supportive role for medical, \nintelligence, and military efforts.\n  Mr. President, I know Iraq has been tough. It is a tough battlefront \nfor Americans. But it is a war and a theater in this war on terror that \nwe can win and must win. The next few months will be vitally important. \nThis is not the time to get weak in the knees. The future of Iraq is \nultimately the responsibility of the Iraqi people. It is going to be \nthe Iraqis' hands, backs, and minds that will be needed to build a \nsecure and free Iraq. We don't want to stay a day longer than \nabsolutely necessary. We are supporting Iraq in this because we are a \ngenerous people, but it is also good for our national security.\n  So I think we need to make sure that Senator Kerry's strategic plan \nfor retreat--a tuck-tail-and-fail approach--must be rejected. We must \nunite as Americans for a renewed commitment for a strategic plan for \nsuccess. It is important for Iraq, important for the Middle East, and \nit is vitally important for the security of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the sponsors of this amendment, \nSenators Levin and Reed, for offering a thoughtful amendment. They are \nmaking a responsible contribution to this debate. All Americans want a \nsuccessful outcome in Iraq. Congress has an obligation to help craft a \nresponsible policy to help achieve a successful outcome in Iraq. \nCongress fails in its duty when we do not probe, when we do not ask \ntough questions, and we fail when we don't debate the great issues of \nour day.\n  There is no issue more important than war. The war in Iraq is the \ndefining issue on which this Congress and the administration will be \njudged. The American people want to see serious debate about serious \nissues from serious leaders. They deserve more than a political debate. \nThis debate should transcend cynical attempts to turn public \nfrustration with the war in Iraq into an electoral advantage. It should \nbe taken more seriously than to simply use the focus group-tested \nbuzzwords like ``cut and run'' and political slogans and debase the \nseriousness of war. War is not a partisan issue. It should not be held \nhostage to political agendas. War should not be dragged into the \npolitical muck. America deserves better. Our men and women fighting and \ndying deserve better.\n  As mentioned earlier by Senator Feinstein and others, there was a \nvery important piece in yesterday's Washington Post, written by Iraq's \nNational Security Adviser. It was titled ``The Way Out of Iraq; A \nRoadmap.'' The National Security Adviser's op-ed mentions three very \nimportant things we need to clearly understand. The first thing this \nop-ed provides is measurable goals for the progress of the Iraqi \nGovernment with regard to U.S. troop presence. The Iraqi National \nSecurity Adviser says this:\n\n       Iraq's ambition is to have full control of their country by \n     the end of 2008. In practice, this will mean a significant \n     foreign troop reduction. We envision the U.S. troop presence \n     by year's ends to be under 100,000, with most of the \n     remaining troops to return home by the year 2007.\n\n  The second point the op-ed makes clear is the unavoidable reality \nthat an endless U.S. troop presence is not in the interest of the new \nIraqi Government. The Iraqi National Security Adviser says this:\n\n       The eventual removal of coalition troops from Iraqi streets \n     will help Iraqis who now see foreign troops as occupiers \n     rather than the liberators they were meant to be. The removal \n     of troops will also allow the Iraqi government to engage with \n     some of our neighbors that have, to date, been at the very \n     least sympathetic to the resistance because of what they call \n     the ``coalition occupation.'' The removal of foreign troops \n     will legitimize Iraq's government in the eyes of the people.\n\n  He makes clear that it will be the Iraqis who determine the success \nof the Iraqi Government. He says:\n\n       The government in Iraq is trying to gain its independence \n     from the United States and the coalition, in terms of taking \n     greater responsibility for its actions, particularly in terms \n     of security. There are still some influential foreign figures \n     trying to spoon feed our government and take a very proactive \n     role in many key decisions. Though this may provide benefits \n     in the short-term, in the long term it will only serve to \n     make the Iraqi government weaker and will lead to a culture \n     of dependency.\n\n  I believe the Iraqi national security adviser has it exactly right. \nAfter all, he is the Iraqi national security adviser. Americans \nlistening to this debate on Iraq are too often being given\n\n[[Page S6226]]\n\nfalse choices between, one, supporting the Iraqis with no end of troop \ndeployments in sight or staying the course, or, two, laying down \narbitrary deadlines for troop withdrawals. The reality is more \ncomplicated than this.\n  We should not limit the Commander in Chief's options in Iraq. That is \nwhy I will vote against the Levin amendment. However, anyone who \nbelieves we will be in Iraq indefinitely ignores the forces of reality, \nas the Iraqi Security Adviser's op-ed makes very clear. It is not in \nIraq's interest for the United States to remain in Iraq. Our influence \nis limited and becoming more limited every day.\n  I note another story in yesterday's Washington Post that detailed the \nreaction of Vietnam veterans to the war in Iraq. I know a little \nsomething about this. My generation worries about Iraq becoming not the \nfailure of our sons and daughters fighting in Iraq, but our failure as \npolicymakers--policymakers--because I believe our policymakers failed \nus in Vietnam.\n  Our troops today are doing what we did a generation ago in Vietnam. \nThey are fighting bravely. They are doing their very best. They believe \nin their country, they have faith in their leaders, and we cannot let \nthem down.\n  I would say that there may be two Members of Congress today--\nCongressman Murtha in the House and myself--who served in Vietnam and \nwere both here working in the Congress in the spring of 1975. Many \nmight recall that time because that was the time the House of \nRepresentatives essentially voted to cut off funding for American \npresence in Vietnam. That was a disastrous decision for disastrous \nreasons, but it was the result of having a Congress absent and not \ninvolved in the policy formation, not involved in asking the tough \nquestions, not involved in doing its job.\n  This debate today is critical. It is important for our country, agree \nor disagree with it. Amendments such as the Levin amendment are \nrelevant, and they are an important contribution. When we debate these \nissues, Congress is doing its job. We do not want our legacy as a \nCongress to be no congressional oversight. We do not want it to be said \nwe were irrelevant when it becomes too late. We do not want to repeat \nthe history of Vietnam. We must not allow what happened in the Congress \nin April of 1975 to happen with Iraq, and it happened because we didn't \ndebate the issues. It happened because the Congress was absent; it \nforfeited its responsibilities. It debased the very responsibility of \nelected officials. And that is why to debate these issues in a \nlegitimate, honest, open manner is so important to our country, and to \nkeep it out of politics, the ``gotcha'' kind of amendments, the \n``gotcha'' kind of phraseology of which America is sick.\n  This is a serious issue. We have lost over 2,500 men and women in \nIraq. We have been in Iraq longer than the Korean war. We have over \n18,000 wounded. We are spending around $10 billion a month. The \nCongress must be present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is advised he has \nnow consumed 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask for 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, take a minute or so.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the chairman.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, with this: What would be the real disaster \nfor America, the real disaster for Iraq, the disaster for the Middle \nEast, the disaster for the world is if this Congress is not present and \naccounted for and is not part of a policy formation for not just Iraq \nbut the Middle East and the future of our country and the world. That \nwould be the disaster. That is why it is so important today that we \ndebate this issue; it is so important that we have amendments, such as \nthe Levin-Reed amendment, that are offered in an important way that \nmake a contribution to the understanding of America's presence and \ncommitment and our responsibilities as a free nation and the beacon of \nfreedom in the world.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for his remarks. He \nspeaks from a body of personal experience and considerable courage as a \nmember of the Armed Forces of the United States, which he has exhibited \nin these years.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, may I have 10 seconds? I wish to add my \nthanks to the Senator from Nebraska for his very constructive, positive \nremarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have on our side Senators Thune and \nRoberts who are waiting. I know Senator Bond has indicated he wishes to \nspeak, and Senator Inhofe. I wish to advise those Senators I have to \nrecognize those on the floor; otherwise, we lose time to a quorum call \nor otherwise. So we are going to alternate at this time. We are going \nto shift to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 6 months ago, I was in Iraq with Senator \nHagel. We met with a number of people. Among the people with whom we \nmet in one of the beautiful palaces of Saddam Hussein not far from \nBaghdad Airport, were the leaders of our American military forces in \nthat country.\n  During the course of that conversation, we heard these words from our \ntop military leader: It is time for America to move toward the door. He \ndidn't say it is time for us to walk out of the door, leave, close the \ndoor. He said: It is time for us to move toward the door.\n  Subsequent to that, we met with Iraqi military and political leaders \nand our own diplomatic leaders, and the message I heard in almost all \nof those meetings was: it is time for America to begin moving toward \nthe door.\n  We have had a policy in Iraq, at least in the last couple of years, \nof stay the course. ``Stay the course'' is a good slogan, and there \nhave been times in our history as a nation when staying the course was \nactually a pretty good strategy. This is not one of those times.\n  What is needed is a different--not a different slogan, but a \ndifferent strategy, and the strategy we need would be not stay the \ncourse but change the course.\n  The American people would like for us to begin to bring our men and \nwomen home and, as it turns out, so would the Iraqi people. In talking \nwith the President upon our return, I said: You know, Mr. President, \nsometimes less is more. In this instance, having a smaller presence, a \nless visible presence would actually be more supportive of our efforts \nin Iraq than not.\n  The Iraqi people don't want us to cut and run. They don't want us to \nleave. They want us to be close by. They want us to be not far away and \nto be helpful if we can be, if needed. But they don't want us to leave \nthis year. They don't want us to leave entirely next year.\n  Senator Hagel just quoted the words of the Iraqi National Security \nCouncil. That is what we heard in Iraq last December. Their message has \nbeen pretty consistent, and it has been pretty much the same.\n  Last year in the Senate we voted by an overwhelming majority that \n2006 needs to be a year of significant transition in Iraq. In other \nwords, the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, called on the Bush \nadministration to take action this year in 2006 to change course in \nIraq to make clear to the Iraqis and the rest of the world that the \nUnited States does not intend to stay in Iraq forever.\n  The amendment before us today, the Levin-Reed amendment, builds on \nthat resolution we passed barely a year ago. It rejects the extremes on \nboth sides of the Iraqi debate--the one side of the extreme that would \nsay either we should stay in Iraq on an open-ended basis, and the other \nextreme to say we ought to withdraw all of our troops by an arbitrary \ndeadline. This amendment rejects both of those, and it says instead: \nWhy don't we find a way to change the course going forward?\n  The policy of ``stay the course'' isn't working for our troops. They \nhave served bravely, they have served honorably despite very difficult \ncircumstances in extended tours of duty. More than 2,500 of our finest \nhave been killed in action. Almost 18,000 have been injured, including \na former member of my staff, Marine Corps LCpl Sean Barney, who was \nshot in the neck last month in Fallujah. Fortunately, he is alive. He \nis going to live.\n\n[[Page S6227]]\n\n  The President's ``stay the course'' plan also is not working for the \nIraqis. Insurgent violence is on the upswing, and our efforts to help \nrebuild Iraq are at a standstill. Electricity output has been pretty \nmuch flat-lined in the last couple of years, and we haven't been able \nto finish building the schools and hospitals they want and need and \nthat we would like to help them build.\n  ``Stay the course,'' I say to my friends, is not working. This \namendment is about a new direction in Iraq. It is about accountability. \nIt is about being tough. It is about being smart. It is about changing \nthe course, not staying the course. It is about laying out a plan for \nvictory in Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the advice I heard \nnot 6 months ago that it is time for America to move toward the door--\nnot to leave, not to leave precipitously but to move toward the door \nand to allow the Iraqi people themselves to carry more of the burden in \nan effort to relieve from us some of that burden, an effort to make \nsure they have, in the end, a democracy and a country of their own to \ngovern.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I advise colleagues on my side, there is one \nRepublican waiting, and others who have indicated a desire to speak. I \nurge them to come to the floor because I have under my control roughly \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we face a difficult choice in Iraq and the \nwar on terror at large. Iraqis are desperately trying to form a fragile \ngovernment in the face of overwhelming odds. They are, as John \nDickinson once said of American independence, ``braving the storm in a \nskiff made of paper.''\n  Despite that, the odds they face, look at the progress that has been \nmade just of late. Prime Minister Maliki just completed the formation \nof a new Iraqi Government, including filling three national security \npositions. In the past few weeks, U.S. forces have taken out terrorist \nleader al-Zarqawi, the head of the snake, and many of his henchmen. \nThis was a huge blow to al-Qaida and a major victory in the war on \nterror.\n  Iraqi security forces are growing in number every day. Only a year \nand a half ago, Iraqi security forces had just begun to form. Today \nthere are 264,400 trained and equipped Iraqi security forces, more than \ndouble the number of U.S. troops in the region.\n  At the beginning of this year, the Iraqi forces had 10 brigades and \n43 battalions. They controlled areas of responsibility. Only a few \nmonths later and those numbers have nearly doubled to 18 brigades and \n71 battalions.\n  Large- and small-scale water treatment facilities have been \nrehabilitated or constructed for an estimated 3 million people at a \nstandard level of service, with plans underway to deliver clean, safe \ndrinking water to 5 million more.\n  May oil production was over 2.1 million barrels of oil per day, and \nthe Treasury Department, from the United States, is sending additional \nprofessionals to Iraq to provide technical support for the creation of \na public finance system that is accountable and transparent. And our \nState Department is coordinating a broad effort to support an economic \npolicy framework that enhances investment, job creation, and growth.\n  As Americans, we know, as Thomas Jefferson once said, ``the price of \nfreedom is eternal vigilance.'' In America, we like things to happen in \na 24-hour news cycle, but it doesn't always happen that way. If we look \nthroughout the pages of history, we have countless examples of those \nwho have come before who have understood the stakes and the risks that \nwere at work in the conflicts they faced. A great figure from history \nof the last century, Winston Churchill, said wars are not won by \nevacuations. Churchill and those of his generation knew they were in a \npitched battle for future generations, a titanic struggle between good \nand evil.\n  A more recent example is, as I was growing up in the State of South \nDakota and going through what at that time we knew was the Cold War, I \nremember a great leader at the end of the last century, Ronald Reagan, \nwhen asked his strategy for winning the Cold War, who said: It is very \nsimple, Mr. President, we win; they lose.\n  I believe that is the same strategy and same objective we need to \napply to the war on terror because the evil we face today--it has a \ndifferent name--is equally deadly. Failure to confront and prevail in \nthis war on terror and we will be creating huge problems for the next \ngenerations of Americans.\n  When we hear this debate on the floor of the Senate and, I believe \npeople have sincere motivations--I don't doubt the motivations of \nanyone who comes to the floor to debate this issue, and I think it is \nappropriate to have this debate, but this is not and should not ever be \nabout partisanship. It is not about politics. It is about the future \nand the security of future generations of Americans.\n\n  We have heard lots of people come here and say, Well, staying the \ncourse is not a strategy, it is not a solution. Yet at the same time, \nwe know full well that as we look at the threat that we face from the \nwar on terror, failure is not an option either. We cannot afford a \nstrategy that includes running away from our responsibility not only to \nthe people of Iraq but to the people of this country who are counting \non us to protect them and to provide security and safety for \ngenerations of Americans to come.\n  I think some simple questions we have to ask are these: Is Iraq a \nfrontline in the war on terror? I believe it is. We have demonstrated \nthat in the last few weeks as we have eliminated many of the leading \nterrorist figures. We have to ask the question: Are the people we are \nfighting in Iraq terrorists who want the kill Americans? The answer \nclearly is yes. We also have to ask the question: If we don't have them \npinned down there, will they not be planning and launching attacks \nagainst the United States? I believe the answer to that question also \nis yes.\n  The good men and women of the United States military are doing good \nwork in Iraq. They are doing the job that we asked them to do. We need \nto make sure they understand we are there to win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would ask simply that as we vote on this \namendment and the one that will follow, that we vote them down and give \nour generals and our troops the ability to complete the work that we \nhave asked them to do, and that is to win, to prevail, and to make this \ncountry safer for future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n8 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, and then following the Senator from New \nJersey, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, will be recognized, and \nthen following Senator Roberts, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I claim my full 8 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senatorcan claim his full 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nresolution put forward by the senior Senator from Michigan. I \nappreciate the fact that he has framed the debate on the war in Iraq \nboth for the Senate and for the American people.\n  Last week the American death toll in Iraq passed 2,500. It is a \ntragic milestone and the American people are not happy about it, \nbecause our President has yet to articulate exactly what we are trying \nto accomplish in Iraq.\n  I maintain a gallery of pictures of U.S. servicepeople who have died \nin Iraq and Afghanistan outside the front door of my office. It reminds \nme and all who visit my office about the loss of young lives and the \nterrible cost of this war.\n  As a war veteran, I know what these troops and their families are \ngoing through. I heard the Bush administration say that some Iraqis are \nworried about us leaving. But I say this: The American people are \nworried about us staying.\n  What more can we do for the Iraqi people? We have spent over $300 \nbillion of U.S. taxpayer funds there. We have\n\n[[Page S6228]]\n\nhelped them hold three elections. We have trained and armed their \npolice and their military.\n  I say it is time for them to take control of their country.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we \nwould bring dishonor to those who lost their lives if we begin to leave \nIraq. But ask the families with loved ones over there how they feel. I \nmet with a group in my Newark office with loved ones in Iraq, including \na mother who lost her son there. As far as they were concerned, it \nwould bring dishonor to other families if we just stay there with no \nplans for the future.\n  So why are we having so much trouble securing Iraq? The answer is \nclear: The administration has no plan in place to do it. When they \ntried, we saw misstep after misstep by the civilian leaders in the \nPentagon. And the leadership problems at the Pentagon start at the top.\n  This administration went to war on the cheap: Not enough troops, not \nenough body armor, not enough help from our allies. I think we are down \nto a coalition that has very little coalescence attached to it. No \nhelp. And our troops have paid the price for these mistakes.\n  There were so many mistakes and miscalculations by the Bush \nadministration that it is hard to believe it at all.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said the Iraqis would welcome U.S. troops and that \nthe Iraqi resistance would be limited. He was obviously wrong.\n  He also failed to build coalitions with our allies. One of the few \nmajor allies that did join the coalition was Poland, which sent about \n1,600 troops. But they began withdrawing early this year. Half are \nalready gone, and by the end of the year, Poland will have all of its \ntroops out of Iraq. Just this week, the Japanese announced they will \nwithdraw their troops.\n  We ask, when are we going to start withdrawing our troops?\n  So far, 16 nations who have provided some assistance in Iraq have \nwithdrawn their troops. The administration's failure to build a real \ncoalition has caused our troops to bear the vast majority of the risk \nand suffer the casualties.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, I will not yield. I don't have enough time, I am \nsorry to say. Perhaps afterwards, the Senator from Oklahoma can use his \nown time to have an exchange.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld said the war would be short. He said, ``I doubt 6 \nmonths.'' More than 3 years later, we know how tragically wrong that \nassessment was.\n  Additionally, Secretary Rumsfeld was also way off on the cost of the \nwar. He said it would cost no more than $100 billion. But the \nstaggering reality is that it has cost $320 billion thus far, and we \nexpect it will get close to half a trillion dollars before this year is \nover.\n  Now we are experiencing a crisis in military recruiting. But about \nthat, Secretary Rumsfeld is in denial. Whether in public or in private, \nhe claims that recruiting is fine. Well, it is not. Here is the \nreality: The Army National Guard and Reserve are falling well short of \ntheir goals, and the only reason other branches are meeting goals is \nbecause the Pentagon has reduced the target numbers.\n  Eight retired generals have come forward to say what many in the \nmilitary have been thinking for years, and that is: It is time for a \nchange at the top as well as the recovery of our people back home. One \nof the generals, General Eaton, who served in Iraq, said the following \nabout Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       In sum, he has shown himself incompetent strategically, \n     operationally, and tactically, and is far more than anyone \n     else responsible for what has happened to our important \n     mission in Iraq. Mr. Rumsfeld must step down.\n\n  But instead of taking a stand like the generals, we have heard our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle simply repeating talking \npoints that were handed to them by the Bush administration: ``Cut and \nrun''--disgusting words when you look at the reflection of what is \nintended there.\n\n  We know this because the Secretary of Defense sent a Republican \nbriefing booklet to Democrats by mistake last week. This briefing book \nis a three-ring binder of spin. It contains the same spin that we hear \ntoday from the other side of the Chamber.\n  Instead of developing talking points and spin for Republican \nSenators, we should concentrate on putting together a plan for our \ntroops in Iraq: For our troops to come home.\n  I think my Republican colleagues should have stamped that briefing \nbook ``Return to Sender'' and told the administration that they will \nthink for themselves. That is what I would hope my colleagues across \nthe aisle would do.\n  I know that they want to protect our troops and I know that they care \nas much about loss of life. But we have a different approach on it. We \nneed a fresh start, honest leadership, and we are not going to get \neither one as long as those in charge maintain their positions.\n  In sum, I think it is time for Secretary Rumsfeld to go, and it is \ntime for our troops to start to go home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from \nVirginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes and 22 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize on the floor Senator Roberts, \nSenator Bond, and Senator Inhofe, and Senator Kyl intends to come. So \nwith the balance of that time, I will try to allocate it as equally as \nwe can. I think Senator Roberts is next in line, so I yield to Senator \nRoberts 4 to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the President and I thank the chairman. I rise \nin opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Levin. I would just \ntell the Senator from New Jersey that nobody gave me my billet points; \nI wrote this myself out of conviction, and I know he speaks from \nconviction as well.\n  There is nobody in the U.S. Congress, nobody in America that does not \nwant stability in Iraq and to get our troops home as soon as possible. \nBut there is a right way and a wrong way. Last week the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly against adopting a strategy focused on an arbitrary date \nfor the withdrawal of U.S. forces. We are back again. Despite that \nlopsided vote of last week, we are again debating yet another \nwithdrawal amendment. By the time we are done, no less than three \nwithdrawal amendments, three messages to our troops, three messages to \nour adversaries, and three very damaging blows for I think the resolve \nof this country.\n  Senator Hagel brought this up. As a careful reading of the amendment \nclearly shows, I think we are setting a disturbing and \ncounterproductive precedent. We, the U.S. Senate, are now getting into \nmicromanaging the military and the military's plans and the military's \nstrategy--not the President, not the commanders in the field, but the \nSenate. This is the same body, by the way, that has a little difficulty \ntrying to decide when to adjourn.\n  While we may wish otherwise, the blunt truth of it is there is no \nexit from either Iraq or the global war on terrorism but through \nsuccess. So in that regard, we did not ask for this war, but in \nfighting worldwide terrorism, a war that must be successful, we must be \nwilling to use force if necessary and to protect our security and that \nof our allies or we invite more insurgency, more terrorist acts for the \nnext President, the President after that, and on down the line. So \nregardless of future policy, current or future Presidents, our ultimate \nsuccess against terrorism will only be won through resolve.\n  Let's talk about one thing that has been missing in this debate, and \nthat is consequences. Calling for withdrawal is one thing; facing the \nconsequences of that action and the responsibility for it is another. I \nfully understand the need and the value of full debate on this issue, \nbut we should do so with the understanding that words do have \nconsequences, and their effect not only influences the intended \naudience, the partisan base or otherwise, but they also affect the \nmorale of our troops in the midst of war and the terrorists who \nquestion our resolve.\n  Make no mistake: if America leaves--all at once or in stages--our \nadversaries will rejoice--all at once or in stages.\n  Last year we received an intercepted letter that Osama bin Laden's \ndeputy sent to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi which urged Zarqawi to prepare for \nwhat the terrorists clearly believe will be a U.S.\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nretreat from Iraq. Ironically, while the terrorists are preparing for \nwhat they hope will be a premature U.S. retreat, we are making real, \ntough, step-by-step progress, highlighted with the recent killing of \nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n  But of all things, in a paradox of enormous consequence and irony, we \nstand here today debating this withdrawal commensurate with the \npredicted retreat by al-Zarqawi and his terrorist associates.\n  Now is not the time to abandon our momentum and retreat. Such a \nretreat would do more than encourage the bin Ladens of the world. \nJihadist terrorist cells throughout the world, and in our own country, \nwould be rethinking their attack plans with ominous repercussions.\n  Let us not ignore the very nature of our adversaries. Senator Allen \nspoke to that. They think of us as dust. We have no human value. And \nthey are not giving up. They are planning attacks as we speak--\neverybody knows that--within the U.S. Capitol. Imagine how such a \nwithdrawal would be viewed in places like Iran, in the midst of \naggressively building up its nuclear capacity; North Korea, with its \nexisting capacity; China, with its continued military expansion, the \ngreatest since World War II; and Russia, where we are now witnessing a \nreturn to totalitarianism round II, especially with Ukrainian \ndemocracy; and Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez has become the next Castro.\n  Imagine what doubts the lack of resolve would really create in the \nminds of our allies now working with us with unprecedented intelligence \ncooperation, and the impact on the progress we have made in Pakistan \nand Afghanistan, leading to a radical Islamic takeover of the Mushariff \nand Karzi governments and further leading to increased threats within \nthe next terrorist nerve centers in Indonesia and Africa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will yield the 2 minutes, and then the two other \ncolleagues can divide equally the time that is remaining.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment has consequences to our \nallies, including Libya, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt, even Saudi Arabia, and \nIsrael. Basically, this amendment has consequences, introducing it on \nthe floor of the Senate has consequences, debating it has consequences, \nand voting for it has consequences.\n  I am going to close by calling to mind a lesson of historical \nprecedent. Upon learning of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sir Winston \nChurchill said this:\n\n       Silly people; that was the description many gave in \n     discounting the force of the United States. Some said they \n     were soft, others that they would never be united, that they \n     would never come to grips. They would never stand for \n     bloodletting, that their system of government and democracy \n     would paralyze their effort.\n       Now we will see the weakness of this numerous but remote, \n     wealthy and talkative people. But, American blood flows in my \n     veins. I thought of a remark made to me years before--the \n     United States is like a gigantic boiler. Once the fire of \n     freedom is lighted under it, there is no limit to the power \n     it can generate. It is a matter of resolve.\n\n  I say to my colleagues that, if approved, this amendment could, in a \nmatter of minutes, undo that resolve now, and for the next generation \nwho will face new threats to our way of life. Setting an artificial \ntimetable will send the wrong message to the Iraqi's, who need to know \nthat America will not leave before the job is done, and our troops, who \nmust know that we are serious about the mission that they are risking \ntheir lives to achieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want the same thing all Americans do, \nfor our troops to complete their mission in Iraq and return home safely \nand quickly. To accomplish that, the President must define what our \ncurrent mission is and how that mission serves our Nation's security \ninterests.\n  The men and women of our military have done everything we have asked \nthem to do. They looked for weapons of mass destruction and found none. \nWe got rid of Saddam Hussein. We helped the Iraqis hold elections and \nset up their government and security forces. So what is our mission \ntoday?\n  Right now, our Nation's policy on Iraq is adrift. Instead of \naddressing this head on, the administration and this Congress continue \nto build on the miscalculation and incompetence of the past and are \ndismissing any serious discussion of the challenge the American people \nnow face.\n  Instead of working to unite this Nation behind a common purpose in \ndefense of our security and freedom, the President and his aides are \nusing the war as political fodder for the next election cycle. Instead \nof being honest with the American people about the costs of our effort \nand the sacrifice necessary to support them, the Congress continues to \nhand a blank check to the administration to continue the status quo. \nThat approach has left us with heated rhetoric and a long series of bad \nchoices.\n  True security for the American people depends on an honest assessment \nof the threats we face, a very clear mission, and an honest discussion \nabout the costs of confronting those threats.\n  On Iraq we do not have any of those components. Continuing the status \nquo is unacceptable. We need the President to tell us what the mission \nin Iraq is so we, as Congress and as a country, can decide if it is \nworth the continued price we are paying.\n  Like all of us, I want the troops home as soon as possible. In fact, \nI think they should start coming home this year. It is absolutely time \nfor a new strategy in Iraq. An arbitrary, specific date for full \nwithdrawal, however, could force us to ignore facts on the ground, \nfacts that have a direct impact on the security of our troops or the \ninterests of our Nation. I appreciate those who ask for a date certain. \nI, too, am frustrated with where we find ourselves today. But what we \ndo need is change. What we do need is leadership. What we do need is a \ndefined mission. And what we do need is a plan for success.\n  The troops on the ground, as well as the American people, deserve an \nhonest discussion and a plan for victory and a goal to achieve that. \nThat is why I support the Levin amendment.\n  This administration, this Congress, and this Nation should be focused \nlike a laser on how we can be successful and bring our troops home \nsafely. Our troops and the American people deserve a plan that brings \nus all together to accomplish that goal.\n  I yield my remaining time.\n  Mr. WARNER. What is the time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 13 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am going to relinquish the time I hoped to use to do \nwrapup remarks and divide it equally between the Senator from Missouri \nand the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 6 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager of the bill. As we \nhave heard, the end of al-Zarqawi is a significant blow to al-Qaida \noperations in Iraq. It is another clear indication of the progress we \nare making. In addition, the documents we captured at that time \nindicate that the al-Qaida terrorists themselves know that we are \nmaking progress. They are worried that time is now on our side. They \nknow they cannot withstand our military forces.\n  But even before our troops eliminated one of America's fiercest \nenemies, some at home had described the current situation in Iraq as \nbleak. Now they are introducing measures for a timetable for withdrawal \nfrom the region.\n  The insurgents will no doubt consider the debating of this measure \none of the best pieces of news they have had this year. That is because \nthe terrorists know that time is on our side unless we give them a \ntimetable for withdrawal. We know that a timetable for withdrawal will \nundercut the momentum that the insurgents themselves say we have gained \nin Iraq.\n  As I have talked to our troops who have been in the field, they say, \ndoesn't\n\n[[Page S6230]]\n\nanybody understand that the terrorists watch our media? They have \ncalendars. If they know we are going to get out on a certain date they \nwill declare victory, lay back and wait to take over the country after \nwe have departed.\n  I would imagine that the terrorists are dumbfounded, yet ecstatic \nwith this self-destructive proposal. I am dumbfounded and aghast. If \ninsurgents had any representation in the Senate, I am sure they would \nsupport it. I am not saying my Democratic colleagues are in any way \nintentionally aiding the insurgents or undermining our troops, but \nregrettably that is what it would do. I implore my colleagues on both \nsides to consider the facts and the words of the insurgents themselves, \nwho view this as a time when they are losing.\n\n  Last Monday night, when our President was addressing a group \noutlining in detail the program of progress and how we are going to \nbuild up the security forces in Iraq so they can take over, and \ncommitting to finishing the job we in Congress overwhelmingly endorsed, \nMr. Howard Dean was on national television claiming that Republicans \nwere sitting in air-conditioned offices asking others to do the work in \nIraq. He stated:\n\n       Republicans are great about sending other people's children \n     to war.\n\n  I take issue with the words of Mr. Dean, the voice of the Democratic \nNational Party. First, our brave young men and women volunteered to \nserve, to go to war to keep America safe from the terrorists who struck \non 9/11 and who would strike again if they had the chance.\n  Second, 77 of us on this floor, Democrats and Republicans, voted to \nsupport the President to carry out the mission that President Clinton \nfirst outlined about regime change in Iraq.\n  Finally, I say to Mr. Dean personally, my only son returned from Iraq \nover a year ago and is preparing to go back. When I told him we were \ngoing to have this debate, I asked him: What is your view on it? I got \nthis e-mail back. He said:\n\n       In case anyone is paying attention, there is progress being \n     made. AMZ himself indicated as much in the confiscated \n     letters around the time of his death. If al-Qaida, No. 1, \n     confesses the U.S. is having good success, who here in conus \n     has the standing to contradict us?\n       I don't get it. I am not wild about going back to Iraq but \n     I'd sure as heck would rather do that than essentially \n     invalidate everything we have done to date by leaving too \n     early and inviting chaos.\n       Happy Father's Day.\n\n  That was a message from one of the people who are serving us in Iraq, \nand he speaks for all the other young people he knows.\n  I implore my colleagues, let our troops finish what we started, what \nmost of us voted for. Let's leave Iraq self-sufficient, free, and \nstable, an Iraq no longer a safe haven for terrorists, threatening to \nbring WMD and terrorist attacks to our shore. Let's leave when the job \nis done, not before. Let's not defeat our mission with political \nattacks on the President and the Secretary of Defense as we have heard \ntoday, and on those of us in Congress, giving the terrorists a victory \npolitically by laying out for them a ``get out of jail free'' card, \ngiving them a timetable for withdrawal whether or not Iraqi security \nforces are fully capable of controlling their country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I will just \nyield a minute to myself. I compliment the Senator from Missouri. That \nwas a heartfelt message. I hope Mr. Dean gets it verbatim because your \nson, whom I have watched grow up through these many years, is proud to \nbe a United States Marine and to take on his duty.\n  Mr. President, I wish to advise colleagues at the hour of 5 o'clock \nthis debate on the Levin amendment is concluded. My understanding is we \nproceed to an amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, \nand Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Leahy. In examining that \namendment, I say to my colleagues who are anxious to continue \naddressing the issues of the amendment of Senator Levin, I think the \nbasic format in this amendment lays a clear predicate for all those who \nare desiring to speak to have their word tonight sometime because we \nare to conclude this debate tonight. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 34 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We started at 12:15. I would then yield for 10 minutes to \nSenator Biden. I then yield 8 minutes to Senator Obama, and then \nSenator Durbin will be next. Depending on how much time is left we can \ndetermine the time allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Was this a unanimous consent request made by the Senator \nfrom Michigan? We are still going back and forth?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. We understand that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. I, too, \ncompliment the Senator from Missouri for the service of his son. My son \nis not--he is in the military, in the National Guard. He is not in \nIraq, although he did spend some time in Kosovo. I admire the \npatriotism of his son and respect the point of view his son expressed. \nBut I think it confuses things.\n  Mr. President, last Thursday, we passed by a 99--1 vote an emergency \nspending bill to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and provide \nrelief to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. \n  Unfortunately, behind closed conference doors, a key provision of \nboth the House and Senate versions was stripped out--an amendment, \nintroduced by Representative Barbara Lee and myself that would bar any \nfunds from being used to establish permanent U.S. military bases in \nIraq or to control Iraq's oil.\n  I voted to support our troops, though I was surprised that my \namendment was stripped after not a single Senator publicly spoke \nagainst it during the floor debate.\n  But what bothers me is that by removing the ``no permanent bases'' \namendment, we make life more difficult for our men and women in uniform \nand undercut our Nation's broader effort against terrorism.\n  So I will reintroduce my amendment as part of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  It is straightforward, clear, and simple. It affirms that the United \nStates will not seek to establish permanent military bases in Iraq and \nhas no intention of controlling Iraqi oil.\n  I will repeat what I said 6 weeks ago:\n  While it may be obvious to Americans that we don't intend to stay in \nIraq indefinitely, such conspiracy theories are accepted as fact by \nmost Iraqis.\n  In an opinion poll conducted by the University of Maryland in \nJanuary, 80 percent of Iraqis--and 92 percent of the Sunni Arabs--\nbelieve we have plans to establish permanent military bases.\n  The same poll found that an astounding 88 percent of Sunni Arabs \napprove of attacks on American forces in part.\n  Why do Iraqis believe we want permanent bases? Why do they think we \nwould subject ourselves to the enormous ongoing costs in Iraq in blood \nand treasure? Do they think we want their sand? No, they think we want \ntheir oil.\n  To my mind, the connection between these two public opinion findings \nis incontrovertible.\n  Before you dismiss these as simple conspiracy theories, remember what \nIraqis have been through in the past 3 decades:\n  Three wars and a tyrannical regime that turned brother against \nbrother and made paranoia a way of life. \n  And there is a longer history, too: 400 years of British and Ottoman \noccupation have led to a deeply ingrained suspicion of a foreign \nmilitary presence.\n  These views extend well beyond Iraq. In a 2004 Pew Charitable Trust \nsurvey, majorities in all four Muslim states surveyed--Turkey, \nPakistan, Jordan, and Morocco--believed that control of Mideast oil was \nan important factor in our invasion of Iraq.\n  Our enemies understand the boon these misconceptions provide to their \nrecruiting efforts and use them as a rallying cry in their calls-to-\narms.\n  Last year in a letter intercepted by the United States military, \nAyman al-Zawahiri, the deputy leader of al-Qaeda, wrote to the recently \nkilled\n\n[[Page S6231]]\n\nJordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi:\n\n       The Muslim masses . . . do not rally except against an \n     outside occupying enemy.\n\n  Our military and diplomatic leaders understand that countering this \nvicious propaganda requires clear signals about our intentions in Iraq. \nAnd they have done just this.\n  General George Casey, the ground force commander in Iraq, told the \nCommittee on Armed Services last September: \n\n       Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of \n     occupation.\n\n  At the same hearing, General John Abizaid, the commander of all U.S. \ntroops in the Middle East, told Congress: \n\n       We must make clear to the people of the region we have no \n     designs on their territory or resources.\n\n   In March, the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, told an \nIraqi television station that the United States has ``no goal in \nestablishing permanent bases in Iraq.''\n  Unfortunately, this clarity has been clouded by mixed messages from \nthe senior-most decision-makers in the Bush administration.\n  To my knowledge, President Bush has never explicitly stated that we \nwill not establish permanent bases in Iraq, and both the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of State have left the door open to do just \nthat. \n  On February 17, 2005, Secretary Rumsfeld told the Committee on Armed \nServices: \n\n       We have no intention, at the present time, of putting \n     permanent bases in Iraq. \n\n  ``At the present time'' is not exactly an unequivocal statement.\n  On February 15, 2006, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearing, my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, asked Secretary \nRice:\n\n       Is it, in fact, the policy of the administration not to \n     have permanent bases in Iraq?\n\n  Rather than answering the simple one word, ``Yes,'' Secretary Rice \nsaid during a 400 word exchange on the question:\n\n       I don't want to in this forum try to prejudice everything \n     that might happen way into the future. \n\n  Just last Thursday, columnist Helen Thomas asked the White House \npress secretary to unambiguously declare that the United States will \nnot seek permanent bases in Iraq. Again, the press secretary could not \nunequivocally declare this to be the case.\n  These mixed messages are confusing to the American people and the \nIraqi people alike. They feed conspiracy theories and cede rhetorical \nspace to our enemies. They make it that much more difficult to win the \nbattle for the hearts and minds of 1.2 billion Muslims in the world. \nOur success in that battle will determine our success in the struggle \nbetween freedom and radical fundamentalism.\n  Against this backdrop, I believe that it is incumbent upon us to \nspeak where the administration has not. \n  My amendment will have no detrimental effect on the military \noperations of our Armed Forces in Iraq or their ability to provide \nsecurity for Iraqi oil infrastructure.\n  United Nations Council Resolution 1546 recognizes that the American \nand coalition forces are present in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi \nGovernment and that their operations are essential to Iraq's political, \neconomic, and social well-being.\n  In his first speech to the Iraqi parliament last month, Prime \nMinister Nouri al-Maliki endorsed that resolution. We are anxious for \nthe day when Iraqis can take control of their own destiny, but the \nIraqis are suspicious of our intentions and growing increasingly \nimpatient.\n  This amendment may not in itself change a lot of minds on the ground \nor in the region.\n  But it can mark the beginning of a sustained effort to demonstrate \nthrough words and deeds that we have no intention of controlling Iraq's \noil or staying there forever.\n  I believe it is our duty to do so.\n  I want to point out a couple of things. I have listened to some of \nthis debate. Sometimes I wonder whether we are debating the Levin \namendment or not. The Levin-Reed amendment says two things. It lays out \na plan. The front part of it is the part that is being ignored by most \npeople. The amendment lays out a specific plan to avoid trading a \ndictatorship for chaos in Iraq. Right now, I respectfully suggest the \nPresident has a plan how not to lose but no plan how to win. In my \nview, a plan to arbitrarily set a date to leave is not a plan. It is an \nexpression of overwhelming frustration and maybe on the part of some a \nconclusion reached that it is not winnable because it has been so badly \nhandled the last 2 years. I respect that position. I don't agree with \nit, but I respect it.\n  The fact is, what is before us in the Levin amendment is it first \ncalls for a political settlement and the sharing of economic resources. \nThat is another way of saying the Iraqis need a deal on oil that gives \nthe Sunnis a fair share of the revenues; and, secondly, it calls for \nthe President to convene what not just Joe Biden and this amendment but \nBiden before, and before that Henry Kissinger, and Secretary Shultz and \nothers called for, and that is convening of an international conference \nto promote a durable political settlement and reduce the interference \nby Iraq's neighbors in Iraq. And it calls for the things that everyone \nagrees have to be done, purging the sectarian militia which has \ninfiltrated the security forces.\n  My friend from Missouri stood up and talked about the Iraqi security \nforces. The Iraqi security forces are riddled with sectarian \ninfiltration. There is overwhelming evidence that Sadr suggests his \nMahdi militia join the military. There is overwhelming evidence that \nthe SCIRI and Dawa Parties have moved their people into the military as \nhave the Sadr militia. There is evidence of the fact that the Peshmerja \nare in the north. So let me ask a question: How is it remotely possible \nthat this government, assuming it is really good government, has a lot \nof personal courage and wisdom?\n  How can it run a country when it does not have a military that--at \nleast at any one time--one-third of the country doesn't trust?\n  Did you all notice what happened today? Saddam's defense lawyer, for \nwhom I have no particular empathy or sympathy--guess what. Five cops or \nfour cops--Iraqi police--show up with identification, take him away, \nand shoot him.\n  What has been going on? Pick up the paper. Every day--almost every \nday for the past months--a bus gets stopped, a group of Iraqi policemen \ntake people off the bus identified as Sunnis and blow their brains out; \nor the next morning--every morning--you read the paper. What do you \nfind? You find 9, 12, or 30 Sunnis handcuffed with bullets in their \nheads.\n  So I ask you the question, imagine the United States of America \ntrying to unite the North and the South, and if you had hit squads in \nthe South after the Civil War going after anybody who fought in the \nConfederacy--this is a big deal.\n  There is no possibility of avoiding a civil war, in my humble \nopinion, if you don't purge the police and then purge the military of \nthe sectarian thugs.\n  Second, we have a very first-rate Ambassador there. The best thing \nthat has happened to our effort is our present Ambassador. What did he \ndo? Remember when he said the first unity government wasn't legitimate \nbecause the Sunnis didn't participate? It was a legitimate point. How \ndo we get the Sunnis to participate in the election? You had the acting \nParliament pass a law defining what could kill the Constitution--\nchanging the law. That is a disaster.\n  So what did our Ambassador do? He said: Change it--quietly; a \nbrilliant diplomatic move. They changed the law going back to what it \nhad been under the law that was written in the first instance. Second, \nwhat did he do? He said: This isn't the final document. They amended \nthe Constitution at the last minute it was being voted on to say you \ncan amend it later. Why? For a specific purpose. Everybody knows that \nunless you get the Sunnis to buy in, there is no possibility of \nsuccess. So everyone has anticipated from the beginning, beginning with \nour Ambassador, that you have to amend the Constitution to give the \nSunnis a piece of the action.\n\n  Up to now, our administration has been saying quietly that would be \ndivisive absent the Parliament doing what is called for under the law, \nconvening, as they should be now, and now with about 3 months left, \nreporting to the entire Parliament amendments to the\n\n[[Page S6232]]\n\nConstitution that will then be sent out to the people to vote on. \nAbsent that, I do not know how this works.\n  The Sunnis need a piece of the action, to stay in the action.\n  My friend, the chairman, understands that there are three things \ngoing on. One, they are so-called insurgents. They are basically the \nold Saddamists. They are the Baathist Party, they are former military, \nand they are the Republican Guard.\n  As I said to the President, who asked the question after my first \ntrip from Iraq--he said: We have taken care of--I don't want to put \nwords in his mouth--he said it was a great victory. And it was a great \nvictory. I said: But Mr. President, 400,000 people went home with their \nguns. I said: Count the bodybags. We had such a blitzkrieg success; \nwhat happened? They didn't resist. They took off their uniforms, kept \ntheir guns, and raided the 800,000 tons of ammunition dumps we didn't \nguard. That is the insurgency--not bunch of dead-enders, as the \nSecretary of Defense said some time ago, and they are getting \nincreasingly organized.\n  There is a second group. The second group is the Zarqawi guys. They \nare the guys who are the jihadists--mostly from out of the country. As \nmy friends, the chairman and ranking member, know, the military has \nnever estimated them to make up more than 5 percent to 8 percent of the \nentire insurgency. They do bad things, but they are a separate group, \ncoordinating with but separate, with separate agendas, from the \ninsurgents.\n  There is a third group. The real problem is civil war. Insurgency is \nnot the big problem. It is a problem. The problem is sectarian violence \nwith Sunnis killing Kurds, Kurds executing Shiites, and Shiites mostly \neliminating Sunnis. Unless you stop that, what is the deal? I hope I am \nwrong, but as I say, take a look at my record on this for the last 3 \nyears and tell me. Am I wrong a lot of times? I haven't guessed this \none very wrong very many times.\n  Ask the following question: By December of 2007, we are going to have \na drastic withdrawal of American forces for one of two reasons: either \nbecause we actually have things going in Iraq, the Iraqis have not only \nstood but stood together, dealt with the Sunnis, dealt with the militia \nand kept the neighbors out, which means we will be able to draw forces \nhome, or we are going to be in a full-blown civil war.\n  I will make a prediction. This is a dangerous thing to do on the \nfloor, and I pray to God I am wrong about it. I think there is at least \nan even chance that you will hear the following debate among the \nforeign policy intellectuals on the left and on the right a year from \nnow. You have to let them fight it out in a civil war. It has to be \ndecided in a civil war; nothing we can do about it. Let the chips fall \nwhere they may, and we come back in and try to pick up the pieces. That \nmay be the ultimate strategy we have to deal with.\n  But to my friends who say get out at a time certain, I say I \nunderstand your frustration, but what do you do afterward? What do you \ndo if things go to hell in a hand basket quickly and there is civil war \nthat turns into a regional war? What is your plan?\n  The Levin amendment lays out a plan. It says take care of the \ninsurgency by giving the Sunnis a piece of the action so they turn on \nthe insurgents. They have a reason to want to be a part of the deal.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I have a more detailed plan as to how we should proceed. But don't \nconfuse the Levin plan by ruling it out. The Levin plan lays out what \nmust be done, how to do it, and it is done on the path by which we can \nleave and leave our interests intact.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for allowing me a few \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I did want \nto get in there when the Senator from New Jersey was speaking.\n  They keep talking about 8 generals out there--8 generals out of 4,000 \ngenerals who are retired right now. Three of the eight generals who had \ntheir own political plans were using that. I have listened to that over \nand over again.\n  I have just returned from my 11th trip, I say that to my friend from \nDelaware, to the Iraqi AOR. The reason I have done this is so I can \nwatch the progress that is being made--and I see the progress.\n  When the Senator from New Jersey stood up saying nothing has \nhappened, consider the fact that we now have three successful elections \nbehind us. Before each election, the Democrats on this floor said it is \nnot going to work, they will not have a free election, it isn't going \nto be successful. We now have had three. I was over there. I went over \nthe day the Ministers were ratified, and they are in there.\n  There are 164,000 trained and equipped troops. I think it is really \nbad, particularly when it is in error, for us to stand here on the \nfloor of this Senate and say that those troops are really not trained \nand equipped, that they are really not serviceable for war. I have \nheard all kinds of things which are a great disservice to these people. \nI was up there in Fallujah during the last election when these Iraqi \nsecurity forces were risking their lives going into town to vote.\n  Anyway, I went over there the other day, the day Zarqawi was killed, \nand I thank God that happened. It happened to be the same day that the \n4 Ministers out of some 30 Ministers were confirmed. I can remember \ntalking to them on a one-to-one basis.\n  Dr. al-Rubaie, the National Security Adviser for the Iraqis, is \nreally a quality guy. I spent several hours talking to him. He projects \nthat the number of troops in Iraq will drop below 100,000 by the end of \nthis year. This is kind of interesting. Here we are trying to dictate \nterms as to when we are going to pull out when they already know when \nthey are going to request and make a recommendation to us to pull out. \nThe other side has it completely backward. He is saying that right now; \nhe projects, the way we are going, that they are going to make a \nrequest by the end of this year to drop the U.S. forces and the \ncoalition down to 100,000. That would be a reduction of 30,000. Then he \nsays that by the end of the following year, they should be all the way \nout.\n  Dr. al-Rubaie has made it clear that a timetable has to be on Iraq's \nterms and that there is already a roadmap. For people who say we don't \nknow, there is no roadmap, there is no criteria out there, there is.\n  Let me tell you. This is a quote from Dr. al-Rubaie. This isn't me \ntalking, this is a quote from him. He said that Iraqi governorates must \nmeet ``stringent minimum requirements as a condition of being granted \ncontrol. Threat assessment of terrorist activities must be low or on a \ndownward trend. Local police and the Iraqi army must be deemed capable \nof dealing with criminal gangs, armed groups and militia, and border \ncontrol. There must be a clear and functioning command-and-control \ncenter overseen by the governor.'' He said, and this is his quote, that \n``13 of the 18 provinces''--18 in Iraq, and 13--``have met'' or are \nclose to meeting this criteria already.\n  One thing which has bothered me most recently is the inconsistency I \nhave observed over time in the Democrats' position. They claim to \ndisagree with the war in Iraq for the very same reasons that they used \nfor supporting going into Bosnia and Kosovo. I remember them standing \non this Senate floor saying that we have no reason to be going to \nBosnia and Kosovo because we don't have any security interests at \nstake.\n  In 1995, President Clinton urged Congress to support involvement in \nBosnia, and they agreed with his philosophy to ``stand up for peace and \nfreedom because it's in our interest to do so.'' That sounded real good \nat the time. Now, when President Bush is doing exactly the same thing, \nthey are saying: No. We have changed our position. We don't want to do \nthat anymore.\n  Opponents of the war in Iraq contradict themselves.\n  Senator Kerry stated, on April 6 of this year, that ``the [Iraq] \ninsurgency grew day by day to be an insurgency that is now a low-grade \ncivil war . . . and our troops can't resolve a civil war.''\n  The Senator from Delaware characterized this as a civil war. This \nisn't a civil war. This is a war where others are going after the \nIraqis. The insurgents aren't Iraqis. I don't know why people can't \nunderstand that.\n  Zarqawi was Jordanian, and Osama bin Laden is Saudi. There are \noutsiders\n\n[[Page S6233]]\n\nwho caused them to coalesce into getting along better with each other. \nThere were factions in Iraqi that you do not see today.\n  But Kerry endorsed involvement of U.S. troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, \nboth of which were civil wars. Those were civil wars. This is not a \ncivil war.\n  In 1995, President Clinton said that ``we must not turn our backs on \nBosnia,'' which was echoed by Senator Kerry when he stated that, \n``History has taught us that we can't sit idly by while people commit \nthese incredible evil acts against humanity.'' He was talking about \nBosnia and Kosovo. I would like to ask him: What evil acts are you \ntalking about when compared to Saddam Hussein, who murdered and \ntortured to death hundreds of thousands of his own people; where they \ndropped people into vats of acid; where people were begging, before \nthey were put into the shredders, to put their heads in first so they \ncould die quickly; women being raped and buried alive? We have not seen \natrocities such as this since Hitler in World War II. And here he was \ntalking about things that were taking place in Kosovo and Bosnia. It \nwasn't happening.\n  Let me tell you what Dr. al-Rubaie said. He said:\n\n       There is . . . an unofficial ``roadmap'' to foreign troop \n     reductions that will eventually lead to total withdrawal of \n     U.S. troops.\n\n  The roadmap is there. It is there, and it is one which they have put \ndown in writing.\n  I am going to deliver to you what Minister of Defense Jasim asked me \nto deliver to you--to us--in this Chamber today. He said:\n\n       Tell them their sacrifice is for a very noble cause, they \n     have given freedom to 26 million people. I believe they are \n     waging a just war for humanity. The terrorism must be stopped \n     or it will spread all over the world, like a carbon copy of \n     fascism and communism. . . . The American victims have borne \n     the price of a freer world. . . . We are very grateful. . . . \n     The war in Iraq is a just war and we have no option but \n     victory. It is not a war that affects Iraq alone, but is \n     truly a world war.\n       The terrorists are a sickness that must be eliminated . . . \n     There is great transformation taking place in Iraq but, the \n     international media does not focus on positive things \n     happening.\n\n  Here he talks about the only focus being on the negative things.\n  I will talk against the next amendment later.\n  I can tell you, after 11 trips to Iraq and the AOR, that every time I \ncome back to this Chamber and talk about the quality of the Iraqi \nsecurity forces and the successes they have had, I am very proud of \nthem, and they are very proud of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nwrapping up close to 20 Senators on this side who have spoken to this \nissue. I remind my colleague there will be further debate tonight. I am \nanxious to have as many as possible come over and join me. I commend \nthe Senator on his statement and thank the Senator for his long, hard \nwork on our bill throughout this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nmanaging this fine amendment.\n  In October of 2002, I delivered a speech opposing the war in Iraq.\n  I said that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless man, but that he posed no \nimminent and direct threat to the United States.\n  I said that a war in Iraq would take our focus away from our efforts \nto defeat al-Qaida.\n  And, with a volatile mix of ethnic groups and a complicated history, \nI said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq would require a U.S. \noccupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with \nundetermined consequences.\n  In short, I felt the decision unfolding then to invade Iraq was being \nmade without a clear rationale, based more on ideology and politics \nthan fact and reason.\n  It is with no great pleasure that I recall this now. Too many young \nmen and women have died. Too many have been maimed. Too many hearts \nhave been broken. I fervently wish I had been wrong about this war; \nthat my concerns had been unfounded.\n  America and the American people have paid a high price for the \ndecision to invade Iraq and myriad mistakes that followed. I believe \nthat history will not judge the authors of this war kindly.\n  For all these reasons, I would like nothing more than to support the \nKerry amendment; to bring our brave troops home on a date certain, and \nspare the American people more pain, suffering and sorrow.\n  But having visited Iraq, I am also acutely aware that a precipitous \nwithdrawal of our troops, driven by congressional edict rather than the \nrealities on the ground, will not undo the mistakes made by this \nadministration. It could compound them.\n  It could compound them by plunging Iraq into an even deeper and, \nperhaps, irreparable crisis.\n  We must exit Iraq, but not in a way that leaves behind a security \nvacuum filled with terrorism, chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide that \ncould engulf large swaths of the Middle East and endanger America. We \nhave both moral and national security reasons to manage our exit in a \nresponsible way.\n  I share many of the goals set forth in the Kerry amendment. We should \nsend a clear message to the Iraqis that we won't be there forever, and \nthat by next year our primary role should be to conduct \ncounterinsurgency actions, train Iraqi security forces, and provide \nneeded logistical support.\n  Moreover, I share the frustration with an administration whose \npolicies with respect to Iraq seem to simply repeat the simple-minded \nrefrains of ``we know best'' and ``stay the course.'' It's not \nacceptable to conduct a war where our goals and strategies drift \naimlessly regardless of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where \nwe end up with arbitrary, poll-driven troop reductions by the \nadministration--the worst of all possible outcomes.\n  As one who strongly opposed the decision to go to war and who has met \nwith servicemen and women injured in this conflict and seen the pain of \nthe parents and loved ones of those who have died in Iraq, I would like \nnothing more than for our military involvement to end.\n  But I do not believe that setting a date certain for the total \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops is the best approach to achieving, in a \nmethodical and responsible way, the three basic goals that should drive \nour Iraq policy: that is, (1) stabilizing Iraq and giving the factions \nwithin Iraq the space they need to forge a political settlement; (2) \ncontaining and ultimately defeating the insurgency in Iraq; and (3) \nbringing our troops safely home.\n  What is needed is a blueprint for an expeditious yet responsible exit \nfrom Iraq. A hard and fast, arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers \nour commanders in the field, and our diplomats in the region, \ninsufficient flexibility to implement that strategy.\n  For example, let's say that a phased withdrawal results in 50,000 \ntroops in Iraq by July 19, 2007. If, at that point, our generals and \nthe Iraqi Government tell us that having those troops in Iraq for an \nadditional 3 or 6 months would enhance stability and security in the \nregion, this amendment would potentially prevent us from pursuing the \noptimal policy.\n  It is for this reason that I cannot support the Kerry amendment. \nInstead, I am a cosponsor of the Levin amendment, which gives us the \nbest opportunity to find this balance between our need to begin a \nphase-down and our need to help stabilize Iraq. It tells the Iraqis \nthat we won't be there forever so that they need to move forward on \nuniting and securing their country. I agree with Senator Warner that \nthe message should be ``we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with \nit.'' At the same time, the amendment also provides the Iraqis the time \nand the opportunity to accomplish this critical goal.\n  Essential to a successful policy is the administration listening to \nits generals and diplomats and members of Congress especially those who \ndisagree with their policies and believe it is time to start bringing \nour troops home.\n  The overwhelming majority of the Senate is already on record voting \nfor an amendment stating that calendar year 2006 should be a period of \nsignificant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security \nforces\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\ntaking the lead for the security, creating the conditions for the \nphased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq. The Levin \namendment builds on this approach.\n  The White House should follow this principle as well. Visiting Iraq \nfor a few hours cannot resuscitate or justify a failed policy. No \namount of spin or photo opportunities can change the bottom line: this \nwar has been poorly conceived and poorly managed by the White House, \nand that is why it has been so poorly received by the American people..\n  And it is troubling to already see Karl Rove in New Hampshire, \ntreating this as a political attack opportunity instead of a major \nnational challenge around which to rally the country.\n  There are no easy answers to this war. I understand that many \nAmericans want to see our troops come home. The chaos, violence, and \nhorrors in Iraq are gut-wrenching reminders of what our men and women \nin uniform, some just months out of high school, must confront on a \ndaily basis. They are doing this heroically, they are doing this \nselflessly, and more than 2,500 of them have now made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country.\n  Not one of us wants to see our servicemen and women in harm's way a \nday longer than they have to be. And that's why we must find the most \nresponsible way to bring them home as quickly as possible, while still \nleaving the foundation of a secure Iraq that will not endanger the free \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized. The \nSenator has 14 minutes 47 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is time for American troops to come \nhome. That was the judgment of the Senate last year. Last year, by a \nvote of 79 to 19, we adopted on a bipartisan basis an amendment written \nlargely by the Senator from Michigan but amended and then cosponsored \nby the Senator from Virginia. It was a bipartisan amendment.\n  By 79 to 19, we said last year that this year would be different. \nThis just would not be another year, it would be a year of significant \ntransition, and we were specific about what that transition meant. It \nmeant that the Iraqis would be moving toward control of their own \nnation. It meant that their forces would take the lead. Those were our \nwords--``take the lead''--in defending their country. It meant that we \nwould create the condition for phased redeployment--that is, withdrawal \nof U.S. forces. That is how we voted last year, 79 to 19.\n  Today, we are now debating again whether American forces can start to \ncome home. I thought we already decided that last year, that this would \nbe the year when they start to come home.\n  Senator Levin brings an amendment to the Senate and says again, as we \ndid last year, we will start redeploying or withdrawing American forces \nthis year. What do we hear from the other side of the aisle? The same \nRepublicans, many of whom voted to start bringing troops home this \nyear, now resist the idea.\n  Is that because Iraq is stronger today? Unfortunately, the statistics \ndo not suggest it. The news reports from the New York Times tells us in \nMay 2003, there were five recorded incidents of sectarian violence. In \nMay of 2004, 10; in May of 2005, 20; in May of 2006, 250.\n  To suggest that Iraq is stronger this year, a year later, is at least \nsubject to debate. But this much we do know: We know we are paying a \nprice every single day. The heartbreaking newscasts we listen to are of \nour men and women, our brothers and sisters, our sons and daughters who \ncontinue to die in Iraq, as they simply drive their vehicles down the \nroad or stand and guard a security installation, 2,508 of our best and \nbravest who have died.\n  The obvious question is, When will this end? The Bush administration, \nwhat plan do they have? No end in sight for the way they view it. I \nlistened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say the Iraqis \nwill take control in the future. This is the fourth year we have been \ntold that the Iraqis will stand up and defend their own country. We are \ntold they have 260,000 soldiers and police prepared to defend their own \ncountry, ready to fight.\n  You know when I will believe that? When the first American soldier \ncomes home, replaced by an Iraqi soldier. That has not happened yet. We \nare about to send 21,000 more American soldiers over to fight in \nrotation to keep 130,000 on the ground. If these Iraqi forces are so \nwell trained and so well prepared, why are we sending another 21,000? I \ndon't think we can explain that.\n  I think we know what this is about. We are facing a situation in Iraq \ntoday where the Iraqis have the wrong message from America. The Iraqis \nbelieve that they can wait, patiently wait, until the day comes when \nthey defend their own country.\n  And why not? They have the best military in the world, the American \nmilitary, in place defending their country. They have the American \ntaxpayers paying for that defense. They understand we are prepared to \ninvest those resources, and they think it will be indefinite. Nothing \nwe are going to do on the floor of this U.S. Senate will change that \npoint of view, unless we adopt the Levin amendment which says we will \nbegin to withdraw the forces, redeploy the forces, this year.\n  There has been a lot of criticism on the floor that the party on the \nother side of the aisle, the Republicans, is all unified and the \nDemocrats cannot seem to all agree on anything. I do not know what the \nvote will be on the Levin amendment. I think it will be a substantial \nvote within the Democratic caucus. But our critics are wrong.\n  Mr. President, 100 percent of the Democratic caucus believes it is \ntime for change. And 100 percent of the Republican caucus believes it \nis time to stay the course, not change. They stand unified for the \npremise that we will not demand accountability. They stand unified for \nthe premise that we will not have any change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the American people understand, as we do, that it \nis time for us to say to the Iraqis: Stand and defend your own nation. \nLet American soldiers start coming home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask, how many minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, my \ncosponsor, Mr. Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  There are two key elements in the Levin-Reed amendment. The first is \nto begin redeployment, this year, of American combat forces in Iraq. So \nmany of my colleagues have mentioned Mr. Rubaie, who is the National \nSecurity Adviser for the Iraqi Government. On two occasions he has said \nit is not only feasible but desirable. He said it first on television, \nand then he said it just this week in a carefully crafted editorial. So \nthis is something that I think can be done, and, according to a key \nleader in the Iraq Government, should be done.\n  The second element is that the President should submit to Congress a \nplan by the end of 2006, with estimated dates for the continued phased \nredeployments of U.S. forces from Iraq, with the understanding that \nunexpected contingencies may arise. The President should do this with \nthe understanding that unexpected contingencies may arise.\n  This has been referred to as an arbitrary timetable. It is not \narbitrary, and it is not a timetable. It is not a timetable of our \ncreation, but it would be of the President. So do, I assume, those who \nobject to this feel that the President could not produce such a \ntimetable? Or if he did produce such a timetable, it would be \narbitrary, that it would be made without consultation with our military \nleaders, that it would be made without reference to conditions on the \nground? I do not think so. In fact, I think such a timetable would be \nappropriate and necessary.\n  Also, I should point out that our amendment recognizes the residual\n\n[[Page S6235]]\n\npresence of U.S. forces in Iraq, those that will be training Iraqi \nforces, those that will provide logistical support, and those that \nwould conduct counterterrorism operations, our special operations \ntroops.\n  But, essentially, what we would also like to do, which is so \ncritical, is to begin this transition from a predominantly military \nresponse to a nonmilitary one. During and after the phased redeployment \nof U.S. forces from Iraq, the United States will need a sustained \nnonmilitary effort to actively support reconstruction, governments, and \na durable political solution.\n  One significant reason why our military is stuck in Iraq today is \nbecause we have not made an appropriate nonmilitary effort. The \nadministration has bungled reconstruction. They have yet to deploy more \nthan 4 provisional reconstruction teams in the almost 18 provinces in \nIraq. They continue to lag behind in terms of political mentoring, in \nterms of reconstruction, in terms of economic activity. They have done \nnothing.\n  As a result, the only real viable tool we have is military forces. \nAnd the commanders will tell you on the ground that they are just \nbuying time, that without this nonmilitary effort, all of our plans for \nIraq will not succeed.\n  Any effort like this requires popular support. Popular support rests \nupon candor with the people. This administration has not been candid \nwith the people. They have not been candid with respect to the costs of \nthis war. And those costs will go up.\n  Indeed, to stay the course, we can predict billions and billions and \nbillions of more dollars. They have not been candid with respect to the \nlength of our operations. They have not been candid with respect to the \nimpact of these operations on our troops. They have substituted slogans \nfor candor.\n  This amendment gives the President an opportunity to present a plan \nnot only to the Congress but to the American people, a plan that will \nbe candid, a plan that will strive for victory, a plan of his making. \nWithout such a plan, we will continue to drift, and the chances of \nsuccess will continue to diminish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, there is much we all agree upon in this body. We have \nan interest in the stability of Iraq. And we want to improve the \nchances of success in Iraq. The disagreement is over whether the \npresent course, with its open-ended commitment to maintain our military \npresence in Iraq, as we now have it, contributes to that stability or \nwhether or not we must prod the Iraqis to do what only they can do--\ncome together to end the insurgency and to avoid an all-out civil war.\n  The President of Iraq, Mr. Talabani, a few months ago, said the \nfollowing about what Iraqis believe. He said that Iraqis believe that \nU.S. forces are ready ``to stay as long as we ask them, no matter what \nthe period is.''\n  That perception on the part of the President of Iraq, reflecting the \nview, presumably, of many Iraqis, that the United States is ``ready to \nstay'' as long as the Iraqis ask us, no matter what the period is, is a \nperception which must end. It is a perception that was based on our \nadministration's commitment, which was open-ended, unlimited, \nunconditional.\n  Iraqis must make a choice. It is a choice that our blood and our \ntreasure has given them. The Iraqis, and the Iraqis alone, can unite to \navoid all-out civil war, by making the political power sharing that \nneeds to be done. Only the Iraqis can decide that they are going to \ndivide the resources equitably so that they can bring in all the groups \nand the insurgency and avoid an all-out civil war. Only the Iraqis can \nunite to remove the militia control of the police.\n  Their unity can do that. We cannot do that for them. We have given \nthem an opportunity. Mr. President, 2,500 American lives, 7 times as \nmany American wounded, have given them an opportunity. They must make a \nchoice: Do they want a nation or do they want civil war?\n  To maintain this open-ended commitment, which we now have, is \ncontributing to a dependency of the Iraqis on us rather than forcing \nthem, prodding them, to do what only they can do to build a nation.\n  The Levin-Reed sense-of-the-Congress amendment proposes that a phased \nredeployment of U.S. troops be begun by the end of this year. Our \namendment does not establish a fixed ending date for redeployment. It \ndoes not propose a fixed timetable once the phased redeployment has \nbegun. But while it does not establish a timetable, it does establish a \nfixed time for the beginning of a phased redeployment by the end of \nthis year. It is not precipitous. It is by the end of this year begin a \nphased redeployment of American troops.\n  Mr. President, the National Security Adviser of Iraq has been quoted \na number of times on the floor.\n  Do I have a minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 5 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The National Security Adviser of Iraq said the following in \nyesterday's Washington Post: We envisage the United States troop \npresence by year's end to be under 100,000. That is a reduction of \n30,000. That is totally in keeping with what the Levin-Reed amendment \nproposes. That is the Iraqi envisioned timetable. We want to hold them \nto that vision for their sake and for ours.\n  Then Mr. Rubaie, the Iraqi National Security Adviser, said the \nfollowing--and these are words which every one of us should soak in--\nthat the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's Government in \nthe eyes of its people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let us do that in a way which is thoughtful, orderly, and \nplanned. And that is what the Levin-Reed amendment proposes.\n  I thank the Chair. And I thank my good friend from Virginia, our \nchairman, for the way in which this debate has been handled on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with regard to the pending amendment, I \nwould only say, in response to the extra 10 seconds you had, I would \nhope that security adviser was in consultation with our Government at \nthe time he made those remarks to determine the authenticity of those \nremarks.\n  Now, my understanding is we now turn to an amendment by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Wisconsin, I believe. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement----\n  Mr. WARNER. Cosponsors of that amendment: the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  I inquire of the manager, in consultation with the proponents of this \namendment, first, if we could get some estimate of the time for the \nintroduction of the amendment. And then I would hope we would continue \nthe practice that we have had today by which Senators go back and forth \non each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would propose that the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Wisconsin control the time which has \nbeen allocated to them. And as to when they bring up their amendment, \nit would be up to them because, as I envision this, they and you or \nyour designee would manage that time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I intend to remain. I do not know that \nthere is a time agreement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is unaware of a time agreement at \nthis time.\n  Mr. WARNER. In other words, we are in an unusual situation. Now, \nmaybe the distinguished colleague from Massachusetts can help advise \nhis leadership and me as to the time. It would be helpful because, like \ncolleagues on this side, there are commitments on our side with regard \nto what Members wish to do this evening.\n  So I am just trying to strike a note of comity so that we can \naccommodate those Senators on both sides of the aisle who are anxious \nto participate in this debate.\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would yield, I totally concur that this \nnext amendment should be brought up and debated in an orderly way, but \nthat being agreed upon, I would hope, between the sponsors of that \namendment and the chairman, the Republican manager.\n  So I do not think there is any need for me, frankly, to intervene in \nthat process. Perhaps you could hear from the Senator from \nMassachusetts as to what his plans are and how he plans to proceed. I \nthink that would be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill. I see no \nreason why we cannot proceed as we normally do in the Senate. I am \nhappy to live by the tradition, with the distinguished manager, of \ngoing back and forth. We do have a little bit of an issue with a couple \nof Senators who need to attend other events. They are not going to \nspeak very long.\n  So what I would like to do is be able to have both of them speak. \nThen if I could open up, and then Senator Feingold speak. And then we \nwould go back and forth. We have a number of speakers. I can't tell you \nexactly how long it is going to take now. But we are not trying to \nprolong it. We, obviously, have waited a significant amount of time. We \nwere going to bring this up last week, and then we ran into this little \nparliamentary game that was played, wanting to go through the caucus. \nAnd now we are finally here.\n  So I want to make sure we have an opportunity to adequately lay out \nand counter what has been about 6 days of both misinterpretation and \nmisstatement about what this is and what it is not. So I am happy to \nmanage it. I respect the willingness of the Senator from Michigan to \nlet me do that. We will try to be as expeditious as we can.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I don't wish to \nmisinterpret his comments, but there was an amendment brought up by his \nsenior colleague from Massachusetts that took an inordinate amount of \ntime, which we had not anticipated. If there was some disjuncture of \nthe process over here, I believe it was initiated on that side.\n\n  Let's return to the matter at hand. Would 30 minutes allow you to \nbegin this debate and then we could have, say, 15 or so on this side \nand then--\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we would need a little bit longer than that \nto sort of open it up if we can. Simply because I am trying to \naccommodate these two Senators, if we could let them speak, I think the \nSenator from Illinois would like 10 minutes and the Senator from \nVermont would like about 10 minutes. Then I could open up. Senator \nFeingold, I know, wants to speak. I think he wanted to speak for about \n45 minutes or more.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do you think we could have some response from this side \nbefore Senator Feingold begins?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, like the \nSenator from Vermont, has been here a long time. He knows that \nsometimes on these things, we can spend more time working out the \nagreement before time than it would actually take. Since I am one of \nthe ones who has to leave, I would ask at least on the original consent \nthat right after Senator Durbin, I be allowed to speak for 10 minutes. \nI suspect this is going to work itself out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not objecting to that. I recognize you Senators have \ncommitments. There are colleagues on this side who have commitments. We \nare trying to balance that and recognize that the proponents of the \namendment should have an opportunity to lay it down. It so happens that \nthere are four cosponsors.\n  Mr. KERRY. So that we don't chew up all the time trying to figure out \nhow to chew up the time, let me suggest that we agree that we have 20 \nminutes quickly divided between the Senator from Illinois and the \nSenator from Vermont. Then if Senator Feingold and I could open for the \ntime that we need, and then it would be up to the Senator from \nVirginia. He obviously would want to have an appropriate amount of time \nto respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, but can he give us \nsome definition of the time desired by yourself and Senator Feingold? \nLet's assume it is a half hour now between the Senator from Illinois \nand the Senator from Vermont; that is, 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Twenty minutes, 10 and 10.\n  Mr. KERRY. Just to make certain that we are covering the time--and I \nam not sure we will use it--I certainly would want to reserve an hour \nfor each.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be an hour and 20 minutes before anyone on \nthis side--\n  Mr. KERRY. Two hours and 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Two hours and 20 minutes before anyone on this side gets \nan opportunity to seek recognition other than the manager for purposes \nof a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator asked me how much time we \nneeded. Whether it is before someone answers or not is something that \ncan be worked out. That is the time we need.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a substantial departure from the manner in which \nwe have managed this bill thus far. I really think that this is most \nunusual. We have no time agreement. We have an open-ended amendment. We \nhave four sponsors. We have colleagues that have commitments tonight. I \nreally believe at some point----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how about if we let the two Senators I \nmentioned proceed. Senator Feingold and I could each take 30 minutes at \nthis point. Then they have a response. Then we can come back and \nrespond afterwards.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. That is quite agreeable to me, take 30 minutes to \npresent the amendment. Then we will on this side have an equal amount \nof time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Instead of taking an hour each--I need to protect Senator \nFeingold's request. He is not here, and I am already compromising \nmyself on his behalf--we would both give up a half hour to begin with, \nso we would take an hour and 20 minutes, and then the Senator from \nVirginia would have an hour or whatever he wants to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. So an hour and 20 minutes on this side to initiate the \namendment. I will concede that we will do that. But it seems to me \nsomewhat a departure from the way we normally manage things. Then it \ncomes to this side for, let's say, an hour's debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. Senator Lieberman has been here off and \non during the day wanting to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If there is going to be any time agreement, Senator \nLieberman ought to be worked into this. We have Senator Byrd here who \nhas been calling all day.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be happy to say, when the time \ncomes to this side, he can initiate on our time his remarks.\n\n  Mr. REID. Senators Byrd and Lieberman or both.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Lieberman. I didn't hear Senator Byrd mentioned. \nLet's hear from our senior colleague as to what his desires are.\n  Mr. REID. We will take you up on that, if you will give Senator \nLieberman 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would be happy to do that at the conclusion of 1 hour \nand 20 minutes, that our side be recognized for a period of, let's say, \n30 minutes, of which the first 10 will be given to Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. REID. As usual, the Senator from Virginia is very kind.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do believe we ought to hear from our senior colleague \nas to what his desires might be.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Before the Senator speaks, does that mean that the \noriginal request that Senator Durbin and I would each be heard first--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has not heard a unanimous consent \nrequest from the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we agreed that since these two Senators are \nunder a timeline difficulty, we would try to accommodate them. Could we \nhave the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Illinois each speak \nfor 10 minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection, if you wish to initiate with those \ntwo\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\nSenators beginning with 10 minutes each. Then what is to follow \nthereafter?\n  Mr. KERRY. At that point I would hope that Senator Feingold and I \nwould have an opportunity to introduce the amendment itself.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore using what amount of time?\n  Mr. KERRY. As I said, we would like 30 minutes each, and then we will \ncome back afterwards.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we are back to the hour and 20 minutes on that side \nbefore we receive any time on this side?\n  Mr. KERRY. We won't even introduce the amendment, if we don't do \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment has been here for some time. I have had an \nopportunity to examine it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before the Senator does that, may I inject--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, out of respect for our distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner.\n  I have an amendment. I would at least like to debate it or have some \ntime to speak on it. I was hoping that I might be able to speak for not \nto exceed 30 minutes on my amendment. I would like to throw that in the \nmix.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: To inform both the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, myself, and others, what is the \norder before the Senate at this time? My understanding is the Kerry-\nFeingold amendment with an unlimited amount of time on it and there is \nno provision for other amendments at this time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMassachusetts, under the previous agreement, was to be recognized for \nhis amendment at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, the order has been in for some \n24 hours by which this is the amendment. The time allocation is under \nthe control of the two managers. We will work that out momentarily, \nhopefully on an equitable basis. I do not at this point in time see the \nopportunity for the introduction of your amendment, I say with due \nrespect, until such time as the debate on the Kerry-Feingold amendment \nis concluded.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have not heard all of the debate, but from \nwhat I have heard, I don't think that another Senator, this Senator, \nwould be precluded from asking for time to explain his amendment. Now \nif the agreement may preclude other amendments--I don't know whether it \ndoes or not. If it does, then that is one thing. But I have an \namendment, and I would like to speak on it. I wonder if Senators \nwouldn't allow me to speak. I have four to six pages. I can do those in \n40 minutes or less.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be more than happy to accommodate \nmy distinguished friend and leader. I simply say that unless we amend \nthe order at this point, I do not see that opportunity. I will be glad \nto put in a quorum in hopes that we can resolve not only the time \nallocation on this side but how we could accommodate our distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest that the two Senators who need 10 minutes each \nbe recognized now and that we try to negotiate these various time needs \nduring their presentation.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a very reasonable request. I now ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Illinois \nbe----\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, could I \nplease have the unanimous consent request stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is the \nfollowing----\n  Mr. WARNER. That the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nIllinois be recognized at this time seriatim for 10 minutes each, \nduring which time we are going to try to negotiate the time allowance. \nThen at the end of that 20 minutes, we resume under the standing order \nof the Senate and the Kerry amendment goes back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Levin-Reed \namendment on Iraq, and I will also vote for the Kerry amendment, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor.\n  Both amendments are a step in the right direction, as they finally \nbegin the process of winding down what has been the most poorly \nconceived, costly, and tragic misuse of United States military power \nsince Vietnam.\n  We got into this war for reasons that bear little if any resemblance \nto the reasons the White House gives for keeping our troops there today \nat a cost of more than a billion dollars every week.\n  First it was weapons of mass destruction. There were none. Anyone who \nurged continued monitoring by United Nations inspectors was ridiculed \nby the White House as being naive.\n  Then it was Saddam Hussein's supposed ties to al-Qaida, which was a \nblatant, calculated distortion.\n  There was none, yet the Vice President continues to say there was. \nToday, thanks to the policy of the President and the rubber stamping by \nthe Congress, Iraq and Guantanamo are the rallying cry for terrorists \naround the world.\n  Then it was because Saddam Hussein--who posed no threat to the United \nStates--was a brutal dictator, which he was. He was also supported by \nthe Reagan administration.\n  That, however, is not a justification for a war that has cost the \nlives and limbs of thousands of young Americans and tens of thousands \nof Iraqi civilians.\n  Winning against terrorism, like stopping the proliferation of \ndangerous weapons, promoting peace between Arabs and Israelis, or \nsolving any other regional or global problem, requires the trust, the \nrespect, the cooperation and the support of our allies.\n  Unfortunately, these, too, are casualties of this war. Squandered \naway.\n  The damage that this reckless adventure has caused to our reputation, \nparticularly among the world's Muslims in countries like Turkey, \nJordan, Indonesia, Egypt and other traditional allies, is incalculable.\n  We have heard a lot of partisan rhetoric about cutting and running. \nHow easy it is to ask others to fight and die from the safety and \ncomfort of an office in Washington.\n  How easy it is to vote for tax cuts and to self-righteously wave the \nflag, while our troops are scavenging for scraps of metal to protect \nthemselves from IEDs. They were sent to fight and die without armor, by \ntop Pentagon officials back home who proudly, dismissively and \nresolutely insisted they were ready, when they were not.\n  How easy it is to mislead the country, with patriotic pronouncements \nby the President like ``mission accomplished,'' or that we are seeing \nthe ``last throes'' of the insurgency.\n  Contrary to the blatantly partisan and false attacks of the \nPresident's political advisors, no one questions the threat that al-\nQaida and other terrorist networks pose to the security of Americans \nand to the people of other nations.\n  No one questions that we need an effective strategy to combat it. The \nissue is how best to combat it.\n  This administration has shown the world how not to do it, creating a \nlengthening catalogue of squander.\n  You don't do it by starting a war with selective, faulty \nintelligence, by dismissing thoughtful criticism as unpatriotic, \nwithout enough troops, with no plan to win the peace, by cavalierly \ndiscounting the risks.\n  You don't do it by repeatedly misleading the American people.\n  You don't do it by creating and fueling a terrorism problem where \nthere was none.\n  And you don't do it by shamelessly denigrating the Geneva Conventions \nand the rights and values that distinguish us from the terrorists.\n  Unlike the war to defeat the Taliban, which continues to this day and \nshows no signs of abating, the invasion of Iraq had nothing to do with \nOsama bin Laden or the attacks on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon.\n  It has degraded our military in ways that will cost us trillions--not \nbillions--trillions of dollars to rebuild.\n  It has left a legacy of thousands of maimed and crippled young \nveterans with medical and other needs that they, their families, and \ntheir communities will cope with for the rest of their lives.\n\n[[Page S6238]]\n\n  Our troops have fought bravely in the harshest of conditions. They \nare our constituents. They are the sons and daughters of our friends \nand neighbors. They have carried out extraordinarily difficult \nmissions, including tracking down and capturing Saddam Hussein and \nkilling Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n  They have sacrificed so much. We support them unequivocally, \nDemocrats and Republicans. The question is how we can best support \nthem.\n  This was to be the year of transition. That was what the Congress \nvoted last year, and what the President signed into law. Yet, the \nAdministration continues to simply stay the course. This course is not \nin America's best interest.\n  Iraq has a new constitution. It has had elections. It has a \ndemocratically elected government.\n  We have trained and equipped more than 100,000 Iraqi soldiers.\n  It has been more than three years since the overthrow of Saddam \nHussein. More than 2,500 Americans have died. We have been there as \nlong as we were in World War II.\n  The Iraqi people need to take responsibility for their own country. \nIt will not happen immediately, but both the Levin amendment and the \nKerry amendment move us toward that goal.\n  I have cast over 12,000 votes in this Senate. I am as proud of my \nvote against the open ended resolution that gave the President the \nauthority to invade Iraq as any I have cast in 32 years. It is time for \nthe Congress to change the course of a policy that has cost us hundreds \nof billions of dollars that would have been far better spent here at \nhome, that has weakened our leadership, that is dividing our country, \nand that has not made us safer.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is to be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the course of a congressional career, \nyou are asked to make many votes. Most of them are fairly routine and \nnot long remembered. In the course of my career on Capitol Hill, those \nvotes that have kept me up at night, those I remember years after they \nare cast relate to one issue--the issue of war. When you have cast that \nvote, if the decision to go forward has been made, people will die--not \njust the enemy but brave Americans and usually innocent civilians.\n  So I remember very well that night in October 2002, when we were \ncalled to this floor of the Senate to vote on the issue of authorizing \nthe President to go to war in Iraq. I say to the Senator from West \nVirginia, I will never forget that moment. There were 23 of us--22 on \nthis side of the aisle and 1 on the other side--who stood up and voted \nno. If the Senator recalls, that vote ended late at night, near \nmidnight. I stayed on the floor because I knew I would not be able to \nsleep when I got home. There were two Senators who were here waiting \nwith the same feelings of emotion. One of them was our late colleague, \nSenator Paul Wellstone. Senator Wellstone was going back home to \nMinnesota to face reelection. I remember saying to him, ``Paul, I hope \nthis doesn't cost you the election.'' Do you know what he said to me? \nHe said, ``It doesn't matter, this is what I believe. This is who I \nam.'' That was the last conversation I ever had with Paul Wellstone. He \ndied in a plane crash a few days later. I have thought about him a lot \never since and I miss him. I miss his voice. I wish he were here today. \nIf he were here, I know what he would be doing. He would be joining me \nin supporting the Kerry amendment. I believe that in the meantime he \nprobably would have voted, as I have, to support the troops. I voted to \ngive the President every penny he has asked for in this war. Once that \ndecision to go forward was made, my yardstick was very basic. If it \nwere your son or daughter in uniform in Iraq, would you not give them \neverything they needed to wage this war and to come home safely? It was \nan easy question to ask and answer, particularly if you lived through \nthe debacle of Vietnam, when our poor soldiers became the victims of \npublic contempt because of our displeasure with the decisions of \npoliticians. That must never happen again.\n  So now in the fourth year of the struggle, I have given the President \nevery resource he has asked for. I have stood behind him and this \nadministration even when I disagreed with their policy because I felt \nit was best that we stay uniform.\n  Today, I join in a decision being made by several of my colleagues to \nsay that we must make it clear to the Iraqi people that our commitment \nis not forever. What have we given the Iraqis? We have given them 2,508 \nAmerican lives. We have given them 18,000 soldiers who have returned \nhome with injuries of body and spirit--2,000 with head injuries that \nmay be life-changing. We have given them $300 billion of our treasury. \nWe have given them the focus of our attention and the focus of our \nresources at the expense of our own country. What have they received in \nreturn? Their dictator has been deposed. We dug him out of a hole in \nthe ground, put him on trial in front of his own people. We have given \nthe Iraqi people three elections and two governments. We said control \nyour future and your fate; this is your country. We helped them train \nabout 264,000 soldiers and policemen. We invested billions in their \ninfrastructure for oil and water.\n\n  We have given that nation virtually more than any other nation has \never given. But now we must tell the Iraqis something very straight and \nsimple: It is time for them to stand and defend their own country. If \nthey truly believe in the future of Iraq, it is time for them to stand \nand risk their own lives and their own blood for their own nation. This \namendment by Senators Kerry, Feingold, and others, says to them that at \nthe end of the year we will consider the withdrawal of all of our \ntroops.\n  Now, I say that with some equivocation because if you read the \namendment, Senators Kerry and Feingold have been careful. They \nunderstand that we are not going to pull every troop out as of the last \nday regardless of the circumstances. They have carefully crafted the \nlanguage, which says that if we face a threat of terrorism, if we are \nstill needed to continue training troops, or if there is danger to \nAmericans at our facilities, we can stay and defend, as we should. It \nis not an immediate withdrawal on the last day. But it says to the \nIraqis: You must stand and fight on your own.\n  I have been told over and over again how well trained these Iraqi \nsoldiers are. The proof of their fitness for battle is when the first \nIraqi soldier replaces an American soldier, so that soldier can come \nhome with his mission truly accomplished.\n  If we leave this open-ended, as those on the other side would \nsuggest, I am afraid the Iraqis will understand that they have the best \nmilitary in the world that will stay there indefinitely. How can we do \nthat to our soldiers who have performed so well, who have been the \nmodel of bravery, the model of patriotism?\n  We have been misled into this war. We were given information by the \nadministration that was not true. This war has not been well managed by \nthis administration in terms of the number of troops sent into the \nfield or the equipment being given to them. We know that. For years, we \nhave been promised that these Iraqis would stand and fight and we could \ncome home. That has not happened. Now I have reached that point that \nother colleagues have reached as well, where I believe the Iraqis must \nbe told that now it is your nation, now it is your turn.\n  For those who say that one year is not enough time--one year is not \nenough time? What happened in the last 12 months in Iraq, in the last \n12-month period of time? We have lost 762 American soldiers in the last \n12 months. We have spent $90 billion in the last 12 months. We have \nseen thousands of soldiers return home with injuries. It is not just \nthe passage of time, it is the passage of life and life's journey for \nso many of our soldiers. Twelve months is a reasonable time--12 months, \nand all that it means for us and all that we would give, is a \nreasonable time.\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\n  I say to the Senators from Massachusetts and Wisconsin, I thank you \nfor bringing this measure before us. I think it is now time for the \nAmerican people to stand up and say to this administration: You misled \nus into this war. You have no plan for it to end. Our brave soldiers \ndeserve the leadership that brings us to the right conclusion. I think \nwe can do that. I think this amendment is a step in the right \ndirection. I will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank all for their cooperation. I think \nwe have reached a reconciliation of the needs and requirements of all \nfor a period of time. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nKerry be recognized now to offer his amendment and, provided further, \nthat he then be allocated 30 minutes to speak; further, that there be \ndebate only as follows; provided further, that that be followed by up \nto 30 minutes under the control of the chairman, Senator Warner, to be \nfollowed by up to 30 minutes under the control of Senator Boxer, to be \nfollowed by 20 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd; provided \nfurther, that there now be a period of 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Lieberman; thereafter, provided further, that there be 30 \nminutes under the control of Chairman Warner, to be followed by Senator \nFeingold, to be followed by Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am one of the main cosponsors of the \namendment. I request to be the next Democratic speaker for 30 minutes \nafter Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, we have now spent \n30 minutes working out this time arrangement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will cede my time to Senator Feingold \nnow, Senator Boxer can go, and I will go afterwards. I will just flip \nwith Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. As amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As amended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Has the Chair announced the acceptance of the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is no objection to the request.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4442\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4442, and I yield \n30 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4442.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the redeployment of United States Armed Forces \n from Iraq in order to further a political solution in Iraq, encourage \n   the people of Iraq to provide for their own security, and achieve \n                     victory in the war on terror)\n\n       On page 437, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1084. UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Redeployment of Troops From Iraq.--\n       (1) Schedule for redeployment.--For purposes of \n     strengthening the national security of the United States, the \n     President shall redeploy, commencing in 2006, United States \n     forces from Iraq by July 1, 2007, in accordance with a \n     schedule coordinated with the Government of Iraq, leaving \n     only the minimal number of forces that are critical to \n     completing the mission of standing up Iraqi security forces, \n     conducting targeted and specialized counterterrorism \n     operations, and protecting United States facilities and \n     personnel.\n       (2) Consultation with congress required.--The President \n     shall consult with Congress regarding the schedule for \n     redeployment and shall submit such schedule to Congress as \n     part of the report required under subsection (c).\n       (3) Maintenance of over-the-horizon troop presence.--The \n     President should maintain an over-the-horizon troop presence \n     to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security \n     interests.\n       (b) Iraq Summit.--The President should work with the \n     leaders of the Government of Iraq to convene a summit as soon \n     as possible that includes those leaders, leaders of the \n     governments of each country bordering Iraq, representatives \n     of the Arab League, the Secretary General of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, representatives of the European \n     Union, and leaders of the governments of each permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council, for the \n     purpose of reaching a comprehensive political agreement for \n     Iraq that engenders the support of Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds \n     by ensuring the equitable distribution of oil revenues, \n     disbanding the militias, strengthening internal security, \n     reviving reconstruction efforts and fulfilling related \n     international economic aid commitments, securing Iraq's \n     borders, and providing for a sustainable federalist structure \n     in Iraq.\n       (c) Report on Redeployment.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of State, submit to \n     Congress a report that sets forth the strategy for the \n     redeployment of United States forces from Iraq by July 1, \n     2007.\n       (2) Strategy elements.--The strategy required in the report \n     under paragraph (1) shall include the following:\n       (A) The schedule for redeploying United States forces from \n     Iraq by July 1, 2007, developed pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(1).\n       (B) A schedule for returning the majority of such \n     redeployed forces home to the United States.\n       (C) The number, size, and character of United States \n     military units needed in Iraq after July 1, 2007, for \n     purposes of counterterrorism activities, training Iraqi \n     security forces, and protecting United States infrastructure \n     and personnel.\n       (D) A strategy for addressing the regional implications for \n     diplomacy, politics, and development of redeploying United \n     States forces from Iraq by July 1, 2007.\n       (E) A strategy for ensuring the safety and security of \n     United States forces in Iraq during and after the July 1, \n     2007, redeployment, and a contingency plan for addressing \n     dramatic changes in security conditions that may require a \n     limited number of United States forces to remain in Iraq \n     after that date.\n       (F) A strategy for redeploying United States forces to \n     effectively engage and defeat global terrorist networks that \n     threaten the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts. I am going to abbreviate my remarks so he and I can \nhopefully split this time and yield it back. It is regrettable that we \nare not able to present this amendment in the manner we normally would \nexpect, which is the two lead sponsors would each offer their thoughts \nwithout that type of limitation.\n  Nonetheless, this amendment is something that I think represents not \nonly the views of the Senator from Massachusetts and myself but the \nviews of the majority of the American people which they have come to in \na very painful way after this war has proceeded in the way it has.\n  In fact, I find it jarring that we spend so much time on the floor of \nthe Senate and throughout the Congress talking almost incessantly about \nthe situation in Iraq as if on 9/11 the situation involved Iraq, as if \nthe attack had come from Iraq. Of course, it didn't. We were attacked \nby al-Qaida operating out of Afghanistan on 9/11. And yet here we are \ndiscussing day after day, week after week every tiny aspect of the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  Of course, it is a terribly important situation, but I submit--and I \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts agrees with me--that the \noverriding issue is what is in the best interest of the national \nsecurity of the United States of America, what is in the best interest \nof protecting the American people when they are at home and when they \nare abroad.\n  All of us in this Chamber, every single one of us, supported the \nappropriate action to invade Afghanistan. It was a necessary war, a war \nthat had to be fought in order to go after the Taliban and al-Qaida. \nNone of us stood back and said, as the Senator from Texas wants to say, \nthat somehow some of us who don't believe in war will never support a \nwar and the rest support wars.\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\nThat is absurd. We understand when it is absolutely essential, and it \nwas essential in the case of Afghanistan.\n  I voted against the Iraq war because it appeared obvious to me that \nwas not the wise next strategic move in the fight against al-Qaida, \nthose who attacked us. It was pretty clear to me, but it was even clear \napparently to this administration when, on their own State Department \nWeb site, where President Bush had his name, they listed the 45 \ncountries where they believed al-Qaida was operating. This came out in \nNovember of 2001. It included, obviously, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, \nKyrgyzstan, Ireland, the United States. Guess what country wasn't even \non their list. Iraq. And this has been confirmed publicly by the \nrecognition now, despite the gross misrepresentations that al-Zarqawi \nwas not even in the part of Iraq controlled by Saddam Hussein when we \ninvaded Iraq.\n  It is pretty obvious on the face of this that this was not the place \nto go if we wanted to deal with al-Qaida. They were not there then, but \nbecause of the errors we have made, we created a beachhead for them to \ndo far more in Iraq than they ever could in the past.\n  I understand former Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of \nState under the first George Bush, said he used to go around the \ncountry and people would ask him every day: Why didn't you go on into \nIraq at the time of the first gulf war? He says with a smile: I don't \nget asked that question anymore because it didn't make sense. It didn't \nmake sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.\n\n  One of the theories we hear is that somehow staying in Iraq is \nnecessary because what we are going to do is have all the terrorists \ncome into Iraq, and we are going to get them all, and then they \nwouldn't be able to attack us anywhere else. Some call this the roach-\nmotel theory, the idea that all these terrorists all over the world are \nsimply focused on Iraq and by staying we are going to get them. This is \nwhat I would like to call an Iraq centrist policy, a policy that \nsomehow believes Iraq is the be all and end all of our foreign policy \nwhen, of course, it is nothing of the kind.\n  The fact is, those against al-Qaida is a much broader fight. I have \nseen estimates of somewhere between 60 to 80 countries where al-Qaida \nis operating. Yet our focus, our troops, and our resources are only \nheavily focused on this Iraq situation. This is just plain tragic 5 \nyears after 9/11.\n  One might say we are fighting the terrorists in other countries, too; \nwe are doing whatever we can. But we are not. We have taken our eye off \nthe ball. We are not dealing with the al-Qaida threat in other \ncountries because we are so focused on Iraq.\n  One good example is Somalia. Remember Somalia? This is a place where \nwe know there were al-Qaida operatives and affiliated groups. It is one \nof those failed states where it is almost an invitation to terrorist \norganizations to come in and organize and be away from any kind of \ncontrol. Because we haven't been paying attention to Somalia, because \nwe don't have a policy in Somalia, guess what just happened. A radical \nIslamist group has taken over Mogadishu and now threatens to take over \nthe rest of the country.\n  I can't say for sure what they will do, but there are indications \nthey may be very much like the type of Taliban government or \norganization that fostered al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\n  So we have taken our eye off the ball. In fact, I asked Ambassador \nCrumpton last week in a public hearing: How many people do we have in \nthe Government devoted to Somalia full time? Mr. President, do you know \nwhat his answer was? One person. One person in a country that is \nclearly a threat in terms of al-Qaida.\n  It is not just there. What about Indonesia? Indonesia is the largest \nIslamic country in the entire world. It is the fourth largest country \nin the world. I heard Senators debating who had been to Iraq the most. \nOne said he had been there 12 times. One said he had been there 11 \ntimes. Guess how many Senators have even been to Indonesia once in the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years. Just two of us, Senator Bond and myself, to a \ncountry that is being terrorized by a group called JI, Jemaah Islamiah, \nthat is clearly affiliated with al-Qaida.\n  We are not paying attention to Indonesia. We are not putting our \npolitical and other resources there. We are only focused on Iraq where \nal-Qaida wasn't even operating as of the time of the invasion.\n  If that isn't enough, what about Afghanistan? I think we can all \nagree that Afghanistan is a place where we ought to win, where we \nshouldn't deplete our resources--well, we shouldn't, in the words of my \ncolleagues on the other side, cut and run. But we are now feeling the \nconsequences of what some have called the Iraq tax in Afghanistan, and \nthat is the resurgence of Taliban fighters.\n  The recent death of more U.S. and Afghan soldiers there and the \ncontinued presence of terrorist networks in the region show how \nshortsighted this administration was by taking its eye off the ball.\n  We have not finished the job in Afghanistan, and we are now at risk \nof backsliding into instability. This is where the attack on the Twin \nTowers and the Pentagon was planned. This is where it was done. And \nbecause of this overemphasis and obsession with only staying in Iraq, \nwe are allowing the Taliban and perhaps al-Qaida to get back in.\n  Let me give an example of what some said about this. A recent expert \nindicated with regard to the Afghanistan situation:\n\n       It is now 5 years since George W. Bush declared victory in \n     Afghanistan and said that the terrorists were smashed.\n  Since the Bonn meeting in late 2001, a smorgasbord of international \nmilitary and development forces has been increasing in size. How is it \nthen that Afghanistan is near collapse once again? To put it briefly, \nwhat has gone wrong has been the invasion of Iraq. What has gone wrong \nis the invasion of Iraq, Washington's refusal to take State-building in \nAfghanistan seriously, and instead waging a fruitless war in Iraq. That \nview is shared by many others. I assure you I could give you many other \nexamples.\n  But the point is, despite the fact that we all know who attacked us \non 9/11, we are not focused on them. It is the most absurd situation I \nhave ever seen in my 25 years as a legislator. Everybody knows we went \ninto Iraq on a mistaken basis. Everybody knows that al-Qaida is the one \nwho attacked us. Yet somehow our colleagues on the other side are \ntrying to pretend they are one and the same thing, when everybody knows \nit is nothing of the kind.\n  So we have to change course. We have to refocus our energies on those \nwho attacked us. I have heard a number of statements on the floor \ntoday, and I have been out here on and off since noon listening to the \ndebate. I heard the Senator from Kentucky make the assertion that if we \ndon't, they will soon be back here--meaning in the United States--if we \ndon't stop them in Iraq. Well, the fact is, they are being effective in \nattacking us and our colleagues and our allies in many other places: In \nIndonesia, in London, in Madrid, in Turkey, in Morocco. It is not as if \nthere haven't been any attacks. It is not as if this al-Qaida \norganization isn't functioning. I mean, under their argument, \napparently we should invade all those other countries on false \npretenses as a way to somehow root out the terrorists. But we know that \napproach doesn't work.\n  If we continue to be stuck in Iraq, we are facilitating al-Qaida's \nfuture. We are facilitating their recruitment. We are facilitating the \ngrowth of their operations in places such as the Philippines, Malaysia, \nand Indonesia. We are facilitating al-Qaida if we continue to make this \nmistake in Iraq over and over again. That is what I care the most \nabout.\n  One of my colleagues, the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison said: \nIf we were to withdraw the troops or redeploy the troops in the coming \nyear, we would be giving the enemy the playbook. Well, my point is, we \nneed a new playbook. The playbook has nothing to do with 9/11. The \nplaybook has nothing to do with al-Qaida. We need a new playbook that \nhas something to do with what really threatens the American people. \nThat is what the Kerry-Feingold amendment is all about. It is not about \njust taking off. What it is about is refocusing.\n  Of course, we have been faced all day with all of the horrible things \nthat might happen if we bring the troops\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\nout of Iraq, and that is a fair debate. What happens if the other side \nis wrong? What happens if a reasonable redeployment over the next year \nwould work, and the Iraqi Government would be able to handle it? Think \nabout the ``what if'' there.\n  We had a moment of silence on the floor, I believe on October 31, for \nthe two thousandth American troop killed in the Iraq war. I believe \nlast week we had a moment of silence for No. 2,500. What if they are \nwrong? What if we can get out of there now in a reasonable way and \nrefocus on the fight against terrorism so we don't have to stand \nhere and have that moment for No. 3,000, for No. 3,500, for No. 10,000. \nThat is the direction we are heading, and the American people know it. \nDo we think it makes sense for our national security to have some \n135,000 American troops on the ground in harm's way without any clear \nidea of how that is going to change the situation in Iraq?\n\n  Mr. President, it was bad strategy to go into Iraq in the first \nplace, and it is a bad strategy to stay there because we are there and \nwe don't want to admit that it was a bad idea in the first place. Some \nwill say: Well, what you are saying then is those who have died have \ndied in vain in Iraq. I disagree. I think anytime an American gives his \nor her life pursuant to a decision of our democracy, it is impossible \nfor that person to die in vain. That is how our system works. I voted \nagainst this war. I didn't think it was a good idea. But we voted on \nit. That is how it works. As long as those troops fight in that spirit \nin support of a democratic decision, they do not die in vain, and we \nhonor them for their sacrifice.\n  If the policy is wrong, if we made a mistake, we owe it to their \nfamilies, we owe it to those who are injured, we owe it to those who \nare still there and who will still go and who will die in the future to \ncorrect that mistake, to change course. We owe it to them to do what \nmakes the most sense.\n  What makes the most sense? We have, in my view, two choices--not this \nabsurd notion that somebody wants all the troops to leave tomorrow. \nChoice No. 1 is a completely open-ended commitment, with no guarantee \nthat this will end anytime in the near future or a commitment to finish \nthe mission by a reasonable date and redeploy the troops where they can \nbe better used to help us in the fight against those who attacked us on \n9/11.\n  Mr. President, I heard the junior Senator from Virginia say: We don't \nneed to embolden our enemy. It is his view that the idea of having a \nreasonable timetable to bring the troops out emboldens the enemy. Well, \nI will tell you what emboldens the enemy: Thinking they have us in a \ntrap and we don't know how to get out. That emboldens and exhilarates \nthem. They wanted us in Iraq. They are glad we are in Iraq. And they \nare using it as a way to fuel the hatred that generated 9/11. That is \nthe bottom line.\n  To me, this is about national security. To me, this is about those \nwho attacked us on 9/11. This administration and this Congress made a \nmistake by thinking that Iraq was the logical next step in this fight. \nIt is time to reverse course. It is time to redeploy. It is time to \nfocus on the real security of the American people.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield back the time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am going to speak, obviously, a little \nbit in an abbreviated fashion at this point, and then I will reserve \ntime and speak again later because of the way things have worked out.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I want to thank him for \nhis foresight and his leadership with respect to this issue, and I also \nwant to thank him for his cooperation and efforts in the last days to \nput together what I think is a reasonable and sensible approach to how \nwe deal with an obviously complicated situation.\n  Let me say that I have heard this debate over the course of the last \ndays and I have listened carefully and I am saddened, in a sense--but I \nguess I have grown to expect it in the course of our politics--that \nthere is an awful lot of characterization going around, an awful lot of \nstereotype sloganeering which tries to characterize something as other \nthan what it is. It is what we have come to.\n  The fact is that this amendment is not what it is being characterized \nas. I have heard a number of people say it is a precipitous withdrawal. \nI have heard obviously the words ``cut and run'' and other words used \nmany times.\n  Let me first point out the differences between this and the other \namendment that has already been debated. First of all, this is binding. \nThe other amendment is a sense of the Senate, and our troops and our \ncountry deserve more than a sense of the Senate. They deserve a policy.\n  Secondly, we have a date; the other is open-ended. It is almost like \nwhat President Bush is doing. We are going to stay the course and be \nopen-ended.\n  Thirdly, this has an over-the-horizon force specifically to protect \nthe security interests of the United States of America in the region \nand with respect to Iraq. But in addition to that, this amendment \nspecifically strengthens the national security of the United States. It \nis not an abandonment of Iraq; it is, in fact, a way of empowering Iraq \nto stand up on its two feet and for the Iraqis to be able to do what \nthey have expressed their desire to do, which is have their \nsovereignty.\n  It is interesting. In the last day we had a huge debate about the \nsovereignty of Iraq, and colleague after colleague came down and said \nhow important it is to respect the sovereignty of Iraq. Well, this \namendment respects the sovereignty of Iraq. In fact, it increases the \nsovereignty of Iraq. It provides specifically for three provisos under \nwhich the President has the ability to be able to lead troops. There is \nno abandonment of Iraq. It sets a date by which, over the course of the \nnext year, the Iraqis themselves have said they have the ability to be \nable to take over their own security. Prime Minister Maliki said a few \ndays ago that by the end of this year--December--in 16 out of 18 \nprovinces, they will be able to take care of their own security. This \namendment holds them accountable.\n  In addition to that, it provides for the ability of the President to \nmaintain a minimal number of forces who are critical to the job of \nstanding up Iraqi security forces, of conducting targeted and \nspecialized counterterrorism operations like the kind that got Zarqawi \nand also protecting United States facilities and personnel.\n  So even when you reach the date of next year--ample enough time for \nthe Iraqis to complete the task of standing up--it will be 4 years, Mr. \nPresident, next year, and I think the American people have a right to \nexpect that after 4 years, soldiers who have been trained over the \ncourse of those years are prepared to stand up for their country. In \nthe United States of America, when we send a marine recruit to \nPendleton or to Quantico, we can tell you in a matter of months when \nthat recruit is ready for deployment. When we send a pilot to Corpus \nChristi or Pensacola, we can tell you exactly when they are ready to \ndeploy. Is this administration telling us that after 4 years, we don't \nhave Iraqis who are trained enough to drive trucks and perhaps be blown \nup by an IED, rather than an American soldier? Are they telling us they \nare not going to be prepared enough to be able to stand up for the \nsecurity of Iraq?\n  This amendment demands the same kind of accountability that the \nPresident was prepared to demand each step of the way of the Iraqis up \nuntil this point. We set a date for the transfer of the provisional \nGovernment. They said: Oh, we can't do it that fast. We said: You have \nto do it that fast, and we did it. We then set a date for the \nConstitution and the referendum. Some Senators, some of whom have \nspoken against this amendment, came out and said: Oh, I think it is too \nearly. I don't think we ought to have that date. Many of us stood up \nand said: No, we have to hold the date and hold them to the date. Guess \nwhat. We did it. We held them to the date and we got the Constitution.\n  The same thing happened for both elections. A lot of people came up \nand said: Oh, we can't get this all together on time; we have to delay \nthe election. We said: No, we are going to stick with the election \ndate, and we did. General Casey himself has said that the large \npresence of American troops is lending to the occupation, the sense of \noccupation, and it is delaying the willingness\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nof Iraqis to stand up. It is human nature. Anybody who has to go out \nand take the risk of loss of life, if somebody else is there to do it \nfor you, you stand back. The fact is, countless numbers of conservative \nvoices, including people like Bill Buckley, have suggested that the \ntime has come for American forces to leave. He happens to believe, as \nothers do, that it is lost. I think there is nothing in this amendment \nat all that, as some colleagues have said, that some people have \ndecided it is all lost. I do not believe that.\n\n  I believe this is the way you empower the Iraqi Government, with its \nown people. This is the way you have accountability for what they need \nto achieve in the next year. This is the way you require their forces \nto take on responsibilities they may be reluctant to do today. And it \nallows for the President to make a determination that the job is not \nquite done and we can address the troops that may be necessary to \ncomplete that task.\n  That is anything but abandonment. I have heard some people say there \nis no plan. There is more plan here than there is in any other approach \nto what is happening in Iraq. Why do I say that?\n  Again, listen to our own generals. General Casey and others have all \nsaid that the reality is that this war cannot be won militarily. Our \nown commanding general is saying to us: You can't win it militarily. \nSecretary Condoleezza Rice has said it can't be won militarily, it must \nbe won politically.\n  Our soldiers have done their job. Our soldiers have won the part of \nthe war they need to win. They have given the Iraqi people a \ngovernment. They have given the Iraqi people several elections. They \nhave given them a constitution. Now it is time for Iraqis to stand up \nand want democracy for themselves as much as we want it for them. The \nbest way to guarantee that is going to happen is to set a date with a \nproviso that the three things that we still need to do can still be \ndone: make sure they are trained, continue to fight al-Qaida, and \nprotect American forces and American facilities. All of that is \nprovided for in this amendment.\n  This has been quoted a couple of times out here today, but let me \nremind my colleagues what the National Security Adviser to the Prime \nMinister has said, himself, in ``The Way Out of Iraq, A Roadmap.''\n\n       The eventual removal of coalition troops from Iraqi streets \n     will help the Iraqis who now see foreign troops as occupiers \n     rather than the liberators they were meant to be. It will \n     remove psychological barriers and the reason that many Iraqis \n     joined the so-called resistance in the first place. The \n     removal of troops will also allow the Iraqi government to \n     engage with some of our neighbors who have, to date, been at \n     the very least sympathetic to the resistance to what they \n     call the coalition occupation.\n\n  That is the National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister of Iraq, \ntelling us that withdrawing American troops will, in fact, help them \nprovide order in the streets of Iraq.\n  The Senator from Virginia and I were in Iraq together. Nobody works \nharder in the Senate at protecting our security than he does. I respect \nhim, and he knows he is my friend. He knows as well as others know here \nthat what General Casey said is true. There is no military solution to \nwhat is happening in Iraq. You either resolve the differences between \nShia and Sunni and provide for an adequacy of the differences that are \nfueling the insurgency or the insurgency will continue.\n  There are five different components of that insurgency. There are \noutright criminals, and there is organized crime. There is al-Qaida. \nYou have the Baathists, who have one attitude about regaining power. \nAnd, of course, you have the insurgents who are different from the \nBaathists, who are hardcore.\n  Those are different elements that are going to have to be resolved in \ndifferent ways. I ask any of my colleagues, where is the diplomacy \nnecessary to deal with this? What we do in this is require the kind of \ndiplomatic effort that, in fact, is a plan to resolve all of the \nproblems that are outstanding in Iraq: the problems with respect to \ngovernments bordering the country, the problems with respect to Shia \nand Sunni, the problems with the divisions of royalties of oil, how do \nyou protect the rights of Sunnis in the minority, what is the degree of \nfederalism that will exist in the government. These are the reasons for \nthe insurgency.\n  At this moment, I don't see the kind of effort I have seen \nhistorically, whether it was from Henry Kissinger in the Middle East \nwith shuttle diplomacy, in Vietnam, or Jim Baker in his efforts to put \ntogether a major coalition with respect to Desert Storm--that doesn't \nexist today. So a policy to say ``stay the course'' is a policy to say \nyou are not going to resolve those issues. It is a policy to hope that \nsomehow the Iraqis will pull their act together. It is a policy that is \nbased on more wishful thinking than on real policy changes that address \nthe question of shifting responsibility.\n  When the Prime Minister of Iraq can tell us that they can manage 16 \nout of 18 provinces within a year, when 87 percent of the Iraqis are \npolled and say they think we ought to set a date for withdrawal of \nAmerican troops, when 94 percent of the Sunnis say we ought to \nwithdraw, when 90 percent of the Shias say we ought to withdraw, we \nought to listen to the Iraqis. After all the talk in the last days \nabout sovereignty, where is that respect for sovereignty?\n  I have more to say about why it is important for us to take this \neffort here. The long list of mistakes that have been made do not \ninspire confidence in the judgments made by this administration. \nCongress helped to get us into this war. Congress needs to take on \nresponsibility for helping to get us out of it.\n  I had a lot more to say, and I have a lot more to say, but because of \nthe way this is working, this will be truncated. I know I only have \nabout a minute left so I reserve the remainder of the time, and we will \ngo through the process and come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. We all try to \nwork within the framework of the unanimous consent.\n  At this point in time, the Senator from Virginia, myself, has the \ntime between 6:35 and 7:05, a period of 30 minutes. I would like to now \noffer the first 15 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut and retrieve \na period of time he had from 7:55 to 8:05 to be added to my time which \ncommences at 8:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then, following the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania would be recognized for the remainder of my time in \nthis time slot, Mr. Santorum.\n  That would be followed, I inform other Senators, by Senator Boxer, \nfrom roughly 7:05 to 7:35, and then the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, 7:35 to 7:55.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nVirginia for previously responding graciously to the request from the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, that I be granted time to speak on \nboth of these amendments, and an extra thank-you for his allowing me to \ndo so a bit earlier than the initial order.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendments introduced by the \nSenator from Michigan and others, and the other amendment introduced by \nthe Senators from Massachusetts and Wisconsin and others because they \nboth would direct, in different ways, the withdrawal of American forces \nfrom Iraq without regard to the real conditions on the ground.\n  Let me begin with a harsh and familiar lesson history has taught us \nand that we are experiencing again in Iraq: War is hell. Precious lives \nare lost, blood is spilled, treasure is spent. Countries, communities, \nand families are deeply pained and disrupted. But history also teaches \nus that there are times when wars must be waged and won to prevent even \nmore awful hell: to overthrow an evil leader or protect the noble \ncauses of human freedom, opportunity, and peace.\n  At the outset of the war in Iraq, coalition forces, led by our own \nAmerican men and women in uniform, brave and brilliant, succeeded with \nremarkable speed to achieve a most worthy goal, the overthrow of an \nevil leader, Saddam Hussein, and the opening of the opportunity for \nfreedom, the opportunity for the people of Iraq and broader peace in \nthe region.\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\n  After that, I would say, and I think all who support that war must \nadmit, that mistakes were made on our side--some of them big--and the \ndifficulties in Iraq increased. As others have said before me, the war \nin Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein may have been a war of choice. It \nis now a war of necessity. We must win it.\n  Why? Because the consequences of an American retreat and defeat there \nwould be terrible for the safety and security of the American people at \nhome whom we have a constitutional responsibility to protect.\n  I must say I also approach these two amendments with a sense of \nlegislative history. They evoke debates that have occurred many times \nin the Senate. We had one just a decade ago on this floor, about how \nlong our Armed Forces should stay in Bosnia. Some wanted to set a \ndeadline for withdrawal, a date. Others, including myself, argued \nsuccessfully that setting a day for automatic withdrawal was dangerous \nand wrong because it would discourage our allies and encourage our \nenemies. Our withdrawal should be consistent with the achievement of \nthe goals we have set for the mission.\n  I remember in that debate quoting Biblical wisdom and warning, ``If \nthe sound of the trumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?''\n  I suppose in our time we might amend that to say, ``If the sound of \nthe trumpet is uncertain, who will stay in battle?''\n  I also remember arguing in that debate that a nation, I thought, \nshould only set an unconditional date, a deadline for withdrawing \ntroops from battle, if all hope of victory was lost, which it was not \nthen in Bosnia and is not now in Iraq, unless the consequences of a too \nearly American withdrawal by calendar instead of condition were \nacceptable to our country, which it was not. They were not then in \nBosnia and are not now in Iraq.\n  The Kerry-Feingold amendment directs that all American troops be \nwithdrawn from Iraq by the middle of next year, regardless of the \nintervening events. The Levin amendment is more complicated. I have \nspent some time studying it since it was made public on Monday. The \nLevin amendment directs that a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq \nbegin by the end of this year, 2006, without regard to the conditions \non the ground.\n  So, for that reason, consistent with what I have just said about \nlegislative history and my own previously stated strong position, I \ncannot support either of these amendments.\n  I personally hope, as I am sure all Members of the Senate do, and I \nbelieve, that we will be able to withdraw a significant number of \nAmericans in uniform from Iraq by the end of this year and even more by \nnext year. I express that optimism based on the election and \nformulation of the new Iraqi unity Government, the increasing capacity \nof the Iraqi security forces to protect their own people, and the \ncommitment of the new Government to disarm the sectarian militias.\n  General Abizaid and General Casey have said that it is their hope to \nbegin withdrawing more troops by the end of 2006 and even more next \nyear. But I want them to decide based on the realities on the ground in \nIraq, not on their hopes or my hopes or the shared hopes of the \nAmerican people that we will soon be able to bring our Armed Forces \nhome from Iraq. I do not want those distinguished American generals and \nthe brave and steadfast American men and women serving under them to be \ndirected by this Congress to exit before they conclude and recommend to \nus and the President that withdrawal is justified.\n  My own opinion is that the sooner the Iraqis take control of their \nown defense and destiny, the better it will be for them and for us. But \nif we leave too soon, it will be disastrous for them and for us.\n  Sponsors of the Kerry-Feingold amendment have stated a very clear and \ndirect purpose. I disagree with it. The sponsors of the Levin amendment \nhave argued on behalf of their amendment that they believe we must \ndirect the beginning of a withdrawal of American troops without \ncondition by December 31 of this year to make clear to the Iraqis that \nour commitment to them is not open-ended. I believe the Iraqis know \nvery well that our commitment is not open-ended and is not a blank \ncheck. I will tell you that I personally have said that to their \nleaders directly, every time I have met them here or there. I know many \nof my Senate colleagues of both parties and leaders of the \nadministration have said the same, openly and directly to the Iraqi \nleaders and the Iraqi people. And the Iraqis themselves have said over \nand over again that they know our commitment is not unconditional.\n  Just yesterday, in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post by the \nNational Security Adviser of Iraq, he made clear that his Government \nwants the American military out of Iraq as much as we want our men and \nwomen to come home to America.\n  He and the rest of the Iraqi leadership doesn't need a congressional \ndirective to convince them of the desirability of American forces \nleaving Iraq.\n  What will be lost by it? I will answer that in a moment.\n  I will say that in the interest of Iraq's security and ours, it \nshould only happen--that is, our withdrawal--as the Iraqis step by step \nare more and more ready to stand on their own.\n  The amendment introduced by Senator Levin itself states that the \nIraqis are making good progress in exactly that direction. The \namendment itself reports more than two-thirds of the operational Iraqi \nArmy combat battalions ``are now either in the lead or operating \nindependently.''\n  That is significant progress.\n  A national unity government has been formed. It took too long, but \nthat also is an enormous achievement. But, of course, there is much \nmore work yet to be done--as the Levin amendment itself states, to \namend the Iraqi constitution to get more help from international donors \nand to ``promptly and decisively disarm the militias and remove those \nmembers of the Iraqi security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq \ngovernment is in doubt.''\n  But then the amendment goes on to direct the beginning of withdrawal \nof American forces by the end of this year regardless of whether that \nwork is done or those militias are disarmed.\n  That is where I respectfully believe it errs.\n  In doing so, I feel that this amendment would just underline the \nmessage the Iraqi leadership has clearly already received, accepted, \nand shares; that America's military commitment to Iraq is not open-\nended and unconditional. I fear that it would also send another message \nto our terrorist enemies and to the sectarian militias in Iraq that \nAmerica is not prepared to see this fight through until the Iraqis \nthemselves can take over. That will actually encourage the terrorists \nto accelerate their cruel and inhumane attacks, and it will unsettle \nthe sectarian groups to hunker down and rearm their militias to \nstrengthen themselves for the civil war that they feel will follow a \npremature American retreat. And that might well create conditions that \nnone of us want, which is to say chaos and civil war in Iraq, regional \nwar in the Middle East, and the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 \nbeing able to claim victory in Iraq and going on, emboldened, to attack \nus again here at home and to bring their terrorism to more Arab \ncountries in the Middle East.\n  That is why I said the war in Iraq, however one thinks we got there, \nis now a war of necessity, a war we must help the people of Iraq to win \nor the security of we, the people of America, our children and \ngrandchildren will be gravely endangered.\n  Section 2 on page 4 of the amendment which the Senator from Michigan \nintroduced says:\n\n       The current open-ended commitment of United States forces \n     in Iraq is unsustainable.\n\n  As I have said, our commitment is not and should not be open-ended. \nIt is conditional on the Iraqis working hard to move themselves forward \ntogether on the path to self-government and self-defense and, in fact, \nas the amendment states, they are doing. And this conditional \ncommitment of ours to them is surely militarily sustainable and must be \nhonored.\n  The failure to do so I believe would have terrible consequences for \nour credibility in the world and our success in the long conflict ahead \nagainst the radical Islamist terrorists who declared war against us and \nmuch of the rest of the world during the 1990s and carried out a brutal \nact of war against our people on September 11, 2001.\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\n  We cannot and must not concede any battlefield to our enemies in this \nmost unconventional but deadly serious war.\n  I do not think it is an overstatement to say that our freedom and \nsecurity and that of most of the rest of the world, Muslim and non-\nMuslim, depends now, as it has at critical moments in the past, on \nAmerican persistence and fortitude in this painful, awful, essential \nworldwide war.\n  For these reasons, I will respectfully oppose the Levin amendment and \nthe amendment introduced by Senators Kerry and Feingold.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will say to my good friend and \ncolleague--and my remarks are not predicated on the fact in all \nlikelihood that he will cast a vote which will be supportive of the \nviews that this Senator and others on this side of the aisle have \nstated, but I say out of the long time that we have worked together to \nthose Senators who may not remember it that I was tasked to draw up the \nfirst resolution in the Gulf War when George Bush, Sr., was President. \nThe Senator from Connecticut stepped up and joined me. It was known as \nthe Warner-Lieberman amendment at that time.\n  Subsequently, when the second resolution was to be drawn up, I again \nwas joined by Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and Senator Bayh. The \nfour of us drew that one up.\n  He has been on the Senate Armed Services Committee these many years \nthat he has served in the Senate, and he has shown tremendous \nleadership. And each day he grows in stature as a statesman and his \nstature as a knowledgeable person regarding the security interests of \nthis country.\n  As they exist today and in the future--when I say ``in the future,'' \nfor our children and grandchildren--they acknowledge their appreciation \nto the Senator from Connecticut for his wisdom.\n  The remainder of time under my control I yield to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, first, I would like to associate myself \nwith the remarks made by the Senator from Virginia. If I could, I would \nlike to also associate myself with the remarks made by the Senator from \nConnecticut. I agree with him wholeheartedly. They were incredibly \narticulately made and hits on all of the relevant points as to why \nthese two amendments should be defeated.\n  I actually want to talk about a different debate which has been \nbrewing on the floor of the Senate for over 3 years. That is the debate \nas to the reasons why we entered into a war in Iraq in the first place. \nThere was some information released today that I think sheds some light \nas to the facts relating to what the conditions were in Iraq prior to \nour commencing the Iraq war.\n  The essential nature of the decision that we made at the time when we \nhad to decide whether to go to war with Iraq was based on many factors. \nColin Powell laid them out at the United Nations. One was that Saddam \nhad possessed and had used biological and chemical weapons on his \npeople and that he had biological. That is indisputable.\n  The second was that he had an active WMD program. And we have the \nIraqi Survey Group which published the Delta Report. It was very clear \nin the Delta Report that, in fact, there was ongoing research at the \ntime of the Iraq war, and if that research of those sanctions were \nlifted it could have quickly turned into a full-fledged biological and \nchemical warfare capability.\n  In fact, the Delta Report mentioned that they could, postsanctions, \nreconstitute anthrax and an anthrax program in 4 weeks.\n  So he already used chemical weapons and had chemical weapons research \nthat could quickly be transitioned into programs.\n  The one aspect that has been in question or which most Americans \nfind--and certainly many have spoken on the floor of the Senate--was \nwhether at the time of the Iraq war back in 2003 Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. That was always the claim--that he had not \ngotten rid of his weapons of mass destruction and potentially produced \nadditional weapons of mass destruction.\n  Up until today, the general perception of the American public--and \ncertainly Members in this Chamber--was that there were no such weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  In fact, today on the floor of the Senate, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland said, ``We have heard the initial defense of the approach to \nIraq as we are going after weapons of mass destruction. They were not \nthere.''\n  The senior Senator from Connecticut said, ``If I had known then what \nI now know, namely that Saddam Hussein possessed no weapons of mass \ndestruction, I would not have given the President my vote.''\n  The senior Senator from Washington said, ``We have looked for weapons \nof mass destruction and found none.''\n  Let me follow up these quotes with quotes from an unclassified \nversion of a document released 3 hours ago coming from the National \nGround Intelligence Center, a part of the Department of Defense. It is \na summary of a classified document which I have had the opportunity to \ntake a look at.\n  The document's key points in the unclassified version are as follows:\n\n       Since 2003, coalition forces have recovered approximately \n     500 weapons, munitions which contain degraded mustard or \n     sarin nerve agents. Despite many efforts to locate and \n     destroy Iraq's pregulf war chemical munitions, filled and \n     unfilled pregulf war chemical munitions are assessed and \n     still exist.\n\n  That means that in addition to the 500 that we have recovered, there \nare additional munitions.\n  The report goes into great detail as to what those munitions are. \nThere are additional munitions that we have not categorized and \nidentified specifically in number or in character.\n  Back to the document:\n\n       Pre-gulf war Iraq chemical weapons could be sold on the \n     black market. Use of these weapons by terrorists or insurgent \n     groups would have implications for coalition forces in Iraq. \n     The possibility of use outside of Iraq cannot be ruled out. \n     The most likely munitions remaining are sarin- and mustard-\n     filled projectiles. The purity of the agents inside the \n     munitions depend on many factors, including the manufacturing \n     process, potential additives, and environmental storage \n     conditions. While agents degrade over time, chemical warfare \n     agents remain hazardous and potentially lethal. It has been \n     reported in the open press that insurgents in Iraqi groups \n     desire to acquire and use chemical weapons.\n\n  This is an incredibly significant document.\n  We now have a lot from our intelligence agencies that said we have \nrecovered 500 chemical weapons and that there are a number of others.\n  It is hopeful that we can, in fact, get that number and that \ninformation out.\n  But the bottom line is, irrespective of whether there were any \nothers, the fact that we recovered 500 and the fact that there are a \nlikelihood of others to recover, maybe from Iraq, maybe from other \nplaces around the Middle East, suggests that Saddam Hussein did have \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  One of the principal concerns that we had in going into this war \nagainst terror, or terrorists as it has been defined, was that Saddam \nwould not necessarily use chemical weapons or biological weapons \nagainst his neighbors again or against us, but, more importantly, that \nhe would have these stockpiles of weapons to give to terrorists to use \nagainst us or to use against others. Now we have information that \nconfirms that some 500, and likely more, weapons were, in fact, in Iraq \nat the time of the Iraq war.\n\n  The quotes that there were no chemical weapons, that the President \nlied, that all of this was a fabrication of neocons who wanted to go to \nwar, is now--if it was not, in my mind, discredited from the other \ninformation we have gotten--is now, in my mind, completely discredited. \nHe had chemical weapons before the gulf war. He used them after the \ngulf war. He used them during the Iran-Iraq war. They had weapons \nprogrammed in place at the time of the second gulf war, the Iraq \nconflict. And we now have found stockpiles.\n  The Duelfer report said there were no stockpiles. We have now found \n500. You want to call that a stockpile? Five hundred is a lot of \nchemical weapons. We handed out a video upstairs, Congressman Hoekstra \nand I--who has been tremendously helpful in gathering this information \nand having this report, first finding the report and declassifying \nportions of it--he handed out information that showed an attack of the \nIraqis using 15 sarin chemical\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nweapon shells like the ones recovered here that killed 5,000 people.\n  This is a serious and important document. This is a serious and \nimportant step in understanding what Iraq was all about when we, in \nfact, commenced military activities against them. It is an important \nfinding to determine what our actions need to be going forward in \nmaking sure we rid this country of the chemical weapons that still may \nbe available, as was mentioned, potentially on the black market.\n  I thank Congressman Hoekstra. I asked for this document from the \nNational Ground Intelligence Center 2\\1/2\\ months ago. It took 2 months \nof going nowhere before I contacted Congressman Hoekstra. He, by the \nway, was not aware of this document, either. He was able to get this \ndocument and we were able to look at it. Several Members in the Senate \nand the House have reviewed the document. It is up in the Intelligence \nrooms. I encourage Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle to \ngo up and view the document. It is a classification that all Members \ncan review the entire document. Please go up, take a look at it. If you \ndo not believe the statements or you do not think the statements are \ncompelling enough, I encourage you to go up and read the entire \nclassified report. It is very compelling. It is a very serious \nsituation.\n  The bottom line is, the statements that Saddam Hussein at the time of \nthe second gulf war, the Iraq war, had no weapons of mass destruction \nis now categorically untrue. This report puts that to rest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from California.\n  The Senator from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield back the remaining 2 minutes I have under my \ncontrol. The order provides for 30 minutes for the distinguished \nSenator from California, to be followed by 20 minutes from the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I come to the Senate tonight with a tremendous sense of loss for the \nvictims of the tragic war in Iraq. Yesterday, the military informed two \nCalifornia families that their sons were murdered in cold blood by the \nvery same Iraqi troops they had been training.\n  Let me repeat that: The military informed two California families \nwhose sons were in the National Guard that their sons were murdered in \ncold blood by the very same Iraqi troops they were training.\n  Sgt. Patrick McCaffrey and 1LT Andre Tyson were killed near Balad 2 \nyears ago. After 2 long years, the Army is now telling the families \nthat Iraqi troops who their sons had been training turned on them and \nintentionally killed them.\n  This morning, the mother of Sergeant McCaffrey appeared on CNN and \nsaid:\n\n       Patrick was never at ease and he constantly said, ``Mom, \n     we're risking our life every day, all the time, \n     permanently.''\n\n  She told the press that Patrick told his commanding officer twice \nthat he was fired upon by Iraqi troops. He told his dad the same thing \nand his dad told the press that his commanding officer said, and I \nquote his dad: ``That he should keep his mouth shut.''\n  Mrs. McCaffrey said she wants the story to come out because she \nbelieves there are other instances of Iraqi troops turning on our \nsoldiers. This is a story that is all over the news. It is emblematic \nof what this war is turning into.\n\n  This week, we all were devastated to hear of the cruel and savage \nkilling of two United States soldiers who were reportedly tortured in a \nbarbaric fashion. These soldiers were manning a traffic check point \nwhen they were captured by insurgents. A third soldier also died in the \nattack.\n  Every day we hear of a new tragedy from Iraq. Why? Because more than \n3 years ago, our President launched a war that was based on false \npremises. The administration told the American people that Saddam posed \nan imminent threat to the United States because of his close ties to \nal-Qaida and because he had an active nuclear weapons program. The \nadministration's case has unraveled in light of the facts. We have a \nchance tomorrow to stand up and say no to the status quo. We can do it \nwith two Democratic amendments. We know there was no working \nrelationship between al-Qaida and Saddam, and Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction program was dormant.\n  Just look at the State Department's own document which Senator \nFeingold talked about. It says clearly when we were attacked by al-\nQaida on that fateful day of September 11, there was not one al-Qaida \ncell in Iraq. Yet those who asked questions about these false premises \nwere dismissed, ridiculed, called unpatriotic, and, in one case, the \ncase of Ambassador Joe Wilson, he actually faced retaliation. The wife \nof Ambassador Wilson had her identity as a CIA agent exposed. Why? \nBecause Joe Wilson blew the whistle on President Bush's claim that Iraq \nhad sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\n  Why do I recount Valerie Plame's story? Because it shows just how far \nthe Bush administration and their Republican friends in Congress will \ngo to tarnish and hurt those who see the war differently from them. \nThat is frightening no matter what side of the fence you are on. \nImagine going after someone's family because you felt you did not like \nwhat the man said. In fact, he told the truth, that there was no truth \nto the claim that Saddam was seeking yellow cake uranium.\n  In this debate right now, those same voices are saying that anyone \nwho disagrees with the status quo in Iraq and speaks about an exit \nstrategy for the war is advocating a policy of cut-and-run. Let me be \nclear, calling for redeployment of our troops out of Iraq is not cut-\nand-run. It is smart and strategic.\n  Why is it smart? Because it will give the signal to the Iraqis that \nthey have to stand up and protect their own country.\n  Why is it strategic? Because it will allow us to use our resources to \ngo after al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.\n  Let's take a look at the status quo. The status quo in Iraq is an \nendless venture with ever-changing missions that has resulted in more \nthan 2,500 United States deaths and 18,000 wounded. It is a blank check \nand a blind eye.\n  I have a chart that shows the costs. This is showing what this \nPresident calls ``progress'' and his Republican friends in Congress \ncall progress. Let's look at the facts. The monthly cost of the Iraq \nwar in 2003 was $4.4 billion a month. It is now $8 billion a month. It \nis causing our debt to soar. It is not being paid for in the usual way: \nIt is put right on Uncle Sam's credit card and our grandchildren will \npay the bill, maybe even their children.\n  The estimated number of insurgents in 2003, 3,000; estimated in 2006, \n20,000. Is that progress in Iraq? I don't think so.\n  Insurgent attacks in 2003, 5 a day; now, 90 a day. Is that progress? \nI don't think so.\n  Incidents of sectarian violence, 5 per month; now it is 250 per \nmonth.\n  If that is progress, then we are in serious, serious trouble--more \ntrouble than I think we are in.\n  How about Iraqis. Are they optimistic about the future? In 2003, 75 \npercent were optimistic. Do you know what the number is today? Thirty \npercent. These figures come from the Brookings Institution.\n  There are claims that the status quo is ``progress,'' when actually \nthe status quo is a disaster. The war is taking a heavy toll on our \nfighting men and women, many of whom are serving their third tour of \nduty. Suicides are up.\n  In 2005, 83 United States Army soldiers committed suicide, an \nincrease of 16 suicides over the 67 reported the year before, and the \nhighest number since 90 were recorded in 1993. Of those 83 soldiers, 25 \nhad been deployed to either Afghanistan or Iraq.\n  Divorces are up. Where are the family values around this place? \nBetween 2001 and 2004, divorces among Active-Duty Army personnel have \ndoubled. Divorces have doubled. That is the weight of this war. And \npost-traumatic stress disorder is rampant. A study published in the \nJuly 2004 New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 15 percent of \nmarines and 17 percent of soldiers surveyed after deployment in Iraq \n``met the screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, \nor post traumatic stress disorder.''\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\n  Our military men and women have done every single thing we have asked \nof them--even without a plan to anticipate the insurgency. Even without \nadequate body armor, even without enough up-armored humvees, here is \nwhat this administration has asked our fighting men and women to do: \nfind the weapons of mass destruction, find Saddam Hussein and bring him \nto justice, find Saddam's family and bring them to justice, secure Iraq \nfor elections--there have been three elections, successful, there--\ntrain Iraqi troops--there are now 260,000 of those Iraqi troops \ntrained.\n  In light of all that our military has done--and they have paid the \nprice in blood, in lost limbs, in pain and suffering and death--what \nare the Iraqi leaders saying? They have proposed amnesty for those who \nhave killed American soldiers. The amnesty plan would include \ninsurgents who have staged attacks against Americans--even as those \nattacks continue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na front-page story from the L.A. Times that ran this past weekend.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, June 18, 2006]\n\n                   Amnesty for Iraq Rebels Is Planned\n\n                          (By Borzou Daragahi)\n\n       The Iraqi government has crafted a far-reaching amnesty \n     plan for insurgents, officials close to Prime Minister Nouri \n     Maliki said Saturday, even as guerrillas killed at least 34 \n     Iraqis in a barrage of bombs and rockets in the capital and \n     the U.S. military hunted for two missing soldiers.\n       The Americans may have been captured after an attack Friday \n     evening on a checkpoint south of Baghdad that left at least \n     one soldier dead, the military said.\n       U.S. forces dispatched helicopters and surveillance planes \n     over the area as well as teams of divers to scour the river \n     and nearby canals for the missing soldiers.\n       The amnesty plan, which apparently would include insurgents \n     alleged to have staged attacks against Americans and Iraqis, \n     calls for the creation of a national committee and local \n     subcommittees to woo rebels and begin a ``truthful national \n     dialogue in dealing with contradicting visions and stances,'' \n     according to a version of the plan published Saturday in an \n     Iraqi newspaper.\n       The reconciliation plan, which is expected to be formally \n     announced soon, would be among the Iraqi government's most \n     comprehensive attempts to engage with insurgent groups.\n       ``The main thing,'' said Haidar Abadi, a leader of Maliki's \n     Islamic Dawa Party, is that the plan doesn't rule out \n     participation of ``the bloody-handed people in the political \n     process.''\n       The plan, mysteriously released and rescinded by the prime \n     minister's office last week, calls for the pardon and release \n     of prisoners ``not proven guilty in crimes and clear \n     terrorist activities'' and a review of the process by which \n     former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party are excluded \n     from public life.\n       U.S. and some Iraqi officials have long urged Sunni \n     insurgent groups that don't have strong ties to the former \n     regime's security apparatus or to foreign militants--and \n     without the blood of innocent Iraqis on their hands--to lay \n     down their weapons and join the political process.\n       The new proposal, said an official close to Maliki, merely \n     recognizes the difficulty of verifying insurgents' past \n     actions.\n       ``Theoretically, we can say we cannot give any amnesty to \n     those in the [former] security agencies and those in Saddam's \n     regime and those who have killed and bombed Iraqis after the \n     invasion,'' said Salah Abdul Razzaq, a spokesman for several \n     prominent Shiite religious organizations.\n       ``In practice, anyone who comes to negotiations and says, \n     `I have no problem with Iraqis or Iraqi government, just with \n     U.S. forces,' how can we check that?''\n       Some Kurdish and Shiite members of parliament, which is \n     scheduled to convene today, voiced doubts about Maliki's \n     reconciliation proposal.\n       ``We think that any reconciliation talks should take place \n     within parliament,'' said Baha Araji, a Shiite lawmaker close \n     to radical cleric Muqtada Sadr's movement. ``We don't need \n     groups from outside--I mean the Saddamists, Baathists and \n     killers.''\n       But officials close to Maliki said the plan was days away \n     from being formally announced.\n       A version of the amnesty plan--titled the ``Reconciliation \n     and National Dialogue Project''--was published in Saturday's \n     edition of Al Mada newspaper. Copies were distributed to \n     journalists and then quickly taken back at an abruptly \n     canceled news conference Thursday at Maliki's office.\n       Abadi said the incident was a minor mix-up caused by \n     inexperienced members of the prime minister's media office.\n       ``It doesn't mean that the project of reconciliation was \n     withdrawn, but that it was given more time for a consensus to \n     be reached,'' said Abbas Bayati, a leading Shiite lawmaker. \n     ``We are ready to sit around a table with all the Iraqis, \n     even those who participated in the resistance and now repent \n     that.''\n       It was unclear whether any amnesty plan would require \n     legislative approval or be adopted by executive decision.\n       Sunni Arabs lead the Iraqi insurgency, which is fueled by \n     the minority sect's perception that it was unjustly robbed of \n     political power and prestige by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion \n     and the Shiite-dominated governments that followed. Incessant \n     insurgent attacks have sparked reprisals by Shiites and \n     brought the country to the precipice of civil war.\n       Sunni Arabs said they were far more encouraged by the \n     Maliki government's olive branches than those of his \n     predecessor, fellow Islamic Dawa Party member Ibrahim Jafari, \n     viewed by many as too sectarian in his outlook.\n       The death this month of terrorist leader Abu Musab Zarqawi \n     opened a new opportunity to draw in Iraqi insurgent groups, \n     Sunni officials said.\n       ``The general direction and general understanding among \n     politicians is that now is the time to differentiate between \n     the extremists and foreign fighters on one side and the \n     native Iraqi people in the resistance,'' said Alaa Makki, a \n     leading member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, the main Sunni \n     Arab political group.\n       ``We think now there might be a reevaluation from A to Z \n     among the Iraqi population,'' he said. ``I think Maliki is \n     going along with these ideas.''\n       But the violence showed no signs of abating Saturday. \n     Dozens of Iraqis were killed in a series of insurgent attacks \n     targeting Iraqi security forces in Baghdad despite a highly \n     publicized crackdown meant to bolster public confidence in \n     the government.\n       At least seven large explosions rocked the capital. In the \n     day's most deadly incident, a car bomb explosion at 8 p.m. in \n     a busy market in southwest Baghdad killed 12 people and \n     injured 381 police said.\n       An earlier car bomb targeting a police patrol killed seven \n     people and injured 11, hospital officials said.\n       A roadside bombing in downtown Baghdad killed six people \n     and wounded 15.\n       In central Baghdad a car bomb targeting an Iraqi army \n     patrol killed three civilians and a soldier and injured eight \n     soldiers and four police officers.\n       A bomb placed inside a passenger bus killed at least two \n     civilians and injured 151 police said.\n       In the northern suburb of Kadhimiya mortar rounds landed on \n     a busy market, killing at least two people and injuring 14.\n       An explosion killed a man in west Baghdad hospital \n     officials said.\n       The search for the missing U.S. soldiers was underway near \n     the Euphrates River town of Yousifiya south of Baghdad. U.S. \n     forces launched raids on four sites, questioned local leaders \n     and set up roadblocks around the area, presumably to prevent \n     assailants from taking the soldiers elsewhere.\n       ``We are using all available assets, coalition and Iraqi, \n     ground, air and water, to locate and determine the duty \n     status of our soldiers, Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV said \n     in a news release.\n       The attack Friday evening took place in a religiously mixed \n     area south of the capital known as a stronghold of militants \n     loyal to extremist religious groups, including Zarqawi's AI \n     Qaeda in Iraq.\n       U.S.-led forces at a nearby checkpoint began radioing their \n     colleagues after they heard an explosion and small-arms fire \n     but could not make contact.\n       Backup forces sent to the checkpoint discovered the dead \n     U.S. soldier and learned that two were missing, the military \n     said.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It says: The premier is crafting a reconciliation program \nthat ``doesn't rule out participation of `the bloody-handed people in \nthe political process.'''\n  What happened when we brought up a resolution on this side of the \naisle to say, no, no, we will not allow that to happen? What happened? \nThe Republicans stalled us for 2, 3 days, figuring out a way they could \nget us to back down. But we did not back down.\n  I cannot believe it. They are still killing our soldiers, and the \nRepublicans in the Senate are saying: Oh, give the Iraqi Government a \nchance. In their wisdom, they will do the right thing. Well, they are \nnot doing the right thing when they are considering giving amnesty to \nthose who are hurting, killing, brutalizing our troops. I cannot \nbelieve it.\n  And in light of all that I have laid out, what does our President \nsay? He says: I will not allow us to leave until everything is \nabsolutely perfect in Iraq. He does not know when that is. He is not \neven willing to talk about conditions that would be enough to bring our \ntroops home. It is kind of like: Well, we will know it when we see it. \nWell, that is not enough for the American people. When the President \nsaid, ``mission accomplished,'' it was not true. And when he says now, \nwe can make this work, we can have a country at peace, we can do all \nthis, and we just have to stay there as long as it takes--blank check. \nOpen checkbook, America. Open checkbook for\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nyou. Debts on your children, debts on your grandchildren, and a blind \neye to what is happening and what the Iraqi people want.\n  What kind of leadership is that? You think I like standing up here \nand getting into this kind of debate? No, I do not. But I have never \nseen anything like this since the Vietnam war, folks. I lived through \nthose years. That was the reason I got into politics, so we would not \nmake this mistake again.\n  Senate Democrats are providing real leadership. Do we all agree every \ninch of the way? No. But I predict to you, at the end of this vote, \ntomorrow, Republicans will be firm for the status quo, and Democrats \nwill be for changing the mission, changing the dynamic. And that is \ngoing to be important for the American people to know.\n  As I said, redeploying our troops is smart and strategic, and here is \nwhy. Again, it is smart and strategic because the Iraqis must stand up \nto the job of providing security for their own people. My goodness, \nthat is what countries do, folks. That is what countries do. We did it. \nYes, we had people help us in the Revolution. By the way, France was \none of those countries. But when the fighting was over, we had the \nboots on the ground. The Iraqi people have to stand up. They have to \nwant democracy as much as we want it for them.\n  And I will tell you, we should start concentrating on the war against \nterror. My friends on the other side blend it all together. They blend \nit all together. But I have already proven to you there was not one al-\nQaida cell in Iraq on 9/11. The State Department's own documents show \nit. There were more al-Qaida cells in America than there were in Iraq. \nBut our presence there is fueling the insurgency completely.\n  Let me tell you what Peter Bergen has stated. He is an expert. He is \nan expert on terrorism. He has written books about it. He says this:\n\n       What we have done in Iraq is what bin Laden could not have \n     hoped for in his wildest dreams: We invaded an oil rich \n     Muslim nation in the heart of the Middle East, the very type \n     of imperial adventure that bin Laden has long predicted was \n     the United States' long term goal in the region. We deposed \n     the secular socialist Saddam, whom bin Laden has long \n     despised, ignited Sunni and Shia fundamentalist fervor in \n     Iraq, and have now provoked a defensive jihad that has \n     galvanized jihad minded Muslims around the world. It's hard \nto imagine a set of policies better designed to sabotage the war on \nterrorism.\n\n  Now, I have spoken with many generals and military experts who agree \nthat our long-term presence in Iraq is counterproductive. They tell us \nthat our continued presence will continue to breed terrorists not only \nin Iraq but throughout the world.\n  Now, I want to show you, as I wind down this speech, how the Iraqi \npeople now feel about our presence. The Brookings Institution revealed \nthis poll. It was just printed in the press a few days ago. If this \ndoes not tell the story, nothing does.\n  Eighty-seven percent of the Iraqis support a timeline for U.S. \nredeployment. Eighty-seven percent of the Iraqi people want us out of \nthere and want a timeline specifically. By the way, this is one thing \nthat unites all the groups there. Sixty-four percent of the Kurds want \na timeline for U.S. redeployment. Ninety percent of the Shias want a \ntimeline for U.S. redeployment. Ninety-four percent of the Sunnis want \na timeline for U.S. redeployment.\n  So you tell me how it makes sense, at a time when we are learning \nthat the Iraqis, whom we are training, have, in at least two cases we \nknow about, turned against our soldiers, who are risking their lives--\nshot them in cold blood. For what? They are there to help the Iraqi \npeople, and they are being killed.\n  I have to say that the status quo is leading us deeper and deeper \ninto a place we don't want to be as a country. The American people want \nan exit strategy. An exit strategy is not cut-and-run; it is smart and \nstrategic. The status quo is more of the same. How many more times will \nwe come down here and talk about beheadings? How many more times will \nwe come down? How many more deaths will it take until finally we say \nenough is enough?\n  That time, I hope, is coming. I think we are going to see votes on \nthese two Democratic amendments that, when taken together, will \nindicate a real difference here between the parties.\n  Listen to what the Iraqi people are saying. Listen to what the \nAmerican people are saying. Listen to what the world is saying. The \nviews of the United States by people all over the world are going down. \nIn the last year alone, favorable views of the United States dropped in \nSpain, from 41 percent to 23 percent approval; in Indonesia, from 38 \npercent down to 30 percent; in Turkey, from 23 percent to 12 percent; \nand in India--India is considered one of our best friends--it has gone \nfrom 71 percent down to 56 percent. This does not make us stronger in \nthe world; it makes us weaker. This does not make us safer in the \nworld; it makes us more vulnerable.\n  I believe in democracy. So let us look at what the Iraqi people are \ntelling us they want. They want a timeline and want us out. Let's \nlisten to the generals who have told us that our long-term presence is \nfueling the insurgency and we need to get out. Let's listen to the \nAmerican people who are wise and love our troops and say it is time for \nan exit strategy.\n  Folks, we are paralyzed. We are paralyzed here. It is like we are in \na hole and we can't get out. Well, I say today is the day to start \nclimbing out of that hole. Senate Democrats have proposed two ways to \nchange the dynamics here in this war.\n  I plan to vote aye for the Kerry-Feingold-Boxer amendment. It speaks \nto me as something that will work for us. It is strategic. It is wise. \nIt is smart. I will also vote for the Levin amendment because it moves \nus in the right direction. It shakes up the mission into something that \nmakes sense. It changes the mission. It starts bringing our troops home \nand starts to redeploy them.\n  So my feeling is, the status quo is a disaster. It is a disaster. Let \nus open our eyes to the truth. Can you imagine how I felt when I got a \ncall in my office by a woman who couldn't find out the truth about who \nkilled her son? And the military had completed its investigation, and \nthey knew her son was killed by the very same Iraqi soldiers whom he \nwas training. And they kept it a secret? They kept it a secret until \ntoday from that woman. I have to say, why? Is it because they are \nfearful that when the American people learn of this, the support for \nthis war will plummet even further? I don't know the answer to that \nquestion. But so far, I have no good answers. It worried me with Mr. \nTillman, Patrick Tillman, in Afghanistan, when they said he was killed \nby the enemy, and the parents pressed on and pressed on, and it turned \nout to be friendly fire.\n  I am telling you, my colleagues, this is a turning point for us as \nindividual Senators. I hope we have the courage to say no to the status \nquo, support the Kerry-Feingold-Boxer alternative, and also support the \nLevin alternative because they both shake it up and say, once and for \nall, we need to talk about an exit strategy. In the end, that is going \nto be the road for success.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is debating two amendments on Iraq. \nThe first amendment has been offered by Senator Levin. It is a \nnonbinding sense of the Congress that clearly illustrates that there \nmust be a change in our policy toward Iraq. It states that it is \nneither in the American nor the Iraqi interest to maintain an open-\nended commitment of large numbers of our troops.\n  Some may challenge this idea and stubbornly maintain that we must \nstay the course, no matter the cost or the consequences. I would point \nthese critics to the op-ed which appeared in the Washington Post on \nTuesday, June 20, 2006, written by Iraq's National Security Adviser. \nHere is what he said: ``The eventual removal of coalition troops from \nIraqi streets will help the Iraqis, who now see foreign troops as \noccupiers rather than the liberators they were meant to be'' and that \n``the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's government in \nthe eyes of its people.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, has crafted a \ngood amendment which I will support. We need a change in our Iraq \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\nSenator Levin has put his finger directly on the key issues facing our \ncontinued military occupation of Iraq.\n  The second amendment which is being debated is an amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry. His amendment \nproposes that American troops be redeployed from Iraq no later than \nJuly 1, 2007. Senator Kerry should be commended for offering his \namendment. It is an important amendment, and it deserves a full debate. \nIt directly addresses the most pressing issue facing the American \npeople today.\n  Last week the very distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, offered an amendment similar to that of Senator Kerry's. It \nwas offered up as a sacrificial lamb, and a procedural motion was made \nto either kill the amendment or to continue debating it. I was one of \nsix Senators who voted to continue debate on that amendment.\n  Some may seek to ascribe my vote as a vote for the substance of \nSenator McConnell's amendment. But I shall speak for myself. As I have \ntold Senator Kerry, my vote was not for the substance of Senator \nMcConnell's amendment. My vote was to continue debate on the most \nimportant issue in our country today. My vote was in favor of the \ninstitution of the U.S. Senate, a temple of debate and free speech.\n  Some may seek to hide from the controversial issue of Iraq, but I \nwill not seek to hide from it. We Senators are sent by the people of \nour States to debate the critical issues facing our country, not to \nhide from them. My vote was in the minority on that procedural motion, \nbut I stand by my vote which was in favor of debate on the momentous \nsubject of Iraq.\n  The amendment the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry, offers will likely be voted on tomorrow, and I have spoken to \nSenator Kerry about the substance of his amendment. I know he is \nseeking a change in the administration's policy toward Iraq, which is \nacknowledged by most Americans to be a disaster. And he should be \nsaluted for his courage in insisting on offering his amendment, even \nthough he will be criticized--and perhaps even called unpatriotic by \nsome--for speaking his mind. However, I cannot support the substance of \nhis amendment.\n  I do not support setting a drop-dead withdrawal date for our troops \nfrom Iraq. I do not believe that this is a wise policy. I have called \ntime and time again for the President to begin bringing our troops \nhome. Our troops cannot be brought home overnight.\n  I also have concerns that this amendment is not strongly tied to the \nconstitutional powers of Congress relating to the conduct of war.\n  So for these reasons, for as much as I support his efforts to make a \nchange in an ill-defined, open-ended, stay-the-course policy in Iraq, I \nwill not support the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  But there are other ways to effect a change in direction. So I rise \ntoday to ask that I may be given time to offer another amendment on \nIraq.\n  There is an urgent need for the U.S. Senate to consider as many \noptions as we can to find an exit strategy with honor for our troops. \nOur country is polarized. The Senate is polarized. And I fear that we \nhave let the usual partisan warfare put blinders, such as we put on \nhorses, on ourselves and on our purpose.\n  Every Member in this body, I am sure, would like to see a successful \nend to the war in Iraq. Every Member of this body on both sides of the \naisle would like to do something that would speed the return of our \ntroops home to the loving arms of their families.\n  All of us, regardless of party affiliation, want to do the best thing \nfor our country. And we would all do well to remember that both the \nPresident, the Chief Executive, and the Congress have important roles \nto play when it comes to the most critical decisions that can be made \nby any government; namely, the decision to go to war and the decision \nto come home from war.\n  The American people are dismayed, as they should be, by this conflict \nin Iraq. I voted against our entry into that war. I voted against the \ninvasion of that country without any provocation toward our country.\n  Most assuredly, dozens of mistakes have been made and billions of \ndollars have been spent. Without a doubt, our international reputation \nhas been damaged, and we are losing the support of our own people for a \ndrawn-out commitment in Iraq and more and more loss of precious blood, \nprecious life.\n  Can we not try one more approach? Can we not? Can we not spend just a \nlittle more time on the consideration of a way out of Iraq? Can we not? \nCan we not? Can we not attempt to speak with one voice on the matter? \nIs that asking too much?\n  I have a third way. This is a fresh approach, I believe. It returns \nCongress's rightful voice to the warmaking power, yet it avoids the \npitfalls of usurping the executive branch's role in an ongoing war. It \nis respectful of the separation of powers, but it does outline a viable \nexit strategy for Iraq.\n  The amendment I would like to offer, the amendment I would like to \nsee debated on the Senate floor, is an effort to move the debate over \nthe war in Iraq away from the realm of political mudslinging to the \nrealm of constitutional responsibility.\n  My amendment is a simple, straightforward approach to laying out a \nroadmap to bring our troops home from Iraq with honor and dignity, the \nhonor and the dignity which they deserve.\n  My amendment establishes the policy that the democratically elected \nGovernment of Iraq should assume responsibility for its own security. \nMy amendment sets forth the conditions under which the congressional \nauthority to maintain U.S. troops in Iraq would expire.\n  This amendment is a genuinely fresh approach to unraveling the \nconundrum of how to disengage the U.S. military from Iraq. My approach \ndoes not attempt to micromanage the war. It is not an attempt to set \nartificial deadlines. It is not based on politically motivated \nrhetoric. It does not preempt the authority of either the President or \nthe Congress. What it does do is it returns the focus of the debate to \nthe role of Congress in the authorization of war. What my amendment \ndoes do is to reassert--yes, reassert--the role of Congress to \nauthorize--or to terminate the authorization of--the use of force.\n  The conditions under which the Iraq use of force authorization would \nexpire are based on circumstances, not on timetables, and they include \nthe following: When the Government of Iraq assumes responsibility for \nits own security; or if a multinational peacekeeping force were to \nassume responsibility for security in Iraq; or if the President \ncertifies that the United States has achieved its objectives in Iraq; \nor if Congress were to enact a joint resolution to terminate the use of \nforce authority.\n  Mr. President, the situation in Iraq has undergone seismic changes \nsince the original use-of-force authorization was granted by Congress \nin October of 2002. Since that time, our troops have completed the \nmission of removing Saddam Hussein from power and paving the way for \nthe establishment of a democratically elected government in Iraq. The \nauthorization under which the United States sent its military forces \ninto Iraq--which I voted against--is now painfully outdated. So it is \ntime to update that authorization to provide a statutory framework for \nreturning our troops home, and to acknowledge that the war in Iraq does \nhave an end point and is not an open-ended commitment.\n  Mr. President, it is most important to understand that the amendment \nI am proposing speaks only to the intent and authority of Congress. So \nit does not--hear me now--it does not infringe upon, or in any way \nusurp, the authority of the President. No Senator has to set aside his \nor her support or opposition to the war in order to support my \napproach.\n  But this amendment would send a powerful message to the people of the \nUnited States and to the people of Iraq, and especially to the \ndemocratically elected Government of Iraq. It would send the powerful \nmessage that the United States supports the security of Iraq but does \nnot intend to become a permanent occupying force in Iraq. This is a \nmessage that the people of Iraq need to hear. It is a message that the \npeople of the United States need to hear. It is a message that the \npeople of the United States are clamoring to hear. My amendment is a \nrealistic roadmap for the United States to remove its forces from Iraq \nin an orderly\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\nmanner--a manner consistent with our national security interests. It is \na legally enforceable formulation that should be embraced by all who \nare truly concerned with finding a solution to the problems in Iraq, \nnot just using the debate over the war in Iraq as a political football.\n  Surely, we owe the over 2,500 patriotic souls who have died fighting \nfor our country in Iraq a little more time on this debate. Surely, we \ncan consider the matter of the conflict in Iraq for a few more hours \nfor the sake of the over 18,000 U.S. troops who have been wounded in \nthat country, and the unknown numbers of Iraqi innocents who have been \nkilled or maimed. Surely, we can discuss this matter on a level that is \ndeeper than sloganeering like ``cut and run'' or ``stay the course.''\n  Mr. President, I hope our two leaders will work together to find a \nway for the Senate to debate my amendment and allow a vote on its \nmerits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, what is the time agreement this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is allocated 40 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Virginia, I \nyield myself as much time as I might consume. We have speakers coming \ndown here and, as they arrive, we will recognize them.\n  I do want to express my appreciation to Members on both sides who \nhave participated in this debate. We have already had a very spirited \ndebate. There will be others speaking throughout the course of the \nevening and again tomorrow before we ultimately vote on both of these \namendments.\n  As you know, we have in front of us two amendments. One is a sense of \nthe Senate, a nonbinding resolution, the Levin amendment, and we also \nhave the Kerry amendment, which has a force of law and which would \nrequire a withdrawal from Iraq by next summer.\n  As we consider and contemplate both of those amendments, I know there \nare strong emotions that Members on both sides feel with respect to \nthis issue, and clearly for good reason. I know in my own particular \ncircumstance, as I travel South Dakota, I hear from people all across \nmy State. I have participated, as many Senators have, in way too many \nfunerals and have heard the playing of taps way too many times in the \nlast year. It is that sentiment I think that makes people in this \ncountry very weary regarding the conflict in Iraq and the cost it has \nbrought this country in terms of both blood and treasure. So as we see \nMembers get up and express their thoughts on the Senate floor during \nthe course of this debate, I think they are in many cases reflecting \nthe sentiments of their constituents in their States, as well.\n  Generally speaking, I think a sense that people have across the \ncountry is one of weariness with this conflict in Iraq. At the same \ntime, I think we have to recognize what the stakes are in this debate \nand what the risks are as well. Clearly, as we have, I think, \narticulated--Members on our side--throughout the course of this debate, \nthe stakes are high and the consequences of failure are disastrous for \nour country if we fail in this campaign in Iraq.\n  I have to say that, like many Members here, I have traveled to Iraq \non a couple of different occasions. I was there as recently as a couple \nof months ago with Senator McCain, as well as with the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and a number of our Governors and House \nMembers, representing different regions of the country. I had been \nthere a year earlier and, of course, in the course of that year much \nhad changed. In fact, I would have to say there had been, at that time, \nsome mixed results. We had seen the outbreak of sectarian violence \nafter the bombing of the shrine at Samara. But at the same time, we had \nseen vast improvements in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to \nprovide for their own security. That, in my mind, was very encouraging \nbecause at that time about 75 percent of the battle areas were being \npoliced either by Iraqi armed services or the police force, which was a \nmarked improvement from the time I had been there a year before.\n  Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that, by any measure, if you \nlook at any significant metric in the past year or so, we have seen \nsome improvements and progress made in Iraq and I think, in a \nsubstantial way, in the broader war on terror. If you look particularly \nat Iraq, Prime Minister al-Mailiki, just in the last couple of weeks, \ncompleted the formation of a new Iraqi Government, filling many Cabinet \npositions. If you look at the success our troops have had in taking out \nthe terrorist leader, Musab al-Zarqawi and many of his allies in just \nthe last few weeks, that is a huge blow to al-Qaida and a huge victory \nfor our side in the war on terror.\n  As I said earlier, the Iraqi security forces are growing in number \nevery single day. Only a year and a half ago, Iraqi security forces had \njust begun to form. Today, there are 264,400 trained and equipped Iraqi \nsecurity forces, which is more than double the number of U.S. troops \nwho are serving in the region.\n  The beginning of this year, 2006, the Iraqi security forces had 10 \nbrigades and 43 battalions that controlled areas of responsibility. \nHere, only a few months later, those numbers are nearly doubled to 18 \nbrigades and 71 battalions. Large- and small-scale water treatment \nfacilities have been rehabilitated or constructed for an estimated 3 \nmillion people at a standard level of service, with plans underway to \ndeliver clean, safe drinking water to 5 million more. May oil \nproduction was over 2.1 million barrels per day.\n  The U.S. Treasury Department is sending professionals to Iraq to \nprovide technical support for the creation of a public finance system \nthat is accountable and transparent. The State Department is \ncoordinating a broad effort to support an economic policy framework \nthat enhances investments, job creation, and growth.\n  I have to say that that progress has occurred--and many of my \ncolleagues have spoken in favor of these amendments in spite of the \npresence of Americans and our troops' efforts--due to and because of \nthe efforts of our troops and their presence there. Contrary to what I \nhave heard some of my colleagues on the other side say throughout the \ncourse of this debate, when I was in Iraq, which was as recently as a \ncouple months ago, as I said, the Iraqi political leaders I talked to \nmade it very clear that they thought it was important that we have a \npresence in Iraq.\n  I have heard Members get up on the floor and say they have talked to \npeople there and they say they want us out, and they don't want the \ndoor to hit us on the way out. But that is certainly not the message \nthat was delivered to me and the delegation I was with when we were \nthere. I also have to say that part of our mission in going there was \nto impress upon the Iraqi leadership, the political leaders in that \ncountry, the importance of forming a national unity government, and to \nend the sectarianism and the sectarian violence that ravaged that area \nduring the time that we were there. They have made that progress in the \nlast couple of months since our departure from Iraq. They have formed \nthis national unity government, and they continue to make progress \ntoward what I believe is a democracy inclusive of the Shiites, the \nSunnis, the Kurds, and the various groups over there that are all \nstruggling to come together behind a government and to be able to \nassume responsibility for their own governance and also for their own \nsecurity.\n\n  It seems to me at least that right now it would not be a good signal \nto send either to them or to our men and women who are fighting the \ngood fight in Iraq that we intend to pull out at any particular time \ncertain. It seems, just as a matter of policy, what we are simply doing \nwhen we do that is telegraphing to the terrorists our intentions, and \nthey will just wait us out, that we are going to leave at some point \nand they will be able to assume control in that region. If there is a \nvacuum at some point, they will be able to step in and fill it.\n  I think we are at a strategic turning point, and I think we are at \nthat point due to the good work of the men and women wearing the \nuniform. We have to listen to what they are saying and what our \ncommanders on the ground are saying. I don't think it is in the best \ninterest of our troops or the overall campaign in Iraq for us to be \nhere in Washington, DC, in a political body such as the Senate--\nalthough clearly we have responsibilities with respect to\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nfunding the troops and supporting them, giving them direction, but I \ndon't think we ought to be passing judgment about when is the best time \nto pull our troops back.\n  We are moving in a direction that will enable us to do that, and I \nbelieve that our commanders have made it clear that as they see the \nIraqi military stand up, as the government stands up, it is only a \nmatter of time before our troops will be able to stand down, and we \nwill begin to draw down some of our troop strengths in the region.\n  I make that point because, as I mentioned earlier, popular support is \nwaning for the conflict and people are weary and they are frustrated as \nthey see lives lost and they see the cost of the war, but at the same \ntime I think they realize we have a mission to complete there. We \nlisten to the people across the country, but it is also important to \nlisten to what the troops are saying.\n  Whenever I travel, when I go to Iraq, when I listen to troops who \nhave returned from Iraq, when I talk with National Guard units in South \nDakota that have been deployed there, and, frankly, even when I discuss \nwith families who have lost loved ones in Iraq their thoughts about the \nwork we are doing there and whether we are making a difference, I \nconsistently ask the questions: Do you believe we are making a \ndifference? Do you believe progress is being made? Do you believe we \nare doing the right thing?\n  I try to ask those questions separate from--and especially when I am \ntraveling into Iraq--the structured settings in which I would get a \nresponse--I wouldn't say a canned response but a response that might be \nless than completely forthright. I ask troops in different situations.\n  I remember when I was in Iraq in Baghdad the last time, I got up \nearly in the morning and went to the fitness center and worked out in \nthe weight room with a lot of our troops and visited, interacted with \nthem, and asked their opinions on issues. Clearly, there is a belief, I \nthink, that the work there is hard, that the work there has been \ncostly, that people would like to be back home with their families but \nat the same time who understand the stakes of what they are doing and \nbelieve profoundly in the mission and the work we are doing at winning \nthe war on terror.\n  As I said before, I think we have to, as we listen to this debate, \nkeep in mind that the stakes are very high because it is not just about \nfreedom and democracy in Iraq, as good as that objective may be, it is \nalso about, in a broader sense, the national security of future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I happen to believe that the war on terror is sort of our, as they \nused to say, rendezvous with destiny, that many generations that have \ncome before have had to battle evil. We had World War II and Nazism and \nall the characters of that time who wanted to kill and destroy and maim \npeople. And since that time we have fought the Cold War. It has taken a \ncertain amount of resolve in every one of those circumstances to \nprevail. But in either of those circumstances had we not had that \nresolve, had there not been freedom-loving people and leadership \ncommitted to finishing that mission, we could be living in a very \ndifferent world.\n  They met, in their generation's time, the challenge that was put \nbefore them to make the world a safer and more secure place for future \ngenerations. That was true in World War II, that was true in the Cold \nWar, and that is true today in the war on terror. I believe it is our \ntime and our generation's, if you want to call it struggle between good \nand evil, and we have a responsibility to the people of this country \nand to freedom-loving people everywhere to make sure we do not fail in \nsucceeding, in winning the war against terror, to ensure that future \ngenerations do not have to live in constant fear, in constant threat, \nand perhaps dealing with thugs such as al-Zarqawi and others who want \nto do evil and want to kill, want to destroy, and have nothing but the \nworst of intentions for the people of this country and people elsewhere \naround the world.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will be voted on tomorrow. I know the \nSenator from Massachusetts has time to talk about his amendment later. \nAnd the Levin amendment will also be voted on. I appreciate and believe \nit is appropriate for us to have this debate, especially in the context \nof the Defense authorization bill, where we are debating national \nsecurity. This is a debate we have every year. I think it is very \nappropriate to have this discussion.\n  I don't question the motivations or intentions of people who bring \nthese amendments; I think just in terms of their judgment, it is wrong. \nI don't think we can telegraph to our enemies what our strategies are. \nI believe it is important we complete the mission, that we listen to \nthose commanders, those generals, those troops on the ground day in and \nday out, fighting the good fight, trying to protect our citizens in \nthis country and around the world and future generations from what I \nbelieve is a very real, very serious threat to our security as we go \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I see that the Senator from Kansas is on the floor. I \nwill be happy, if he is prepared at this time to make his remarks, to \nyield such time to him as he may consume. We have others who will be \njoining us in the Chamber. I, at this time, yield to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota \nfor yielding time to me on this very important topic that we are \ndealing with today, and I also thank my colleagues from Massachusetts \nand from Michigan for raising these issues.\n  As Senator Thune was stating, this is an important debate. It is time \nwe had this debate. It is the right vehicle for us to have this debate, \nand I think it is helpful for us to have this debate for the United \nStates as we move forward.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, can I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 25\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is time we had this debate and time \nwe had this debate in front of the people of the United States and in \nfront of the world. Rest assured that the terrorists are watching this \ndebate. Those who seek harm for us in Iraq and in many regions of the \nworld are watching this debate, and they are testing and sensing our \nsense of resolve or lack of resolve in this war on terrorism.\n  They are very much playing off us and saying the weakness of the \nUnited States is its willingness to stay the course or its lack of \nresolve or the shifting of public opinion, and that is what they drive \nat more than anything else, seeing that the weakest part of the U.S. \nmilitary is public opinion, U.S. public opinion, so that our forces are \nnot defeated on the battlefield. We have lost valiant soldiers, but we \nwin the battles. What they are targeting is weakening U.S. public \nopinion and U.S. resolve. That is what they are targeting with the \nattacks, with the IEDs, with the roadside bombs. It is not going force \non force and saying: OK, we are going to drive Americans out of this \nportion of Iraq; we are going to keep them out of this particular area. \nMuch of it is saying: Look, we know the United States. We know they are \na democracy. They respond to public opinion. What we have to do is have \nthis be costly enough to the United States in American blood that \npublic opinion shifts and they pull away. And once they leave, we take \nover. So their actual target is U.S. public opinion.\n  We need to disappoint the terrorists on that particular issue, that \nU.S. public opinion and U.S. resolve remains in place to see this \nthrough.\n  We are in a decades-long struggle with terrorism. It had been going \non since before we had the attack on 9/11. It had been going on for a \ndecade prior to that. We had the attack on Khobar Towers. We had the \nUSS Cole attack. We had two embassies in Africa attacked. Hit, hit, \nhit, and ineffective, feckless responses on our part I think further \nemboldened the terrorists to take this even further. Hit, no response; \nhit, ineffective response; hit, ineffective response; and then 9/11, \nand after that, there was no way you were going to stop the United \nStates from responding. We said: Look, that is it, we are going and we \nare going to deal with this. We went into Afghanistan, the \nheadquarters. And after that we said: Where else are terrorists working \nout of? And the war effort moved to Iraq.\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n  Let's look at it from the point of view of the terrorists. I think \nthey misjudged us in thinking we wouldn't respond. We did respond, and \nwe responded aggressively and we responded effectively. We sent a very \nstrong message. But now if we pull out or if we set a timeframe for \npulling out that says just wait a definite period of time, 1 year, wait \nthat period of time and the United States starts pulling back, how do \nthe terrorist groups read that?\n  My colleague from Massachusetts would have a certain point of view on \nthat; maybe others would, my colleague from Michigan. I respect the \nmotivation. I am delighted we are having this debate. It is important \nwe have this debate with our Nation and with the world now.\n  The conclusions I draw from this are different. If we set timeframes, \nit says to them that they have us where they want, and they can start \ndeclaring victory in their own words saying: Look, we have them down; \nin a year's period of time, they are gone; all we have to do is wait \nthat period of time.\n  We have to see this through to a successful conclusion. That does not \nmean, in any respect whatsoever, that I oppose us repositioning troops, \npulling down the number of troops in Iraq or taking our troops away \nfrom the Sunni Triangle and handing more of that over to the Iraqis. It \nseems to me that our timeframes, as set by our military leaders--as set \nby the military leaders--that they would be the ones to recommend \nsaying it is time we can pull troop levels down.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Not now. I have limited time, and I want to make this \nstatement, if I may. That we can, at the appointment of our military \nleaders, start pulling our troops away from the Sunni Triangle so we \ncan have the Iraqis taking over more and more of the security in more \ndangerous areas. I think that is an important thing for us to say here \nin this debate as well, that in opposing setting a timeframe for \npulling out, we are not opposing changing tactics, or if our military \nleaders say it is time, we can start pulling troops down, let's do it. \nI want that to take place. But it should be the military leaders doing \nthis, without the dictates of us saying here that we are just going to \nset an arbitrary timeframe for us to pull on out of this region. I \nthink it sends the exact wrong signal, particularly at this point in \ntime when we have momentum that we have gained and we have an Iraqi \ngovernment in place.\n\n  Frankly, through the help of this debate, we are sending a message to \nthe Iraqi people and their government that the United States is not in \nthis for an unlimited period of time. We do expect the Iraqis to step \nup. You have to step up in taking more of this on and moving more of \nthis forward. I think this should be done on our working with and \nlistening to the military leaders of what they would say would be the \nright route for us to go on this and not us setting an arbitrary date.\n  This has been, in my estimation, a very good debate to have. But I \nthink it is important at the end of the debate that we have a very \nstrong and clear vote on this that we are staying, and we are going to \nsee this through to the end. We are not dictating to the military \nleadership an arbitrary time period, and we are going to win this war \non terrorism, period, and that we have the resolve to win this war on \nterrorism. I think that is important for us to do.\n  I want to thank my colleague from South Dakota for chairing this \ndebate at this point in time. I do hope that my colleagues join me \nagain tomorrow in voting against this resolution with this timeframe.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If we have time on our side, but I don't know if we \nhave other colleagues wishing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Kansas, if he wants to yield for a \nquestion, I guess that is your prerogative. We have other speakers \ncoming. I am hesitant to allow too much time to burn off the clock.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would rather reserve the balance of our time for \nother speakers.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of my \ncolleague from Kansas, because I think he too has laid out very clearly \nwhat the stakes are in this debate.\n  As I said earlier, we will have an opportunity to vote tomorrow on \nboth of these amendments, the Levin amendment, the sense of Congress \namendment, and then the Kerry amendment, both of which are directed at \nsome sort of a timeline with respect to the conflict in Iraq. As I \nmentioned earlier, I think as we have undertaken to allow a very open \ndebate on this, which, as I said before, I think is a good thing to do, \nparticularly in the context of debating the Defense authorization bill, \nwe are hearing from both sides some of the emotion that is felt on this \nand also some very strong opinions and views but, oftentimes, a \ndifferent interpretation of the facts.\n  I think what we need to do in this debate is try and focus on the \nfacts as they exist on the ground and not sometimes as we understand \nthem here from what we read in the press, but we need to rely, in my \njudgment, on those people who are day in and day out fighting the good \nfight in the theater. Our commanders, our generals, our troops who are \nconducting this operation over there are doing the Lord's work, in my \nopinion, in protecting us from terrorist threats that exist. I dare \nsay, as we look at the type of threat we will face in the future, it \nseems to me, at least, that the success or failure of the operation in \nIraq is going to bear heavily on whether we are ultimately going to \nsucceed in the war on terror.\n  People have argued about whether we ought to be in Iraq in the first \nplace, and that is a debate where Members on the other side have said \nwe shouldn't have been there, we shouldn't have gone in the first \nplace. Most who are making that argument are people who supported the \nresolution to go there, and I think many of those people also realize \nas well--and I think the vote will reflect this tomorrow--that they \nhave strong misgivings about us pulling out prematurely and putting in \njeopardy the good work that has been done by the troops in that region \nalready.\n  So I expect tomorrow when we have this vote we will see a very strong \nvote against the Kerry amendment. I think it will reflect, hopefully, \nthe will of this body at this point in time as we are making good \nprogress, I think, at a very important turning point in the war in \nIraq, the progress that has been made on the ground both with respect \nto the Iraqi security forces as well as with the Government of Iraq as \nit stands up. We want to make sure we are not telegraphing to our \nenemies that at this very point where we literally have them on their \nbacks, that we are going to let them up and begin to assume many of the \nthings that they were doing in the past: the killings, the planning, \nthe launching of attacks against people not only in that region but \nelsewhere around the world and, in many cases, people from freedom-\nloving countries and American citizens. We want to make sure that never \nhappens again.\n  My colleague from Alabama is here on the floor. Would the Senator \nfrom Alabama like to speak on this subject? We are waiting for the \nSenator from Georgia to arrive. He is not here yet, so if the Senator \nfrom Alabama would like to claim some time, I am certainly willing to \nyield to him. I think we have about 10 minutes left on our side if the \nSenator from Alabama would like to make some remarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do have some remarks, and I would \ndeliver those after the others have finished their time tonight if it \nis not too late, and I would just share a few thoughts at this time.\n\n  We have been given a great heritage in our country. We have been \ngiven a Nation that is the greatest Nation in the world at this time. \nWe have the finest military the world has ever known. We have a great \ndemocracy where we have full and vigorous debate.\n  I was here when we debated the question of whether or not to issue \nthat ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, and we knew then if he didn't accept \nit, if he didn't allow the inspectors in and if he didn't renounce \nweapons of mass destruction, we would be going to war, and that was the \nvote and we knew it and everybody discussed it. It went on for months. \nPeople say it was quick. It went on for months.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n  I will tell you what I said about why we went. I looked back at my \nremarks. It was not based on primarily weapons of mass destruction. We \nwere dealing with Iraq for years. We had a war with them in 1991, and \nwe defeated them and sent their Army going back to Baghdad. In effect, \nSaddam Hussein sued for peace and he made a series of promises to keep \nus from following and destroying his Army completely and invading his \ncountry and removing him from power, and he made those commitments, and \nhe did not follow them.\n  There were a number of U.N. resolutions that he was in violation of. \nHe rejected the international community, and an embargo had been placed \non Iraq. The United States was attempting to enforce that embargo. \nSaddam Hussein was consistently working to get around that embargo. We \nwere flying in no-fly zones and enforcing no-fly zones over Iraq. He \nwas shooting at our airplanes on a daily basis, almost. We were \ndropping bombs on Saddam Hussein on a regular basis, dropping bombs \nfrom our aircraft.\n  So the question was, as The Economist magazine said, are we going to \nquit our efforts, are we going to issue an ultimatum and be prepared to \ngo to war if they do not? Their editorial said, the London-based \nEconomist magazine said, our vote is for war. That was that London \njournal's opinion.\n  That is the way I felt about it. Iraq was a rogue nation that had \ntremendous amounts of oil, it had a dictator prepared to use weapons of \nmass destruction, use weapons of mass destruction against his own \npeople, and he was determined to break the embargo, determined to be \nable to sell his oil on the world market, not for his own people's good \nbut to build up his military power, just like he did when he invaded \nKuwait, and be the preeminent Nebakanezer of the Middle East. That was \nhis goal. It remained his goal. It probably still is as long as he \ntakes a breath.\n  So we gave him that ultimatum, and with the support of large numbers \nof nations in the world--I believe some 60 supported us, including \nnations like the United Kingdom and Australia and others--he refused to \ncomply and we commenced our military action. This Nation made a \ndecision to remove him from power and we voted on it as a Senate, and \nwe sent our soldiers in harm's way. We did not do that lightly. No \ngreat Nation which expects to be respected will send its soldiers into \nharm's way with a half-hearted commitment to them.\n  When I talk to those soldiers, as I did recently at the 231st \nbirthday of the United States Army over at the Jefferson Memorial, and \nI talked to those soldiers and we were discussing these kinds of \ndeadlines and policies and directives to set forth plans as to how the \nwar should be conducted, one of them said to me, Senator, let me tell \nyou what we want. We want to win. And I have talked to families who \nlost loved ones in Iraq, and they tell me every time--it is amazing--my \nson was doing what he believed in, what he wanted to do.\n  I submit we owe them the responsibility to be faithful to them and \nnot to dishonor their sacrifice by cutting and running when it is not \ntime to do so. I believe that very, very sincerely.\n  So I would just say to my colleagues, I can see how we have \ndifferences of opinion, and I understand that. I remember the debate \nand I remember the vote I cast and I knew it was very serious. No \nNation that desires its own self-respect or the respect of other \nnations can be flippant about those kinds of matters. When you make a \ncommitment, you stay the course.\n  Iraq has formed a new government completely now. They have a \nparliament. They have elected all their ministers. They have their \ninterior and defense ministers in place. They are determined to \ncontinue to grow and strengthen their Army and their security forces.\n  I believe they still need American help to get over that hump and be \nsuccessful. We should not disregard the advice of our military leaders \nand set an artificial date, not connected to military and political \nreality in Iraq, for leaving Iraq. I think that would be the very wrong \nthing to do. And nothing could be more corrosive to our self-confidence \nas a Nation or to our own military than to prematurely give up on the \nopportunity we have to create a good and stable government in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, could I inquire how much time is \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise tonight in opposition to this \namendment. As I have thought about this over the last several days, I \nbelieve it is critically important that we bring this issue up for \ndebate. The Senator from Massachusetts, frankly, is to be commended for \ndoing so. We could have eased through this bill without having this \ndebate and the American people would not have had the opportunity to \nhear where we are, what is going on, and in particular why those of us \nwho think it is important that we move ahead continue to do so.\n  First of all, when the President spoke to a joint session of Congress \nfollowing September 11, he said we were going to be engaging in an \nentirely different form of military conflict than we had ever been \nengaged in before, and it was going to be a war on terror which was \ngoing to be a long and enduring war. He has been exactly right. We \nultimately moved into Afghanistan, and liberated the people of \nAfghanistan. We took out hundreds if not thousands of terrorists in \nthat country, and ultimately the decision was made to liberate the \npeople of Iraq, and we have done that. It is about this conflict that, \nin the minds of a lot of Americans, the question is still being asked, \nHow much longer is this going to go on?\n  I remind the folks of America that the President did say it is going \nto be a long and enduring war. That is the case. The reason it is going \nto be a long and enduring war is because this is an unconventional war \nin every sense of the word. It would be nice if we had tanks on the \nbattlefield or artillery being fired at an enemy over the hill. But we \nare never going to see that in this war on terrorism. It is being \nfought in the back alleys of Baghdad and Mosul and Tikrit, in towns \nthat were foreign to anybody in America before we moved into Iraq and \nmade the march to Baghdad. That is the kind of war which is going to \ncontinue to be fought.\n  The people of Iraq know that well. They have suffered as much if not \nmore than any country in that region that has had a conflict like this. \nI say that because we all remember Desert Storm and what happened in \nKuwait. We all remember what has been happening daily in that part of \nthe world, whether it is Jordan or whether it is Israel or Egypt or \nsome other part of that region of the world. The people of Iraq have \ntruly suffered. They understand that America has made a sacrifice, and \nthey understand that, were it not for the American soldier coming in to \nliberate them, they would not be in the condition they are today, which \nfrankly is a pretty positive condition--both economically as well as \notherwise.\n  Are there bad things happening? Sure. There are going to continue to \nbe bad things happening. The one thing about war is there is nothing \npleasant about it. There is nothing good about war. But at the end of \nthe day, America has always stood tall in military conflicts. America \nhas carried the day. America has always achieved victory, and victory \nmeans a democratic form of government in Iraq being formed. It means a \nunified government, which we have seen taking place in Iraq recently. \nIt means taking out the bad guys, from a leadership standpoint all the \nway down. That is happening in Iraq every single day.\n  Recently, we saw the takeout of their leader, Zarqawi. That happened \nin a short period of time. But were it not for the first American \nsoldier to set foot in Iraq and start the motion in process, that would \nnot have happened the way it did 2 weeks ago. It will happen again. \nWhoever is next in line will ultimately be brought to justice or have \njustice physically brought to them at the hands of the American \nsoldier.\n  We are in a situation today where we are discussing whether we ought \nto pull our troops out of there--whether we talk about next week, next \nmonth, or next year. In my opinion, that sends the wrong message to the \nIraqi people. It sends the wrong message to the terrorists. And it \nsends the wrong message to the world. It is a different message from \nwhat the American military\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nand America itself has ever sent to any enemy with which we have been \nengaged in combat.\n  We are having successes today, successes that are brought about \nbecause of sacrifices--in a lot of cases the ultimate sacrifice. That \nhas always been the American way. While we grieve for those families \nwho have made that ultimate sacrifice, they are going to be satisfied \nonly when their ultimate sacrifice is rewarded with full and complete \nvictory in the war on terror.\n  I believe it is important that we have this debate. It is important \nthat the American people understand we truly are winning this war and \nthat the wins are not measured by victories on the battlefield every \nday, but the victory is being measured by winning the hearts and minds \nof the Iraqi people. The victory is being measured by the folks who are \nachieving success inside Iraq, from a military standpoint, from a \ngovernmental standpoint, and from an economic standpoint.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at these motions very carefully, both of \nthem, and that we defeat both motions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired. The \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Georgia. He is a very valued member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, as is Senator Thune, who spoke earlier, as was Senator \nSessions.\n  I think we have had a good debate. We are prepared to continue that \ndebate as long as it is desired. We are here to stay. We feel very \nstrongly about these issues, you know. I do not want to invade the time \nof my good friend.\n  I yield the floor at this time, and I will follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wonder if it will be possible to let the \nSenator from New Jersey speak for about 15 minutes and then I resume \nthe floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if that is with no objection, the next 30 \nminutes is under the Senator's control.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand I have unlimited time at this time, Mr. \nPresident? There is no time limit on me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. I just yield him 15 minutes. I don't intend to talk all \nnight, but I hope to have the chance to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hope we have a rotation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, to decide our future in Iraq, we must \nfirst understand our past in Iraq.\n  Frankly, I never believed this administration's false arguments about \nwhy we should go to war in Iraq. And I believe this administration has \nnever had a strategy for success in Iraq.\n  That's why I voted against the war in Iraq.\n  The Bush administration led us into this war based on false premises \nand false promises.\n  The Bush administration invaded Iraq without the troop numbers needed \nto complete the job.\n  The Bush administration failed to provide the troops with the \nequipment they needed letting them go into Iraq without proper body \narmor or properly armored vehicles\n  The Bush administration failed to create a real international \ncoalition so that the United States wouldn't have to bear the highest \ncost in blood and national treasure.\n  And President Bush went into the war without a plan to win the peace.\n  This was a war of choice, not a war of necessity.\n  The Bush administration's record in Iraq represents a massive failure \nof leadership--a massive failure of Presidential leadership.\n  Let me be clear. While I did not support the war, I have always \nsupported the troops on the battlefield. Our troops have succeeded in \nthe tasks they were given. They have fought for freedom and security in \nthe most difficult of situations. They have risked their lives to \nprotect ours. And the Nation is indebted to them for their service.\n  In New Jersey, over 3,169 New Jerseyans are serving in Iraq or \nAfghanistan and 71 service members with ties to New Jersey have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our country in Iraq or Afghanistan and our \nthoughts and prayers are with them and their families. Obviously, our \ntroops are committed to this call to duty. They have not questioned the \nwhy, or the wherefore, they have simply, honorably, and valiantly \nanswered the call of their country.\n  But we are all living with the consequences of this failure in \nPresidential leadership today:\n  Iraq continues to explode with sectarian violence.\n  Reconstruction efforts have not restored Iraq to prewar levels of oil \nproduction, security concerns continue to impede progress, while \naccusations of contractor corruption continue.\n  We have not been able to internationalize the effort of training and \nsecurity in Iraq because of the administration's closed-minded decision \nto keep countries from helping with reconstruction unless they \nsupported the administration's decision to go to war.\n  On top of the other failures, the administration refused to engage in \nreal diplomacy to create regional security with Iraq's neighbors.\n  The United States has spent nearly $319 billion in Iraq. Our monthly \nburn rate is over $8 billion. Over 2,500 American lives have been lost, \nover 18,500 soldiers have been wounded--many of them severely.\n  And we were all horrified to hear the news just yesterday that two \nU.S. soldiers, PFC Kristian Menchaca from Houston, TX and PFC Thomas \nLowell Tucker, from Madras, OR, were kidnapped and slaughtered by the \ninsurgents.\n  My heart goes out to the families of these soldiers and to all who \nhave lost loved ones in Iraq.\n  I believe we have paid a heavy price for the war in Iraq--in blood \nand in national treasure.\n  But we must account for not only the literal cost of the war but also \nwhat we have not done because of the war--the opportunity cost of the \nwar in Iraq.\n  We also cannot forget that our fight against terrorism started where \nit should have in Afghanistan. But because of the President's war in \nIraq, this administration then took our eye off the ball in \nAfghanistan.\n  The administration never finished the job in Afghanistan, the \nbirthplace of the Taliban, the home to al-Qaida, the land of Osama bin \nLaden, and the place where the attacks of 9/11 were planned.\n  This was the right place to pursue the national security of the \nUnited States. It was in Afghanistan that the murderers of September 11 \nwere located. We had Osama bin Laden pinned down in the mountains of \nTora Bora. But instead of having a large contingent of the best \ntrained, best equipped, most technologically advanced military in the \nworld go after him, we outsourced the job to Afghanistan warlords. The \nresult? Osama bin Laden got away.\n  Many of us have been horrified as we have watched the resurgence of \nthe Taliban and strong anti-American sentiment in Afghanistan.\n  During just the past few weeks, over 250 people have been killed in \nthe upsurge in violence and we see techniques borrowed from Iraq, like \nthe use of improvised explosive devices, now being used in Afghanistan.\n  According to the New York Times, Pentagon officials say that 32 \nsuicide bombs have been exploded in 2006, which is already 6 more than \nexploded in all of 2005. Roadside bombings are up 30 percent over last \nyear and the Taliban are fighting in groups triple the size of last \nyear. Just this Monday, we heard reports that the Taliban used women \nand children as human shields during a fierce firefight with British \ntroops. And after a deadly traffic accident involving the U.S. \nmilitary, an anti-American riot exploded in Kabul last month. \nMeanwhile, Bin Laden makes his tapes and remains free.\n  President Bush's war has also hurt us here at home. The fact is that \nbecause of the cost of President Bush's war at almost $319 billion, we \ncannot afford to take care of some of the basic needs of our citizens \nhere at home. This administration is cutting funds for firefighters, \nfor education, for our seniors, for healthcare, and for homeland \nsecurity funding in New Jersey and New York to protect our ports and \nour transit systems. They are underfunding the very veterans who are \nsecuring our\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\ncountry and who come back from war wounded or traumatized. The Bush \nadministration is cutting funding to all of these people--our nurses, \nteachers, and seniors--while spending billions in Iraq every month.\n  As we start a new hurricane season, I look back on Hurricane Katrina \nand I see the terrible price the people of the Gulf Coast paid when \ntheir National Guard troops were away in Iraq and unable to protect \nthem here at home. Our homeland is simply less secure when our National \nGuard and Reserves are being kept in permanent rotation away in Iraq.\n  Clearly, it is time to change the course; we need a new direction in \nIraq.\n  That's why I am supporting the Levin and Kerry amendments today.\n  The Senate has already spoken saying that 2006 must be a year of \ntransition. That is why the Levin amendment says that we must begin \ntransitioning out troops now while still protecting our people and \nhelping with security. With the Levin amendment, we make it clear that \nthe time has come to change the course, rather than stay the course.\n  I am also supporting Senator Kerry's amendment which takes the first \nand most important step by setting a date of July 1, 2007 to have all \nU.S. troops transition except those critical to training Iraqi security \nforces, working on specialized counterterrorism operations, and \nprotecting our U.S. personnel and facilities, like our embassy.\n  Let us be clear. This amendment does not say we should remove all of \nour troops from Iraq right now.\n  With this amendment, we are saying that it is time for Iraqis to take \nresponsibility for their own destiny.\n  With this amendment, we are sending a message that over the course of \nthe next year, the Iraqis must take full control of their own country, \ntheir own security, and their own future.\n  With this amendment, we are saying that we respect the message of the \nIraqis' own elected, sovereign government. At a time when the Iraqis \nhave put in place the entire cabinet of the elected government of Prime \nMinister Maliki; at a time when the United States and coalition forces \nhave trained and equipped more than 116,000 Iraqi soldiers and more \nthan 148,000 Iraqi police and other security forces; at a time when \nsectarian violence has taken over terrorism as the most serious \nsecurity threat in Iraq; at a time when 69 out of the 102 army combat \nbattalions, are either soon able to take the lead or able to operate \nindependently, isn't it time for the Iraqis to start taking \nresponsibility for their own destiny?\n  In fact, the Iraqis have made this point themselves. The Iraqi \nNational Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie said in a Washington Post \narticle this week:\n\n       Iraq has to grow out of the shadow of the United States and \n     the coalition, take responsibility for its own decisions, \n     learn from its own mistakes, and find Iraqi solutions to \n     Iraqi problems, with the knowledge that our friends and \n     allies are standing by with support and help should we need \n     it.\n\n  He also said that the eventual removal of coalition troops ``will \nhelp the Iraqis, who now see foreign troops as occupiers rather than \nthe liberators they were meant to be'' and that ``the removal of \nforeign troops will legitimize Iraq's government in the eyes of its \npeople.'' Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki supports a transfer of \nresponsibility for 16 out of 18 provinces by the end of 2006 and his \nsecurity adviser believes that we can reduce coalition forces to less \nthan 100,000 by the end of this year with most of the multinational \nforce gone. The Iraqis are clearly saying that they are ready for this \ntransition to happen.\n  A few days ago, Republican Senators made a great deal of Iraqi \nsovereignty when I, and Senator Nelson, proposed a Sense of the Senate \namendment that urged the government of Iraq not to grant amnesty for \nthose who had killed U.S. soldiers.\n  We heard a lot about sovereignty.\n  If the Iraqis are to be respected as a sovereign government, as many \nargued on the floor of the Senate a few days ago, shouldn't we respect \ntheir knowledge and wishes as it relates to the very issue of troop \nredeployment and their ability to sustain their own security?\n  It is only when the Iraqis and the rest of the world know there is a \ncertain timeframe for a real transition that they will make the hard \nchoices, negotiations, and compromises to maintain a stable government \nof national unity. It is time for the U.S. to cap the open-ended \ncommitment of U.S. forces in Iraq and to ``remove the training wheels'' \non the Iraqi security forces. The sooner the Iraqi security forces \nbelieve they are fighting for their country, the sooner they help stop \nthe sectarian violence. Until that happens, the fledgling Iraqi \nGovernment will continue to rely on U.S. forces to keep them from \nmaking the difficult decisions and taking tough actions. It is time for \nthe Iraqis to step up to the plate.\n\n  Clearly, it is essential to set a date certain for transition so that \nIraqis will take responsibility for their country.\n  It is also essential to set this date certain for transition so that \nthe international community will start to take responsibility for \nreconstruction and security in Iraq, as well.\n  The United States cannot go it alone; we must internationalize \nreconstruction, security, and create an international process to end \nsectarian violence. It is in everyone's interest to create a stable and \nsecure Iraq. That is why I support the proposed Summit in Senator \nKerry's amendment which brings together all of the players--the EU, \nNATO, the UN, and Iraq's neighbors--to come up with a plan to solve the \npolitical problems, to deal with the militias, and to revive \nreconstruction efforts.\n  And this Summit will also deal with a key issue to Iraq's stability--\noil. Ultimately, all parties need to be brought in to the process and \nshare the oil profits whether through a national fund or some form of \nrevenue sharing. We cannot forget that Iraq has the fourth largest oil \nreserves in the world. The goal is to reduce insurgent attacks, improve \nsecurity along the pipeline and create strong oversight over current \npipeline reconstruction. The Iraqis need a stable income stream to \nrestore economic stability and help pay for reconstruction and security \nso we must get oil production back above prewar levels.\n  I also believe that our worldwide troop deployment must reflect our \npriorities in the fight against terrorism. Senator Kerry's amendment \ncreates an over-the-horizon troop presence in case we need to deal with \nother terrorist issues or regional security issues. With the reduction \nof troops in Iraq we will be able to redeploy certain troops to other \nkey areas, such as Afghanistan. And we will also be able to bring our \nNational Guard and Reserves home to prevent another terrorist attack on \nour soil and to help during natural disasters.\n  Let me conclude by saying that there are those who want to politicize \nthe war to present the American people with a false choice--either stay \nthe course by keeping our troops in Iraq or empower the terrorists by \ncutting and running. I would ask all of you not to fall into the trap \nof this false choice or simplistic solutions.\n  Let me be clear, this amendment is not a simplistic choice to leave \nIraq today and to let it fall into the hands of the terrorists.\n  With this amendment, we will begin to fulfill the transition the \nSenate voted for and the Iraqis have said they intend to pursue.\n  With this amendment, we are voting to leave sufficient troops in Iraq \nat the end of that year to fight counterterrorism, to finish training \nIraqi forces, and to protect our people and our embassy.\n  With this amendment, we are voting to put troops over-the horizon in \ncase of other terrorist activity or regional conflict.\n  With this amendment, we are voting to create regional stability and \nget the international community to the table.\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\n  With this amendment, we are voting to get our National Guard home to \nkeep us safe and secure in our cities and towns.\n  With this amendment, we are voting to finish the job in Afghanistan.\n  With this amendment, we are changing the course of events in Iraq--a \nchange of course that will still meet our objectives, save American \nlives, and ensure our ability to both protect our people at home and \nmeet the other challenges we have as a nation.\n  Let us remember that this was a war of choice, not a war of \nnecessity.\n  Let us remember what this administration has told us about this war.\n  Let us remember the unfound weapons of mass destruction; remember the \nmissing mobile weapons labs; remember the yellow-cake uranium in \nAfrica; remember Saddam's nonexistent vast stockpiles of chemical \nweapons; remember when Secretary Rumsfeld told us that, ``We know where \nthe WMDs are;'' remember the non-existent link between al-Qaida and \nSaddam; remember the claims that Iraqi oil and other countries, not the \nU.S. taxpayer, would pay for the cost of reconstruction; remember when \nthe administration told us that the war would cost somewhere between \n$50 and $60 billion; remember when Paul Wolfowitz said that ``it seems \noutlandish'' to think that we would need several hundred thousand \ntroops in Iraq; and let us remember when President Bush told us on May \n1, 2003 that ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended'' while he \nstood in front of a sign that said ``mission accomplished.''\n  Let us remember the lies.\n  So I ask: Are we willing to continue to sacrifice the lives of young \nAmericans so that this same administration can stay the course, a \ncourse without direction, for a cause that President Bush has already \nsaid that he will abandon to the next president? I hope not.\n  I will say again, do not fall into the political trap and rhetoric \nfrom those who will try to mischaracterize this amendment.\n  I voted against the Iraq war when many on the other side tried to \nfalsely characterize those of us who didn't believe the evidence that \nthe administration presented, who thought we should work through the \ninternational process, who didn't believe the administration had done \nany postwar planning. For standing up for what we believed in, they \ntried to mischaracterize us as anti-American and unpatriotic. I was \nwilling to take a difficult stand, and stand up for what I believed was \nright for the country and for the people of New Jersey. That is why I \nvoted against the war.\n  Today, with over 2,500 lives lost, almost $320 billion spent in \nnational treasure, with $8 billion used each month, I know I made the \nright decision.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to act now, to enact a policy worthy of \nthe sacrifice of our soldiers.\n  And that is why I am voting for the Kerry and Levin amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for a \nreally excellent summary and a terrific statement about what this is \nabout and what is at stake. I thank him also for in the short time he \nhas been here he has really proven to be indispensable for a number of \ndifferent debates we have had and for his work in the last few days on \nno amnesty for those who have killed Americans. It had a major impact \non our policy. We thank him so much for that contribution.\n  Mr. President, I think one of the important things that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey just said is let us remember what this amendment is \nreally about.\n  I have sat here and listened to this nondebate for a little while. \nWhen Senators used to be able to question each other, we used to be \nable to have a dialog on the floor. It seems to me that is the best way \nto test each other's thinking.\n  What is interesting to me is that a number of Senators came to the \nfloor to make these grand pronouncements about our country, about war \non terror, about our troops. And none of us in the U.S. Senate would \ndisagree that our troops are the best troops in the world and that they \nhave made an extraordinary sacrifice. None of us would disagree. We are \na great country and a great democracy. None of us disagree that we \ndon't need to fight against terrorists to win the war on terror. That \nis not the issue.\n  A lot of other people are getting tired of that sort of game, of \ntrying to characterize things as they aren't.\n  The Senator from South Dakota said that we shouldn't telegraph to the \nenemy and to the terrorists. Of course, we shouldn't telegraph to the \nenemy and terrorists. What are we telegraphing? We are there. They know \nit. They are killing our soldiers to some degree but lesser than the \ninsurgency today.\n  The point that people need to really focus on is the fact that what \nhas happened in Iraq is not what was originally billed. This is the \nthird war. It is a different war from the war we went into.\n  The war that the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, described was \nthe war against Saddam Hussein as an enforcement mechanism of weapons \nof mass destruction. And they weren't there. There is a whole history \nof that being about a war of choice as opposed to a war of necessity.\n  That then transitioned because Zarqawi and company and a bunch of \nforeigners were attracted by the fact that we were there. We made a \ngreat target. So they started to use that target. And, indeed, it \nbecame a haven for some terrorists.\n  But every single analyst who I have talked to--and I know the \nchairman knows this--says that there are about 1,000 or less of the \nforeign terrorists in Iraq. Ninety-eight percent of what is happening \nin Iraq today is Iraqi on Iraqi.\n  When they come to the floor and say to us we are going to telegraph \nsomething to the terrorists, who are we telegraphing something to? The \nShias who hate Sunnis, the Sunnis who hate Shias who are killing each \nother?\n  What are our troops supposed to be about? Drive down the street and \nfind an IED and get blown up? Wait for a suicide bomber to come into an \noutpost and kill them?\n  The bottom line is that either the Iraqis are going to resolve the \ndifferences between Iraqis or we are going to see people dying for a \nlong, long time.\n  When we talk about the war on terror, let's talk about the real war \non terror which never was in Iraq. Yes, it is now part of the war on \nterror. It has been made part of the war on terror because foreign \nterrorists have been attracted there because the American target is \nthere and because they know they can feed into the sectarian violence \nand use it against us.\n  What is smart if you are going to try to deal with that? How do you \nwin? Do you think I want to win any less than the Senator from Alabama \nor the Senator from Georgia? I believe in winning. I believe in winning \nfor America and I believe in winning for our troops, and I don't think \nthis is a winning strategy. It is not a winning strategy in Iraq, and \nit is not a winning strategy in the war on terror.\n  All you have to do is look at al-Qaida and what they are doing in 60 \nto 80 countries around the world. Look at what happened in Somalia the \nother day? Are we dealing with that? Are we dealing with Darfur? Are we \ndealing with North Korea? It took us until this year to sit down with \nour own allies, Great Britain, Germany and France, and actually try to \ndo the diplomatic work of dealing with Iran.\n  For 3\\1/5\\ years we sat on the sidelines and allowed Iran to become \nmore of a problem.\n  Is that winning the war on terror?\n  What about the 60 percent of the kids in Saudi Arabia and Egypt and \nJordan and other countries that are under the age of 25, 50 percent \nunder the age of 18, 40 percent under the age of 14, and the unemployed \nand uneducated and unemployable? They are going to go down to madrasas \nand learn how to hate people while the United States remains a big, fat \ntarget in the Middle East.\n  Ask our foreign policy experts. I don't know whether it was Foreign \nAffairs or another magazine, but one of them did that just the other \nday.\n  Eighty-seven percent of the people, when asked, said we are less safe \ntoday in the war on terror than we were; 87 percent of the experts of \nthe United States, including people like General Brent Scowcroft and \nothers who I know the chairman has great respect for.\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\n  This is not a question of whether we want to beat terrorists. This is \na question of whether we are doing it the right way and whether we know \nhow to do this right.\n  Show me in this resolution, in this amendment, where it says all \ntroops out in 1 year. It doesn't. A lot of people are upset at that. \nThey think it ought to, but it doesn't. Show me where it says we are \nfinished altogether, and we are walking away from Iraq. It does not say \nit.\n  It says we are going to leave sufficient people there to finish the \ntraining, to go after al-Qaida, over the horizon to have the capacity \nto be able to protect our interests in the region, and it says we will \nprotect American facilities.\n  This is not cut and run. This is a smart way to win the war on \nterror. Our own generals--and I know the chairman has heard it; I know \nothers have heard it--know that they believe our presence is \ncontributing to the problems. It contributes to the sense of \noccupation. It contributes to the--whether it is Abu Ghraib or \nGuantanamo Bay or Haditha, those all contribute to the recruitment of \nterrorists against the United States.\n  Our intelligence people will tell every Member of the Senate that \ncurrently there are al-Qaida-trained operatives leaving Iraq, trained \nin munitions, trained in IEDs, going to Europe and elsewhere in order \nto wreak the havoc of the future.\n  We are not doing the job. We are not doing the job correctly. Let's \nhave a real debate, not a false debate, about something this resolution \nis not.\n  Moreover, in listening to my colleagues, one of them talked about \nwhat his vote meant and the vote he casts to hold Saddam Hussein \naccountable. I remember what my vote was. I remember what I said in the \nSenate when I voted. I voted reluctantly based on what Colin Powell, \nSecretary of State, and others said they were going to do: Exhaust the \nremedies of inspections at the United Nations, not cut them short; go \nto war as a last resort, not as a rush; do the adequate planning, not \nignore the State Department plan for what you do to win the peace.\n  I hear colleagues come to the Senate and say: We shouldn't tell this \nadministration what to do. Their record demands that we tell them what \nto do. Congress helped get us into this mess, and Congress ought to \nhelp get us out of it. We are partly responsible.\n  I have heard my colleagues talk about troops they talk to. We all \ntalk to troops. We have all talked to families. I will be honest about \nit, I hear both things. I hear troops whose families have said to me: \nMake sure my son or daughter did not die in vain. I agree with what the \nSenator from Wisconsin said earlier about that. I think anyone who \nserves their country at the call of the Nation never dies in vain.\n  I have heard troops who have come back and said to me: We are making \nprogress. We ought to be doing more of this, more of that, more of the \nPRTs, more of a number of different other projects. But I have also met \na lot of troops who are coming back who believe they do not know what \nthe mission is; they think the war is wrong and they think a lot of the \ntroops just want to come home. That is where they are. It is a mixture.\n  Our question, our judgment, is to try to see through that, try to be \nintelligent and genuine in trying to work out what is the best policy. \nI have come to the conclusion that the reason for setting a date--I was \nnot there 2 years ago. Why wasn't I there 2 years ago? Because 2 years \nago we didn't have all the elections, we did not have a referendum, we \ndid not have the Constitution, we did not have an elected government, \nwe had not made some of the progress, and we had not transitioned to a \ncivil sectarian struggle. We then still saw things as fundamentally \nforeign jihadists. Because of all the mistakes that have been made, \nthat transition is now a matter of history.\n  I believe deeply, based on what I am hearing from military personnel, \nbased on what I see personally, and based on my own experience where I \nfought with foreigners in another country, where we were trying to \nstand them up and get them to go out and do the job, that as long as we \nare there and prepared to do the job for them, they won't do it \nadequately. You have to push people out into that kind of situation.\n  The bottom line, can we do it the way we are muddling along? \nPossibly. I heard a couple of colleagues come to the Senate and say \nthere were some who have decided that this is lost and we just have to \ngo. I haven't. I believe there are ways, hopefully, to pull something \ntogether that has a sufficiently stable government that we can go \nforward to the other issues of the Middle East.\n  I will tell you this, and this I know for certain: If we make this \nsuccessful muddling along, as we are doing now, it is going to cost us \nmore lives, more limbs, and more dollars than if we did what is in this \nplan. That I know to a certainty. I also know to a certainty that \nunless we are prepared to do the diplomacy necessary, we cannot resolve \nthe fundamental underpinnings of this insurgency.\n  I talked to General Zinni the other day to ask his advice. He doesn't \nagree with me setting a date, so I will be upfront about that, but he \ncertainly cited unbelievable dismay at the lack of adequacy of \nconsultation in the region, at the lack of effort to put together a \nregional security arrangement, at the lack of diplomacy that is trying \nto resolve the fundamental differences and work bilaterally in an \nintensive way to pull people to the table to try to deal with this.\n  One thing I know, when you have a 20-percent minority Sunni \npopulation who for 200 years has run the country and now suddenly they \nare not, but some of them are still committed to doing it, if you do \nnot give them a sufficient stake, you are not going to resolve this \nproblem. And, at the same time, you have the Shias who are 60 percent \nof the population who for 200 years have been oppressed by this 20 \npercent minority, and they won at the ballot box because we gave them \nat the ballot box the opportunity to have power, and they want to hold \non to it. That is natural.\n  But if they want to go the full distance of what they want to do, we \nhave a serious long-term problem. That is what we are supposed to \nresolve in the next few months.\n  The Senator from Delaware is absolutely correct in his description of \nthe tensions that have to be resolved. I disagree with the Senator with \nrespect to the question of whether there is a plan. This amendment is a \nplan. It is a plan for standing up the Iraqis. It is a plan for \ncreating accountability. It is a plan for shifting responsibility to \nthe Iraqi Government to bolster their sovereignty and empower the \nGovernment in the eyes of the Iraqi people. It is a plan for how to \nbegin to redeploy troops to protect our interests in the region at the \nsame time as you stand up their military. And, most importantly, it is \na plan for what you do with the Arab League, with the Secretary General \nof the United Nations, with the neighbors and with the factions in Iraq \nin order to resolve the fundamental differences. It specifically \nrequires reaching a comprehensive political agreement for Iraq that \nengenders the support of Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds and ensures equitable \ndistribution of oil, strengthens the internal security, disbans \nmilitias, revives reconstruction efforts, fulfills related \ninternational economic aid commitments, secures Iraq's borders, and \nprovides for a sustainable Federalist structure in Iraq.\n\n  That is a plan. And the only way to arrive at any plan, whether it is \nthe Senator from Delaware or anyone else, is to pull the parties \ntogether and do the diplomacy necessary. Never in the 21 years I have \nbeen here have I seen as significant an issue of war and peace, life \nand death, as significant an absence of fundamental diplomacy as there \nis here. Never. It does not come close to the efforts of other \ngenerations.\n  There is 200 years of American history being turned topsy-turvy. It \nis hurting us on the war on terror. When September 11 happened, the \nwhole world was with us--the whole world. Newspaper headlines said: We \nare all Americans now. That was the atmosphere after September 11. And \nthe whole world understood why we had to go to Afghanistan. And every \nsingle one of us voted for that, understood it, and supported it.\n  But Iraq is different. Iraq had nothing to do with Afghanistan at the \ntime, nothing to do with September 11, and everyone knows it.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n  So why are we here talking about requiring this administration to do \nsomething? Why don't you think about the history. When they could have \ndemanded and relied on accurate information instead of manipulated \nintelligence, they made a willful choice not to do that. They were \nwrong. Instead, they sacrificed American credibility at home and \nabroad. The result of that is the ``We are all Americans now'' was \nsquandered. It disappeared.\n  Ask any American citizen who travels abroad now how comfortable they \nfeel as they travel. Ask any American businessman what happens to them \nwhen they travel in other parts of the world.\n  When this administration could have given the inspectors additional \ntime to discover whether Saddam Hussein actually had weapons of mass \ndestruction, when they could have taken time to exhaust the patience of \nour own allies and hold them accountable to the U.N. resolutions, \ninstead they just broke off and said, OK, you go your way, we will go \nours, and they exposed America to greater cost and greater sacrifice.\n  When they could have paid attention to Ambassador Wilson's report, \nthey chose not to. And they were wrong. Instead, they attacked him and \nthey attacked his wife to justify attacking Iraq.\n  But the mistakes were not limited to that decision to invade. They \nmounted, one upon the other. When they could have listened to General \nShinseki and put in enough troops to maintain order, they chose not to. \nWhen they could have listened to Larry Lindsey and others who said it \nis going to cost $200 billion, they not only chose not to listen, they \nfired him. They were wrong.\n  When they could have learned from George Herbert Walker Bush, Jim \nBaker and General Scowcroft and built a genuine world coalition, they \nchose not to. And they were wrong.\n  When they could have implemented a detailed State Department plan for \nreconstructing post-Saddam Iraq, they chose not to. And they were \nwrong.\n  When they could have protected American forces by guarding Saddam \nHussein's ammo dumps where there were weapons of individual \ndestruction, they exposed our young men and women to the ammo that now \nmaims and kills them because they chose not to act. And they were \nwrong.\n  When they could have imposed immediate order and structure in Baghdad \nafter the fall of Saddam Hussein, Secretary Rumsfeld shrugged his \nshoulders and said, ``Baghdad was safer than Washington, DC,'' and he \nchose not to act, he was wrong.\n  When the administration could have kept an Iraqi Army selectively \nintact, they chose not to. And they were wrong.\n  When they could have kept an entire civil structure functioning to \ndeliver basic services to Iraqi citizens, guess what. They chose not \nto. And they were wrong, and we are paying the price today.\n  They could have accepted the offers of the United Nations and \nindividual countries to provide on-the-ground peacekeepers and \nreconstruction. Guess what. In their arrogance about doing it alone, \nthey chose not to, and so we are alone. They were wrong.\n\n  When they should have leveled with the American people that the \ninsurgency had grown, they chose not to. Vice President Cheney even \nabsurdly claimed that the insurgency was in its last throes, and he \nrepeated that again just a few days ago. He was wrong.\n  Now, after all these mistakes, the administration likes to accuse \nanyone who proposes a better course of wanting to cut and run. Well, \nMr. President, we are in trouble today because of the policy of cut-\nand-run--cutting and running from common sense, cutting and running \nfrom history, cutting and running from cultural realities, cutting and \nrunning from the truth, cutting and running from the best advice of our \nmilitary. And we are paying a huge price for that today.\n  Mr. President, every single one of us is determined to win the war on \nterror. But we have to ask ourselves some tough questions about where \nwe find ourselves today. I wonder, as we are told by a lot of people \nthat--I think the President, just yesterday or the day before, said it \nwas important to have Members of the U.S. Congress who will not wave \nthe white flag of surrender in the war on terror.\n  I think the President of the United States ought to stop acting as \n``Campaigner in Chief'' and start being Commander in Chief and start \nbringing the Congress together and the Nation together around a real \npolicy.\n  I don't know anybody waving a white flag. We are debating whether or \nnot there is a better way to win the war on terror.\n  I respectfully say to my colleagues, if we don't begin to pay \nattention, instead of over $2 billion every couple of days--every 2 \ndays, I think; it is about $8 billion a week; 8 billion bucks a week--\ninstead of $8 billion a week going to Iraq, we could be investing and \nworking on a greater Middle Eastern initiative, working on economic \ndevelopment, working on schools, working on children's issues, working \non a future with respect to future terrorists.\n  The fact is, we are not going to succeed at this if all we do is go \nout there and alienate people. I have heard from soldiers over the last \nweekend. I was with three medics who have came back, and they are all \nagainst the war, those three medics. They are out there in America \nright now talking to people about why they are against the war. They \nsaid: When you go into a house at night, and you are holding guns, and \nyou are scaring people in that house, and you leave that house, they \ndon't like you. You are not winning their hearts and minds.\n  I cannot tell you how familiar that is to the same experience we saw \nand went through years ago in hamlets throughout Southeast Asia. It \njust does not work the way they are doing it.\n  We could ask the question, legitimately: How many lives have been \nlost because of the ineptitude of this strategy? How many lives have \nbeen lost? And how many people have been maimed and wounded because we \ndid not provide the body armor to our troops? You want to talk about \npatriotism? How many troops were killed or wounded by the shells and \nthe weapons that came from the ammo dumps that we were not smart enough \nto protect? How many lives have been lost and how many limbs have been \namputated because there were not enough troops in the beginning in \norder to provide people with the support and safety and the control of \nthe country? How much bigger and more dangerous is al-Qaida today \nbecause we outsourced the job of capturing him at Tora Bora to Afghans \ninstead of using the First Marines or the 10th Mountain Division or \neven the SEALs who were there?\n  We are where we are today in this war on terror because of \nmisjudgments. And I believe those misjudgments continue.\n  How many times have we heard that we are turning the corner or that \nthis is a moment of turning the corner, and yet momentum was lost? \nMomentum was lost after the elections. Momentum was lost after the \npassage of the Constitution. Momentum was lost in the last months while \nwe waited and waited and waited for Iraqi politicians to stop playing \naround and form a government.\n  I do not think our soldiers deserve that interim period, personally. \nAnd the question now is, how do you best protect our troops? How do you \nbest secure our objectives? How do you best deal with the problem of an \nIraq where Iraqis need to defend their own rights and interests?\n  Americans cannot do it for them. Yes, we can provide backup. Yes, we \ncan provide insurance against a total implosion. Yes, we can provide \nsecurity with respect to the efforts to go after al-Qaida. And our \namendment contemplates all of that. But it also contemplates a \ntransition based on experience.\n  The Iraqis needed a deadline for the transfer of authority to the \nProvisional Government. The Iraqis needed a deadline for the \nConstitution. They needed a deadline for their elections. They needed a \ndeadline for their own formation of a government. They even have a \nself-imposed deadline for the transition of the Constitution in \nthese next months.\n\n  Why then, when the Iraqis themselves are saying they can take over \ntheir security, when the Iraqi Government itself says withdrawing \nAmerican troops would be helpful, would we not coordinate with the \nIraqi Government a drawdown that makes it clear that we are standing \nthem up?\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\n  Now, speaking of the stand-up, I thought the policy of our \nGovernment--how many times have we heard it from the President: ``As \nthey stand up, we will stand down.'' He announced that in a speech to \nthe American people. He has announced it in press conferences.\n  Well, here we are. In the trips I made to Iraq, General Petraeus, and \nhis now successor, showed us charts that indicated 272,000 was the goal \nto train and equip. We are now at 264,600. That is as of June 14, 2006. \nThe goal was 272,000.\n  Now, I think they moved the goal out to 325,000. But notwithstanding, \nhow many have stood down? If the goal is to stand down as they stand \nup, and we have stood up 264,000--incidentally, in addition to the \n264,000, there are 144,000 facilities protection service personnel \nworking in 27 ministries. So you have a total of almost 400,000 Iraqis \ntrained and equipped. And where is the stand-down?\n  I believe it is essential to accelerate this transition. That is the \nonly way to reduce the targeting of our troops. It is the only way to \ninvest other countries in the reality that the United States will not \nalways be there, and they need to take a stake in their own region.\n  Right now, because of the way they feel about this administration, \nand because we are simply there ``staying the course,'' they have no \ncompulsion whatsoever to come to the table. The only way you are going \nto bring them to the table, in my judgment, is to change that equation.\n  So we have a very significant, broad-based plan for an international \ndiplomatic effort, beginning with bilateral, and working up, \nultimately, through the bilateral to a summit that we know can be \nsuccessful. That is the way in which we will invest in a new security \narrangement for the region and protect the United States of America's \nlong-term interests more effectively.\n  Mr. President, I see that another colleague has come and would like \nto speak now. I just close by saying that----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator closes, I would like to \nsay a word or two with him.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be delighted to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. You finish your closing and I will wait.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to do so. I thank the distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. President, I heard the Senator from South Dakota say that there \nare occasions when a generation faces a struggle between good and evil. \nI agree with that. There is good and there is evil in this world. And \nwhat radical fascist extremists are doing in the name of religion is \nevil. I know as well as anybody here in the Senate that we have to \nstand up to that. But we have to stand up to it in the best traditions \nand values of our country. We have to stand up to it in a way that \nbrings people to our side and does not alienate them.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that after these several years, where we \nstarted with ``we are all Americans'' post-9/11, and the world was at \nour side, that we have now seen radical, extreme terrorists isolate the \nUnited States of America in that particular part of the world. That is \na failure of policy. And it is a failure that makes the United States \nof America less secure, not more.\n  Some people have said: Well, if you tell the terrorists that we are \nleaving in a few days--whatever period of time--I remind them, we are \nnot leaving altogether. We are going to leave our special forces \npersonnel who are capable of taking out the terrorists.\n  But the bottom line is that they are not waiting for anything today. \nWe just lost two troops in the most brutal, horrible manner. They are \nnot waiting now. And the fact is that unless we get Iraqis to resolve \nthose issues I talked about, this will continue or even get worse.\n  So ignoring all the warnings of history itself, in a moment of total \nideological excess, this administration has managed to make the ancient \ncradle of civilization look a lot like Vietnam.\n  I think there is a path forward. I think there is a better way to \nsecure our interests. There is a better way to fight the war on terror. \nThere is a better way to stand up to Iraq. There is a better way to \nrespect their sovereignty. There is a better way to protect our troops.\n  I hope the U.S. Senate will look carefully at that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I would say this has been a good \ndebate. Say what you want. I listened very carefully to what you said, \nand there are certain elements with which I agree with you. You and I \nhave known each other a long time. I have great respect for your \nmilitary career, the accomplishments you have had. I think you often \nshared that with regard to my modest career.\n  But I must say, I kind of bit my tongue here a few minutes ago when \nyou said in our old days we used to have a colloquy and talked. I \narrived on the floor of this Senate at around 9:30, when I first got \nhere. It is exactly 12 hours now that I have been on this floor. And \nthe first thing I said--and I don't want to personalize this--to the \nother side of the aisle was: Now, let's try to engage in a colloquy and \nexchange some views. I did say that since we were under a time \nconstraint my questions would be charged to me, the replies from the \nother side charged to your side. It seemed to me fair enough. We had 5 \nhours before us at that time. But I have to tell you, I was flatly \nturned down.\n\n  So now, after 12 hours and your invitation to enter into a colloquy, \nI say to my good friend, you can ask me any question you wish. And I \nmight start off with a question or two for you.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. President, let me just say to the distinguished chairman, I don't \nhave a question for him because he has not said anything outrageous.\n  Mr. WARNER. Beg your pardon?\n  Mr. KERRY. I said, the Senator from Virginia has not said anything \noutrageous that begs a question at this point.\n  But I will say this: I do understand the difficulties that the \nmanager was under.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, that is history. We are here now. Why don't we make \nthe best of it?\n  Mr. KERRY. I know. But he had wanted more than 5 hours, as you know. \nWe are where we are.\n  Mr. WARNER. We are here now.\n  Mr. KERRY. And I think he had more speakers than he was able to fit \nin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, I must say, I shared that on this side, but I was \nwilling to take the heat.\n  Mr. KERRY. But I would be delighted to answer any questions.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. We have the opportunity, Senator. Is there \nanything you wish to ask of me? And I will ask a few of you.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator not agree with me that the fundamental \ncrisis of Iraq today is not particularly with Zarqawi having been \nkilled and the treasure-trove of information we found--which, \nincidentally, happened because Iraqis gave Iraqis information and F-16s \nfrom outside came in and took him out. So there was an Iraqi component \nof that, which can still function with the setup that we are setting \nforward. But wouldn't the Senator agree, Mr. President, that the \nfundamental problem today is that 98 percent of the insurgency is Shia-\nSunni, Sunni-Shia sectarian violence, militias within the military?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I don't know what that fraction is. But in \ndiscussions with senior military, clearly, they have said the \ninsurgents, the foreign invaders, the others who have come in have \ndropped in terms of--somewhat--numbers of incidents. And, indeed, the \nsectarian violence--Sunni versus Shia, Kurds to some extent--has grown \nenormously. So I cannot qualify it. But the Senator is correct.\n  And that leads me to my first question, because----\n  Mr. KERRY. Can I just finish the question?\n  Would the Senator then not agree that there are serious limits on \nwhat our troops can do to resolve sectarian violence?\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, that remains to be seen. They are, right now, for \nexample, in Baghdad, fighting side by side. A very significant number \nof Iraqi troops, together with the components of our troops, are trying \nto bring about a greater measure of stability and security in the very \ncapital of this country.\n  I think we should make known to those following the debate and those \nwho listened to the debate with Senator Levin, Senator Levin's \namendment was a sense of the Congress. The amendment of our colleague \nfrom Massachusetts very explicitly becomes law,\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nif it were adopted and eventually went into the bill and the bill \nsurvived the conference.\n  The point I wish to make is, you are directing the President. For \nexample, it says: The President shall redeploy, commencing in 2006, \nthis year, United States forces from Iraq by July 1, 2007. So this is \nlaw. As we used to say in the old days, we are shooting real bullets \nwith this one, not just a sense of the Congress.\n  Throughout the debate, not only this one in the past day or two on \nthis bill, but we have always, certainly, on this side, resisted \ntimetables. You talk about putting together a summit. That is on page \n2, section (b), Iraq Summit: The President should work with the leaders \nof the Government of Iraq to convene a summit as soon as possible that \nincludes those leaders, leaders of the governments of each of the \ncountries bordering Iraq, representatives of the Arab League, the \nSecretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--I think \nthat is important to have NATO in there--representatives of the \nEuropean Union, and leaders of the governments of each permanent member \nof the United Nations Security Council, for the purpose of reaching a \ncomprehensive political agreement for Iraq that engenders the support \nof the Sunnis, the Shias, and the Kurds by ensuring the equitable \ndistribution of oil revenues--that is a very important point you make, \ndisbanding the militias--another very important point, strengthening \ninternal security, reviving reconstruction efforts and fulfilling \nrelated international economic aid commitments, securing Iraq's \nborders, and providing for a sustainable federalist structure in Iraq.\n  Those are all important subjects, commendable goals. But first let's \ngo back. It has taken the Iraqis 18 months since the first election in \nearly 2005, through three elections, through the formation of the first \npermanent government. And the first permanent government is just, as \nyou and I as old sailors would say, getting its sea legs. You start a \nconference like this--and I think it is a good idea--but the first \nquestion that is going to be asked is, can we proceed to achieve any of \nthese goals if we have overhanging this the redeployment of our forces \nby July 1, 2007?\n  Senator, that is a timetable. That is a concept which I and I think \nthe majority in this Chamber have continuously rejected. How could you \nask the other nations of the world to come in and begin to put their \ncredit on the line, their dollars on the line, if you have this \ntimetable to pull out the very foundation that is supporting such \nprogress as has been achieved in the 18 months of getting the first \ngovernment up and testing their sea legs?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is a wonderful question and a very \nappropriate one. I really appreciate it. It gives me a chance to talk \nabout the viability of this. First of all, may I remind the \ndistinguished chairman what I just said a moment ago. We are at \n264,000. We have 144,000 more. That is 400,000 people prepared to go. \nThey are in the streets now. We have 1 year to continue to work with \nthem. Prime Minister Maliki has said himself that by the end of this \nyear, in 16 out of 18 provinces they will be able to take over \nsecurity. This is contemplated within the framework that the Prime \nMinister himself has adopted. This respects their sovereignty. It \nrespects their capacity.\n  Secondly, in my conversations with leaders in the region, as recently \nas this year, ranging from the President of Egypt to the King of Jordan \nand others, what I gleaned from those conversations is, they are \nwaiting for a series of kind of diplomatic and business conference \nefforts that do get them invested and invest the whole region in an \nunderstanding that the United States is going to be leaving, and they \nneed to begin to accept that reality.\n  The longer we stay, the longer we delay their readiness and their \nneed--let alone willingness--to come to the table. I respectfully \nsuggest that it is within the framework of a year.\n  We did the Dayton Accords in less time. Milosevic did not want to \ncome to the table. President Clinton persuaded Yeltsin to create a \npressure point that brought people there. In effect, we made things \nhappen against people's will by creating the pressure. This is the same \nkind of situation.\n  I say respectfully to the Senator, we have a far better chance of \nspending less money, losing less lives and being more effective in the \nwar on terror if we pursue this than if we simply do what we are doing \ntoday.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it might be the case, but I would be \nwilling to make a modest wager with you that if you got this conference \nunder way, the first thing that they would ask would be to suspend this \ntimetable of July 1, 2007.\n  Mr. KERRY. And if that were the case, and they were prepared to come \nto the table to resolve these issues and be part of this process, then \nthe President could come back to us and we would respond accordingly. \nWe are not stupid. We want to act in the best interest of our country. \nThe question is, how do you begin to push people to a place where they \nrealize they have to confront these realities?\n  Secondly, the Senator's question makes a presumption that I just \nfundamentally disagree with and don't see in this amendment. That is if \nwe pull out the foundation, I think the Senator said, we specifically \nsay we arrive at a schedule coordinated with the Government of Iraq, \nleaving only the minimal number of forces that are critical to \ncompleting the mission of standing up Iraqi forces.\n  I have asked the Senator from Virginia, what are we there for? What \nare we there to do? We are there to fight al-Qaida. We allow for that. \nWe are there to stand up Iraqis for themselves. We allow that. And we \nare certainly there to protect American facilities. So what is it that \nis absent from here that would somehow pull out the foundation from \nanything?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, I cannot see, for example, the \ngovernments of each country bordering Iraq suddenly beginning to rush \nin if they feel that a civil war could start. The pulling out of the \ntroops, the setting of a timetable will be a signal to all of the \nvarious factions. I will concede it is the Shia against the Sunnis that \nis the major faction. Wait them out. Let's let the troops flow out and \nthen we will topple this government with a civil war.\n  It seems to me, I say to my colleague, you cannot expect these \nnations that border Iraq, the Arab League, I can't see that they would \nstep up and say, we are willing to do everything. But wait a minute, \ncoalition forces----\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to the Senator, I know he doesn't want American \ntroops in the middle of a civil war. I know he doesn't think that that \nis why we sent our troops there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share that concern, but----\n  Mr. KERRY. That is where they are.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the presence of our troops today that is probably \nholding it back from becoming a civil war.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I say respectfully, we will continue to \nbe able to do that. Over the course of the next year, with over-the-\nhorizon capacity and with our ability to move in an emergency, we are \nnot going away. We have plenty of troops in Kuwait. We could have \nplenty of troops over the horizon. That is not going to fall apart. The \nproblem is that the tasks that the Senator is referring to, each of \nthem are civilian tasks. They are political tasks. You don't need \n138,000 American troops as targets to complete those tasks when you \nhave 400,000 Iraqis allegedly trained and equipped and prepared to \ndefend their country.\n  Let me ask the Senator: Did Iraq or did it not fight Iran for 10 \nyears within the last 25 years?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remember well that conflict because I \nwas then on the Intelligence Committee.\n  Mr. KERRY. And they lost a million people fighting for almost 10 \nyears for their country. These are the same people. Four years later we \nare still driving trucks down the street and our guys are taking IEDs. \nAre you telling me that they don't have people who can drive a truck? \nThey don't have people to go out on patrol? Why aren't our people \ngarrisoned and being held in reserve in case there is an implosion? \nWhat are we doing with our troops being the ones that have to go out? I \ndon't get it. I believe there is a better way to wage this effort. That \nis what this amendment contemplates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we just disagree. I feel this government \nhasn't\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nbeen given a chance. It has only been 6 weeks. It took 18 months to get \nto where they are today. If we were to enact this into law, presumably \nthe authorization bill would be signed by the President--there is a \nquestion whether if this is in there, he would sign it--this would go \ninto law in a matter of a few months. And then suddenly to try and call \non the rest of the world--and by the way, I certainly did not see the \nEuropean Union trying to help form the coalition forces. Of each \npermanent member of the Security Council, the only one, Great Britain, \nstepped forward. I don't see those countries suddenly coming in and \nmaking the types of commitments that this paragraph requires, if we are \ngoing to pull out the very stability that is holding together this \nfragile government and preventing a civil war today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is a legitimate question and it \ndeserves, obviously, an answer.\n  Those countries, many of them, are reluctant to become engaged with \nthe United States as long as they see us on the status quo path, \nbecause they see the same series of mistakes that I have just cited. If \nyou talk to them, they will tell you, they don't have confidence that \nthis administration is going to get it right or move in the right \ndirection. That is why I believe you have to come in and lay out a \npath.\n  In my judgment, historically, most Presidents would not want the \nCongress telling them to do this. If I were President, I wouldn't want \nthem telling me to do this. But at the same time, I would hope that I \nhad consulted with Congress and not been as stubborn and not made the \nseries of mistakes they have so that you wind up having alienated the \nvery people you need to solve the problem. If you don't have some kind \nof regional security arrangement, the situation with Iran will grow \nmore serious.\n  Iran loves the fact that we are bogged down in Iraq. This just plays \nperfect for Iran. And Iran has a much stronger lever over us with \nrespect to its current nuclear path because they know they could wreak \nhavoc with what is happening on the ground in Iraq, and that restricts \nour choices and options.\n  We will be stronger in counterproliferation efforts, we will be \nstronger in our efforts against terrorism in the region, and we will be \nable to create the credibility to bring these other countries to the \ntable, which they are not willing to do today, if we make this kind of \ntransition. If they understand that we are acknowledging that our \npresence is a problem, they have to step up because they don't want \nregional chaos. I believe that is exactly what helps us get it done. \nThat is what changes the dynamics.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we have covered this point. We \nwill just have to agree to disagree.\n  I would draw your attention to the clause where you say consultation \nwith the Congress is required. Here we are, basically on the eve of the \nAugust recess which starts the first week in August. We come back here \nas a Congress for maybe 30 days or 5 weeks in September. Then leave \nagain for elections. You say:\n\n       The President shall consult with the Congress regarding the \n     schedule for redeployment and shall submit such schedule to \n     Congress as part of the report required . . .\n\n  You know, we know how this institution works. We have been here for \ntwo decades apiece. I say, if the President were to devise a \nredeployment schedule to meet 2007, when do you think the Congress \nmight swing into action and take such responsibility, as implied here, \nthrough the consultation process? I presume Congress could take an \naction to stop it. You are talking about July 1, and I don't see the \nCongress acting on such a proposal in a timely manner.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, if that is all that gets in the way of this, Mr. \nPresident, I am confident we can find expediting language or other \nlanguage that would resolve it.\n  But I will tell you, Congress is going to be dealing with this issue \nnext year at this time if we don't change this policy. Like it or not, \nwe are going to be here debating it one way or the other.\n  Mr. WARNER. That may be true, but I will ask another question. Drop \ndown to paragraph 3, ``maintenance of over-the-horizon troop \npresence.'' ``The President should maintain an over-the-horizon troop \npresence to prosecute the war on terror and protect regional security \ninterests.''\n  Where would those troops, in all likelihood, be put?\n  Mr. KERRY. Most likely in Kuwait, Qatar, the Gulf States, if you work \nout a security arrangement.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would require a substantial amount of installations \nto be constructed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we already have--as the Senator knows, we \nhave been there and there are a number of pretty substantial facilities \nalready in Kuwait, and there are others regionally, in my judgment; and \nthat is the purpose of this arrangement, to prepare to work on an \naccommodation, providing it was in the context of a larger security \narrangement. What I have learned--and again, we all talk to people and \ntry to learn as much as we can.\n  General Zinni was saying to me the other day that he believes the \nGulf States are particularly interested in some kind of a regional \nsecurity arrangement because they are threatened by the instability and \nby the questions about Iran and the challenge to the oilfields and so \nforth. That is precisely the kind of issue that has to be arrived at, \ninitially bilaterally and ultimately through this international \nconference.\n  I know the Senator was willing to bet something a little while ago. I \nam not sure we should do that in the Senate, but I would certainly bet \nmy reputation that, one way or the other, we are going to be ultimately \nhaving to engage in this kind of multilateral diplomacy to resolve \nthese issues. The sooner we get about it, the better we will be in \nfighting this war on terror.\n  Mr. WARNER. I caution my colleague because that is saying to this new \nIraqi Government that you are going to fail.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, sir. About the regional security, I said we will need \nultimately to deal with the question of Iran, the oilfields, the \ninstability in the region. I think the greater Middle East is going to \nrequire this kind of focus and attention one way or the other.\n  As I said during the debate a moment ago, I am not somebody who \nsuggests that we cannot make this still work out somehow. I am not in \nthat school. But I do know that on the current path, it is going to \ncost more lives, more money, and it is going to cost us prolonged loss \nof relationship and reputation within the region and is going to set us \nback in terms of other interests we have. This can be done more \neffectively, and that is what I am here to argue for. How do we protect \nour security interests more effectively? How do we advance our safety \nand security in the world? How do we win the war on terror more \neffectively and stand Iraq up more effectively? I believe setting the \ndate accomplishes all of those things.\n  Mr. WARNER. You have to admit that July 1, 2007, is a timetable; am I \nnot correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes, for the beginning of the transition. But as it makes \nvery clear, if you get to 2 months before the end, or 3 months, and you \ncan see the progress being made, and there is another month or so that \na certain number of troops need to be stood up, or whatever, we allow \nthat--the ability of the President to make that determination. If it is \ndone in the best traditions of the Congress, it will be done with the \nconsultation of the various committees and the Congress itself. And \nthen you would have the kind of unity in the pursuit of this policy \nthat is absent today or we would not have had this debate for the last \nseveral days. I know the chairman believes this----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is operating on a premise that \nif this became law and the President issued a timetable, suddenly the \nlevel of violence would begin to be lowered considerably.\n  Mr. KERRY. No, sir, I am not making that presumption, Mr. President. \nI am saying that unless you resolve the fundamental political tension--\nthe Shia don't have oil revenues. They want a strong Iraq with a \ncentral government. The Shia are well taken care of. The Kurds are \nhappy in the north; they want to be left alone. They have oil revenues. \nSo you have Kirkut as a major issue you have to resolve ultimately. But \nyou have this fundamental tension between whether you are going\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nto have this federal loose-knit structure which the Shia want, with \ncertain individuals with strong designs on future political power in \nthat region, or whether you are going to have a manageable entity. That \nis why the former counsel for Foreign Relations and Senator Biden and \nothers have joined in this idea of partition. The only way you are \ngoing to get there--and I don't think it is a particularly viable \noption--is through this kind of international conference. If you don't \nultimately have a resolution by the parties politically, you are going \nto have a civil war. They have a few months under their own \nConstitution to try to resolve these things. That is going to be \nunavoidable.\n\n  I am not suggesting that the violence is going to suddenly vanish. \nThe question is, How are you ultimately going to take away the \nrationale for the folks who are engaging in it? As I said, there are \nfive different groups, and we are not dealing very effectively with it. \nYou have criminal activity, you have Baathists, you have insurgents, \nIraqi insurgents, and you have al-Qaida, and you have each of them that \nrequires a different approach. Our military is not the answer to any of \nthem, except al-Qaida. Al-Qaida, we can continue to prosecute with unit \n145 operations and other things, and we can make that happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if you say the violence is not going to \nstop if this became law, if this becomes law, we have to make a \nmovement in reduction in 2006. That is in there. There has to be a \ncommencement. You would not wait and send out a platoon on Christmas \nEve. You mean a significant drawdown, leaving only 6 months in the \nfollowing year to get the bulk of the forces out. And if we start \nmoving those troops, I tell you that will engender a higher level of \nviolence and lead possibly to a civil war.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree. We have a civil \nwar today, to begin with. We have a civil war today. People are being \nkilled in the dead of night, shackled in handcuffs, beheaded, found in \nbasements; kids are being hauled out of buses every day. The number of \nsectarian incidents is many times what it was just months ago, a year \nago, 2 years ago. Now, how are you going to resolve it?\n  I don't think there is any Member of the Senate who voted to send our \ntroops to be in the middle of a civil war. Our troops are there to \nbolster the Government. We are there to support that Government's \nability to make it on its own. How are they going to do that? By \nstanding up these 400,000 security people. The faster they understand \nthey have to go out and do it, the faster the violence is going to \nsubside. Either they make it or it ``ain't'' makeable because we cannot \nmake it for them. That is the bottom line that people have to \nunderstand.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague that I agree \nfundamentally with the premise that the Iraqi people, in the final \nanalysis, are the ones who are going to be able to bring about their \nown measure of democracy and enable this Government to exercise \nsovereignty.\n  Other Senators want to participate, so I will soon yield. I know both \nof us have had the opportunity to serve in the military. There is \nnothing more painful than the loss of a brother member of the service. \nI don't know about you, but it has been difficult for me today to \ncontain my absolute outrage about what happened, Mr. President, to \nthese two young soldiers who raised their right arms and volunteered \nfor this service in Iraq, to have been captured and brutally mauled and \nexecuted.\n\n  You know, I would say a rough calculation is that we probably have \nhad about a million and a quarter Americans--that is, our brave men and \nwomen in uniform and many civilians from the departments and agencies \nof our Government, including a number of American contractors--who have \ncontributed to where we are today in this new Government standing up \nand beginning to exercise the powers of sovereignty.\n  I say to my good friend, given that heavy investment, the risks taken \nby over a million and a quarter of our citizens, to send out a signal \nnow--and it is a timetable, Senator--that July 1, 2007, barely 12 \nmonths from now that we would probably have under your formula--I ran a \ncalculation--you are going to leave some behind for training and some \nfor logistics, but basically I would say the fighting forces are out. \nSome may be pre-positioned in other countries nearby. There is a clause \nin here requiring a report as to how soon they can come back to the \ncontinental limits of the United States. That is going to send a \nsignal, and that worries me, that all these people who made these risks \nand contributions are going to sit back and say, right at the threshold \nof really the first rays of hope to get this problem solved, we send \nthis type of signal.\n  What did you feel when we lost these two individuals? I know you felt \nit probably as badly as I did. I cannot understand why they could be \nsaying over there that, see what we did, we beheaded two, and what did \nthe Congress do? It passed this law that said our troops would be \nredeployed by July 1, 12 months from today.\n  Senator, timing in life is everything. The timing for this concept \nyou have has not arrived, I say to my good friend.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are few people in the Senate for whom \nI have more respect and affection than the Senator from Virginia. We \nhave known each other a long time, and we have traveled together. I am \ngrateful to him for the respect and consideration he has shown for this \ndebate this evening.\n  When I heard those two guys were captured, my heart sank because I \nimmediately envisioned the worst. The worst happened. I thought about \nthem throughout that time period, until they were found. I was not \nsurprised that they were brutalized in the most horrific, disgraceful \nway, and may I add--and I know the Senator knows this--in ways that \ncontravene every law of warfare. But I believe we have a better chance \nof honoring what they went there for and what all of our soldiers have \ndied for, given something for, if we adopt a policy of reality.\n  Mr. President, let me say to the Senator that I went to serve in \nVietnam in 1968. There was turmoil in this country. Remember the \nChicago convention, remember McCarthy, and Bobby Kennedy had been \nkilled in June. In fact, I arrived back in Long Beach, CA, at the dock \nafter the first deployment in the Gulf of Tonkin the night he was \nkilled. It was the first radio words we heard. I remember that turmoil \nover the war. I remember Richard Nixon running for President with a \nsecret plan for peace. I remember how people invested in the concept of \npeace. Years later, we read in Robert McNamara's book how he knew, as \nSecretary of Defense, while he was sending troops over there, that we \nweren't going to be successful. Now, from 1968 until 1975, when we left \nin that dramatic helicopter moment off the embassy, almost half of the \npeople who died were lost in that period of time--for a policy that our \nleaders knew wasn't working.\n  I am not going to be a Member of the Senate in good standing and in \ngood conscience and support a policy in Iraq that I believe is going to \nadd people to whatever Iraqi memorial will be created, at a time where \nI am convinced this isn't going to work for them and it is not going to \nwork for the Iraqis. I believe we have a moral responsibility to those \nsoldiers who died to do our best to get it right, and I just don't \nbelieve staying the course, more of the same, is getting it right.\n  If you don't resolve the differences between Shia and Sunni where 98 \npercent of this fight is taking place, we are stuck. And I believe it \nis only by pushing the process, by demanding something of everybody in \nthe region, by demanding something of the Iraqis who are in uniform \nthat we are going to properly defend the honor of those who served. We \ndefend it by getting it right.\n  And may I add, we also defend it by honoring those who come back. \nThere is a $6 billion shortfall in current services in our VA budget. \nThat is just unacceptable.\n  We have a big job to do. I look forward to working with the Senator \nto do it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will conclude. The Senator from \nMassachusetts and I have had this conversation about that period of \nhistory before. We will have it again and again. I recall, I went to \nthe Pentagon in February 1969 and was there for 5 years in the Navy \nSecretariat. As the Secretary of the\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\nNavy, the Senator always said I was his boss. He has been very \nrespectful about that.\n  I remember when his Silver Star came through our Secretariat at that \ntime. I went back and checked for accuracy, and it was accurate, I say \nto the Senator. He knows that, and I know that.\n  I thought many times about that period, and I recall that the then-\nSecretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, came to the conclusion that we had \nto begin a program of Vietnamization and begin to look toward bringing \nour troops home. I remember that, and the rest is history.\n  I share those concerns. I, like the Senator from Massachusetts, every \nday, particularly in my responsibility as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, worry about these men and women in uniform. Like \nthe Senator, I visit the hospitals, go to the funerals when it is \nappropriate for me to do so. I share that burden. I think most of our \ncolleagues do. I happen to know that our President shares those \nburdens.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator, my friend, there is a time for \neverything, and I feel ever so strongly that we have to give this new \ngovernment more time to try and exercise that sovereignty before we \ntake the very dramatic steps that the Senator from Massachusetts has \nset forth in this amendment, which I say not as a buzzword, but there \nis that timetable.\n  I do not think the other nations will come in. I do not think we \ncould bring to bear the resources elsewhere in the world in the \ntimetable that is laid down here.\n  There is one other point that we should consider, and that is we are \nthere with a coalition of forces. I see no mention--maybe I didn't read \nit carefully--but no mention of what would Great Britain think if we \nwere to take this somewhat unilateral action as the Senator proposes? \nWhat would Poland, what would the other nations think? They don't have \nthe measure of the troops of quantity and so forth, but they are there \nin spirit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, they are drawn down. There is a huge debate \nin Great Britain. They are prepared to draw down. They are ready.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I admire the courage of the Prime Minister \nof Great Britain. The Senator from Massachusetts has seen it, and I \nhave seen it. We are political figures, he and I. We understand when we \nsee another leader. He has stood with our President and our President \nhas stood with him, unlike any two leaders of the United States and \nGreat Britain since really Roosevelt and Churchill. It is remarkable \nwhat those two men have done.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I can just say, again, I repeat, this \nplan is a plan to be successful. It is a plan to strengthen all of our \nefforts in the war on terror. I have been to Great Britain. I have met \nwith the leaders there. I know there are people there who believe we \ncan do a better job in the war on terror, and I know they know the \nprice they are paying for standing by us at this moment.\n  I believe this is a better way to actually fight the war on terror \nthan we are doing today. If you accept that premise, you approach this \ndifferently. I think a lot of other countries believe it, too. All you \nhave to do is look at the record of what is happening with respect to \ncountries in the region, the number of incidents, the number of \nterrorists, the increase of al-Qaida. You can run down the list. Al-\nQaida is in 60 to 80 countries. Osama bin Laden is still running around \nthe mountains of northwest Pakistan or Afghanistan.\n  The fact is, one of the reasons we saw happen what happened probably \nis that it is a quick statement by the folks out there that: You may \nhave got Zarqawi, but we are still around.\n  The fundamental problem remains the same. The Iraqis will not \ntolerate foreign jihadists--jihadists, actually I have been told, is \nnot a great way to refer to them because it actually confers more of a \nGod-given effort to them, and they don't deserve it. They are \nterrorists, they are just foreign terrorists, and we ought to quit \ngiving them jihadists. But the fact is, they are not going to \nsurvive in Iraq if these security forces take hold and the Government \nstands up.\n\n  I believe, as the Senator does, that we want that Government to stand \nup. I think the best way to stand it up is shift the responsibility to \nit. And from all indications, they believe that, too. National Security \nAdviser al-Rubaie wrote in the Washington Post that we ought to \nwithdraw the American troops; it will help us in the streets of Iraq. \nPrime Minister Maliki says they are prepared to take over.\n  He said: You could probably have well under 100,000 troops by the end \nof this year, and we are talking about a year from now.\n  This is reasonable beyond compare, and besides, it allows the \nPresident to make the decision of what we need to finish standing them \nup. A lot of people object to that, but I think it is smart. And it \nallows us to continue to use special forces against al-Qaida. That is \nexactly how we got Zarqawi.\n  I think this is, as I said many times--incidentally, Secretary Melvin \nLaird broke a 30-year silence and wrote in ``Foreign Affairs'' that we \nhave to get our forces out of there and reduce the numbers because they \nare contributing to the occupation and to the insurgency. All you have \nto do is talk to any leader in the region and they will tell you we are \nworking as our own worst partner by this large presence of American \ntroops which is acting as a poster recruitment for terrorism.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will conclude. I just say if we had \nmore time, I would want to enter into another chapter of debate with \nthe Senator on what would be the consequences if we saw failure; if \nthis program of his, no matter how well conceived and how \nconscientious, were to trigger that failure, what would be the \nconsequence.\n  The fact that this country could revert to a haven for further \ntraining of al-Qaida and terrorists from all over the world----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is why we maintain over-the-horizon \ncapacity. That is why we allow the finishing of the training of the \nIraqis to stand up.\n  Look, whether it is the plan of the President or this plan, both of \nthem are operating on some element of faith that hopefully the \nGovernment is going to stand up. If it doesn't, we all got a problem. \nWhat we have here is one resolution--I keep hearing people come to the \nfloor and saying they are definitely against an indefinite presence in \nIraq, but they are indefinitely against being definite about it. You \ncan't have it both ways. Either you are going to push this process or \nwe are locked in the current paradigm.\n  Does my colleague think the current paradigm is going to do it? It \nmay, but I am saying this for the last time: If it does, it will be at \na greater cost in American life; it will be at a greater cost in \ndollars; it will be at a greater cost to the war on terror; it will be \nat a greater cost to our reputation in the region; and I believe there \nis a better way to get this done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I think this has \nbeen a very worthwhile colloquy between us. I must say on this side, \nthere are 55 who are going to stand tall and unify with no dissension \non tomorrow at the time of the vote.\n  At this time, can I inquire as manager of the bill if there are other \nSenators desiring to speak?\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are. Senator Harkin wants to speak \nfor a few minutes. I know Senator Feingold wants to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am prepared to remain here as long as is necessary.\n  Mr. KERRY. Senator Feingold, I understand, will not, but Senator \nHarkin wishes to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. On this side, I see my colleague from Alabama, although \nhe has had some opportunity, but very limited opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to accommodate Senators. I ask my friend, if \nhe desires to speak, can he advise the manager of the bill how much \ntime he would like?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am not certain how much time I want. Who is next in \nline? Are we going back and forth?\n  Mr. WARNER. We are going back and forth, and I am about to relinquish \nthe management of the bill to my good friend from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\n  The parliamentary situation is we remain on the bill, and debate can \ncontinue on the bill. We are not going to try and have time \nconstraints. We are trying for the benefit of this infrastructure that \nhas to remain in place and such Senators who may be listening to \ndetermine who would like to speak and for what period of time. That is \nall I am trying to ascertain.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think the only speaker remaining on our \nside now is the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can the Senator from Iowa advise the chairman as to how \nmuch time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I looked over my remarks, and I say to the \nchairman, probably 20 minutes, I suppose. It depends if I go off.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator from Alabama desire some \ntime also?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to the chairman, 20 to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Good. I relinquish the management of this bill to the \nSenator from Alabama and such time that Senator Sessions and Senator \nHarkin may require. I thank all for their participation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can we enter into a unanimous consent agreement so we know \nwhat is happening?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that will be advisable.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final, \nconcluding comments this evening be made by the Senator from Alabama, \nfollowed by the Senator from Iowa, at which time I believe the Senate \nwill adjourn; is that accurate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that is a reasonable request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, before the chairman leaves, I want to \ntell him how much I appreciated his analysis and summary of where we \nare. He noted that we may have had as many as a million or more people \nat one time or another investing their very lives in a successful \noperation of this country, and we have just gotten a government up and \nthey have just elected a Defense Minister a few weeks ago and an \nInterior Minister.\n  Based on the long chairmanship and leadership of the Senator from \nVirginia in the Senate and as former Secretary of the Navy, let me ask \nthe Senator again: Does he think that we would be creating grave risks \nthat are not necessary by a precipitous withdrawal at this time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think this chairman has resonated with \ndebates for months on this issue of timetables. I say to my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts, as I stated in our colloquy here, clearly by \nsetting forth a terminal date there is a timetable, and that, in my \njudgment, is a very destabilizing thing. It sends a signal that perhaps \nthe United States has less than the will and the commitment, as clearly \nexpressed by our President many times, most recently upon his return \nfrom his trip to Iraq just days ago, that we are there to help the \nIraqi people achieve their goals.\n  Now we expect from them a level of cooperation to move, hopefully, \nmost swiftly to establish a full range of sovereignty and the \nresponsibility that goes along with that. All I have asked repeatedly \nis give them a chance to do that. We have 18 months in the making of \nthis permanent unified Government. Give them a chance. I think that is \nthe President's desire--I know it is.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I remember when we were there just a few months ago.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Before this permanent government was in place, and I \nremember you and Senator Levin, along with Senator Salazar and others--\n--\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Wyoming, and Senator Bingaman was with \nus.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. And I remember you telling the leader of Iraq at \nthat time that they were being challenged and they had to step up and \nassume responsibility.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is not as if they haven't been told that. And they \nassured us at that time that they understood that, and they felt that \nresponsibility deeply. Is that the impression you got?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is absolutely correct. I will even go a step \nfurther. I said: The American people have a strong voice in this, and \nthe elected representatives in Congress listen to those voices. You \nneed only look at the expressions being put forth today.\n  But leadership requires reassuring our people, reassuring the Iraqis, \nreassuring the consortium of nations of the coalition, reassuring all \nothers that this fight in Iraq portends the next half century of the \nhistory of that region. If it fails, who knows where the end of the \nstrife will come in that region--the possible destabilization of one of \nthe largest concentrations of energy in the world, which suddenly \nbegins to impact in many ways on the quality of life here at home and \nthroughout the world. That whole infrastructure could be challenged if \nthis Nation devolves into a vicious civil war and anarchy follows and a \nhaven for terrorism follows. We cannot let that happen.\n  I just said to my good friend, timing is everything. The time for \nthis amendment has certainly, in my judgment, not come, and a timetable \nis not a good signal to send out. I yield the floor, and I thank my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have one more question I want to ask \nmy colleague. I remember--I personally have a vivid recollection of \nbeing in a meeting, our delegation was, just a few months ago in \nBaghdad, with the Sunni leader. Do you remember the insecurity he felt \nabout whether our Nation would remain in Iraq? He made a commitment to \njoin with this Government, and some of his Sunni people didn't agree \nwith that. He realized that a precipitous withdrawal which he had heard \nsomething about in the media could jeopardize the ability of that \ncountry to hold together, and maybe even jeopardize his own life \nbecause he had stepped up and invested himself in trying to create a \ngood and decent democratic government. Do you remember that discussion?\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember it very vividly. Senator Levin was there. He \nquestioned these individuals quite thoroughly, as did I, and as did \nyou. And it is clear there is an unfortunate dichotomy that the Sunni \npeople are, in large measure, responsible for those areas--al Anbar and \nBaghdad--where this great instability and insurrection takes place \ntoday. At the same time, I think the Sunnis should recognize that it is \nthe participation of the United States and the other coalition partners \nthat gives them the security against the majority of the Shiites who \ncould revolt in such a way and challenge them and their future.\n  So let us hope that this government, which is a unity government with \nSunni representation, can take hold. But it must be given the \nopportunity to send its roots down, to gain its stability and give it a \nchance. This amendment, in my judgment, would send the wrong signal and \nstrip them of that chance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator for his \ncomments and his leadership. It has been a privilege to be a part of \nthis debate. I listened to this debate that has gone on tonight, this \ndiscussion between he and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nwho is most eloquent. But I would just say to Senator Warner that your \nremarks tonight are worthy of the valor and the courage and the \nfidelity of the troops we have sent forth into harm's way, and I am \nhonored to serve with you on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, looking at the resolution that Senator Kerry has \nproposed, I would just make a couple of summary comments. No. 1, he has \na date in which the vast majority of our troops, virtually all combat \nforces, under this amendment would be out by next summer, whether or \nnot that is the right thing militarily. At the same time, he proposes \nthat we have some sort of regional conference, and that this regional \nconference would meet somewhere while we are pulling out troops. And it \nis going to meet and decide what is going to happen in Iraq. I would \njust say that is not the way the world works.\n  Does anybody here think if we get a group of nations in that region \nto gather somewhere and meet and talk about Iraq, while we pull out \ntroops, and violence escalates, that they are just going to pass a \nresolution, and somehow these terrorists, these Baathists are going to \nstop their fighting? Does anybody think that? I wish it were so.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just get the nations in that \nregion to go off somewhere and have a conference in Rome or London or \nParis and have a vote about Iraq and the war would all end and there \nwould be peace and we could just take our soldiers out and these other \nnations who are concerned about it, and if things get bad in that \ncountry of Iraq, they are just going to send their troops in and fix \nit? We really have to be more clear in our thinking about these issues.\n  That is not going to happen. That is fantasy land, let me say, with \nall seriousness. I wish we could do that. Wouldn't it be wonderful if \nwe could. Would it were so, they would just step up, the other nations \nin the region, and take over and fix this problem for us. And wouldn't \nit be nice if we could just have some sort of conference in Iraq and \nbring in the hostile parties and sit them down at a table and just \nreach an agreement? Wouldn't it be nice if we could do that? I wish it \nwere so. I wish the enemy we faced was not the kind of enemy that when \ntheir new top leader captures two American soldiers, he personally \nbrags about brutalizing them as he kills them. Wouldn't it be nice if \nthe enemy we faced were more principled than that? Wouldn't it be \nbetter?\n  But I am afraid the reality is different. I am afraid the reality is \nthat we are facing a radical terrorist enemy that knows it can't win a \nwar conventionally, knows it can't win a vote of the people so \ntherefore they have settled upon an asymmetric method of warfare to \nutilize whatever destructive capacity they can generate, even the \nsuicide of women and children to carry out their diabolical ends, and \nthey are going to continue that. Mr. President, it is the kind of \nthreat that we are just going to have to face, and we are going to have \nto strengthen this Iraqi Government.\n\n  I heard it said that we can never be involved in a civil war. Well, \nwe were there and we talked about whether there was a civil war, and I \nthink those of us who understand in terms of the United States of \nAmerica what a civil war is, that is not a civil war in Iraq. But there \nis a high level of violence, a higher level of violence than we cannot \naccept and the Iraqi people cannot accept. We know that. It is not \nquite the same thing as a civil war. But that conflict can be brought \nunder control. I believe we are on the verge of bringing it under \ncontrol, but it will not be easy.\n  Some say we haven't done anything like this before. Well, how about \nBosnia? Wasn't that a brutal sectarian war that we had to send forces \ninto? What about Kosovo? Wasn't that basically a civil war that we sent \nour troops into? It hasn't been settled perfectly today, but both of \nthose countries are having some stability. They don't have strong \ngovernments, frankly. I have been somewhat disappointed in how Kosovo's \nGovernment has come together, but at least it is a peaceful country and \noperating in a fairly decent way. So to say that we can't help make a \ndifference when there is sectarian violence by the utilization of \nAmerican forces, I think, is wrong. We have done it before, and we can \ndo it again.\n  I would say to my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, he has \njust had a litany of criticisms of the conduct of this war. I wonder \nwhat he would have said were he in the Senate during the Civil War. \nWith all the problems and the years that went by, and General Lee with \nsmaller forces defeated repeatedly the larger forces, what would the \nSenator from Massachusetts be saying about that? Would he be saying: We \nneed to pull back our troops? And what about World War II and all of \nthe problems we had, and World War I for example? Senator Warner just \ngave me on the trip I referred to recently a book about World War I, \nand I just completed it. We lost 18,000 people killed in 1 day at the \nBattle of Meuse, Argonne, in World War I--18,000 in 1 day.\n  I have talked to Alabama families who lost children in Iraq. We have \nlost 2,500 in Iraq in the time that we have been there, and that is a \ngrim number. Every one of those losses represents the best kind of \npeople this country can produce, and my heart breaks for those \nfamilies. But the cost of freedom has always been high, and our \ninterests in fighting a war on terrorism is high, and we have to be \nsmart about it. We have to be careful about it. We have to have a \ndebate in this country, and that is all right. But I would say again \nthat I was very proud of this Senate when we voted a few days ago on \nthe original Kerry amendment to have the troops out by the end of this \nyear, and it was voted down 93 to 6. Presumably, he may have \naccumulated some more votes now for moving the date to 6 months later, \nbut I suspect he will not have a whole lot of votes for that because it \nis just not good policy.\n  We have a country that has only really formed on a permanent basis in \nthe last few weeks. The Prime Minister was elected just a couple of \nmonths ago. His last Cabinet members were just recently selected. They \nwere voted on by the Parliament, elected by the people. Millions of \nIraqis have gone out and voted three times now.\n  So this Government, the real Government, not a transitional or \ninterim government, but the real Government, fully elected by the \npeople, has only been in office a few weeks. And the enemy knows that \nif this Government is successful, their message of violence and hatred, \nextremism, oppression of women, they know those visions, those ideas \nthey have that they want to impose on the people will be lost, and they \ndon't want that to happen. And they are doing everything they possibly \ncan to win the war in Iraq.\n  The Iraqi Army and the Iraqi police are taking far more casualties \nnow than the Americans are. They are out front in many provinces in \nIraq. They are conducting military operations on a regular basis by \nthemselves. Sometimes we go together; sometimes we have embedded \nAmericans with the Iraqi forces. They are stepping up. But they are not \nready yet. Their military is not there yet. It is not as fully equipped \nand it is not as fully trained. They don't have the confidence and the \nchain of command, their logistics are not where we would like them to \nbe compared to a modern American Army. And they can be vulnerable to \nthese kinds of terrorist attacks by which small groups of the military \ncan be overrun or attacked and it can destabilize that country right \nnow.\n  So I think the best course is to listen to our military leaders as we \ndecide how and whether to conduct our military operations there.\n  I remember being with GEN John Abizaid, commander for CENTCOM, the \ncombatant commander for this region of the world. He has been involved \nin this closely. He speaks Arabic. He grew up for a number of years in \nthe Middle East. He understands this area. He has been a student of it. \nHe is a brilliant general. He told me on an airplane back when people \nwere saying: We need to send in more troops--he said: No, we don't \nneed--in his opinion--he said: We don't need to send in more troops. We \nneed to train up the Iraqi forces so we can reduce our presence.\n  I say that to you, Mr. President, because I want the American people \nto know that the combatant commander, the one who is giving the advice \nto President Bush, does not believe in excessively maintaining forces \nin Iraq. He understands that it would be better if we could reduce \nthem.\n  But he also understands the challenges that exist in Iraq today.\n  That is why his recommendation is that we not have a resolution like \nthis. And General Casey likewise, it is his recommendation that we not \nhave a resolution like this.\n  I thought about the idea that somehow we can have, as one Senator \nsaid, an accelerated redeployment, or really a date for withdrawal, \nunder Senator Kerry's amendment. Will this pullout, cut-and-run \nmentality, help us and help the Iraqis defeat al-Qaida? Really? If we \npull out right now, will that help the Iraqis defeat the al-Qaida \nforces? Will it help reduce sectarian violence?\n  I wish it were so. I wish we could pull right out and they would all \nbe nice and we wouldn't have any more fighting.\n  Would it help reduce the criminality in the country? Would it help \nstrengthen and provide confidence to those members of the new Iraqi \nGovernment? Or would it increase their nervousness, would it increase \ntheir insecurity, at a time when we need to get that government off to \na good start and, as Senator Warner said, send their roots into the \nsoil for stability?\n  Would it help establish the police force if we just pulled out? A lot \nof\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\nIraqis are signing up every day to be policemen. They have become \ntargets of the terrorists on a regular basis. But I think they are \nprovided confidence and comfort to know the American military is there \nto support them. Right now I do not believe there is enough strength in \nthe Iraqi military, in the context of the Iraqi people, to survive a \nprecipitous withdrawal. I think it could destabilize them. Maybe not, \nbut I think there is a real likelihood of it.\n  I just would say we ought to think carefully about what our generals \nhave told us.\n  The amendment submitted by Senator Kerry, I think, goes too far. I do \nnot believe a conference, a meeting in any capital city anywhere in the \nworld is going to settle the conflict in Iraq. I do not believe pulling \nour troops out is going to reduce the threats in Iraq. I believe what \nwe have to do is do what General Abizaid and General Casey have told \nus; let's maintain our presence, let's draw it down as rapidly as we \ncan, but let's do it consistent with the raising up of a legitimate \nmilitary and police force in that country. And let's do what we can to \nstrengthen and create credibility in the Iraqi Government.\n  You should never tell your enemy what your plan is. You should never \ngive him a guaranteed plan of withdrawal or any other plan that you are \ngoing to execute, particularly when you are dealing with an asymmetric \nenemy like these terrorists.\n  Clausewitz warned of this type of war planning and making your \nintentions known. He said this ``the essence of the defense''--think \nwhat these terrorists are about. They are defending their dream of a \nterrorist-dominated state.\n  Clausewitz says:\n\n       The essence of the defense is waiting: waiting until the \n     attacker clarifies his own intentions; waiting until the \n     balance of forces shifts; waiting for any improvement in the \n     defender's situation, whether from the culminating process \n     described above, from outside intervention, from mobilization \n     of his own resources, or from some chance development. Time \n     is almost always on the side of the defender.\n\n  Our Nation is on the offensive in the war against terror and we have \nbeen blessed that, since 9/11, we have not had another attack on our \nhomeland. Who would have thought that possible? Certainly people were \nafraid to get on an airplane for weeks afterwards. They wouldn't go to \nshopping malls. We have been blessed to have gone this far without \nanother attack.\n  The terrorists are using every desperate act they can to break the \nwill of the Iraqis and our U.S. forces and our U.S. political system. \nThis would undercut the foundation of our military efforts. So victory \nmust be tied to results and victory is what we must have--not an \namendment calling for redeployment measured in days or hours.\n  President Bush has established a strategy for a victory in Iraq that \nis condition-based, not based on arbitrarily selected dates.\n  Why not December 31? Why not April 1? Why not July 4? It is not a way \nto make a strategy in a military situation. The President's strategy \nfocuses, rather, on the accomplishment of specific objectives.\n  President Bush has said:\n\n       Victory will come when the terrorists and the Saddamists \n     can no longer threaten Iraq's democracy, when the Iraq \n     security forces can provide for the safety of their own \n     citizens, and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to \n     plot new attacks on our Nation.\n\n  The President knows Iraq must stand up and do its part. In his most \nrecent visit to Iraq the President urged the Iraqis to ``seize the \nmoment and we, the United States, will help them succeed. When America \ngives a commitment, America keeps its word.''\n  He said:\n\n       If the United States of America leaves before this Iraqi \n     government can defend itself and sustain itself and govern \n     itself, it will be a major blow to the war on terror.\n\n  I certainly would agree with that, as Senator Warner has so \neloquently stated.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld explained why a time-phased plan \nfor redeployment is wrong. He said:\n\n       Once you start doing that, then you are stuck with a number \n     and a date and it just doesn't do any good. The decision to \n     withdraw is based [must be based] on conditions on the \n     ground.\n\n  Some supporting this amendment and others who are calling for this \nexit strategy of time-phased withdrawals stake their claim on past \nexperiences in other conflicts. This global war on terror is different. \nThe enemy here has not surrendered. He does not wear a uniform. He is \nnot sequestered in a country bounded by borders. He has not signed a \npeace accord and he has not given up his arms.\n\n  He, unlike Vietnam, is sworn to attack this country if he is \nsuccessful and emboldened and gets his hands on the wealth of the Iraqi \noil. Will our country be safe? Will they stay in Iraq and not continue \nto attack us, as they have, if the terrorists take over their country? \nHe fights in an asymmetric fashion unlike any we fought before, and we \ncannot put our people and our allies at risk by shirking our \nresponsibilities in any way that will undermine the opportunity that we \nhave to have a victory and a stable government in Iraq.\n  Our generals on the ground understand this and have offered their \nperspectives on what impact this type of time-phased redeployment would \nhave on the Iraqi situation. I know we have had people here who have \nserved. Senator Warner has served in World War II and Korea. Senator \nKerry served in Vietnam. But what about General Abizaid, Commander of \nthe U.S. Central Command? He has given his life to the service of the \nmilitary and in that region of the world. He has overall responsibility \nfor Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he recently spoke to Prime Minister \nMaliki and said:\n\n       The Iraqi people don't want to go back to the 6th century. \n     The Afghanis don't want to live under the rule they \n     experienced under the Taliban. They don't want bin Laden to \n     win. There is clear preference expressed by the people in \n     both Iraq and Afghanistan to vote. The fact that they voted \n     is their way of reaching out to the future.\n\n  General Abizaid warns of leaving the region without proper conditions \non the ground with respect to the terrorists in that all they, the \nterrorists. He says:\n\n       All they do is destroy and kill and try to grab headlines. \n     They believe by doing that they can gain time and eventually \n     the coalition will leave. And when we leave there will be \n     states vulnerable to their ideology.\n\n  General George Casey--he is the commander of all our forces in Iraq--\nrecently said this:\n\n       I think as long as the Iraqi security forces continue to \n     progress and as long as this national unity government \n     continues to operate that way and move the country forward, I \n     think we are going to be able to see continued gradual \n     reductions of coalition forces over the coming months and \n     into the next year.\n\n  That is his prediction. Somehow I have the vision of, out in the \ncountry, the dogs we used to have. You would get in the car and drive \ndown the road and the dog would chase after the car, thinking somehow, \nI guess, that it made the car run off, that the car was afraid of it. I \nthink sometimes some in this body are afraid we are actually going to \nbe able to draw down troops in the next year or so. They think if they \ncan just pass a resolution mandating it, then they can claim credit for \nit.\n  General Casey's comments do mention the force reduction, but he ties \nthe reduction to the status of the development of the Iraqi security \nforces and the national unity government's success.\n  This amendment, the Kerry amendment, calls on the President to begin \na deployment, beginning in 2006, in stark contrast to the best judgment \nof the most senior United States commanders in Iraq. Who should we \nlisten to? General Abizaid and General Casey, I submit.\n  U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, whom we met in Iraq a few weeks \nago, said the formation of the government, with crucial involvement \nfrom Saddam's once dominant fellow Sunnis is a great sign of progress. \nHe states:\n\n       I believe that with the political changes taking place--the \n     emphasis on unity and reconciliation, with effective \n     ministers . . . that conditions are likely to move in the \n     right direction that would allow adjustment in terms of the \n     size, composition and mission of our forces.\n\n  In closing, I would like to highlight the recent comments by the man \nentrusted with advising Prime Minister Maliki on the national security \nof the new Iraqi democracy and what his items are concerning a time-\nphased reduction in U.S. forces.\n  Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the recently approved Iraq minister for national \nsecurity, expressed his concerns in the Washington Post. I believe it \nwas today or yesterday. He stated:\n\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n\n       There has been much talk about a withdrawal of U.S. and \n     coalition troops from Iraq, but no defined timeline has yet \n     been set. There is, however, an unofficial roadmap to foreign \n     troop reductions that will eventually lead to total \n     withdrawal of U.S. troops. This roadmap is based, not just on \n     a series of dates but, more important, on the achievement of \n     a set of objectives for restoring security in Iraq.\n\n  I want to conclude by saying how proud I am of our military. I was \npleased that the original Kerry amendment was voted down 93 to 6. I \nthink by moving that date forward 6 months, the vote is not going to \nchange very much.\n  I know Senator Levin has offered an amendment. I will just say this \nabout it. I serve with Senator Levin on the Armed Services Committee. I \nam sure he is trying to reach some sort of compromise, some sort of \nunifying amendment for the Democratic side. I am really sort of \ndisappointed at it, because I don't think, if adopted, it will serve \nany purpose and could cause much mischief and be misinterpreted.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against both amendments, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President. I apologize to the President for \nhaving to sit there at this late hour. It wasn't my doing. But I did \nwant to speak on this issue. It is one of major importance, and one \nabout which I have not spoken on the Senate floor previously. So I beg \nthe indulgence of the Chair at this late hour.\n  Mr. President, on May 3, I introduced a resolution in the Senate that \noffered a clear break from our current counterproductive course in Iraq \nallowing our Armed Forces to return to their focus to defeating the \nterrorists who attacked us on September 11, 2001.\n  The resolution would do three things.\n  First, it states that the United States should not maintain a \npermanent military presence or military bases in Iraq.\n  Second, it states that the United States should not attempt to \ncontrol Iraq's oil.\n  And, third, it states that the United States Armed Forces should be \nredeployed from Iraq as soon as practicable after the completion of \nIraq's constitution-making process, or December 31 of 2006, whichever \ncomes first.\n  My resolution is identical to the resolution introduced in the House \nof Representatives by Representative Mike Thompson of California with \nat least six Republican cosponsors. As far as I know, it is the only \nIraqi resolution introduced that has bipartisan support. So I \nintroduced the same measure here in the Senate.\n  I continue to believe that only this resolution offers a clear, \nunambiguous, principled stand--a stand that can produce the results \nthat we all want.\n  Only when the Iraqi Government faces a firm timetable for U.S. \nredeployment will it have the incentive to resolve its internal \ndifferences and stand on its own two feet.\n  And only when our government faces a firm timetable will it make \nurgent policy changes necessary to right our course in Iraq.\n  President Bush has it exactly backwards. He said that our Army will \nstand down only as the Iraqi Army stands up. The truth is that the \nIraqi Army and government will stand up only when it is clear that the \nAmerican military is committed to standing down by a date certain.\n  My resolution is a clear, unambiguous statement of our intention to \nmove beyond the strategic blunder of Iraq which has distracted us from \nthe fight against those who attacked us on September 11. Only such a \nclear break will allow us to recommit our military and intelligence \nresources to the unfinished task of crushing al-Qaida and capturing or \nkilling Osama bin Laden.\n  We need this new decisive direction because President Bush is \nunwilling to change his current policies in Iraq which are manifestly a \nfailure.\n  Let us be clear. Staying the course effectively means stay forever. \nIt means to stay and pay and stay and pay and stay and pay.\n  Already we have paid with more than 2,500 dead and more than 18,000 \nwounded. We will continue to pay a terrible price in terms of lives and \ntreasure, not only to the end of President Bush's term but well into \nthe term of his successor and beyond. And for what? For a failed \napproach in Iraq that in the judgment of a large majority of national \nsecurity experts is damaging America's national security and making us \nless safe.\n  Because I believe we need a new direction, I will vote for both the \nLevin-Reed amendment and the Kerry-Feingold-Boxer amendment.\n  I commend my friend and my colleague, Senator Kerry, for his \nleadership on this issue. I was here this evening listening to him. I \nlistened to his colloquy with the Senator from Virginia. I think it is \nclear that Senator Kerry is on the right course. Also, Senator Levin, I \nbelieve is also on the right course. So I will support both, and I do \nso because I believe that both are better than what we have now.\n  But I also want to be clear that neither one is going to pass. We \nknow that. So we shouldn't agonize over which one we can support. It \ndoesn't matter what we do; it won't become law.\n  So why are we doing this? We are doing it because we must put \npressure on the President. We do it because we need to speak for the \nAmerican people who are way ahead of us, way ahead of the President, \nway ahead of the White House, and way ahead of the Congress on this \nissue. They know what we are doing in Iraq--costing $7 billion a month, \n$9 million an hour, 2,500 dead, 18,000 maimed and injured--they know it \nis wrong. They know we have been misled into this war.\n  My position is simply that anything we can do to give voice to the \nAmerican people that will hopefully pull the President back to a more \nrational, reasonable and sane policy, anything that will do that I will \nsupport.\n  I realize that some, including the President's top political adviser, \nare eager to politicize this issue in an election year. They can't wait \nto frame this as a debate between those who support our troops and \nthose who want to retreat, between those who want to fight and those \nwho want to surrender.\n\n  This is outrageous, and it is false. It is the same inflammatory \ndemagoguery that tore our country apart during the Vietnam war. Just as \nwe were misled into the Vietnam war, so we were in Iraq. All you have \nto think is weapons of mass destruction equals the Tonkin Gulf. Weapons \nof mass destruction is to Iraq what the Tonkin Gulf was to Vietnam. \nBoth misled us into a drastic, terrible war.\n  Just as the Nixon administration was bent and misused intelligence to \nfit a preconceived belief on Vietnam, so would President Bush in Iraq. \nJust as we heard the arguments in the early 1970s about Vietnam, that \nwe have to fight the Communists there or we will be fighting them here, \nnow we hear that we have to fight the terrorists in Iraq before we \nfight them here.\n  Just as we said in Vietnam we will have to support the government \nbecause it is a free government elected by 80 percent of the people, so \nnow we hear the same thing about Iraq and terrorists.\n  The echoes are resounding about what we hear from this administration \nand their policies for Iraq and what we heard for Vietnam.\n  Let us be clear about what I think this debate is really about. It is \nabout charting a smarter, more focused offensive against the terrorists \nwho attacked us on September 11. It is about acknowledging that Iraq \ndid not attack us on September 11, but that our invasion and occupation \nof Iraq has been a costly distraction from our fight against those who \ndid attack us.\n  It is about giving the government in Iraq incentives to get its act \ntogether; to overcome sectarian divisions and stand up a viable, self-\nsustaining army.\n  This debate is about acknowledging that staying the course is no \nvirtue if the course we are on is demonstrably wrong. Indeed, it is \nabout acknowledging that staying the course means stay and pay. Stay \nand pay. It means that our Armed Forces will continue to stay and pay \ndearly with more than 20,000 already killed, maimed, and wounded. For \nour beleaguered taxpayers, it means stay and pay more of their hard-\nearned tax dollars and the debt that is being piled on for our children \nand grandchildren to pay--$350 billion already on Iraq and counting.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces deserve better than this.\n  Instead of putting bumper-stickers on our cars saying ``support our\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\ntroops,'' let us actually support our troops. Let us give them some \nhope for a way forward from the current stalemate and quagmire.\n  They have brilliantly completed the task they were sent to Iraq to \naccomplish. Saddam Hussein's dictatorship has been deposed. We are \ncertain that Iraq does not possess weapons of mass destruction--and \nnever did. And the Iraqi people have a constitution and a \ndemocratically elected government.\n  To our troops goes great credit. They have achieved these things \ndespite a series of disastrous decisions by their civilian leaders here \nin Washington.\n  President Bush himself has acclaimed the installation of a permanent \nIraqi Government as a historic ``turning point.''\n  So the question is, why aren't our troops returning? Why are we still \nin Iraq with no commitment whatsoever even to a graduated redeployment?\n  Why has President Bush stated that we will be in Iraq at least \nthrough the end of his administration and into his successor's \nadministration?\n  Why are we building what appears to be permanent military bases?\n  Why are we in the process of building a gigantic new United States \nembassy in Baghdad that will span 104 acres, the size of nearly 80 \nfootball fields?\n  What message does it send when the House Republican leadership 2 \nweeks ago insisted on stripping from the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill Senate-passed language asserting that we will not \nbuild permanent bases or attempt to control Iraq's oil? We passed that \nin the Senate. The House Republicans took it out.\n  What message does that send to the insurgents and al-Qaida and the \nterrorists who would do us harm? None of these things give the \nimpression that the United States plans on winding down our military \nand civilian presence or relinquishing our grip on Iraq.\n  To the contrary, it is easy to see how ordinary Iraqis as well as \npeople across the world view this as the behavior of a conquering power \nthat has no intention of leaving. Unfortunately, this perception \ncreates continuing resentment. It feeds anti-Americanism. It continues \nto give powerful fuel to the insurgency, both in terms of motivation \nand recruitment, and it puts our American Armed Forces at greater risk.\n  It has now been more than 3 years since President Bush's speech on \nthe flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln. On that occasion, with a \ngiant banner behind him a claiming ``Mission Accomplished,'' President \nBush said triumphantly, ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.''\n  But today, 133,000 troops remain on the ground. President Bush again \nand again has signaled that the U.S. military presence in Iraq is open-\nended and of indefinite duration.\n  This has given rise to suspicions that the United States has long-\nterm designs on Iraq and its oil and deprives the Iraq Government of \nthe incentives to resolve its internal divisions and stand on its own \nfeet.\n  With the war in Iraq now in its fourth year, it is clear that the \npresent course is not a strategy for success. It is a strategy for \ncontinued stalemate and stagnation.\n  As I said, stay the course means stay and pay. Stay and pay. One-\nthird of a trillion dollars we have spent so far and counting.\n  Indeed, I fear that stay the course also means stay forever--and this \nsends exactly the wrong signal. It stokes the insurgents who believe \nthat the U.S wants a permanent military presence in Iraq.\n  Don't think for a second that they do not know and they aren't \nputting out the word that the Republican leadership in the House 2 \nweeks ago stripped the language out of the Senate bill which stated \nthat we were not going to have permanent bases and we will not control \ntheir oil. Don't think for a minute that they haven't broadcast that, \nthat they aren't using that as a recruiting tool. Of course they are.\n  When President Bush says it will be through his administration and \ninto his successor's administration before we decide what to do in \nIraq, that is a powerful recruiting tool for the insurgents and the \nterrorists.\n  Our open-ended commitment to stay in Iraq as long as it takes has had \nthe effect of taking away any incentive for the Iraqi Government to \nresolve its internal division and get its act together.\n  Parliamentary elections were held way back in early December. Has \nBaghdad descended into vicious sectarian violence? It took the Iraqis \nnearly 7 months to chose a prime minister and to fill all the \nministries.\n  Now, as the Iraqis face a deadline for U.S redeployment, there is no \nway they would have squandered 6 months before forming a government, \nnor would the Iraqis be dragging their feet in standing up a viable, \nself-sustaining army and police force.\n  I just heard the Senator from Alabama quoting a general. A lot of \ngenerals have been quoted around here. I guess I can quote a general \ntoo. How about General Casey, our commander in Iraq, who told the \nSenate last September. He said:\n\n       Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of \n     occupation, contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security \n     forces on the coalition [and] extends the amount of time that \n     it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self-\n     reliant.\n\n  Last September, General George Casey said that.\n  BG Donald Alston, the chief U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, put it \nthis way:\n\n       I think the more accurate way to approach this right now is \n     to concede that . . . this insurgency is not going to be \n     settled . . . through military options or military \n     operations. It is going to be settled in the political \n     process.\n\n  Nor, I must add, is there a military solution to most of the critical \nproblems confronting Iraq--sectarian strife, out-of-control crime, \nrampant corruption, widespread unemployment, chronic shortages of \nelectricity and water and gasoline, and on and on. There is not a \nmilitary solution to that; it is a political solution.\n  The Iraqi people also believe that a redeployment of U.S. forces \nwould give a boost to the political process. According to a recent poll \nconducted by the University of Maryland, more than 80 percent of Iraqis \nwant U.S. forces to leave Iraq. When asked what the impact of a \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops would be, large majorities of Iraqis believe \nthat insurgent attacks will decrease, sectarian violence will decline, \nand the sectarian factions in Parliament will be more willing to \ncooperate. That is what a majority of Iraqis believe. Yet somehow this \nadministration believes differently.\n  We all hope the Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish leaders are sincere in their \nstated desire to avoid an all-out civil war. Prime Minister Maliki has \nformed a national unity Cabinet. As I said, President Bush has hailed \nthis new Government as a turning point. We hope that is the case. But \nwhether or not Mr. Maliki is willing or able to make good on his \npledges, it is certainly time for a turning point in U.S. policy in \nIraq.\n  The coming months must be a period of transition to full Iraqi \nsovereignty. It is time to hand off security responsibilities to the \nIraqi Army and police, to redeploy most of our U.S. Armed Forces from \nIraq by the end of this year. This strategic redeployment must involve \nconverting our vast military presence on the ground in Iraq to a quick \nreaction force, staged in countries bordering Iraq, countries that \nshare our interest in a stable Iraq and that view our military presence \nin the region as a stabilizing force.\n  This substantial over-the-horizon force would be used to strike at \nal-Qaida and its affiliates whether in Iraq or elsewhere. These forces \nwould be able to respond in a timely manner, as they did 2 weeks ago in \ntargeting and killing Al-Zarqawi.\n  I would expect, as our troops withdraw from Iraq, this would free up \nU.S. forces to combat the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. \nOther troops would be available to send to the emerging terrorist \nthreats in countries such as Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, which threaten \nto become major breeding grounds for terrorists.\n  The harsh fact is that the Iraq war has led to a decline in the \noverall readiness of U.S. ground forces. It has decimated our capacity \nto put large numbers of boots on the ground were we to face an \nemergency elsewhere, such as on the Korean peninsula.\n  At a Senate hearing last year, GEN Richard A. Cody, Army vice chief \nof staff, said:\n\n       What keeps me awake at night is what will this all-\n     volunteer force look like in 2007?\n\n  He stated this in the context of a discussion about whether we could \nsustain\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\nthe operational tempo of deployments at the rate we have had since the \nbeginning of the Iraq war. For all the military superiority we \ndisplayed in the invasion of March 2003, 3 years later, a guerilla \nconflict is grinding away at our military manpower and equipment.\n  We need to redeploy from Iraq in order to reset and reequip the \nforce--ground forces in particular--so they are prepared for a more \nfocused campaign against the terrorists who attacked us and continue to \nthreaten us.\n  At the same time we are redeploying our Armed Forces, we need to \nfoster sustained diplomatic engagement, working with Middle Eastern \nnations to facilitate rival Iraqi factions in reaching a political \nsettlement. Iraq's neighbors have a profound stake in this stability, \nbut they currently have no incentive to get involved. Once it is clear \nthat the United States is leaving, those nations will be highly \nmotivated to facilitate a coming together of the factions within Iraq.\n  Some say that U.S. forces in Iraq are the only thing that stands \nbetween the Sunnis, Shiites, the Kurds, and all-out civil war. I \ndisagree. It is the ongoing presence of U.S. forces and the prospect \nthat we will be in Iraq as a babysitter for years to come that has \ndelayed progress on the political front. It is the ongoing presence of \nU.S forces and statements by this President that we will be there for \nas long as it takes, it is actions such as were taken by the House \nRepublicans in stripping that language out we put in that said we are \nnot going to have permanent bases, we are not going to control the \nworld, it is those actions which have delayed progress on the political \nfront and have given the insurgents the narrative, the story, the \nrecruiting tool they need.\n\n  Our presence in Iraq is a propaganda victory and recruiting tool for \nthe insurgency in Iraq and for Islamic extremists around the world. The \ninsurgents and jihadists are threatened by the overwhelming perception \nin the Arab world that the U.S. military is an occupying force, that we \nare building what appears to be permanent bases, that our continuing \npresence in Iraq is all about controlling oil.\n  Meanwhile, let's be clear on what continuing our current policy of \nstay and pay will entail. The Congressional Research Service reports \nthat we are now spending $6.4 billion a month in Iraq, up sharply from \nlast year. That is $9 million an hour every hour of every day. And we \nare doing so at a time when our budget, the budget put through by the \nRepublicans who control the Congress, is slashing funds for education, \ncancer research, health care, other essential needs at home. The budget \nthis year will mean we have 1,100 fewer research grants from the \nNational Institutes of Health than we had 3 years ago. That is the path \nwe are on. We have spent a grand total of about $350 billion in Iraq.\n  As I have said, more than 2,500 troops have been killed, 18,000 \nwounded. More than 8,500 of the troops are wounded so seriously they \nwere listed as wounded in action, not to return to duty. Are we going \nto stay and pay for another 3 years, spending another $300 billion, \nsacrificing more American troops, with more killed, more maimed and \ninjured for life? Is that what we mean by supporting the troops? Is \nthat what we mean, to stay more, with more killed, more maimed? Why in \nthe world would we want to stay on a course that is so clearly \ncounterproductive, so clearly a failure?\n  Last week, the Center for American Progress and Foreign Policy \nMagazine released the results of their survey of more than 100 of \nAmerica's top terrorism and national security experts from across the \nideological spectrum. The results show fewer than 2 in 10 believe the \nUnited States is winning the war on terror; 87 percent believe the war \nin Iraq has had a negative impact on our national security. So 87 \npercent of the top 100 national security experts around America say \nIraq has had a negative impact on our national security.\n  Last Thursday, the Department of Defense issued a highly partisan \n``debate prep book,'' designed to help Republicans defend the war in \nIraq. Likewise, the President and Vice President are staying the course \nwith their endless happy-talk about progress in Iraq, about how \ndemocracy is on the march. But the facts on the ground tell a different \nstory. I believe we should base our policy choices not on happy talk \nbut on facts on the ground.\n  Clearly, by preemptively attacking Iraq, we have committed a major \nstrategic error in the larger war against the terrorists who attacked \nus. Simply put, we took our eyes off the ball. We deferred our military \nand intelligence resources away from Afghanistan, away from the hunt \nfor bin Laden. The consequences were plain to see. It is no coincidence \ntoday the Taliban has powerfully resurfaced in southern Afghanistan \ndespite President Bush's claim on September 27, 2004, that ``the \nTaliban no longer is in existence.'' Say again? As fighting in \nAfghanistan has intensified over the past 3 months, the United States \nhas conducted 340 airstrikes in Afghanistan, more than twice as many as \nthe 160 airstrikes carried out in the war in Iraq during the same \nperiod.\n  Meanwhile, while we have been distracted in Iraq, al-Qaida-like \nIslamic fighters have retained control of the Somalia capital of \nMogadishu and have dealt a major blow to our counterterrorism efforts \nin the horn of Africa. Nor is it a coincidence that Osama bin Laden is \nstill at large, still directing al-Qaida operations, still encouraging \njihadists around the world.\n  Nearly 5 years ago, before a joint session of Congress, President \nBush pledged he would ``bring Bin Laden to justice or bring justice to \nbin Laden.'' That was 5 years ago. President Bush has done neither. \nInstead, he allowed bin Laden to escape and has gotten the U.S. \nmilitary bogged down in a civil war in Iraq--a huge strategic gift not \nonly to bin Laden but also to Iran. Not only has our open-ended Iraqi \nentanglement taken the heat off the terrorists who attacked us on \nSeptember 11, it has given them a propaganda victory and, as I said, a \nmajor recruiting tool. The sooner we acknowledge the strategic blunder \nand take steps to reverse it and the sooner we redeploy our military \nand strategic assets to confront our real enemies, the better off we \nwill be.\n  The resolution I introduced setting a firm timetable for redeployment \nof U.S. troops from Iraq is about accelerating the emergence of Iraq as \nan independent nation willing to stand on its own feet. But it is also \nabout the unity and security of the American people. This misbegotten, \nmisguided, mismanaged war is dividing our Nation. I already mentioned \nhow the President's top political strategist is planning to inflame \npassions in the war on Iraq in the months between now and the election. \nAgain, I state, it is eerie, eerie how defenders of the Iraq policy, of \nour policy in Iraq are sounding exactly like defenders of Nixon's \npolicies in Vietnam.\n  It is eerie how the defenders of Bush's policies in Iraq are sounding \nlike the defenders of Nixon's policies in Vietnam in the early 1970s. \nBack in 1972, Nixon and his defenders were saying that we were winning \nthe war, that we must stay the course. And guess what. They were saying \nwe must not cut and run, that we must prop up the ``democratic \ngovernment'' in Saigon, which was, of course, elected, as you know, by \n80 percent of the people, and on and on and on.\n  I can remember a time when I sat in a room with a group of \nCongressmen in Saigon, listening to then-President Thieu tell us that \nwe must stay in Vietnam and fight the communists there or we would be \nfighting them in the Philippines and in Japan and on our doorstep.\n  What do we hear now? We have to fight them over in Iraq or we will be \nfighting them here. Eerie, as I said. Eerie.\n  Quite frankly, I say today President Bush is saying almost the exact \nsame things that Richard Nixon said, and he has no more credibility \nthan Richard Nixon did.\n  Likewise, back in 1972, President Nixon and his supporters were \narguing that withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility in the world. \nBut as LTG William Odom, Director of the National Security Agency under \nPresident Reagan, states in a current issue of Foreign Policy \nmagazine--I want to quote him--\n\n       A rapid reversal of our current course in Iraq would \n     improve U.S. credibility around the world.\n\n  I am going to repeat that. LTG William Odom, Director of the National \nSecurity Agency under President Reagan, in the current issue of Foreign \nPolicy magazine, said:\n\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\n\n       A rapid reversal of our current course in Iraq would \n     improve U.S. credibility around the world.\n\n  General Odom went on to say:\n\n       [I]nvading Iraq was not in the interests of the United \n     States. It was in the interests of Iran and al Qaeda. For \n     Iran, it avenged a grudge against Saddam [and left Iran as \n     the strongest power in the Persian Gulf]. For al Qaeda, it \n     made it easier to kill Americans.\n\n  That is not me. That is LTG William Odom, Director of the National \nSecurity Agency under President Reagan.\n  Beyond dividing our country, our endless, open-ended presence in Iraq \nhas distracted our Government from urgent priorities, as I have said, \nin health care, education, law enforcement, and even a smarter approach \nto the very real terrorist threats of today and tomorrow.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces have sacrificed greatly. I \ndon't know why it is that because they have sacrificed so greatly--and \nthe fact is, the Commander in Chief told them what to do, and they did \nit. So what. So to honor them, to honor what they have done in Iraq, we \nstay longer? We sacrifice more of our young people? We have more who \nare maimed for life? To honor them, we drain the Treasury of more of \nour dollars from taxpayers? Is that what it means to support our \ntroops? I don't think so. I do not believe so.\n  I believe to support our troops is to do exactly what LTG William \nOdom said: A rapid reversal of our current course in Iraq.\n  It is time to allow the political process to go forward in Iraq. It \nis time to give Iraqi politicians greater incentive to bridge their \ndifferences and take responsibility for their country's future.\n  It is time to bring home as many troops as possible, consistent with \nforce protection requirements.\n  It is time to redeploy as many as necessary to successfully pursue \nand crush bin Laden and al-Qaida and to protect our vital interests \naround the world.\n  President Bush tells us to be patient. He says Iraq will become a \nflourishing democracy that will spread the flame of freedom across the \nentire Middle East. But, with due respect to President Bush and to Vice \nPresident Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, they have been \nconsistently wrong--disastrously wrong--in all their predictions with \nregard to Iraq.\n  Before the invasion, Vice President Cheney said that Iraq had \n``reconstituted nuclear weapons.'' Secretary Rumsfeld said he knew \nexactly where Saddam was storing his weapons of mass destruction. And, \nas I noted 3 long years ago, President Bush said that major combat \noperations were over, mission accomplished.\n  Many of President Bush's people assured us that the war would be \nself-financed thanks to Iraq's oil--Paul Wolfowitz.\n  Vice President Cheney said, more than a year ago, that the insurgency \nwas ``in its last throes.''\n  Just yesterday, at the National Press Club, Vice President Cheney \ndefended and repeated his claim that the insurgency is in its last \nthroes.\n  I guess if you repeat something often enough--will people believe it? \nListen to what Abraham Lincoln once said: You can fool some of the \npeople all the time. You can fool all the people some of the time. But \nyou can't fool all the people all the time.\n  Mr. Cheney, you may have fooled some people. The American people are \nnot buying it any longer.\n  I could go on and on with this litany of false assertions--prediction \nafter prediction that turned out to be 100 percent wrong.\n  There are those who say: But if we leave, there may be civil war in \nIraq. As I have stated, I think the longer we stay, there will be more \nsectarian strife, more insurgency. But to be honest, I can't tell for \nsure what the likely outcome will be. How can anyone tell what the \nlikely outcome will be, when we can't trust what the administration is \ntelling us, when we can't trust, any longer, the intelligence as it is \nbeing given to us by the administration? We can't tell for sure.\n  So at this point, President Bush has not only spent his political \ncapital, I think he has squandered the last shred of credibility when \nit comes to Iraq. Specifically, as I said, with regard to America's \ndeparture from Iraq, I think the President has it backwards. He says \nour Army will stand down only as the Iraqi Army stands up. The truth is \nthat the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Government will stand up--make the hard \npolitical decisions--only when it is clear that the American military \nis committed to standing down by the end of this year.\n  So I repeat, I will vote in favor of both the Levin-Reed amendment \nand the Kerry-Feingold amendment. As I said, anything is better than \nwhat we have now, even though I think both could go further in setting \na clear, decisive new direction. I stand by my conviction--and the \nwording in my resolution, the same as was introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Mike Thompson, with at least five if not six Republican \ncosponsors--that it is time to set a firm timetable for redeploying our \ntroops from Iraq and redoubling our fight against those who attacked us \non September 11. Only this new course will produce the results we all \nwant, both on the ground in Iraq and in the campaign against al-Qaida \nand rebuilding, reconstituting our forces and rebuilding and reuniting \nthe people of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the Senate for allowing me to \nexplain briefly, this evening, why I will be voting to stay the course \nin Iraq until the progress we are making there now ripens into complete \nvictory. And I want to put that conflict in context.\n  The United States is in a war against a transnational army of \nfanatical extremists who routinely use terror against civilians its a \nweapon. The terrorists began attacking us before September 11. They \nattacked us in the 1980s and in the 1990s, when they bombed Khobar \nTowers, attacked the USS Cole and our embassies abroad, and first tried \nto bomb the World Trade Center. Our government did not recognize the \nthreat and did not respond vigorously until after they escalated the \nwar by the attacks on September 11.\n  We know who the terrorists are--an interlocking network of highly \ntrained, deadly, and adaptive terrorist organizations funded largely by \nthe Saudi Wahabbists and Iran. We know what their goals are from the \nal-Zawahiri letter which was intercepted in July of 2005. They want, \nfirst, to radicalize Islam by converting, suppressing, or killing those \nMuslims who resist their twisted and extreme interpretation of that \nreligion. They want to exclude the principles of enlightenment thought \nfrom Islamic countries and set up a series of Taliban-like caliphates \nthroughout the Muslim world. Those regimes would be run by religious \nthought police who would ruthlessly suppress free expression, religious \ndissent, social pluralism, political activity, and women's rights. We \nknow that such regimes are possible; one existed in Afghanistan before \nAmerica intervened, and another exists in Iran today.\n  We know the tactics they will use. The terrorists are patient, in the \nsense that they think generationally. They infiltrate mosques and they \nfeed off the discontent and hopelessness many young Muslims feel. They \nsee Western democracies as weak and feckless; they hope that with time \nand intimidation they can control the policies of these countries. They \nhope to gain control of sources of energy on which the West depends. \nAnd, the terrorists want to acquire weapons of mass destruction. Since \nthey have no national base and no concern whatsoever for innocent human \nlife, traditional means of deterrence--the threat of a counterattack--\nwould be unlikely to prevent the terrorists from using such weapons \nshould they get them.\n  The point is that the terrorists are trying to achieve these goals, \nand they are not going to stop voluntarily. There is no conceivable \nacceptable accommodation we could reach that would cause them to leave \nus alone. We must therefore counter their efforts, and to be effective \nwe must fight on three ``fronts,'' as it were, at once: we must rebuild \nour intelligence and covert operations capability, we must deprive the \nterrorists of national bases of support, and we must work with \nmainstream Islam around the world to show Mideast Muslims in particular \nthat there is a future for them in the principles of liberal democracy.\n  The operation in Iraq is a central part of all three of these \n``fronts.'' Our\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\ngoal there was, first, to remove Saddam Hussein. His regime was an \norganic threat to world peace; he had twice invaded his neighbors and \nwas systematically violating the commitments he made after Desert \nStorm. He had harbored and trained terrorists; more fundamentally, he \nwas a tyrant who wanted weapons of mass destruction and was obstructing \nthe war against the terrorists.\n  Second, the United States, in cooperation with mainstream Iraqi \nleaders from all parts and ethnic groups in the country, is building a \nmulti-ethnic democracy in Iraq that will be a strong ally in the war on \nterror and will confront and confound the vision of the terrorists for \nthe Muslim world.\n  The terrorists know how important the struggle in Iraq is to the \noverall war. That is why they are trying so hard to disrupt the new \ngovernment. Yet they are not succeeding. The sacrifice and hardships \nendured by all the soldiers and families whose loved ones are serving \nin Iraq have resulted in major achievements for the Iraqi people.\n  In the 3 years since Iraq was liberated, the Iraqi people have \nassumed sovereignty over their country, held free elections, drafted a \ndemocratic constitution, approved that constitution in a nationwide \nreferendum, elected a permanent representative under the new \nconstitutional framework, and formed a government with representatives \nfrom all sections and religious groups within the country.\n  The Iraqi Government has become more capable of providing essential \nservices to its people. The 2005 per capita GDP was more than double \nthe 2003 amount, and exceeds the prewar 2002 amount by more than 30 \npercent. There are over 100 independent newspapers and magazines, 44 \ncommercial television stations, and 72 commercial radio stations now \noperating in Iraq.\n\n  America continues to actively fight the terrorists, while building \nand training capable and effective Iraqi security forces, which \neventually will take the lead in the fight and take responsibility for \nthe safety and security of their citizens. Over 250,000 Iraqi security \nforces have been trained and equipped, which is an increase of 123,500 \ntroops from January 2005. In addition, there are now more than 100 \nground combat battalions of Iraqi military and special police forces \nconducting operations against the insurgency.\n  I do not begrudge anyone their discontent with how some of our \noperations have been conducted in Iraq. There have been mistakes.\n  The administration underestimated how long it would take to stabilize \nthe Sunni triangle; our active duty army is too small and this has \nstrained Reserve components; we have relied too much on technology and \nnot enough on intelligence in counteracting the improvised explosive \ndevices. Wars are messy and failures are inevitable; yet the Bush \nadministration has had the authority for the last 5 years, and I do not \nblame anyone for holding the administration accountable for the \noperational mistakes that have been made.\n  Yet I do ask everyone to recognize that this war is serious and \nnecessary and must be won. I believe the decision to invade Iraq was, \nwhatever mistakes have been made operationally, the only possible \nstrategic choice. President Clinton was, quite properly, building the \ncase for action against Saddam during his last years in office, even \nbefore the attacks on 9/11. I was in the House at the time and I \nremember clearly that Secretary Albright, Vice President Gore and the \nPresident himself repeatedly warned that Saddam was a major threat. In \nshort, the war in Iraq, like the global war on terror of which it is a \npart, is America's war, which we must fight and win to protect our \nsafety and freedom and to preserve from violence and oppression \nhundreds of millions of innocent people around the world. And we will \nwin it, despite the mistakes, provided that we do not let strategic \nincoherence, partisan politics, or personal disaffection with the \nadministration divide or discourage us.\n  For many of us, the hardest thing about war is not the physical or \nmonetary sacrifice. It is the burden of having to confront unpleasant \nrealities, choose consistently from unpalatable options, and sacrifice \nobjectives that apart from the war would justifiably claim a priority. \nBut if we really do value freedom, safety, pluralism, and justice, we \nmust all resolve that we will shoulder this burden for as long as it \ntakes. Our service men and women are doing their duty magnificently, \nand will continue doing it until they have won. They have shown by \ntheir sacrifice how much they value the safety of their families and \nthe freedom of their country. We need to back them up.\n  That means, among other things, resolving to stay and fight in Iraq \nuntil the battle is won. To pull out now or to set an artificial \ntimeline on withdrawal--especially after the victories of the last few \nweeks--would imperil everything the sacrifice that our service men and \nwomen has gained. It would encourage the enemy to struggle even more \ntenaciously and ruthlessly in the hope that America could be made to \nquit. It would demoralize our friends and it would convince those who \nhave yet to take sides that the United States cannot be trusted to keep \nits commitments.\n  I want to encourage everyone about the progress we have made. We are \nwinning, not just in Iraq, but in the larger global war on terror. We \nhave allies now we didn't have 5 years ago--in Pakistan, Afghanistan, \nand Iraq--and we have cooperation and support throughout the Muslim \nworld that a few years ago would not have been possible. The operation \nagainst Zarqawi shows the value of our alliance with the new Iraqi \nGovernment and the increasing sophistication of our intelligence. In \nshort, there is no question that the United States, with its coalition \npartners, has the power to win in Iraq. The question is whether we have \nthe resolution to win.\n  Most wars are combat operations with psychological components. Wars \nagainst terrorists might better be described as psychological \noperations with combat components. They are struggles between leaders, \npeoples, and ``narratives'' of the world. By that, I mean ways of \nlooking at or judging the worth of human beings and the fundamental \nprinciples of human society. I know the American people have the \nstrength and resolution to prevail, as they have prevailed in similar \nstruggles for freedom throughout our history. I know our ``narrative'' \nof the world--our belief in the inherent dignity and equality of all \nhuman beings--is right and strong. I trust our leaders will be resolute \nin the struggle as well, and that by its votes tomorrow, the Senate \nwill signal that we too have confidence in the success of our efforts, \nthe worth of our sacrifice, and the justice of our cause.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today, as we resumed consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill, we have debated two very important \namendments on U.S. policy in Iraq.\n  After the votes on the minimum wage amendments offered by Senators \nKennedy and Enzi, there were 5 hours of debate on the amendment on Iraq \noffered by Senators Levin and Reed. Following this debate, Senator \nKerry offered his amendment.\n  These amendments would call upon the United States to cut and run \nfrom Iraq, just when the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi people need us \nthe most. It is important for all of us to fully understand the \ndangerous implications of a premature withdrawal from Iraq.\n  If we withdraw from Iraq before the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi \npeople are capable of defending their new democracy, the terrorists \nwould see this as a vindication of their strategy of intimidation and \nviolence. This would only embolden them to challenge us, as well as our \nfriend and allies, elsewhere in the Middle East, around the world, and \neven right here at home.\n  While the new Governmment in Iraq is making substantial progress \nevery day, it is not fully ready to defend itself and provide security \nfor the Iraqi people. If we were to cut and run before Iraq can defend \nitself, the violence in Iraq would certainly increase. The terrorists \ncould be expected to mount even deadlier attacks against the new Iraqi \nGovernmment and innocent Iraqi civilians. Chaos would result. Bloody \ncivil war would almost certainly follow, as terrorists and rival \nmilitias tore the country apart. In the process, they would kill \nthousands of innocent Iraqis.\n  In addition, the very unity of Iraq--a unity that we along with our \ncoalition partners and the Iraqi people have worked so hard and \nsacrificed so much to secure--would be destroyed.\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\n  Sectarian violence would tear the country apart. It would split Iraq \ninto segments controlled by terrorists or ethnic and tribal militias. \nThis would allow the terrorists to achieve one of their highest \npriorities: to turn Iraq into a safe haven for terrorists and a base \nfrom which to launch attacks against our friends and allies in the \nregion and even the American homeland.\n  The terrorists affiliated with bin Laden and Zarqawi have clearly \nstated their aim of overthrowing moderate governments throughout the \nMiddle East. We therefore would have to worry about close friends that \nhave cooperated with us in the global war on terror, such as Jordan, \nbeing transformed into terrorist regimes. The violence and instability \nthat the terrorists seek to sow in Iraq would spread throughout the \nMiddle East.\n  The terrorists have also demonstrated a strong interest in acquiring \nweapons of mass destruction for use as the ultimate terrorist tool. \nThey seek to obtain these weapons and use them against innocent \ncivilians. Given the presence in Iraq of many of Saddam Hussein's \nformer weapons scientists, an Iraq under the control of terrorists \nlikely would become a safe haven for the covert production of chemical \nand biological weapons.\n  President Bush has repeatedly stated that the potential combination \nof terrorism and weapons of mass destruction poses the greatest threat \nto the United States. The destruction of 9/11 would pale in comparison \nto the devastation terrorists could inflict with weapons of mass \ndestruction produced in Iraq and covertly slipped across Iraq's porous \nborders.\n  Cutting and running from Iraq would allow the threat posed by the \ncombination of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to \nmaterialize. This is an unacceptable risk to the American people, and \nwe simply cannot allow that to happen.\n  It is clear that those calling for an early withdrawal of American \ntroops from Iraq fail to understand the potentially catastrophic \nimplications of their proposal. Cutting and running before Iraq can \ndefend itself would pose unacceptable risks to all Americans.\n  We, our coalition partners, and the Iraqi people have come too far. \nWe cannot turn back now. We must stay until the job is done.\n  I look forward to today's debate on these amendments, and I urge my \ncolleagues to speak out against the strategy of cutting and running \nfrom Iraq. It is a strategy that guarantees failure. And failure in \nIraq is not an option.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nBond in discussing S. 2658, the National Defense Enhancement and \nNational Guard Empowerment Act of 2006. A version of this \ngroundbreaking legislation has been adopted by the Senate as an \namendment to the fiscal year 2006 Defense authorization bill.\n  Our amendment would tangibly strengthen our national security by \ngiving the National Guard more of a voice in decisionmaking and in \nensuring that our Nation is able to optimally tap the enormous \nexperience and capabilities that exist within the National Guard.\n  Today's Guard is a 2lst century military organization that is \ncarrying its weight and more in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as here \nat home, whenever disaster strikes. But today's Guard is needlessly \nfrozen in a 20th century Pentagon organization chart. The implications \nof that show up in everything from the Guard's depleted equipment \nstockpiles, to training and staffing and mission decisions. Our \namendment clears away some institutional cobwebs to let the National \nGuard be the best it can be.\n  The Bond-Leahy amendment specifically increases the rank of the chief \nof the National Guard from lieutenant general to full general. It will \nensure that the deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command come from the \nranks of the National Guard. Additionally, the bill makes the National \nGuard a joint activity of the Department of Defense, giving the \nNational Guard greater latitude to talk around the Pentagon. Finally, \nthe Guard would be given greater ability to identify gaps in \ncapabilities in our States' ability to respond to emergencies at home.\n  This amendment differs somewhat from the baseline legislation that \nSenator Bond and I introduced earlier this year. The amendment does not \ninclude a requirement that the chief of the National Guard sit on the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and we also removed the provision that would \ngive the National Guard separate budget authority. We heard some strong \nobjections from other members about these two provisions, and, as \nchairs of the wide-reaching Senate National Guard Caucus, we wanted to \ndo the best we could to accommodate every Guard supporter.\n  However, we still strongly believe in the importance of opening to \nthe chief of the National Guard Bureau a position on the Joint Staff \nand of giving to the Guard more general flexibility in procuring \nequipment to match the needs of its missions. We will fight for these \nprovisions another day.\n  Given that we have dropped the core objections that some have raised \nagainst Guard empowerment, there was absolutely no reason that any \nmember of the Senate could oppose this legislation. This amendment is \nabout fairness and effectiveness. It is about fairness in that it makes \nsure that the National Guard is not treated like a stepchild in key \nbudget and policy deliberations. Giving greater institutional standing \nto the Guard makes it a lot harder for the Guard to get short-thrift in \nthese discussions.\n  Our amendment is about effectiveness in that it will improve the use \nof the Guard in homeland security matters, which is becoming quite a \nregular phenomenon. The National Guard is being used regularly in a so-\ncalled title 32 status to increase security and provide military \ndisaster response. Under this status, the Guard serves under command \nand control of the Nation's Governors, with Federal financing. In \naddition to the recent Southern Border mission, the National Guard \nserved spectacularly during Katrina in this way, providing one of the \nmost effective responses to that disaster. By allowing the National \nGuard to talk regularly across the Department of Defense and to work \nclosely with the States to identify gaps, our amendment takes advantage \nof the knowledge of the members of the National Guard to help plug \nholes in our homeland defense. And we make this whole process for \nactivating the Guard in title 32 far smoother.\n  The National Guard is critical to the Nation's defense on a number of \nlevels. We must have the trust and confidence in this force to give \nthem more responsibility. At the same time, we simply cannot have a \nrepeat of the ill-advised recommendations from the Army and the Air \nForce that sought to slash the National Guard personnel levels. The \nArmy wanted to cut the Army Guard by more than 17,000 troops and the \nAir Guard by almost 14,000. These proposed cuts made absolutely no \nsense.\n  We need to turn this dynamic around. We cannot keep asking the Guard \nto do more for the country, and then force it to justify its existence. \nThe National Guard needs institutional standing and leadership \ncommensurate with its missions and capabilities.\n  Our National Guard stands willing to do even more to protect the \ncountry, and this amendment will give them a key tool to help them \ncontribute to the Nation's defense.\n  I thank my colleagues and friends, the chair and ranking members of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, for their support of this \namendment. We cannot afford to let our Guard down.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Levin-Reed \namendment on U.S. policy in Iraq. Before I continue, I would like to \nsay a word about our troops and their families. We owe our brave \nservicemembers and their families a debt of gratitude for their \nselfless service and great sacrifice in Iraq, over the last 3 years. \nMembers of our Armed Forces are at this moment deployed in harm's way, \nmany on their second or third deployment. They and their families \nshould know they have our wholehearted support and gratitude, with \ndeeds, not just with words. Our troops need to know, what is our exit \nstrategy?\n  In October 2002, as the Senate debated giving the President authority \nto invade Iraq, I asked whether our troops would be greeted with land \nmines or parades. Three years later, we know the answer. Our forces \nhave faced a violent insurgency and terrorist attacks that have claimed \nthe lives of 2,500 brave American servicemembers. We went to war with \nIraq, but today we find ourselves at war in Iraq. After 3 years, it is \ntime for a new approach.\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\n  Mr. President, 2006 must be a year of transition in Iraq. We want \nIraqis to lead, so we can leave. It is important for Iraqis to take \nownership of Iraq. They must provide for their own security, take \ncharge of economic development, and restore civic order. Iraq is \nbeginning to move in the right direction, but our open-ended presence \nis keeping them from making faster progress.\n  That is why I am proud to support this amendment, which calls on the \nPresident to begin reducing U.S. troop levels in Iraq by the end of \n2006. This amendment gives us a plan for a phased, structured \nwithdrawal of our troops so Iraqi forces can take control of their \ncountry in an orderly way.\n  This is not about cut and run. This is about getting out of the way \nso Iraqis can run their own country. Iraqi security and police forces \nare getting stronger by the day, and the U.S. commander in Iraq, \nGeneral George Casey, thinks it will be possible to reduce the U.S. \npresence in Iraq by as many as 30,000 troops by the end of 2006.\n  Iraqi National Security Adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, has said that \nthe removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's Government in the \neyes of its people. In an excellent article in the June 20, 2006 \nWashington Post, he details the ``road map'' for restoring security in \nIraq and reducing the presence of foreign troops. The road map's \nobjectives are similar to the benchmarks for withdrawal of U.S. forces \noutlined last year in legislation offered by Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin, which I supported.\n  Here is what Mr. Rubaie said can be done: ``With the governors of \neach province meeting these strict objectives, Iraq's ambition is to \nhave full control of the country by the end of 2008. We envisage the \nU.S. troop presence by year's end to be under 100,000, with most of the \nremaining troops to return home by the end of 2007.'' He went on to say \nthat ``. . . the removal of foreign troops will legitimize Iraq's \ngovernment in the eyes of its people. . . . [T]he draw-down of foreign \ntroops will strengthen our fledgling government to last the full four \nyears it is supposed to.'' Mr. Rubaie concluded, ``Iraq has to grow out \nof the shadow of the United States and the coalition, take \nresponsibility for its own decisions, learn from its own mistakes, and \nfind Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems, with the knowledge that our \nfriends and allies are standing by with support and help should we need \nit.'' We salute and support the position the Iraqis themselves are \ntaking. This is what the Levin-Reed amendment does. Iraqis want full \ncontrol of their country by the end of 2008, and we should help them \ntoward that goal.\n  We need to ensure that an adequate number of Iraqi Army battalions \ncan operate independently to defeat the insurgency and protect Iraq's \nborders, and we must ensure an adequate number of Iraqi police and \nsecurity units are trained and equipped to maintain law and order. The \nIraqi Government is committed to meeting these benchmarks as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, our brave men and women are serving with great honor \nin Iraq. Their service has paved the way for democratic elections and \nfor the formation of a new unity government. We are all tremendously \nproud of their accomplishments and grateful for their sacrifice. It is \ntime for the Iraqi Government to stand up, so our troops can begin to \nstand down\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nthat I intended to offer to the Defense Authorization bill to address \nthe situation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n  The amendment would have required that the United States charge, \nrepatriate, or release individuals held at Guantanamo within 180 days \nof the enactment of the Defense Authorization bill. If for some reason \nthe Government failed to comply within the timeframe provided under the \namendment, the Department of Defense would have to provide a report \nregarding why they have not complied. The amendment would not have \nclosed Guantanamo, and nothing in the amendment would have required the \nGovernment to release individuals who are a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  I think this is a reasonable approach. These are all options that the \nPresident has said that he is moving forward on. I have decided, \nhowever, not to offer my amendment at this time for a number of \nreasons. First, given the looming cloture vote, it is clear we will not \nhave time to have a full and open debate on this issue. I believed that \nthis is an important issue that deserved more time. I have also been \nadvised by other Senators that they need additional time to study the \nproposal.\n  I strongly believe that the indefinite imprisonment of persons \nwithout charges is inconsistent with the traditions and values of the \nUnited States, and that it will continue to cause difficulty in our \nrelations with other nations, including the allies that we rely on in \nconfronting the threat of terrorism.\n  As President Bush said on June 14, 2006:\n\n       No question, Guantanamo sends a signal to some of our \n     friends--provides an excuse, for example, to say the United \n     States is not upholding the values that they're trying to \n     encourage other countries to adhere to.\n\n  I think the President is right.\n  According to an article in today's Miami Herald, Retired Army GEN \nBarry McCaffery, who recently visited Guantanamo, said: ``We are in a \npolitical and legal mess that is beyond belief'' and political leaders \nneed to fix the ``legal schizophrenia'' that exists by continuing to \nhold individuals at Guantanamo.\n  I completely agree, and it is my hope that the Senate will afford \ntime to debate this issue in the near future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America has long been a beacon of human \nrights and democracy in the world. But Guantanamo demonstrates the \nadministration's disrespect for the rule of law.\n  The administration is trying to have it both ways. They claim the \ndetainees at Guantanamo are prisoners of war and thus should be held \nuntil the end of hostilities. At the same time they refuse to treat \nthem as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.\n  In the first gulf war, the International Committee of the Red Cross \nsaid that our Nation's compliance with the Geneva Conventions was the \nbest of any country in any conflict in the history of the conventions. \nSadly, this administration has presided over the steepest and deepest \nfall from grace in our Nation's history.\n  The administration did not give the detainees the field hearings \nrequired under article 5 of the conventions, when the information \nrelating to their capture was most readily available. Over 2 years \nlater, the administration created combatant status review tribunals to \nsubstitute for the field hearings they should have held.\n  It is no surprise that it is often very difficult to find the \nnecessary evidence. Yet the administration doesn't even try. The Boston \nGlobe recently reported that 34 detainees convinced officials that \noverseas witnesses would provide relevant testimony. But in every \ncase--every case--the administration said the witnesses could not be \nfound. Yet in three days, Boston Globe reporters found three out of \nfour witnesses--one of whom is teaching right here at the Pentagon's \nown National Defense University.\n  The shocking ease with which the Boston Globe located these witnesses \nsuggests that the Government didn't make an effort to find them and \nraises serious questions about the administration's good faith in \ndealing with the detainees at Guantanamo. We have an even greater \nobligation to make sure we have a strong case now, since we have \nalready kept these people for so long.\n  The administration not only ignored the law when it came to ensuring \nthat these people were properly classified, but it also failed to give \nthem the proper treatment.\n  The Geneva Conventions clearly state the standard for humane \ntreatment of prisoners of war:\n\n       No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of \n     coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from \n     them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who \n     refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed \n     to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.\n\n  This administration threw out the golden rule that had served us so \nwell for so long. Instead, they adopted new rules that allowed cruel \ntactics such as waterboarding, use of military dogs, and stress \npositions. The administration consistently overruled the objections of \nexperienced military personnel and those who represent American \ninterests abroad, including Alberto Mora, the former general counsel of \nthe Navy.\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\n  As Secretary of State Colin Powell warned the White House, ``It will \nreverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice in supporting the \nGeneva Conventions and undermine the protections of the law of war for \nour troops.'' Senior Defense officials were warned that changing the \nrules could lead to so-called ``force drift,'' in which, without \nclearer guidance, the level of force applied to an uncooperative \ndetainee might well result in torture.\n  But these wise words fell on deaf ears. Officials at the highest \nlevels of the administration viewed the rule of law as inconvenient and \nquaint. As Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary \nPowell, said, ``I don't think, in our history, we've ever had a \npresidential involvement, a secretarial involvement, a vice-\npresidential involvement, an attorney general involvement in telling \nour troops essentially carte blanche is the way you should feel.''\n  There is little doubt that some of those detainees are cold-blooded \nkillers intent on harming Americans. They should be charged for their \ncrimes and locked away. But far too many were swept up in raids by the \nAfghans and turned over to the Americans for reward money. Some were \nseized from the streets of Africa, Thailand, or Europe. As Jay Hood, \nthe former commander of Guantanamo, said, ``Sometimes we just didn't \nget the right folks.''\n  The terrorists don't obey the Geneva Conventions. But we can't win \nthe war on terror by stooping to their level. We do not win by \nrepudiating the very ideals our soldiers are fighting for. We win by \nsetting an example--by doing unto others as we would have them do unto \nus.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that we need \nto hold these people until the end of the war on terror.\n  We have created legal and literal black holes where detainees are \nbeing held without hope of receiving due process or fair and humane \ntreatment, and that is nothing short of a travesty. We criticize such \ntactics in repressive regimes for doing exactly that. It is the height \nof hypocrisy. It violates the basic principles on which our Nation was \nfounded. Indefinite detention is not the American way. We need to \nrestore our standing in the eyes of the world as a beacon of human \nrights, and the best way to start is by closing Guantanamo.\n  I understand the Senator from New Mexico was unable to get sufficient \ntime to debate his amendment and will not insist on a vote. I hope that \nhe will continue to fight for its adoption, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Bingaman amendment when it is offered again.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter that has \ntremendous potential to decrease cancer deaths among the millions of \nmilitary dependents and retirees served by the TRICARE health program. \nI am talking about colonoscopy, a medical procedure used very commonly \nto screen for colon cancer. Medical specialists tell me that \ncolonoscopy is the most accurate test for detecting colon cancer at the \nvery earliest stages, when it is highly treatable.\n  As my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee are aware, I \nhave been very concerned that DOD's TRICARE medical plan hasn't covered \ncolonoscopy to screen for colon cancer in average-risk beneficiaries \nover age 50, even though both Medicare and the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program did so. Instead, DOD's policy has been to pay for \nscreening colonoscopy to detect colon cancer only for a very narrow \ngroup of high-risk individuals. This limitation meant that many of our \nmilitary retirees and dependents have not been able to get access to \nthis sensitive cancer screening test, and as a result, they may well \nhave been subject to adverse health consequences from delayed cancer \ndetection.\n  I called this omission to the attention of the committee and \nintroduced legislation to rectify the situation. I was pleased to be \njoined in these efforts to fix this problem by Senators Mikulski and \nBingaman.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say today that DOD has done the right \nthing by modifying the TRICARE criteria for screening colonoscopy so \nthat all average-risk TRICARE beneficiaries over age 50 have access to \nthis important cancer screening test. This new policy, which is \nretroactive to procedures performed since March 15, 2006, is good news \nin the ongoing battle against colon cancer, and I would hope that DOD \nwould disseminate widely the news of the availability of this important \npreventive service.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Boxer and Bingaman in introducing an amendment to the Fiscal \nYear 2007 National Defense Authorization Act concerning the Park \nService's management of Santa Rosa Island within the Channel Islands \nNational Park.\n  I remain deeply concerned about a provision in the House version of \nthe Defense authorization bill regarding the future use of Santa Rosa \nIsland.\n  Under a binding court settlement, non-native deer and elk must be \nremoved from the island by 2011. The House language would prohibit the \nPark Service from eliminating this non-native herd by providing for a \n4-year period of intensive hunting beginning in 2008.\n  The Park Service is firmly opposed to the House provision. Nor, to my \nunderstanding, did the Department of Defense ask for the language.\n  I am particularly concerned that the House provision would waste \ntaxpayer dollars and deny public access.\n  The taxpayers paid approximately $30 million to acquire Santa Rosa \nIsland in 1986 to restore its native ecology and provide public access.\n  In addition to the $30 million, the previous owners agreed to what \nwould seem to be a fair deal: they were permitted to keep hunting and \ngrazing on the land through 2011. A court settlement in the late 1990s \nremoved the cattle immediately but reaffirmed that the non-native deer \nand elk would have to be removed by 2011.\n  Now, under the House provision, the prior owners will be able to \ncontinue charging $16,000 or more for their privately operated hunting \ntrips. Even though the Government purchased the island from them for \n$30 million in taxpayer money, they would get to keep essentially \neverything they had before and that is simply not in the public \ninterest.\n  As I said earlier, I strongly oppose the loss of public access to the \nisland. This is the public's land. It is a national park, and the \npublic should be able to visit it.\n  But these privately operated hunting trips require the closure of 90 \npercent of the island to the public for 4 to 5 months of the year, even \nsometimes during peak season.\n  Now while the House language doesn't specifically say this, I \nunderstand one of its purposes was to provide hunting opportunities for \ndisabled veterans. Yet it should be pointed out that in California \ntoday, there are already nine military installations that permit \nhunting five that can accommodate disabled service members.\n  Two of these military installations, Camp Pendleton and Vandenberg \nAir Force Base, are adjacent to the Channel Islands National Park, and \nallow disabled veterans to hunt a variety of animals including deer, \nwaterfowl, quail, feral pigs, small game, and coyote.\n  All together there are over 100 U.S. military installations where \nhunting is permitted, over 70 of which are currently accessible to \ndisabled servicemembers and veterans.\n  Consequently, I strongly believe that the Park Service should \ncontinue managing this National Park for the benefit of the general \npublic.\n  It is simply unfair to the taxpayers to allow a provision in the \nHouse version of the Defense authorization bill to impede on the \npublic's right to access the island.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, in offering the Military Family Support Act \nas an amendment to S. 2766, the fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization \nbill. This amendment would bring a small measure of relief to the \nfamilies of our men and women in uniform as they seek to maintain a \nsense of normalcy here at home while their loved ones are deployed in \nservice to our country. Our ongoing large-scale deployments in Iraq \ncontinue to demand so much from our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies. Passing this amendment is the least we can do.\n  As part of the predeployment process, military personnel with \ndependent\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\nchildren or other dependent family members, such as elderly parents who \nrequire care, designate a caregiver for their dependents. This person \nwill act in the deployed personnel's place to provide care for these \nfamily members during the period of deployment. The caregiver could be \na spouse, parent, sibling, or other responsible adult who is capable of \ncaring for, and willing to care for, the dependents in question.\n  The Jeffords-Feingold amendment would create two programs to provide \nadditional leave options for persons who have been designated as \ncaregivers. The first program would require the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM, to create a program under which Federal employees who \nare designated as caregivers could use accrued annual or sick leave, \nleave bank benefits, and other leave available to them under title 5 \nfor purposes directly relating to or resulting from their designation \nas a caregiver.\n  This amendment would also encourage the Secretary of Labor to \nestablish a voluntary program under which private sector companies \nwould create similar programs for their employees and to solicit \nparticipation from private sector companies. I commend the many \nemployers around the country for their understanding and support when \nan employee or a family member of an employee is called to active duty, \nand I hope that companies in Wisconsin and around the country will \nparticipate in this voluntary program.\n  In addition, our amendment would require the Government \nAccountability Office to report to Congress with an evaluation of both \nthe OPM program and the voluntary Department of Labor program. It is my \nhope that this evaluation will demonstrate the utility of such a leave \nprogram for designated caregivers and that these pilot programs could \nthen be expanded to the designated caregivers of additional deployed \nmilitary personnel.\n  This amendment builds on a measure that I introduced last year, S. \n798, the Military Families Leave Act. That bill would provide a similar \nbenefit to military families by allowing eligible employees whose \nspouses, parents, sons, or daughters are military personnel who are \nserving on or called to active duty in support of a contingency \noperation to use their Family and Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, benefits \nfor issues directly relating to or resulting from that deployment. \nThese instances could include preparation for deployment or additional \nresponsibilities that family members take on as a result of a loved \none's deployment, such as child care. I also introduced this bill \nduring the 108th Congress.\n  Let me be clear, that the Jeffords-Feingold amendment does not amend \nthe FMLA in any way. In fact, FMLA benefits are specifically exempted \nfrom the types of leave that can be used by designated caregivers for \npurposes directly related to or resulting from their caregiver \nresponsibilities. While I believe that the FMLA could serve as the \nbasis for providing additional leave opportunities for designated \ncaregivers, opposition in some quarters to the original FMLA makes this \na difficult proposition. I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this \nlandmark law, and I believe that the FMLA continues to provide much \nneeded assistance to millions of workers around the country as they \nseek to care for their own serious health condition or that of a family \nmember or as they welcome the birth or adoption of a child. I will \ncontinue to support this law and efforts to ensure that the vital \nbenefits that it provides are not eroded.\n  The Military Family Support Act is endorsed by the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, NGAUS, the National Military Family \nAssociation, NMFA, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of \nthe United States, EANGUS, the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, MOAA, and the National Partnership for Women and Families.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for his work on this \nimportant measure, and I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for agreeing to accept this amendment\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to the \n2007 Defense authorization bill which I cosponsored with my esteemed \ncolleague from California, Senator Barbara Boxer. I also thank my other \ncolleagues who have joined us in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  It is my strong belief that all prisoners of war who die in captivity \nshould be eligible for the Purple Heart, regardless of the cause of \ndeath, for they all will have paid the ultimate price. Approximately \n17,000 prisoners of war--including fine servicemembers from my own \ngreat State of Maine--have died while in captivity since December 7, \n1941--the start of World War II. More than 8,100 Korean war \nservicemen--46 from Maine--and more than 1,800 Americans--14 from \nMaine--remain unaccounted for from Vietnam.\n  In rightful honor of all our prisoners of war, I am proud to be co-\noffering this amendment to the DOD authorization bill that would bestow \nthe Purple Heart upon those Americans who perished while held captive \nas a result of starvation, disease, or maltreatment. Currently, only \nprisoners of war who die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted \nby an instrument of war--such as a gunshot wound or intentional \npoisoning--are eligible for posthumous Purple Heart recognition. Those \nwho die of starvation, disease, or other causes during captivity are \nnot.\n  How can we say that anyone who dies at the hands of our enemy doesn't \ndeserve this mark of respect and honor from a grateful nation--whether \nthey make the ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield or behind barbed \nwire? They fought for America and died at the hands of our enemy--what \nmore do we need to know and what more could they have given than their \nvery lives? They and their families have earned this honor.\n  The intent of this amendment is to correct this injustice by \nrequiring the President, our Commander in Chief, to review the current \ncircumstances establishing eligibility for the Purple Heart and advise \nCongress on modifications to the criteria for the Purple Heart award, \nwhich I strongly believe should take into account such inhuman war \ntactics as the deliberate withholding of medical treatment for injury \nor disease by enemy forces.\n  Last month, the House Armed Services Committee adopted their version \nof the Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act--which had 216 \ncosponsors--during committee markup of the Defense authorization bill. \nThe Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act has been endorsed by a number \nof prominent military and veterans organizations, including the \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple \nHeart, Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW/MIA \nFamilies, and the Tiger Survivors.\n  The posthumous awarding of the Purple Heart Award to members of the \narmed services who died while in captivity or died due to injury or \nillness incurred while in captivity would be of only some comfort to \nthe next of kin of these fine service men and women. I sincerely hope \nthat the Senate Armed Service Committee will follow suit by taking \nsimilar action as the House and adopt this legislation\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6274-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. TALENT.

Indeed, \nit is the very first clause of the first amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution:\n  ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''\n  As George Washington wrote in his letter to the United Baptist \nChamber of Virginia, May of 1789: ``Every man, conducting himself as a \ngood citizen,\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\nand being accountable to God alone for his religious opinions, ought to \nbe protected in worshiping the Deity according to the dictates of his \nown conscience.''\n  We are blessed to live in a country built on freedom of conscience, \nthought, and action. Waves and waves of hopeful aspirants have flocked \nto these shores to exercise this basic human right.\n  But in every era, religious freedom, like all other freedoms, has \ncome under challenge. And in every era, we have been called upon to \npromote and defend religious liberty here at home and in faraway lands. \nWe do so as a matter of principle. Freedom of conscience and religion \nis the most basic, fundamental human right. No person should be \npersecuted, imprisoned or harmed because of their personal faith. But \nas 9/11 showed us with such terrible force, we also do so as a matter \nof national security.\n  I thank Senator Santorum for bringing this topic front and center to \nCapitol Hill yesterday, along with his distinguished panelists.\n  We heard from the eminent U.N. Ambassador John Bolton on the gains \nthat are being made around the globe. We also heard from courageous \ndissidents, including Dr. Wafa Sultan and Eli El-Khoury, who have \nsuffered for their faith and been persecuted for their convictions.\n  America must remain ever vigilant to the threats, challenges, and \nopportunities we face. From North Korea to the troubled Middle East, \nfor millions of people, religious liberty is still a fragile hope they \nlook to us to nurture.\n  It is our duty as Americans and our honor as sons and daughters of \nthe greatest revolution and the ongoing American experiment in ordered \nliberty and religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6275-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MANNY CORTEZ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when people around the world think of my \nhome State of Nevada, their first thoughts are usually of Las Vegas.\n  Around the world, people know us for our first-class entertainment \nand resorts, our world-class dining, and for slogans like ``what \nhappens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.'' But what most people don't know is \nthat Las Vegas is the city it is today because of the hard work of one \nman--Manny Cortez. Manny was a friend, and it is with great sadness \nthat I come to the chamber today to pay tribute to his life. He passes \naway from a heart attack on Sunday. He was 67.\n  Manny Cortez achieved so much in life. He served on the Clark County \nCommission, the Taxi Authority, and in the district attorney's office. \nHe was, however, best known as the president of the Las Vegas \nConvention and Visitors Authority. He held this post for 13 years, from \n1991 to 2004. Under Manny's tenure, Las Vegas went from seeing 21 \nmillion visitors a year to more than 35 million, from 1.8 convention \ndelegates to nearly 6 million, and from 73,000 hotel rooms to 140,000 \nhotel rooms.\n  As his successor on the convention board, Rossi Ralenkotter, said: \nManny was one of the cornerstones that made Las Vegas the success it is \ntoday.\n  Former Clark County Commissioner Paul Christensen has echoed that \nsentiment, saying: Putting Manny Cortez in charge of the (convention \nauthority) was one of the better moves we ever made. He never ever told \nyou he would so something that he wouldn't back up.\n  Throughout his life, Manny was recognized as an astute marketer and \nbusinessman. For example, he was named Person of the Year by Travel \nMagazine in 1999. He was past president of the Boys and Girls Clubs in \nLas Vegas. He served on a number of boards. But for all his \nachievements and success, I think the Las Vegas community will remember \nManny more for being a leader and good man.\n  In Monday's Las Vegas Sun, Editor Brian Greenspun shares this \nrecollection of Manny.\n\n       When the late Gov. Mike O'Callaghan appointed Manny to the \n     Taxi Authority, he said that in Manny he had a man who cared \n     about people and about doing what was right. Manny lived that \n     obligation throughout his life.\n\n  That is how I will remember Manny too, as a good man who always did \nthe right thing.\n  Manny--like Las Vegas--was a true American success story. He was born \nin Las Cruces, NM. His father was a baker. His mother was a retailer. \nThey moved to Las Vegas when Manny was 5. A product of Las Vegas \nschools, he held a degree from Nevada Southern University. He didn't \nstart at the top, but he ended up there.\n  Manny leaves behind his wife Joanna, two daughters, Catherine and \nCynthia, and two grandchildren, Andrew and Christina. Today, Mr. \nPresident, our prayers are with them.\n  Many is gone. He will be missed. And his presence will be felt by \neveryone who visits Las Vegas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6275-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IMPROVING SERVICES FOR HOMELESS VETERANS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to \nimprove services for homeless veterans, and prevent chronic \nhomelessness amongst our returning servicemen and women in the war on \nterror. This bill will expand the housing and services available to our \nNation's homeless veterans and their dependents, and improve the \nability of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to provide health \ncare services to this same group of deserving Americans. I will take a \nfew moments now to explain the provisions of this legislation.\n  Public Law 107-95 was the last comprehensive homeless veterans \nassistance act signed into law. A number of the authorizations in that \nlaw, aimed at preventing and reducing homelessness amongst veterans, \nhave expired or will expire this year. In March, I held a hearing on \nthese needs, at which VA, its Federal partners, and community-based \nservice providers to the homeless testified about what is working, what \nisn't, what duplication might be eliminated, and where deficiencies \nexist that must be addressed.\n  At the hearing, we learned that this year alone, more than a half \ndozen Federal agencies will devote over $2 billion to homelessness. VA \nalone will spend upward of $221 million on grants, housing and \ntreatment of underlying conditions. In fact, the budget the Senate \npassed included record-level funding for the sixth straight year for \ntargeted programs for homeless veterans. These figures do not include \nthe total costs of the law enforcement and emergency medical treatment \nfor the homeless, which are astounding.\n  Plainly stated, America's chronically homeless are some of the most \nexpensive people in communities across this country, yet they live \nlives no one wants to imagine having. We must ensure that our resources \nare invested carefully so that homeless veterans can resume their self-\nsufficiency and independence. I believe this bill will help us realize \nthis shared goal.\n  Among other things, this measure extends the authorization of \nappropriations for comprehensive services for homeless veterans, a \ngrant program for homeless veterans with special needs, a technical \nassistance program, and extends the authority of the Advisory Committee \non Homeless Veterans. It also extends the authority of the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to transfer properties obtained through foreclosures \nof Department home mortgages to certain organizations to assist \nhomeless veterans and their families in acquiring shelter. The bill \nalso includes the authorization of appropriations for a program \ndesigned to prevent homelessness by providing financial assistance to \neligible entities to provide and coordinate the provision of supportive \nservices for very low-income veteran families occupying permanent \nhousing.\n  I am pleased to introduce the Comprehensive Homeless Veterans \nAssistance and Prevention Act of 2006 along with my committee ranking \nmember, Senator Akaka, as well as two committee members who have been \nparticularly active on issues facing homeless veterans, Senators Burr \nand Obama.\n  Over the coming days, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will be \ntaking up this bill and other legislation introduced to improve the \nrange of services and benefits available to our Nation's veterans. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues throughout the rest of this \nCongress on these and other important efforts.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6276-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n            GRATITUDE FOR KATRINA VOLUNTEERS IN MISSISSIPPI\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the way the American people responded to the \nloss and suffering wrought by Hurricane Katrina was probably \nunprecedented and surely unforgettable. We in Mississippi, and our \nneighbors elsewhere along the gulf coast, will always remember the aid, \nthe labor, the rescues, the prayers--everything our fellow citizens did \nto bring us through that terrible ordeal.\n  I wish it were possible to acknowledge every individual who came to \nassist us when we most needed them, but that honor roll is far too long \nfor the Congressional Record. Moreover, their names, I am sure, are \ninscribed in a more important book, and their lasting reward will be \nmuch greater than our praise.\n  I do want to take note of one particular group of volunteers from the \nState of North Carolina. On short notice, on September 2, 2005, more \nthan 90 health care professionals left their homes and their jobs to \ncome to Hancock County, where Katrina had left the towns of Waveland \nand Bay St. Louis in ruins. Because Hancock Regional Hospital was \nflooded, the Carolina volunteers created a field hospital that operated \nfor 2 months and cared for more than 7,000 patients. During that time, \nmore than 400 doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other health care \nprofessionals rotated through the facility, caring for local residents \nuntil Hancock Regional Hospital could again admit patients.\n  These men and women selflessly served the people of Mississippi \nduring one of the worst disasters ever to confront our country. One of \nthem, I should point out, is part of the Senate's extended family. \nChris Ogden, an RN, is the daughter of our own Joy Ogden, manager of \nthe Senate's Appointments Desk at the North Door of the Capitol.\n  To Chris, and to the more than 400 like her who brought hope and \ncomfort to Hancock County, I offer the heartfelt gratitude of all the \npeople of Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6276-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ntremendous public servant for his good work in leading an important \nFederal Government program for the past several years. Jim Williams, \nwho currently holds the position of Director of the US-VISIT Program at \nthe Department of Homeland Security, will soon leave this position to \nbecome the Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service at the \nGeneral Services Administration.\n  There's little question that the Department's loss will be the \nCommission's gain. However, the good news is that one of our most \naccomplished, capable and experienced federal employees will continue \nserving his country.\n  In May 2003, Jim Williams took over as Director of the US-VISIT \nProgram, a critical border-management program that collects point-of-\nentry and exit information on visitors entering and exiting the United \nStates. The program uses biometric identifiers--digital finger scans \nand photographs--to make entering the United States easier for \nlegitimate tourists, students, and business travelers, while making it \nmore difficult for those who might do us harm to enter and stay in the \nUnited States illegally. Hundreds of thousands of visitors cross the \nTexas border each year, and the US-VISIT system has improved security \nwithout slowing down legal trade and tourism.\n  Mr. Williams' job was to develop a solid foundation of policies and \npractices that would guide the program for the foreseeable future. It \nwas a critical moment for the program, and Mr. Williams skillfully \nseized this opportunity. In a little more than 2 years, Mr. Williams \nhelped develop US-VISIT into a viable program. Mr. Williams built the \nteam that developed and deployed the effort, which today is crucial to \nour immigration and border-management system.\n  Under Mr. Williams' leadership, US-VISIT has met its congressional \ndeadlines on time and under budget and has helped establish the \nfoundation of the U.S. Government's 21st century immigration and \nborder-management system.\n  Jim Williams is a model public servant and leader. He has left a \ntremendous imprint on the US-VISIT Program and on the many people who \nwork with him at US-VISIT and across the Government. Because of his \nleadership, US-VISIT has cultivated a talented team that will guide the \nprogram in the years ahead. They will continue to help overcome the \nchallenges that face our Nation, and Mr. Williams will continue to \nprovide the American people with the very best of Government service. \nWe wish Mr. Williams well and thank him for his continued service to \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6276-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RETIREMENT OF AIR FORCE CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT GERALD R.

He served this great \nNation in assignments in the States of Texas, Florida, South Carolina, \nWashington, Hawaii, Washington, DC, and also served overseas in Turkey, \nJapan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia in support of operations Desert Storm \nand Southern Watch.\n  As the 14th Chief Master Sergeant appointed to the highest \nnoncommissioned officer position, Gerald R.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of Bill and Rose Mary Mooney Brooks on July 6, 2006. Their \nlife together truly represents the American ideal. They met when Bill, \nan Army captain, took a weekend leave, with his fellow officer and best \nbuddy Lewis Mooney. Lew introduced Bill to his younger sister Rose Mary \nthat weekend in Philadelphia. Shortly after the war ended, they were \nmarried and Rose Mary and Bill returned to his home State where they \nmade their home in Sioux Falls, SD. There they built a construction \nbusiness and a family. Quite a family in fact, their first child and \nonly daughter Barbara has shared my life for the last 37 years. Barbara \nwas followed by six sons, Theodore, Robert, Ronald, Raymond, Richard, \nand Stephen.\n  During their years together, their business, Brooks Construction, and \nlater Brooks Concrete, was always known for quality work but, most \nimportantly, for integrity. Bill was also a founding officer of the \nSouth Dakota Air National Guard where he served until he retired as a \nlieutenant colonel. Then, as now, guard service required sacrifice. \nDuring the Korean war, Bill had to leave his new business and move his \nyoung family to Duluth, MN, where, once again, he served his country.\n  They were active members and leaders in their church where Rose Mary \nenjoyed singing in the choir. Her Irish sensibilities and intelligence \ngave her grace and wit in raising the children. They were strong \nsupporters of whatever their seven children chose to participate. \nWhether it was a starring role on the football team, an all-day \nwrestling meet, a lead in a musical, or one line in a class play, Bill \nand Rose Mary were in the stands. Their children will tell you that \nthey were and are wonderful parents.\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\n  There are many American ideals that apply to Bill and Rose Mary. \nTheir love story truly captures the American dream and I am proud to be \npart of their family, and honored to offer my congratulations on their \n60th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6277-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF MOBRIDGE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Mobridge, SD. Mobridge is a beautiful \ncommunity located on the Missouri River, with friendly people and a \nstrong local economy.\n  Long before the settlers arrived, the site of Mobridge was inhabited \nby mound dwellers. Following the mound dwellers were the Woodland \nIndians, who in turn were followed by the Mandan and Arikaras. The \nSioux Indians arrived later, coming from the East. In the late 1800s \nsettlers began moving onto the land that eventually became the site of \nMobridge. General S.E. Olson owned the land on which the city was \nbuilt. The idea that Mobridge should be the place where the Milwaukee \nRailroad met the Missouri River came to him while goose hunting. The \nname ``Mobridge'' came from the abbreviating of ``Missouri Bridge.'' \nThe Milwaukee Railroad reached Mobridge on September 9, 1906. A.H. \nBrown contributed materially to give Mobridge a convention center and \nmarketplace. Monuments can still be found around the town, including \nthe A.H. Brown Library, the Mascot Theatre, the Mobridge Wholesale \nbuilding, and the Brown Palace Apartments.\n  Mobridge offers immense opportunities to those who enjoy the \noutdoors. With Lake Oahe near the city, Mobridge is able to hold \nnational and regional fishing tournaments every year. The area also \npresents many good hunting opportunities, as well.\n  In Mobridge, there is a school, library, nursing home, three clinics, \na beautiful nine-hole golf course, municipal airport, three parks, an \noutdoor swimming pool, the Mobridge Tribune, and 12 churches along with \nmany other thriving businesses.\n  Each year Mobridge offers events such as parades, carnivals, and \nrodeos. The Lewis and Clark Renaissance Festival reenacts the visit of \nthe famous explorers to the area, and local jazz bands can often be \nheard entertaining in the gazebos of parks.\n  The city will be celebrating this memorable occasion July 1st through \nthe 4th with events such as a pancake breakfast, a school reunion, a \ndance, rodeo, parade, and fireworks along with other various \nactivities. This celebration is an appropriate way to honor the past \nand a chance to look toward the future. I am pleased to recognize the \nachievements of Mobridge and to offer my congratulations to the \nresidents of the community on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6277-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF CROCKER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Crocker, SD.\n  A cafe was the first business to open in Crocker in 1906. The cafe \nwas soon followed by the Lambert Lumber Company and the Crocker State \nBank. Eventually the town expanded to include a clothing store, pool \nhall, drug store, hardware farm machinery store, and a blacksmith. The \nfirst train ran through Crocker in 1907. Soon there were four trains a \nday, with a sleeper on one train en route to Minneapolis. The post \noffice was established on February 6, 1907. The first Crocker school \nwas moved into the town in 1908, on the corner of Vera Street and Third \nAvenue.\n  Today the Crocker Lutheran Church, which was founded in 1917, still \nremains a thriving place for its congregation.\n  I am proud to publicly honor Crocker on this memorable occasion. \nSmall communities like Crocker are part of the backbone of our great \nState and help to preserve our agricultural roots and deep-seated \ncharacter. After 125 years, Crocker still exemplifies what it means to \nbe a great South Dakota community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6277-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF MOUNT VERNON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of Mount Vernon, SD.\n  Mount Vernon, originally named ``Arlandton,'' is thought to be named \nby a Virginian or someone who had wanted to pay tribute to George \nWashington's estate. The town plat was recorded in 1882 around the same \ntime period that John Pease established the Mount Vernon Gazette. \nClosely following this, a hardware store, livery stable, lumber yard, \ndrug store, cigar manufactory, hotel, and various other firms were \nestablished. Mount Vernon's survival, like many South Dakota \ncommunities, was largely dependent on the newly constructed railroad.\n  The community endured a fair share of hardship during the early \nyears. In 1888, a ferocious blizzard caused conditions so intense that \npeople froze to death just a few feet from shelter. Then in 1889, a \nfire burned down 53 buildings in the fledgling town and caused damage \nto many more. However, the community spirit was resilient, and the \nresidents rebuilt.\n  Mount Vernon currently holds an estimated population of 477 citizens. \nIt is still home to many thriving businesses, as well as the high \nschool's Mount Vernon Mustangs.\n  I am pleased to announce that Mount Vernon celebrated its 125th \nanniversary with a community celebration on June 16 to 18. There were \nnumerous events scheduled, including a petting zoo, tractor show, golf \ntournament, and parade. This celebration was a fitting way to recognize \nMount Vernon's long and productive history.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Mount Vernon continues to be a \nvital community and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to \npublicly honor Mount Vernon on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6277-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF WEBSTER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Webster, SD. Webster \nis a vibrant community and an asset to the State of South Dakota. It is \nthe county seat of Day County.\n  Webster is an excellent destination for outdoorsmen. Hunters will \nfind an abundance of ringneck pheasant, as well as many duck varieties, \nCanada geese, and doves. Anglers will enjoy the excellent fishing at \nnearby Waubay Lake and many other area glacial lakes. For the winter \nmonths, miles of snowmobiling trails run around the town and the rest \nof Day County. It truly is ``a place for all seasons.''\n  Webster also boasts a variety of manmade attractions. The Blue Dog \nLake Fish Hatchery opened in 1982, and it is the only cool and warm \nwater fish hatchery in South Dakota. The facility sits on scenic Blue \nDog Lake, which has a variety of hiking trails and outdoor facilities. \nWebster is also home to the Day County Museum and the Museum of \nWildlife, Science & Industry. Residents benefit from the services of \nsix churches, a golf course, the Webster Reporter & Farmer, and a \nvariety of other businesses.\n  Today, Webster is a credit to South Dakota and our way of life. The \ntown has just constructed a new high school to help educate its next \ngeneration of young people and to ensure the vibrancy and vitality of \nthe Webster community for years to come. The people of Webster will \ncelebrate their town's 125th anniversary from July 27 through the 30.

Sioux Falls is \nthe largest city in South Dakota and growing at a phenomenal rate. \nSioux Falls is a progressive and diverse community with all the \nopportunities normally associated large metropolitan areas and the \nfriendliness of a small town. I offer my congratulations to the people \nof Sioux Falls on this momentous occasion.\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\n  The waterfalls for which Sioux Falls is named have long been an \nattractive feature. Burial mounds have been found near the site dating \nas far back as 500 B.C. The area was settled by Europeans in the 1850s, \nwhen two groups made claims to land around the falls. Fort Dakota was \nestablished in 1865, and shortly thereafter the town began to blossom. \nThe railroads arrived in the 1880s, and over the course of the decade \nthe population leapt from 2,164 to 10,167. Other major events for the \narea include the opening of the John Morrell plant in 1909, \nestablishment of an airbase in 1942, and the conclusion of construction \nof the interstate highways in the early 1960s.\n  Modern Sioux Falls boasts a wide variety of educational, cultural, \nartistic, and recreational opportunities. The city has offerings from \nboth public and private universities, including Augustana University \nand the University of Sioux Falls, as well as many specialized and \ntechnical schools for those seeking to further their educational goals. \nThe city is served by the Argus Leader newspaper. The Old Courthouse \nMuseum and the Pettigrew Museum are major attractions, as is the \nhistoric downtown area generally. The Washington Pavilion of Arts and \nScience, the Great Plains Zoo, and St. Joseph's Cathedral are only a \nsmall sample of the interesting places and activities in Sioux Falls.\n  Sioux Falls is celebrating its sesquicentennial with a variety of \nevents over the summer, such as ``150 Candles!'', a musical tribute to \nthe history of Sioux Falls; historic building tours; a sesquicentennial \ngala ball; a performance by He Sapa Dancers and Lakota Drum Group; a \ncommemorative Sioux Falls Canaries baseball game and fireworks display; \nand a parade ending at Falls Park with a community picnic to follow. \nThese activities will serve as a reminder of the shared history of the \ncommunity and bring the close-knit people of Sioux Falls even closer \ntogether.\n  This anniversary is a significant milestone for Sioux Falls. After \n150 years, the city is stronger than ever. I am pleased to publicly \nhonor the achievements of this wonderful South Dakota community as they \nreach this juncture. As the slogan of the community celebration states, \nthe citizens of Sioux Falls are ``Honoring the Past, Shaping the \nFuture.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6278-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CENTENNIAL OF THE FOUNDING OF ORTLEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \ncentennial of the founding of the community of Ortley, SD.\n  Ortley is situated in the southwestern corner of Roberts County. \nOrtley was established on the Sisseton Wahpeton Indian Reservation when \nC.E. Anderson purchased the land in 1906. The town was originally named \nAnderson Townsite. However, the name was later changed to Ortley to \ncorrespond with the name of the township in which it is located. The \ntown was incorporated in 1907, and the first elected trustees were C.E. \nAnderson, Paul Halvorson, and D.L. Branum.\n  One year after the land was purchased, Ortley experienced an immense \nbuilding boom. In 1907, a railway company established a depot and \nstockyard in the town. A labor yard, meat market, hotel, bank, hardware \nstore, and general stores were also constructed. In the area in which \nOrtley is located the principal industries have been farming, raising \nlivestock, and dairying.\n  Small towns like Ortley add to the character of our wonderful State. \nI am pleased to announce that Ortley will be celebrating its centennial \non July 1, 2006. There are numerous events scheduled, including a car \nand motorcycle show, parade, softball game, and barbeque.\n  A hundred years after its founding, Ortley continues to be a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to honor the \nachievements of Ortley on this memorable occasion. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6278-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CENTENNIAL OF THE FOUNDING OF STRATFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \ncentennial of the founding of the city of Stratford, SD. A latecomer in \ninclusion into Brown County, Stratford sprung up rapidly in just weeks.\n  Stratford was founded 100 years ago on the Minneapolis and St. Louis \nrailways. Stratford was a convenient commuter system to many of its \nneighboring cities at the time. In just 5 years, Stratford reached its \npeak population of 600.\n  Stratford is one of South Dakota's classic small towns. It has been \nthe home of industry and farm-related businesses, and its meat market \nis known for its homemade sausages, hams, and liverwurst. The Taylor \nHoney Company, which processes about a million pounds of honey \nannually, was established in 1955 and is still a booming business. The \ncommunity created Stratford's volunteer fire protection in 1911, and \nthe post office and Badger Hole, a cafe and bar, are open to this day.\n  A hundred years after its founding, Stratford continues to be a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to South Dakota. I am proud to honor the \nachievements of Stratford on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6278-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CENTENNIAL OF THE FOUNDING OF WECOTA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \ncentennial of the founding of the town of Wecota, SD. The town, with \nits five streets and five avenues, is a place of great charm and \ncharacter.\n  Wecota became a town when the Minneapolis and St. Louis railroad was \ncompleted. Although small, Wecota has had a rich history. The first \nbuilding to be established in the community was a small schoolhouse. A \nyear later, the town's post office was organized, which stayed in \noperation for 75 years. Of the original buildings that were built, a \ndepot, school, bank, and elevators remain to this day.\n  The town has subsisted through many hardships. In 1919, a fire \ndestroyed two grocery stores and the meat market. Then in 1926 a \ndestructive hailstorm damaged most of the community's crops. After the \nhailstorm, many of Wecota's residents began to drift to other towns, \nthough a core of dedicated residents still occupies the town.\n  The name ``Wecota'' is derived from an Indian word meaning \n``friendship,'' and the town holds true to its name. A hundred years \nafter its founding, Wecota continues to be a great asset to South \nDakota. I am proud to honor the achievements of Wecota on this \nmemorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6278-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6278-S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF TEA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n100th anniversary of the founding of Tea, SD. Tea is enriched with a \nvibrant history reaching back to the growth of the railroads and \ncontinuing to the present, with Tea now being the fastest growing city \nin the State.\n  Tea's unusual name was discovered when the community was asked to \nsubmit 10 town names to the Postal Service but only 9 could be decided \nupon. A recess was called during a town meeting at which tea was \nserved. Someone suggested the name ``Tea'' be added to the list. \nShortly after, this tight-knit community was informed that their new \nname would be Tea. Tea was officially incorporated in 1906.\n  Tea's first bank was opened in 1900 in the place that is now \nO'Toole's bar. Unfortunately, the bank went broke in 1922 prior to the \nDepression. Despite the failure of the bank, Tea developed beautifully \nwith its own post office, schoolhouse, cafes, general store, and \nlumberyard. Woodman Hall was the center of the town's social \nactivities, hosting everything from roller skating to school plays. \nMore recently, a new high school was opened in August 2005 and is a \npoint of pride for the community. Tea is currently served by the Tea-\nHarrisburg Champion newspaper.\n  I congratulate Tea in achieving 100 wonderful years. During the week \nof June 10, the community gathered to celebrate with a Wild West Show, \nthe coronation of Ma and Pa Teapot and Ecumenical church service. This \ncelebration tied the community together even tighter, as they \ncommemorated their history and looked to their future.\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n  One century after its inception, Tea continues to be a valuable \naddition to the State of South Dakota and source of pride for all those \nwho live there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6279-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF PLANKINTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the city of Plankinton, SD. As the \ncounty seat of Aurora County, this progressive community has been a \ncenter of commercial and civic activity since its inception.\n  This vibrant community was laid out by General Lawler of the \nMilwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, after he purchased the land \nfrom the founding settler, Ira Wooden. The town was named ``Merrill'' \ninitially but was later changed to Plankinton after a wealthy Milwaukee \nmeat packer. The original town plat was eight blocks north of the \nrailway and three to the south. In August of 1880, the first building \nwas erected: a one-story frame building about 12 feet by 20 feet in \nsize, which became a saloon. A post office and bank were constructed \nshortly thereafter.\n  Now Plankinton is home to three churches; a thriving business \ncommunity, including the South Dakota Mail weekly newspaper; and \nexcellent hunting and fishing. The new high school building is a point \nof regional pride, having been built following a tragic fire at the \nformer building. Home to the South Dakota State Training School for \nmany years, that campus awaits possible redevelopment.\n  I am pleased to announce that Plankinton will be celebrating its \n125th anniversary with a community celebration on June 23 to June 25. \nThere are numerous events scheduled including a golf tournament, time \ncapsule opening, demolition derby, and a parade. This celebration is a \nfitting way to recognize Plankinton's long and productive history.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Plankinton continues to be a vital \ncommunity and a great asset to the wonderful State of South Dakota. I \nam proud to publicly honor Plankinton on this memorable \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6279-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF HARTFORD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of the town of Hartford, SD. Home to over \n2,000 residents, Hartford is a vibrant and flourishing town.\n  The area was originally known as Oaksville, after an early settler, \nI.E. Oakes. However, in 1879, the Oaksville train depot was renamed \n``Hartford'' by two travelers from Hartford, CT. The settlement took \nshape in 1881, when a post office was established. Stores, hotels, \ngrain warehouses, and other businesses soon followed. In 1896, the \ncitizens of Hartford petitioned the county commissioners to hold an \nelection to incorporate the area as the ``Town of Hartford.'' After \nholding an election, the town was divided into three districts and \ntrustees were elected.\n  Hartford's city motto, ``Hartford on the Right Road,'' captures the \nprogressive nature of the community. The city is located just west of \nSioux Falls, in Minnehaha County, and has a volunteer fire department, \nlaw enforcement, churches, and many civic organizations. In addition to \nthe many businesses already located in Hartford, the Hartford Area \nDevelopment Corporation is working to bring even more commerce and \nindustry to the area. The community is served by the Hartford Area News \nweekly newspaper. In downtown Hartford, the Hartford Area Veterans \nMemorial honors all the men and women of Hartford who have served our \ncountry in a war.\n  Hartford celebrated its 125th anniversary with a Quasquicentennial \nJamboree Celebration from June 1 to June 4. There were carnivals, \nparades, softball tournaments, golf tournaments, and even paintball and \nXBOX tournaments. The celebration reflected the enthusiasm the \nresidents of Hartford have toward commemorating the history of their \nwonderful community.\n  More than a century after its founding, Hartford continues to be a \ngreat asset to South Dakota. I am proud to honor the achievements of \nHartford on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6279-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF HOWARD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of Howard, SD. Howard is a progressive \ncommunity, offering many opportunities to a variety of people, and is \nalso the county seat of Miner County.\n  The city of Howard is the first municipality to own and operate their \nown wind turbines to supply electricity to the entire city. In recent \nyears, it has become a regional economic development leader through \nefforts such as the Miner County Community Revitalization and the new \nRural Learning Center. These are examples of the innovative and \nprogressive ideas abounding in Howard. Though agriculture is the \nprimary driver of Howard's economy, the community has found many ways \nto diversify. In particular, Howard has developed an excellent local \ntechnology infrastructure, helping to attract new businesses. The \ncommunity is served by the Miner County Pioneer newspaper.\n  In addition to this healthy business climate, Howard boasts some of \nthe world's best hunting and fishing. In the third week in October, \nsportsmen come from around the globe to hunt pheasant in this hotspot. \nHoward is also near Lake Thompson, the largest natural lake in South \nDakota, and home to excellent walleye fishing.\n  Howard is celebrating its 125th anniversary with a variety of events. \nThe festivities start with an all-school reunion, including students, \nalumni, and faculty at Howard or St. Agatha schools. Other events \ninclude a road race, parade, children's games, baseball, music, and \nfireworks. The events will be held on July 1st through the 4th.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Howard remains a vital community \nand a great asset to the wonderful State of South Dakota. I am pleased \nto honor this lively city on such a memorable occasion, and offer my \ncongratulations on this historic milestone. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6279-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO ALABAMA'S VESTAVIA HILLS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

Vestavia Hills High School placed fourth in \nthe national We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national \nfinals, held in Washington, DC. This impressive competition, headed by \nthe Center for Civic Education, engaged young people in the fundamental \nideals and values of American constitutional government.\n  Members of this remarkable team from Vestavia Hills included Grace \nAnthony, Georgiy Bolshinskiy, Barrett Bowdre, Courtney Bragg, Jeannette \nDooley, Daniel Driscoll, Claire Foster, Sarah Graffeo, Lauren Howard, \nSarah McKibben, Patrick Mulligan, John Nicholson, Tiffany Parrish, \nHanna Perry, John Phillips, Joseph Siegelman, Mary Kendal Spires, \nWilliam Edward Stevenson, Emily Unnasch, Amy Watson, Ryan Woodford, and \nAnsley Zarra.\n  I congratulate Amy Maddox, the teacher who led this fine team. \nTeachers shape the future, and I appreciate Ms. Maddox's investment in \nthese students. As a former educator and the father of three children, \nI have a great admiration for educators, and I am grateful that \neducators like Ms. Maddox are making a difference.\n  I thank U.S. District Judge Karon Bowdre for her involvement and \nsupport of the Vestavia Hills High School team. Judge Bowdre is a \nperson of great intellectual and academic ability who understands and \nreveres our Constitution. I am very proud that she has given of her \ntalents to this worthy project.\n  I thank Janice Cowin, the executive director of the Alabama Center \nfor Law and Civic Education.\n  I applaud the efforts of students, teachers, and community leaders \nwho made this accomplishment possible. Vestavia Hills High School is an \nexceptional school and has represented Alabama well. I encourage these \nstudents to continue pursuing a deep understanding of the Constitution \nand our Government. It is important that we raise up quality leaders \nwho will serve our country in years to come.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6280-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6280]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1285.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Enzi, and \n        Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3546. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to serious adverse event reporting for dietary supplements \nand nonprescription drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to rise with my colleague, \nSenator Durbin, to introduce S. 3546, the Dietary Supplement and \nNonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act.\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\nWe are joined in this effort by Senators Harkin, Enzi, and Kennedy.\n  As my colleagues are aware, over half our population regularly uses \ndietary supplements. In fact, one government survey in 2004 indicated \nthat nearly 60 percent of Americans regularly use dietary supplements \nto maintain or improve their healthy lifestyles.\n  Nearly 12 years ago, Senator Harkin and I joined with then-\nRepresentative Bill Richardson to author the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act, DSHEA, which sets out the framework by which the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, regulates dietary supplements.\n  Since that time, the industry has grown. By some estimates, it is a \n$20 billion industry today.\n  Critics of the industry see this growth as a negative, as an \nindication that the industry is ``unregulated.'' I disagree. I think \nthe growth of dietary supplement sales is testimony to a vibrant \nindustry that is producing positive benefits for our economy and our \npeople.\n  This is an industry that is largely comprised of men and women of \ngood will, who want to provide the public with healthy products.\n  Let me hasten to add that we all recognize there are bad actors in \nthe supplement industry, those who break the law and mislead consumers. \nThey should be the subject of swift and sure punishment by the FDA and \nthe Federal Trade Commission. Their products should be removed from the \nmarketplace and the full weight of the law should be brought down on \nthese bad actors.\n  It is no secret that the FDA is a woefully underfunded agency, which \nwill be the first to admit that its oversight of the dietary supplement \nindustry has not been as aggressive as it could be, in part due to a \nlack of resources. For several years, Senator Harkin and I have worked \nto rectify that shortcoming, and we are gratified that our Utah \ncolleague, Senator Bennett, chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, has joined hands with us to infuse some badly needed \nresources into the FDA.\n  When DSHEA was being debated in the Congress, one of the major points \nof contention was the belief by some that dietary supplements should be \nsubject to premarket approval by the government. That would sound the \ndeath-knell for this industry, an industry that is largely comprised of \nproducts which have been sold safely for decades, if not centuries in \nmany cases.\n  In 1994, the Senate agreed not once, but twice, to approve DSHEA by \nunanimous consent. The House also passed this bill by UC. It was not \ncontroversial.\n  Members recognized that supplements are largely safe. But just to \nmake doubly sure there was adequate regulation, we provided the FDA \nwith an arsenal of tools to take action against problematic products.\n  Then comes ephedra.\n  I do not think it is a constructive exercise to rehash the history of \nephedra. There were mistakes and problems all around in how this \nproduct's safety was evaluated and addressed.\n  But something did stand out: one company had literally hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of reports about products with this product, none of \nwhich were revealed to Federal authorities.\n  There is no question in my mind that the too-long safety evaluation \nof ephedra would have been shortened considerably had we known earlier \nabout these reports.\n  Two years ago, I began discussing with those who are interested in \ndietary supplement regulation whether it would be wise to implement a \nsystem of mandatory adverse event reporting, AER, for those products.\n  While as a general principle, I am usually reluctant to argue for \ngreater government regulation, in this instance it seemed to me a case \ncould be made that an AER system for supplements could complement the \nwork we achieved with DSHEA and improve the government's ability to \naddress the relatively few problems which arose.\n  Senator Durbin and Senator Harkin were also having similar thoughts.\n  We joined forces and after much study, discussion and negotiation, \nproduced S. 3546.\n  It may be surprising to many of our colleagues that Senators Hatch, \nDurbin, Harkin, Enzi and Kennedy stand together on this legislation--we \ncome from very different perspectives on dietary supplement regulation.\n  And while we are each very passionate about our views, we are united \nin a common goal: improving the public health.\n  The premise for this bill is simple: mandating a system to provide \nthe government with information about serious adverse events associated \nwith the use of two types of FDA-regulated products--dietary \nsupplements and over-the-counter drugs--provides Federal authorities \nwith a better tool to respond to any problems which might occur. This \nis an important public health initiative, which at the same time \nsafeguards access to dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs.\n  There is currently a voluntary reporting system for supplements and \nsome OTC drugs--our bill would replace that with a mandatory system.\n  Senator Harkin and I have a longstanding interest in regulation of \nthese products, stemming back to our work on DSHEA.\n  Senator Durbin, as the former chair of the House Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, is one of the most knowledgeable Senators \nin this body when it comes to FDA matters.\n  Our collaboration on this legislation, along with the distinguished \nchairman and ranking minority member of the committee of jurisdiction, \nthe Health, Education, Labor and Pensions--HELP--Committee, both of \nwhom were integral to this process, has produced a bill which strikes \nthe right balance between necessary regulation and over-regulation.\n  This is how the new system will work:\n  Manufacturers, packers or distributors of OTC drugs or dietary \nsupplements marketed in the United States must provide to the FDA \nwithin 15 business days any reports of a serious adverse event \nassociated with their products. Accompanying that report must be a copy \nof the label on or within the retail packaging of the supplement.\n  The definition of serious event is proscribed within the legislation. \nIt is either an event that results in a death, life-threatening \nexperience, inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant \ndisability or incapacity, or congenital anomaly or birth defect; or it \nis an event that requires based on reasonable medical judgment a \nmedical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes I have \njust listed.\n  The bill requires that those reporting must, for 1 year, provide any \nnew medical information related to the serious adverse event report. \nAgain, that information must be submitted within 15 days.\n\n  In addition, manufacturers, packers and distributors must keep for 6 \nyears records of any adverse event associated with the product, even \nthough there is no reporting requirement unless the event meets the \ndefinition of serious.\n  For over-the-counter drugs, the definition of ``adverse event'' is a \nhealth-related event associated with the use of a nonprescription drug \nthat is adverse, including: an event occurring from an overdose, \nwhether accidental or intentional; an event occurring from abuse of the \ndrug, or withdrawal from the drug; or any failure of pharmacological \naction.\n  For dietary supplements, an ``adverse event'' is defined as any \nhealth-related event associated with the use of a dietary supplement \nthat is adverse.\n  The reports will be submitted on the current MedWatch form, unless \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services chooses to modify that form \nat some point.\n  The bill makes clear that State health officials may have access to \nthe adverse event reports, but that the Federal reporting system would \nsupersede any state reporting laws.\n  As we met to develop this legislation, one thing we struggled with \nwas the need to encourage responsible reporting in a way that \nmanufacturers could implement. Some manufacturers indicated to us, for \nexample, that they were not medical experts and could not determine in \nevery case if a reporter's problem met the definition of ``serious'' \ncontained in the bill.\n  To address this, we allow manufacturers to contract with third \nparties to handle the collection of reports. The manufacturers, of \ncourse, would still be ultimately responsible for reporting.\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\n  We have also asked the FDA to issue guidance to help manufacturers \ninterpret what a serious adverse event might be.\n  Another concern was making certain we appropriately defined the role \nof retailers, who are selling a range of products, some supplements, \nsome OTCs, some not. We determined that retailers would not be \nconsidered reporting parties. If, however, a retailer contracts with \nmanufacturers to distribute ``private label'' products, he or she may \nauthorize the manufacturer or packer to submit reports, as long as the \nretailer directs to the manufacturer all reports it receives.\n  We also wanted to allow the FDA the flexibility to manage this \nprogram. At its request, we made the program self-implementing. We also \nincluded a provision to allow the Secretary, after notice and comment \nfrom interested parties, to establish an exemption to the reporting \nrequirements if there would be no adverse effect on public health.\n  Finally, there are provisions in the bill to impose penalties for not \nreporting, not providing on the product label an address or phone \nnumber for reporting, and for providing a false report.\n  The law will go into effect 1 year after the date of enactment.\n  Before I close, I want to address some of the concerns that \nrepresentatives of the dietary supplement industry have voiced with \nthis legislation.\n  First, some have suggested there is no need for this legislation from \na public policy or a consumer safety perspective. I disagree.\n  Many have unfairly criticized the industry over media reports that \nsupplements are unsafe because there is no premarket approval. While I \ncan never support any system that requires premarket approval for \nsupplements, I have become convinced that having a system in place to \nidentify problems quickly can only enhance the authorities we gave the \nFDA with DSHEA.\n  It is also good policy. As the industry matures, we need to separate \nout the good actors from the bad. This is one way to show that this \nindustry is a respectable, mainstream industry. Other major \nindustries--e.g. pharmaceuticals, devices--are subject to mandatory AER \nreporting. Supplements are only handled through the voluntary reporting \nsystem.\n  And, I disagree with those who avow there is no consumer safety \nbenefit. Let's take an easy case--where there is a bad batch of a \nproduct. Enabling the FDA to know quickly there is a problem can help \nindustry and the public.\n  Other critics note that the FDA fails to pursue egregious violations \nof DSHEA. They question why this program will help. As I discussed \nearlier, Senator Harkin and I have been working to increase FDA's \nfunding for responsible enforcement of DSHEA. I recently discussed this \nwith the Commissioner-nominee, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach.\n  One of my constituents who opposes this effort suggested that the \nFDA's voluntary system, the CAERS system, should be able to handle any \nreports of problems. Public health experts will agree that a voluntary \nsystem is not as good a sentinel as a mandatory system. In addition, \nthose who report under the voluntary system are more likely to be \nphysicians. Encouraging consumers to report to manufacturers through a \nphone number or address on the product's label will ensure a more \nthorough reporting system.\n  Yet another concern I have heard is that this bill has a significant \neconomic impact that has not been studied appropriately. One estimate I \nhave heard is that it could cost tens of millions of dollars a year to \nindustry and consumers.\n  I have to say that these estimates do not seem to be supported by \nother industry representatives, many of whom are already instituting \nreporting systems of their own. During the drafting of this bill, we \nworked very hard to keep requirements to the minimum that would be \nnecessary for a complete and full reporting of serious adverse events.\n  In addition, I have heard a suggestion that a better alternative to \nthis bill would be a 1-800 number that consumers can use to contact FDA \ndirectly to report complaints. I discussed this with my colleagues and \nthe FDA and found little support for this idea. What this could do is \nshift onto FDA the majority of reports about product problems. In other \nwords, FDA fears that consumers would start phoning the agency, rather \nthan the manufacturer, to report complaints for things like broken \nbottles or tablets, or to answer questions about usage. It is easy to \nsee how this could end up relieving manufacturers of some of their \nconsumer-related responsibilities and shift that onto the FDA.\n  Let me hasten to add that I understand the motivation behind these \nconcerns. I will keep a close watch on this new program as it is \nimplemented, and pledge to reexamine it should problems with \nimplementation arise.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues for the spirit of collaboration \nwhich led to development of this legislation. In particular, I thank \nSenator Durbin for his leadership on this issue. While we may not have \nalways agreed on every provision, we did forge a bill on which we can \nagree.\n  Senator Harkin is a steadfast supporter of the dietary supplement \nindustry, and his guidance undoubtedly made this bill a better product.\n  Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, both longtime experts in food and \ndrug law, have both been most generous in their time and in moving the \nprocess forward.\n  I must also note the groups that also support the bill--the \nConsumer's Union, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the \nConsumer Healthcare Products Association, the National Nutritional \nFoods Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the American \nHerbal Products Association, and finally and most importantly, the Utah \nNatural Products Association.\n  That these groups, not often united--at least on this subject--can \nrally around our bill today is a testament to good policy, good \npolitics, and a surviving bipartisan spirit.\n  Chairman Enzi has placed this legislation on the HELP Committee \nagenda for the June 28 executive session. It is my hope the committee \nwill give swift approval to this bipartisan measure and that the Senate \nwill shortly thereafter do the same.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hagel, \n        and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 3553. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require all gasoline \nsold for use in motor vehicles to contain 10 percent renewable fuel in \nthe year 2010 and thereafter, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill take a bold step in reducing our dependence on fossil fuel and \nforeign oil. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Johnson and others in \nintroducing the ``10 by 10 Act.''\n  The ``10 by 10 Act'' will require that 10 percent of each gallon of \nmotor fuel sold beginning January 1, 2010, contain at least 10 percent \nrenewable fuel. The ``10 by 10 Act'' is a signal that Congress remains \ninterested and adamant in seeking energy independence by promoting the \ndevelopment of renewable fuels in the United States.\n  As President Bush stated in his State of the Union Address, America \nis addicted to oil. He also declared that we could displace at least 75 \npercent of the oil we import from the Middle East by 2025. I am here to \nsay to America's agriculture community, that we're serious and we're \ngoing to do something about it.\n  Because the U.S. imports more than 60 percent of the crude oil we \nneed, we have become dangerously reliant on foreign sources of energy. \nIt is a threat to our national security for the United States to be \ndependent upon countries like Iran and Venezuela for our energy needs. \nIt is also a threat to our economic security to be dependent on foreign \ncountries for the energy that drives our economy. It is up to our \nfarmers and ranchers to help liberate our consumers and our economy \nfrom the stranglehold of OPEC and other foreign countries on our energy \nneeds.\n  This legislation will demonstrate to consumers, in a commonsense way, \nthat each and every gallon of gasoline will contain at least 10 percent \nof domestically produced renewable fuel. It will show that we are \nserious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and it will show \nin a tangible way that we are working to reduce that dependence.\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\n  The ``10 by 10 Act'' is a commitment to our constituents that we are \nworking to lower that dependence, and reduce our consumption of foreign \noil in every gallon of fuel they pump. With this legislation, Americans \nwould know with certainty that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel \nwas home-grown by farmers and ranchers right here in America.\n  It is important for consumers to recognize that for the vast majority \nof cars on the road today, no modifications are necessary to operate on \na 10-percent renewable fuel blend. No significant changes are required \nto the fuel distribution network to allow for a 10-percent blend. The \nonly thing standing in the way of reduced dependence on foreign oil is \na signal from Congress that we recognize the virtue of homegrown \nalternatives to foreign oil.\n  Today, ethanol, a renewable fuel produced from corn, is blended in \nmore than 30 percent of the gasoline sold in the United States. There \nare currently 101 biorefineries prducing nearly 5 billion gallons of \nethanol annually. By the end of 2007, it is projected that we will have \nthe capacity to produce nearly 7 billion gallons annually.\n  We owe it to the American people to pursue aggressive policies to \nfree our country from our foreign oil dependence.

A bill to establish an alternative diesel standard, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleagues, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, \nthe Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, and the Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nCarper, in introducing the Alternative Diesel Standard Act of 2006.\n  Last summer, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act, which included a \nbold, bipartisan initiative to help wean our Nation from its petroleum \ndependency. This initiative, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard, \nestablished that it is the policy of the United States that the 140 \nbillion gallon national gasoline pool will consist of at least 7.5 \nbillion gallons of ethanol by the year 2012.\n  We have seen tremendous response to this new policy. Almost 30 new \nethanol plants have been proposed to be constructed in my State of \nIllinois alone, and many more are proposed nationwide. By comparison, \nover the past 30 years, no new petroleum refineries have been built in \nthe United States. The Renewable Fuels Standard is probably one of the \nsingle most important legislative actions taken by Congress in recent \nyears to strengthen our domestic energy security, and the legislation \nwe introduce today takes this policy one step further by addressing the \n40 billion gallon national diesel pool.\n  Petroleum-based diesel is used in a wide variety of transportation \nmodes: transit buses; semitrucks; ships; heavy duty construction, \nfarming and mining equipment; military vehicles; locomotives; barges; \nlarge scale generators; and in a range of cars and trucks. While not as \nlarge of a market as gasoline, petrodiesel is enormously significant to \nour economy, and reducing our reliance on foreign feedstocks for this \ndiesel is of equal importance in our efforts to increase energy \nsecurity.\n  Our bill, the Alternative Diesel Standard, simply requires that by \nthe year 2015, the national diesel pool must consist of at least 2 \nbillion gallons of alternative and renewable diesels.\n  This is but a modest 1 percent of the national diesel supply--hardly \npainful for the petroleum industry. It would not in any way dent the \noil industry's record-shattering profits. Instead, it establishes \ncertainty to those who know that alternative diesels can provide a real \nsolution to our dependence on foreign oil and who are prepared to \ninvest in alternative diesel production on a commercial scale.\n  Right now, there is an estimated 180 million gallons of biodiesel \nproduction capacity in the United States. Fifty-four companies have \nreported plans to construct dedicated biodiesel plants in the near \nfuture, but those plans are dependent upon regional and national demand \nprospects.\n  Moreover, entrepreneurs across the Nation have proven that we can \nmake diesel from other plant oils, like sunflower seeds, or coal, \nmanure, animal fats, and yes, even from recycled plastics or garbage. \nThis bill sends a signal to those entrepreneurs that a market is \nplanned in the future for these domestically produced fuels, attracting \nthe necessary investment to establish a national infrastructure of \ndomestic fuel production capabilities.\n  If we are serious about reducing our country's dependence on imported \npetroleum and insulating our economy from future supply disruption \nshocks--whether from the volatile Middle East or natural disasters such \nas Katrina--encouraging the construction of more domestic alternative \nfuel production capacity must be part of that strategy. Several billion \ngallons of alternative diesels are possible within the timelines \nproposed in our legislation, making another bold step to create jobs in \nrural America and strengthen our economic security. An Alternative \nDiesel Standard is the right course for the Nation's future. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I ask \ntheir support for swift enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6288-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6288-S6289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 519--CONGRATULATING THE MIAMI HEAT FOR WINNING THE \n              NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

ANNUAL REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT ON EQUIPMENT RESETS \n                   FOR THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As a result of the unprecedented strain of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the inventories \n     of equipment, vehicles, and aircraft of the Army and Marine \n     Corps have been gravely depleted. Having 16 to 18 Army \n     brigades deployed in combat at one time for the last 3 years, \n     in addition to other United States forces, has added to the \n     strain on United States military equipment. Battle losses and \n     so-called equipment ``wash-out'' are having a significant \n     impact on the readiness of the Armed forces.\n       (2) In Operation Iraqi Freedom, United States tanks are \n     being driven more than 4,000 miles per year, 5 times the \n     expected annual usage of 800 miles per year. Army helicopters \n     are experiencing usage rates roughly 2 to 3 times the planned \n     peacetime rate. The truck fleet of the Army is experiencing \n     some of the most pronounced problems of excessive wear, with \n     usage rates of 5 to 6 times the peacetime rate, further \n     exacerbated by the addition of heavy armor.\n       (3) This increased ``operational tempo'' (optempo) shortens \n     the life of equipment, vehicles, and aircraft and demands \n     much earlier and larger investments in maintenance and \n     procurement. Other causes of degradation of equipment, \n     vehicles, and aircraft include--\n       (A) sand and extreme heat that effects mechanical and \n     electronic systems; and\n       (B) rocket-propelled grenade and improvised explosive \n     device (IED) attacks.\n       (4) From 2003 to 2005, the Army claimed that it deployed \n     more than 40 percent of its equipment in support of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Recently, the \n     Marine Corps estimated that approximately 40 percent of all \n     Marine Corp ground equipment and 20 percent of aircraft \n     assets are in use in support of current operations.\n       (5) According to the Government Accountability Office, \n     although the Army reports high rates of equipment readiness \n     in Operation Iraqi Freedom currently, it risks sacrificing \n     long-term readiness through decisions to keep equipment in \n     theater, to forgo depot repairs, and to rely almost \n     exclusively on in-theater repair capabilities to keep \n     equipment mission-capable. As a result, much Army equipment \n     has not undergone high-level depot maintenance since the \n     start of operations in March 2003. Continued usage at rates \n     like those in Operation Iraqi Freedom, without higher levels \n     of maintenance, could result in more equipment requiring more \n     extensive and expensive repairs in the future and may result \n     in the need for replacement rather than repair.\n       (6) Because most Army and Marine Corps equipment is staying \n     in Iraq, Operation Iraqi Freedom is hampering--\n       (A) the ability of Government-run depots in the United \n     States to retain the industrial base to meet recapitalization \n     needs; and\n       (B) the ability of the Armed Forces to address future \n     threats at home and abroad.\n       (7) Army Chief of Staff General Schoomaker recently \n     testified that over the next 6 years, the Army projects that \n     it will cost $36,000,000,000 to fund reset activities for \n     equipment, vehicles, and aircraft, assuming that the United \n     States fully draws down its forces from Iraq by the end of \n     2007. If the Army continues to operate in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom at current levels, the reset cost will total more \n     than $72,000,000,000, and will eventually require steady \n     reset expenditures for a full 2 years after the Armed Forces \n     withdraws from Iraq.\n       (b) Annual Review and Assessment on Equipment Reset.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall each--\n       (A) conduct a review and assessment of the equipment, \n     vehicle, and aircraft reset requirements of the Armed Forces \n     as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \n     Freedom; and\n       (B) submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     setting forth--\n       (i) the results of such review and assessment; and\n       (ii) recommendations for actions to address the long-term \n     preparedness challenges with respect to equipment, vehicles \n     and aircraft for the Armed Forces that result from Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n       (2) Particular requirements.--In carrying out paragraph (1) \n     each year, the Secretary and the Comptroller General shall \n     each--\n       (A) assess the consequences of deferred depot maintenance \n     on the equipment, vehicles, and aircraft of the Armed Forces;\n       (B) evaluate the impact of the need for resets of Army \n     equipment, vehicles, and aircraft on Army force modernization \n     initiatives (such as modularity) and on the development of \n     the Future Combat Systems (FCS);\n       (C) identify a realistic multi-year schedule for the \n     procurement, repair, and recapitalization to be required to \n     reset equipment, vehicles, and aircraft for the Armed Forces, \n     and, in the case of the Secretary, develop mechanisms for \n     incorporating such schedule (and the funding required to \n     implement such schedule) in coming Future-Years Defense \n     Programs of the Department of Defense;\n       (D) develop, to the extent possible, an accurate estimate \n     of the cost of the necessary reset of equipment, vehicles, \n     and aircraft for the Armed Forces;\n       (E) review and assess the impact of Operation Iraqi Freedom \n     and Operation Enduring Freedom on the defense industrial base \n     of the United States in meeting the requirements of the \n     Department of Defense for equipment, vehicles, and aircraft \n     for the Armed Forces, including the regular components and \n     reserve components of the Armed Forces, in order to ensure \n     the full and continuing readiness of the Armed Forces to \n     fulfill their national defense responsibilities; and\n       (F) develop recommendations, including recommendations on \n     the utilization and expansion of existing authorities like \n     the Defense Production Act, to improve the capacity and \n     capability of the defense industrial base of the United \n     States to meet such responsibilities.\n       (c) Reset Defined.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``reset'', when applied to equipment, vehicles, or aircraft, \n     means the actions required to bring such equipment, vehicles, \n     or aircraft to full combat readiness.

MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a \n     report on March 30, 2006, entitled ``An Assessment of U.S. \n     Efforts to Secure the Global Supply Chain'' (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Senate Report''). That report, among \n     other things, analyzed the unique security risks posed by the \n     importation into the United States of cargo containers \n     carrying trash.\n       (2) The Senate Report contained several important findings \n     including the following:\n       (A) Containers carrying trash pose inherent security risks \n     fundamentally different from those posed by containers \n     carrying consumer products because--\n       (i) it is difficult, if not impossible, to trace the supply \n     chain for trash cargos, given the variety of different \n     individuals and entities that contribute to trash collections \n     and the lack of any screening system to identify \n     contributions as they are made;\n       (ii) the density of trash cargos makes inspection through \n     irradiation impossible; and\n       (iii) physical inspection of trash cargos is difficult and \n     dangerous.\n       (B) Importers of consumer products, by contrast, have more \n     control over the specific content and the origin of the \n     imported products, making it easier to take steps to monitor \n     and ensure the security of the supply chain.\n       (C) There are few, if any, security measures in place to \n     screen trash or ensure that trash does not conceal illegal or \n     harmful materials, such as weapons or nuclear material.\n       (3) Growing imports of trash present an increasingly \n     serious security problem.\n       (4) For example, according to the Senate Report, Canada \n     shipped roughly 100,000 containers of trash across United \n     States borders into Michigan in 2004 alone, an 8 percent \n     increase over 2003.\n       (5) Another 10,000 containers of trash come through 9 other \n     ports of entry on both the northern and southern borders of \n     the United States each year.\n       (6) The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \n     Security has found that from 2003 to 2004, tons of illegal \n     drugs and millions of dollars in illegal currency have been \n     transported into the United States in trash containers, among \n     other forbidden cargo.\n       (7) The Senate Report concluded that the Department of \n     Homeland Security should ban imports of trash into the United \n     States entirely until the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     ``can ensure that the supply chain of a trash importer is \n     secure or develops protocols ensuring adequate inspections of \n     individual trash containers''.\n       (8) To pay for more rigorous inspections to protect people \n     in the United States from the security risks currently \n     associated with trash containers, the Senate Report \n     recommended enacting into a law a ``fee on international \n     shipments of trash''.\n       (b) Inspections of Imported Municipal Solid Waste.--\n       (1) Inspections of municipal solid waste.--Not later than 6 \n     months after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection shall commence \n     inspections of international shipments of municipal solid \n     waste that enter the customs territory of the United States.\n       (2) Fee.--\n       (A) In general.--The Commissioner of Customs and Border \n     Protection shall levy a fee on each importer of international \n     municipal solid waste that enters into the customs territory \n     of the United States.\n       (B) Amount.--The fee under subparagraph (A) shall be \n     limited in amount to the approximate cost of the inspection \n     described in paragraph (1) and shall not constitute a source \n     of revenue for the United States Treasury.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n       (1) Customs territory of the united states.--The term \n     ``customs territory of the United States'' has the meaning \n     given the term in general note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States.\n       (2) Municipal solid waste.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (C), \n     the term ``municipal solid waste'' means--\n       (i) all waste materials discarded for disposal by \n     households, including single and multifamily residences, and \n     hotels and motels;

and\n       (II) were collected and disposed of with other municipal \n     solid waste described in clause (i) as part of normal \n     municipal solid waste collection services, except that this \n     subclause does not apply to hazardous materials other than \n     hazardous materials that, under regulations issued under \n     section 3001(d) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6921(d)), are not subject to regulation under subtitle C of \n     that Act (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq).\n\n       (B) Inclusions.--The term ``municipal solid waste'' \n     includes food and yard waste, paper, clothing, appliances, \n     consumer product packaging, disposable diapers, office \n     supplies, cosmetics, glass and metal food containers, \n     household hazardous waste, and debris resulting from \n     construction, remodeling, repair, or demolition of \n     structures.\n       (C) Exclusions.--The term ``municipal solid waste'' does \n     not include the following:\n       (i) Any solid waste identified or listed as a hazardous \n     waste under section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6941 et seq.), except for household hazardous waste.\n       (ii) Any solid waste, including contaminated soil and \n     debris, resulting from--\n\n       (I) a response action taken under section 104 or 106 of the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9604 and 9606);\n       (II) a response action taken under a State law with \n     authorities comparable to the authorities of such section 104 \n     or 106; or\n       (III) a corrective action taken under the Solid Waste \n     Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).\n\n       (iii) Recyclable materials that have been separated, at the \n     source of the waste, from waste otherwise destined for \n     disposal or that have been managed separately from waste \n     destined for disposal.\n       (iv) Scrap rubber to be used as a fuel source.\n       (v) Materials and products returned from a dispenser or \n     distributor to the manufacturer or an agent of the \n     manufacturer for credit, evaluation, and possible reuse.\n       (vi) Any solid waste that is--\n\n       (I) generated by an industrial facility;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1092. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 1093.

From December 1941 until May 1942, United States \n     military personnel fought valiantly against overwhelming \n     Japanese military forces on Wake Island, Guam, the Philippine \n     Islands, including the Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor, and \n     the Dutch East Indies, thereby preventing Japan from \n     accomplishing strategic objectives necessary for achieving a \n     preemptive military victory in the Pacific during World War \n     II.\n       (2) In military action in the Philippines, United States \n     troops were ordered to surrender on April 9, 1942, and were \n     forced to march 65 miles to prison camps at Camp O'Donnell, \n     Cabanatuan, and Bilibid. More than 10,000 Americans died \n     during the march, known as the ``Bataan Death March'', and \n     during subsequent imprisonment as a result of starvation, \n     disease, and executions.\n       (3) Beginning in January 1942, the Japanese military began \n     to transport United States prisoners of war to Japan, Taiwan, \n     Manchuria, and Korea to perform slave labor to support their \n     war industries. Many of the unmarked merchant vessels in \n     which the prisoners were transported, called ``Hell Ships'', \n     were attacked by American naval and air forces, which, \n     according to some estimates, resulted in more than 3,600 \n     American fatalities.\n       (4) Following the conclusion of World War II, the United \n     States Government agreed to pay compensation to United States \n     ex-prisoners of war amounting to $2.50 per day of \n     imprisonment. This compensation was paid from Japanese assets \n     frozen by the United States Government and do not begin to \n     fully compensate those ex-prisoners of war for the short-term \n     and long-term costs of the slave labor they endured. Neither \n     the Government of Japan nor any Japanese corporations admit \n     any liability for further payment of such compensation.\n       (5) Other nations, including Canada, the United Kingdom, \n     and the Netherlands, have authorized payment of gratuities to \n     their surviving veterans who were captured by the Japanese \n     during World War II and required to perform slave labor.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to recognize, \n     by the provision of compensation, the heroic contributions of \n     the members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the \n     United States who were captured by the Japanese military \n     during World War II and denied their basic human rights by \n     being made to perform slave labor by the Imperial Government \n     of Japan or by Japanese corporations during World War II.\n       (c) Payment of Gratuity Authorized.--The Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs may pay a gratuity to a covered veteran or \n     civilian internee, or to the surviving spouse of a covered \n     veteran or civilian internee, in the amount of $20,000.\n       (d) Covered Veteran or Civilian Internee Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``covered veteran or civilian internee'' \n     means any individual who--\n       (1) was a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian employee \n     of the United States, or an employee of a contractor of the \n     United States during World War II;\n       (2) served in or with United States combat forces during \n     World War II;\n       (3) was captured and held as a prisoner of war or prisoner \n     by Japan in the course of such service; and\n       (4) was required by the Imperial Government of Japan, or \n     one or more Japanese corporations, to perform slave labor \n     during World War II.\n       (e) Relationship to Other Payments.--Any amount paid a \n     person under this section for activity described in \n     subsection (d) is in addition to any other amount paid such \n     person for such activity under any other provision of law.\n       (f) Inapplicability of Taxation or Attachment.--Any amount \n     paid a person under this section shall not be subject to any \n     taxation, attachment, execution, levy, tax lien, or detention \n     under any process whatever.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4413.

WITHHOLDING OF CERTAIN UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTIONS \n                   TO THE UNITED NATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A consensus existed in September 2005 that the United \n     Nations was in dire need of reform in order to restore its \n     credibility. An agenda for reform was outlined in the United \n     Nations Summit Declaration of September 2005 that was \n     endorsed by the members of the General Assembly of the United \n     Nations. These reforms were subsequently included in a \n     proposal set forth by the Secretary General of the United \n     Nations to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly in \n     April 2006.\n       (2) The United States Ambassador to the United Nations has \n     continuously worked in good faith with fellow member states \n     of the United Nations to achieve a consensus agenda for \n     United Nations reform.\n       (3) A group of members of the General Assembly, embodied in \n     the G-77, has obstructed progress on reform of the United \n     Nations, specifically by rejecting those set proposals forth \n     by the Secretary General to the Fifth Committee of the \n     General Assembly in April 2006. These proposals stemmed \n     directly from the Summit Outcome document endorsed by the \n     members of the G-77 in September 2005.\n       (4) The spending cap for the United Nations agreed to in \n     December of 2005 was premised on the need for the United \n     Nations to demonstrate meaningful progress on reform in order \n     to justify funding by member states of the 2006-2007 biannual \n     budget of the United Nations.\n       (5) The G-77 has reinforced its obstructionist approach to \n     United Nations reform by insisting that the lifting of the \n     spending cap for the United Nations not be linked to progress \n     on management reform issues, contrary to the position of the \n     United States.\n       (6) The United Nations has failed to show meaningful \n     progress in a number of areas for reform, including human \n     rights, budget, management, and oversight.\n       (7) Congress should not authorize the remaining United \n     Nations budget until the General Assembly approves the reform \n     measure for the United Nations proposed by the Secretary-\n     General.\n       (b) Withholding.--\n       (1) In general.--In the event the United Nations 2006-2007 \n     biennium budget is adopted by the General Assembly without \n     being accompanied by a commitment to reform measures, the \n     United States shall withhold the remaining portion of its \n     assessed dues that formulate its obligations within the \n     budget that are not allocated toward humanitarian, \n     educational, and development programs and other non-political \n     programs considered to be high priority for the United \n     States.\n       (2) Determination of portion of dues.--The Secretary of \n     State shall determine the portion of the assessed dues \n     referred to in paragraph (1) that are allocated toward \n     humanitarian, educational, and development programs and other \n     non-political programs considered to be high priority for the \n     United States.\n       (3) Treatment of certain contributions.--Voluntary \n     contributions made by the United States to United Nations \n     agencies over and above the assessed dues of the United \n     States, including contributions to United Nations \n     Peacekeeping Operations and the World Health Organization, \n     shall not be subject to withholding under paragraph (1).\n       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirement in \n     subsection (b) upon a determination and certification to \n     Congress that the General Assembly has made a good faith \n     effort on reform of the United Nations, which may include \n     progress in areas such as rationalization of United Nations \n     mandates and a strengthening of United Nations oversight \n     mechanisms.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4449.

TESTING AND OPERATIONS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to assessments by the intelligence community, \n     North Korea continues to maintain an ambitious ballistic \n     missile development program and has exported missiles and \n     missile technology to other countries, including Iran.\n       (2) North Korea has made preparations to launch a long-\n     range ballistic missile that could reach the United States. \n     The launch of such a missile by North Korea would end the \n     moratorium on long-range missile testing declared by North \n     Korea in 1999.\n       (3) Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has warned North \n     Korea that the launch of a long-range ballistic missile would \n     be an ``abrogation of obligations'' of its missile test \n     moratorium and ``would once again show North Korea determined \n     to deepen its isolation, determined not to take a path that \n     is a path of compromise and a path of peace, but rather \n     instead to once again saber-rattle''.\n       (4) According to assessments by the intelligence community, \n     Iran has a very active ballistic missile development program, \n     which includes recent improvements to the Shahab-3 medium-\n     range ballistic missile to extend its range beyond the Middle \n     East. The danger that Iran will acquire a nuclear weapon and \n     the ability to integrate it with the ballistic missiles Iran \n     already possesses is a reason for immediate concern. With \n     continued assistance, Iran could have an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States \n     before 2015.\n       (5) According to assessments by the intelligence community, \n     North Korea continues to produce plutonium for its nuclear \n     weapons program, while Iran remains committed to acquiring a \n     nuclear weapon and is currently developing its nuclear \n     infrastructure.\n       (6) The Department of Defense has fielded interceptors and \n     other initial components of a missile defense system capable \n     of providing limited protection for the United States against \n     ballistic missile attack. In view of the immediate threat of \n     a test launch by North Korea of a long-range ballistic \n     missile in the direction of the United States and the \n     continuing efforts of Iran to develop longer-range ballistic \n     missiles, the Department of Defense should expand the size \n     and effectiveness of the current missile defense capabilities \n     of the United States as the threat from these countries \n     continues to grow.\n       (b) Additional Funding.--\n       (1) Additional amount for missile defense agency.--Of the \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(4) for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation for Defense-wide \n     activities, the amount that is available for the Missile \n     Defense Agency is hereby increased by $45,000,000.\n       (2) Availability of amount.--Of the amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(4) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for Defense-wide activities and \n     available for the Missile Defense Agency, as increased by \n     paragraph (1), $45,000,000 may be available for Ballistic \n     Missile Defense Midcourse Defense Segment (PE #63882C)--\n       (A) to accelerate the ability to conduct concurrent test \n     and missile defense operations; and\n       (B) to increase the pace of realistic flight testing of the \n     ground-based midcourse defense system.\n       (3) Supplement.--Amounts available under paragraph (2) for \n     the program element referred to in that paragraph are in \n     addition to any other amounts available in this Act for that \n     program element.\n       (4) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 201(4) for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation for Defense-wide activities that is available for \n     any purpose other than the Missile Defense Agency is hereby \n     reduced by $45,000,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4475.

Under the provisions of rule \nXXII and the previous consent, the filing deadline for second-degree \namendments will be at 10:30 tomorrow. We hope cloture will be invoked \nand that we can then work toward completing this vitally important \nDefense authorization measure. Additional votes are expected during \nThursday's session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/21/senate-section/article/S6322-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
