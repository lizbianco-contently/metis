Mr. President, today we will start with a 30-minute period \nof morning business. Therefore, shortly after 10 a.m., we will return \nto the consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. We now \nhave approximately 13 amendments pending. One of those has been divided \ninto 18 divisions; therefore, that amendment could require up to 18 \nvotes before we dispose of it.\n  Needless to say, we will have rollcall votes throughout the day as we \nwork our way through these amendments. At this point, there appears to \nbe an unending flow of amendments and we will gauge our progress at the \nend of business today. I want Members to have the opportunity to offer \namendments, but at some point it may be necessary to file a cloture \nmotion to ensure that we finish this emergency supplemental sometime \nnext week.\n  In the meantime, I encourage Senators to work with the managers to \nschedule their amendments, and perhaps there will be an opportunity for \nsome of the votes to be accepted without the need for floor debate or a \nvote.\n  I will have a brief statement on another issue, unless the Democratic \nleader wants to comment on the schedule. We are going to have a busy \nday. I ask our colleagues to be cooperative. This is a supplemental \nemergency bill and we need to proceed efficiently--with patience but \nefficiently.\n  I wish to comment on another very important issue. We have so many \nthings going on today and over the course of the week, with a focus on \nenergy, with a lot of work being done not on the floor but in \ncommittees and in working groups and task forces to address the \nskyrocketing prices of gasoline. We have a pensions conference report \non the way, and a tax increase prevention act conference report is \nunderway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3635-8", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3635-S3636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there is another issue we have made slow \nprogress on recently that we need to accelerate and that is the \njudicial nomination process. Throughout my time as leader, I have done \nmy very best to stand on the principle of having fair up-or-down votes \nfor each of the judicial nominees. I believe it is our responsibility, \nour constitutional duty, grounded in the advice and consent clause of \nsection 2 of the Constitution, and it is reinforced by over 200 years \nof Senate history; it is a duty we have in the Senate. I compliment the \nbody on the two Justices who were confirmed--a Chief Justice, an \nassociate Justice, and all the district court judges who were \nconfirmed. In the coming weeks, we need to continue building on this \nprogress, as with all the rest of the issues coming before us. We will \nconfirm new nominees to fill vacancies on the Federal bench.\n  As we all know, we need our courts to have judges who are well-\nqualified, mainstream judges, who demonstrate the highest integrity, \nand who will practice judicial restraint and will respect the rule of \nlaw and the Constitution.\n  After consulting with Chairman Specter, Senator McConnell, and many \nof my colleagues, I am pleased to announce that in the coming weeks we \nwill move forward on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the DC \nCircuit\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\nCourt of Appeals. I will make every effort to see that he gets a vote \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  President Bush nominated Mr. Kavanaugh on July 25, 2003, 3 years ago. \nHe has been waiting for that up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate \nsince that time. That is almost 3 years ago. That is a long enough time \nfor us to bring that nomination forward to the floor and to act on that \nnomination. He is a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School, and \nhe is also a former Supreme Court clerk. He has sterling credentials. \nMost of us have studied his record.\n\n  Mr. Kavanaugh has a broad range of experience as a prosecutor, as a \nlawyer in private practice, and as a trusted counsel and adviser to \nPresident Bush.\n  Throughout his entire career, Brett Kavanaugh has demonstrated the \nfairminded temperament and intellectual prowess that is needed to serve \nas a Federal appellate judge.\n  There will be a lot more to say about him in the coming weeks. We \nwill talk about that nomination. For now, I urge my colleagues to \nrefocus on the nomination process and make sure it will work fairly. I \nwant to be able to approach the process and dignify it in a civil way, \nrejecting the obstruction and personal attacks that have arisen on the \nfloor in times past. Let's embrace the principle of a fair up-or-down \nvote. It is right to do for the nominees--to treat them in a dignified \nway--and for the American people, who depend on fairminded judges to \nresolve disputes and interpret our laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3636-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The distinguished majority leader is right, we confirmed \ntwo Supreme Court Justices. I think they were dignified debates. I \nthink the committee did a good job in preparing the Senate for those \ntwo Supreme Court nominations. We have also approved 29 lower court \nnominations. All nominees have been considered by the full Senate in \nthis Congress and have been confirmed. The minority recognizes what \nrights we have. We will continue to recognize what those rights are, \nand certainly we have not abused any of those rights. We don't intend \nto. We will perform our constitutional role.\n  I say to the majority leader he is right, Mr. Kavanaugh had a \nhearing, but that was more than 2 years ago. I think one of the things \nthat should be considered is whether the Judiciary Committee should \nupdate that. There have been a lot of things going on dealing with the \nsituation in Iraq in which he was involved. That is a subject for \ndiscussion at a later time.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  We look forward to the supplemental appropriations bill being \nfinished. We have a lot of amendments. At this stage, we have had very \nfew quorum calls. I am somewhat disappointed that we have this \nsituation before us today. I believe the committee did some very good \nwork--the Appropriations Committee--in bringing this matter to the \nfloor. I wish we had a vote. I think when it is all over, that is what \nit will wind up being, anyway. I hope Senator Coburn, for whom I have \nthe greatest respect, when he sees the first few votes, will get the \nidea how things are moving along and maybe we won't have to have all \nthose votes.\n  As I understand it, at this time, there are about 30 votes in order \nat this stage. We have to dispose of those. There are people over here \non this side waiting to offer amendments, none of which are dilatory in \nnature and all of which are dealing with the situation in Iraq, our \nmilitary generally, with veterans. We have amendments that people wish \nto offer dealing with the energy situation we find in America.\n  So I hope today we can figure out a way to get through this \nsituation. I appreciate very much the majority leader recognizing, as \nhe has for the last few weeks, that we have an event over the weekend, \na retreat in Philadelphia. We understand that.\n  The point I am making is that on this side we understand the \nimportance of this bill. We wish it had not been part of an emergency \nappropriation in the original budget. We have to play the cards we are \ndealt. We will do everything we can to move this forward in what we \nbelieve is a dignified manner.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

WADE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a wonderful privilege for me to \nintroduce to our colleagues Rev. Frank Wade, who most recently is the \nrector at St. Alban's Church. I want to say upfront that this great \npastor married me and my wife Jeanne some 2 years ago. It was a real \nexperience. It was so magnificent in that we counseled with him--even \nthough both of us are well into adulthood--and received his guidance \nfor some weeks prior to that beautiful ceremony, which was held in the \nWashington Cathedral. That is a site--St. Alban's and the Washington \nCathedral--where I have spent so much of my life. Preceding Dr. Wade \nwas my uncle, Charles Tinsley Warner, rector of St. Alban's Church for \nalmost 40 years, from the late 1920s and 1930s all through World War \nII.\n  Our colleagues might recall that one of our dearest Members of the \nSenate, the former Senator from Missouri, Mr. Danforth, was an ordained \nEpiscopal minister and he also preached occasionally at St. Alban's \nChurch. Dr. Wade went to the Citadel, and from there he went to the \nVirginia Episcopal Seminary, where my uncle also graduated. For 17 \nyears, he tended to the ministry of those in the great State of West \nVirginia. What a privilege for Dr. Wade and me this morning to have a \nfew moments with our highly esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  I thank my colleagues and I thank Senator Lautenberg and Mr. Maxwell \nof his staff, who worked to make this memorable occasion for so many \npossible today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is my understanding we have 15 minutes \nequally divided. I ask the Chair, after 6 minutes has elapsed, to \nadvise me.\n  First, let me say there is nothing new to the problem we have had in \nthis country by not having an energy policy. I can remember when Don \nHodel was Secretary of Energy and later Secretary of the Interior. We \nhad a dog-and-pony show where we went around the country during the \nReagan administration and tried to talk about how serious this was--the \nfact that our dependence upon foreign countries, or our ability to \nfight a war, was not an energy problem, it was a national security \nproblem.\n  We found the message didn't sell. I was critical of the Reagan \nadministration. Later on, when the first Bush administration came \nalong, I thought, surely, out of the oil patch he would want to have an \nenergy policy, but he didn't either. And during the Clinton \nadministration, he did not. When the second George Bush came into \noffice, the first thing he did was say we are going to have an energy \npolicy. Keep in mind that our dependency at that time, when I was \nactive around the country with Don Hodel, was 36 to 37 percent. Now we \nare up to twice that. It is much worse now than it was before.\n  We are in the middle of our second gulf war and people should realize \nwhat a threat this is. I chair the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, which has most of the jurisdiction over many energy issues, \nand certainly the air issues. I remember making every effort to get \ndrilling on ANWR. The distinguished President pro tempore has spent his \nlife trying to get production in the northern part of his State. It is \nsomething that would resolve the problem.\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\n  Yesterday, on this floor, one of the Senators on the Democratic side \nsaid it would take 10 years before we would see any of that production. \nI don't believe that is true. But if it were true, I remind my \ncolleagues that on November 20, 1995, we passed in both Chambers \ndrilling in ANWR, and President Clinton vetoed the bill. We would have \nit today. We would not be having this problem.\n  I suggest also that there is one other facet that has not been talked \nabout enough, and that is, we could have all the production, all the \nexploration in the world, but if we don't have the refining capacity, \nit doesn't do any good.\n  We were at 100 percent refining capacity even before Katrina. This is \na serious problem. In our committee, we marked up a refinery bill, a \nvery sophisticated bill, very moderate. It would allow those cities \nwhere they had closed military bases to use those closed military bases \nalong with EDA grants to establish refineries. It is something that \nwould enhance our refinery capacity and give us new refineries, and it \nwas killed right down party lines. Every Democrat voted against it.\n  I will read what one of the papers, the Topeka Capital Journal, said:\n\n       Politics played a crucial role in Democrat opposition. If \n     gas prices are high next year--\n\n  This is next year now--\n\n     the GOP will be blamed. . . .\n\n  Even though it is the Democrats who are responsible for it. So we \nhave those problems that are looming at the same time.\n  I will say this: Democrats did offer an alternative when they killed \nthe refinery bill. All eight Democrats on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the committee I chair, voted in favor of an \nalternative that would put the Environmental Protection Agency in \ncharge of siting, constructing, and operating oil facilities. In other \nwords, socializing that particular sector of our economy, which is \nsomething they apparently believe Government can operate better than \npeople.\n  It is not true. When we had the LIHEAP program, I had an amendment \nthat would have improved the permitting process for ethanol plants, as \nwell as oil refineries and coal liquid facilities. Again, killed right \ndown party lines.\n  I guess what I am saying is, we go through this and we see what is \nhappening, and it is always down party lines when we try to enhance our \nability to have natural gas. Ask farmers anywhere in America what is \ncausing the cost of fertilizer to go up. It is a shortage of natural \ngas.\n  At the same time, we had an opportunity to do something in \nMassachusetts. Two Congressmen from Massachusetts, Frank and McGovern, \nput a provision in the Transportation bill that blocks the construction \nof an already-approved liquefied natural gas facility.\n  What I am saying is--and I know I am down to 1 minute, Mr. \nPresident--it doesn't seem to matter to the Democrats whether we are \ntrying to do something with fossil fuels, trying to do something with \noil and gas, trying to do something with clean coal technology, or \ntrying to do something with nuclear energy. It always is killed right \ndown party lines. Now the crisis is here, and we are going to have to \nface it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as Americans go to the gas pump to fill up \ntheir gas tanks with gasoline, they are met with a very harsh economic \nreality. We have higher gas prices in this country. We don't have \nenough supply in this country. Of course, we have lots of demand, and \ndemand continues to grow not only in the United States but around the \nworld.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma said, we have been trying to take steps \nnow for a decade to address this issue of shortage of supply. As \nconsumers look at the prices they are facing today and the fact that \nwe, for the past decade, have really, for all intents and purposes, \ndone nothing to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy or \nto add to energy resources we have in this country, that reality is \nstarting to take root. I think people are realizing that now for the \nvery first time, and they are taking the steps they can to curb demand. \nThey are carpooling, buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, probably \nwalking more than they used to. I think consumers are doing what they \ncan on their side of the equation to try to address the demand issue.\n  We have a profound supply issue that has been complicated by a decade \nof obstruction in the U.S. Congress when it comes to increasing that \nsupply. We have tried for the past decade--I was a Member of the House \nof Representatives for three terms and now as a Member of the Senate. \nWe have had the opportunity to vote on numerous occasions to explore \nand produce oil on the North Slope of Alaska. There is somewhere \nbetween 6 and 16 billion barrels of oil on the North Slope of Alaska. \nThere would be 1 million barrels a day in the pipeline if, when in 1995 \nthe Congress acted, the President had acted and signed legislation into \nlaw that would have allowed us to take advantage of that rich resource \nright here in America.\n\n  We have tried on countless occasions to add to supply. We have \noffshore production. Why is it that Cuba can produce oil off the coast \nof Florida but we can't? We have to do something to help ourselves, and \nfor the past decade we have been blocked at every turn by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, by the Democrats in the \nSenate and in the House, from being able to get into the resources in \nthe State of Alaska and other places.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, we had a vote in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on legislation that would allow \nus to expand our refinery capacity. It was blocked by a party-line \nvote. One Republican voted with the Democrats, but the Democrats voted \nas a party en bloc against expanding refinery capacity.\n  That is something, too, that we need to get done. I believe there \nwould be a majority of Senators in the Senate who would be in favor of \nthat, just as there is a majority of Senators who are in favor of \nexploring on the North Slope of Alaska and in favor of offshore \nproduction. But the rules of the Senate have been used repeatedly--\nrepeatedly, Mr. President--to block the clear will of the majority when \nit comes to adding to supply so we can lessen the crisis that we face \nin this country, putting more supply out there to bring that cost of \ngasoline, that cost of petroleum down. We have run into constant \nobstruction in the Senate from our colleagues on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle.\n  So as consumers look at what they are facing today, it is important \nthey begin to apply pressure to their leaders in the Senate and the \nHouse to take steps that should have been taken a long time ago and for \nwhich there is a clear majority of support in the Senate for \nexploration in Alaska, for building additional refinery capacity, for \noffshore production--for all these things that would add to the supply.\n  Having said that, I also believe it is not too late to do the right \nthing, and I have introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Obama \nfrom Illinois that would help increase the use of renewable fuels to \nhelp meet the energy crisis, that would allow fuel retailers to defray \nthe cost of installing E-85 pumps and other alternative fuel tanks at \ngas stations. Currently, only about 600 gas stations in the country \nhave E-85 pumps. This would give many more Americans access to this \nalternative fuel and reduce our dependency on foreign energy.\n  There is more we can do. The President needs to push our oil-\nsupplying countries to increase production to help ease this supply \ncrisis.\n  Later today, I will introduce legislation that will provide immediate \nand short-term relief to American consumers. I will introduce \nlegislation called the Gas Price Reduction Act of 2006 that will \nprovide that relief. It will suspend the gas tax in its entirety for \nthe remainder of this summer, until September 30, the period when \nAmericans need the relief the most over the course of the summer \nmonths, when they are doing most of their traveling.\n  It calls for the elimination of the current 18.4-cents-per-gallon \nFederal gas tax on gasoline, relief that Americans will feel when they \nfill their gas tanks. The lost revenues will be reimbursed by temporary \nsuspension of a number of tax credits and royalty\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nwaivers received by oil corporations. The increased revenue to the \nFederal Government from this suspension of tax breaks and incentives \nwill be used to reimburse the Federal Treasury and the highway trust \nfund dollar for dollar for lost revenue from the suspension of the \ngasoline tax. The temporary suspension of the tax credits and waivers \nwill remain in place until the resulting revenue stream has fully \nreimbursed the Treasury.\n  As we see skyrocketing gas prices around the country, it is time for \nthis Congress to act. It is time for the American consumer to realize \nsome relief. When crude oil is selling for $73 a barrel, it seems to me \nthat many of these incentives and tax credits that are in place for \nresearch, development, exploration, and even drilling costs for the oil \ncompanies could be used to offset a reduction in the gasoline tax that \nwill bring immediate relief to hard-working consumers who are facing \nhigher and higher costs for the fuel they need to get to work, to do \ntheir jobs.\n  I look forward to engaging in the debate about what we can do here \nand now, but I have to say that in the long term, steps should have \nbeen taken a decade ago to add to supplies in this country. It is never \ntoo late to do the right thing. We need to be moving forward to make \nsure America is energy independent, that America's future is energy \nsecure. So we have to rely less and less on foreign countries around \nthe world from which we derive today about 60 percent of our energy \nsupply. That is an untenable situation to be in. It is something that \nshould have been addressed. We tried to address it for years.

LENNOX\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of LTG William J. Lennox, United States Army, \nSuperintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. \nGeneral Lennox is retiring on the June 30, after 35 years of active \nmilitary service. I have known General Lennox for many years. His \nmilitary career exemplifies a soldier who always sought and achieved \nexcellence.\n  After graduating from West Point in 1971, General Lennox served in a \nwide variety of assignments in the field artillery. He served as a \nForward Observer, Executive Officer, and Fire Support Officer in the \n1st Battalion, 29th Field Artillery, and as Commander, Battery B, 2d \nBattalion, 20th Field Artillery, in the 4th Infantry Division at Fort \nCarson, CO. He was the Operations Officer and Executive Officer for the \n2d Battalion, 41st Field Artillery, in the 3d Infantry Division in \nGermany. He returned to Fort Carson to command the 5th Battalion, 29th \nField Artillery, in the 4th Infantry Division and also commanded the \nDivision Artillery in the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, GA.\n  General Lennox also served in a number of staff positions including a \nWhite House Fellowship, as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of \nthe Army, and as the Executive Officer for the Deputy Chief of Staff \nfor Operations and Plans.\n  Additionally, General Lennox served as the Deputy Commanding General \nand Assistant Commandant of the U.S. Army Field Artillery Center; the \nChief of Staff for III Corps and Fort Hood; the Assistant Chief of \nStaff, CJ-3, at Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea; the \nDeputy Commanding General, Eighth United States Army and Chief of \nLegislative Liaison.\n  General Lennox is not only a soldier, however, he is also a scholar. \nAfter West Point, he continued his education at Princeton University, \nreceiving a master's degree and a doctorate in literature. He was first \nin his class at Fort Leavenworth's Command and General Officer's \nSchool. He also completed the Senior Service College Fellowship at \nHarvard University.\n  In June 2001, General Lennox became the Superintendent of the U.S. \nMilitary Academy, and took the helm of one of the Nation's premier \ninstitutions of higher learning. Managing 7,000 people and $250 million \nbudget per year on the 16,000-acre campus, he provided strategic \ndirection for the academic, military, athletic and values programs.\n  During his tenure, his key accomplishments not only preserved but \neven enhanced the prestige of the Military Academy. General Lennox \noversaw upgrades to the core liberal arts program while sustaining the \nfourth-ranked undergraduate engineering program in the country. Today, \nonly Harvard, Princeton, and Yale produce more Rhodes scholars than \nWest Point.\n  General Lennox has implemented and intensified opportunities for \ncultural exposure and expanded semesters abroad to countries such as \nChina, Russia, Spain, and Chile.\n  In the summer of 2005, he himself traveled to the People's Republic \nof China to strengthen ties with educators and government officials and \nimprove the opportunities for exchanges. His has increased the number \nof foreign students by 74 percent, an initiative that promises to build \nlanguage and cultural skills, as well as lasting relationships with our \nallies across the globe.\n  General Lennox also realized the importance of the physical \ninfrastructure of the Academy to the ultimate success of the cadets. \nHis capital improvements have changed the face of the historic post for \nthe better. He planned and began building a $120 million library \nlearning center and science complex that is architecturally compatible \nwith the granite buildings from previous centuries, and he completed \nconstruction of the $95 million physical development center.\n  To provide the margin of excellence necessary to maintain the U.S. \nMilitary Academy's status as a tier I university, LTG Lennox completed \na $150 million fund raising campaign with over $220 million. The funds \nfrom private sources enabled further improvements in the academic, \nathletic and military programs.\n  General Lennox also recognized that the United States Military \nAcademy was part of a larger community. From the outset of his tenure, \nhe sought the comments and insights of graduates, the Academy, and the \nmembers of the surrounding neighborhood, whenever appropriate, to give \nthem a closer identification with and support for the institution and \nultimately its decisions.\n  LTG Lennox leaves a notably improved Academy in terms of leadership, \nfacilities, and finances. The military, academic, physical and moral/\nethical development programs at the Academy have never been stronger \nand more connected to the Army. General Lennox has set the course for \nofficer education into the first half of the new century.\n  Bill Lennox is an extraordinary soldier. He combines great intellect, \ngreat character and great dedication. He is also an extraordinary man. \nTogether with his wife, Anne, he has raised three sons, Andrew, \nMatthew, and Jonathan, who have continued the Lennox tradition of \nservice. He and Anne have been a remarkable example of husband and wife \nin service to the Army and in service to the Nation. And anyone who has \nenjoyed the warm embrace of their friendship, treasures their company \nand their kindness.\n  The motto of West Point is ``Duty, Honor, Country.'' Throughout its \nhistory, West Point has been guided by leaders who exemplify and live \nout that great credo. LTG William Lennox is such a leader. He leaves a \nproud and\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nenduring legacy as the 56th Superintendant of the United States \nMilitary Academy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3639-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3665\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

I thank the Senator from Oregon for his indulgence. I \ncall up amendment numbered 3640 and I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3640, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n               DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES IN IRAN\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of the United States have long demonstrated \n     an interest in the well-being of the people of Iran, dating \n     back to the 1830s.\n       (2) Famous Americans such as Howard Baskerville, Dr. Samuel \n     Martin, Jane E. Doolittle, and Louis G. Dreyfus, Jr., made \n     significant contributions to Iranian society by furthering \n     the educational opportunities of the people of Iran and \n     improving the opportunities of the less fortunate citizens of \n     Iran.\n       (3) Iran and the United States were allies following World \n     War II, and through the late 1970s Iran was as an important \n     regional ally of the United States and a key bulwark against \n     Soviet influence.\n       (4) In November 1979, following the arrival of Mohammed \n     Reza Shah Pahlavi in the United States, a mob of students and \n     extremists seized the United States Embassy in Tehran, Iran, \n     holding United States diplomatic personnel hostage until \n     January 1981.\n       (5) Following the seizure of the United States Embassy, \n     Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the repressive \n     revolutionary movement in Iran, expressed support for the \n     actions of the students in taking American citizens hostage.\n       (6) Despite the presidential election of May 1997, an \n     election in which an estimated 91 percent of the electorate \n     participated, control of the internal and external affairs of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran is still exercised by the courts \n     in Iran and the Revolutionary Guards, Supreme Leader, and \n     Council of Guardians of the Government of Iran.\n       (7) The election results of the May 1997 election and the \n     high level of voter participation in that election \n     demonstrate that the people of Iran favor economic and \n     political reforms and greater interaction with the United \n     States and the Western world in general.\n       (8) Efforts by the United States to improve relations with \n     Iran have been rebuffed by the Government of Iran.\n       (9) The Clinton Administration eased sanctions against Iran \n     and promoted people-to-people exchanges, but the Leader of \n     the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Militant \n     Clerics' Society, the Islamic Coalition Organization, and \n     Supporters of the Party of God have all opposed efforts to \n     open Iranian society to Western influences and have opposed \n     efforts to change the dynamic of relations between the United \n     States and Iran.\n       (10) For the past two decades, the Department of State has \n     found Iran to be the leading sponsor of international \n     terrorism in the world.\n       (11) In 1983, the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah terrorist \n     organization conducted suicide terrorist operations against \n     United States military and civilian personnel in Beirut, \n     Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Americans.\n       (12) The United States intelligence community and law \n     enforcement personnel have linked Iran to attacks against \n     American military personnel at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia \n     in 1996 and to al Qaeda attacks against civilians in Saudi \n     Arabia in 2004.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n       (13) According to the Department of State's Patterns of \n     Global Terrorism 2001 report, ``Iran's Islamic Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security \n     continued to be involved in the planning and support of \n     terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals,'' and ``Iran continued to \n     provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist \n     groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the \n     [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General \n     Command]--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, \n     training and weapons''.\n       (14) Iran currently operates more than 10 radio and \n     television stations broadcasting in Iraq that incite violent \n     actions against United States and coalition personnel in \n     Iraq.\n       (15) The current leaders of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     and Hashemi Rafsanjani, have repeatedly called upon Muslims \n     to kill Americans in Iraq and install a theocratic regime in \n     Iraq.\n       (16) The Government of Iran has admitted pursuing a \n     clandestine nuclear program, which the United States \n     intelligence community believes may include a nuclear weapons \n     program.\n       (17) The Government of Iran has failed to meet repeated \n     pledges to arrest and extradite foreign terrorists in Iran.\n       (18) The United States Government believes that the \n     Government of Iran supports terrorists and extremist \n     religious leaders in Iraq with the clear intention of \n     subverting coalition efforts to bring peace and democracy to \n     Iraq.\n       (19) The Ministry of Defense of Iran confirmed in July 2003 \n     that it had successfully conducted the final test of the \n     Shahab-3 missile, giving Iran an operational intermediate-\n     range ballistic missile capable of striking both Israel and \n     United States troops throughout the Middle East and \n     Afghanistan.\n       (b) Congress declares that it should be the policy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) to support efforts by the people of Iran to exercise \n     self-determination over the form of government of their \n     country; and\n       (2) to actively support a national referendum in Iran with \n     oversight by international observers and monitors to certify \n     the integrity and fairness of the referendum.\n       (c)(1) The President is authorized, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, to provide financial and political \n     assistance (including the award of grants) to foreign and \n     domestic individuals, organizations, and entities that \n     support democracy and the promotion of democracy in Iran. \n     Such assistance includes funding for--\n       (A) the Broadcasting Board of Governors for efforts to \n     cultivate and support independent broadcasters that broadcast \n     into Iran;\n       (B) cultural and student exchanges;\n       (C) the promotion of human rights and civil society \n     activities in Iran; and\n       (D) assistance to student organizations, labor unions, and \n     trade associations in Iran.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that financial and \n     political assistance under this section be provided to an \n     individual, organization, or entity that--\n       (A) opposes the use of terrorism;\n       (B) advocates the adherence by Iran to nonproliferation \n     regimes for nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and \n     materiel;\n       (C) is dedicated to democratic values and supports the \n     adoption of a democratic form of government in Iran;\n       (D) is dedicated to respect for human rights, including the \n     fundamental equality of women;\n       (E) works to establish equality of opportunity for people; \n     and\n       (F) supports freedom of the press, freedom of speech, \n     freedom of association, and freedom of religion.\n       (3) The President may provide assistance under this \n     subsection using amounts made available pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under paragraph (7).\n       (4) Not later than 15 days before each obligation of \n     assistance under this subsection, and in accordance with the \n     procedures under section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394-l), the President shall notify the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives.\n       (5) It is the sense of Congress that in order to ensure \n     maximum coordination among Federal agencies, if the President \n     provides the assistance under this section, the President \n     should appoint an individual who shall--\n       (A) serve as special assistant to the President on matters \n     relating to Iran; and\n       (B) coordinate among the appropriate directors of the \n     National Security Council on issues regarding such matters.\n       (6) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) support for a transition to democracy in Iran should be \n     expressed by United States representatives and officials in \n     all appropriate international fora;\n       (B) representatives of the Government of Iran should be \n     denied access to all United States Government buildings;\n       (C) efforts to bring a halt to the nuclear weapons program \n     of Iran, including steps to end the supply of nuclear \n     components or fuel to Iran, should be intensified, with \n     particular attention focused on the cooperation regarding \n     such program--\n       (i) between the Government of Iran and the Government of \n     the Russian Federation; and\n       (ii) between the Government of Iran and individuals from \n     China, Malaysia, and Pakistan, including the network of Dr. \n     Abdul Qadeer (A. Q.) Khan; and\n       (D) officials and representatives of the United States \n     should--\n       (i) strongly and unequivocally support indigenous efforts \n     in Iran calling for free, transparent, and democratic \n     elections; and\n       (ii) draw international attention to violations by the \n     Government of Iran of human rights, freedom of religion, \n     freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press.\n       (7) There is authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Department of State $100,000,000 to carry out activities \n     under this subsection.\n       (d) Not later than 15 days before designating a democratic \n     opposition organization as eligible to receive assistance \n     under subsection (b), the President shall notify the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives of the proposed designation. \n     The notification may be in classified form.\n       (e)(1)(A) The amount appropriated by chapter 2 of title I \n     for the Broadcasting Board of Governors under the heading \n     ``international broadcasting operations'' is hereby increased \n     by $12,500,000.\n       (B) The amount appropriated by chapter 4 of title I for \n     other bilateral assistance for the Department of State under \n     the heading ``Democracy Fund'' is hereby increased by \n     $12,500,000.\n       (2)(A) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 2 of title I \n     for the Broadcasting Board of Governors under the heading \n     ``international broadcasting operations'', as increased by \n     paragraph (1)(A), $12,500,000 shall be made available for \n     democracy programs and activities in Iran.\n       (B) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 4 of title I for \n     other bilateral assistance for the Department of State under \n     the heading ``Democracy Fund'', as increased by paragraph \n     (1)(B), $12,500,000 shall be made available for democracy \n     programs and activities in Iran.\n       (3) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 2 of title 1 \n     under the heading Department of State and Related Agency, \n     excluding funds appropriated for Educational and Cultural \n     Exchange Programs and Public Diplomacy Programs, $42,750,000 \n     shall be available for the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n     for Democracy Programs and Activities in Iran.\n       (4) Of the amount appropriated by chapter 4, title 1, \n     $47,250,000 shall be made available for the Democracy Fund \n     for democracy programs and activities in Iran.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, this is an amendment to add $25 \nmillion to the money that the President requested for prodemocracy \nefforts for Iran within the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental. It is \nvitally important to understand how important this effort is in the \nface of what we are dealing with in Iran today.\n  We have heard lots of talk in the press about military options, given \nthe potential nuclear threat from Iran. This is not a military option; \nthis is a diplomatic option. It is a vitally important option. It is an \noption that says we in the United States are going to step forward and \nprovide funding, a robust level of funding, for efforts through \ntelecommunications as well as by seeding prodemocracy movements within \nIran to effect change within the country of Iran so they do not move \nforward with this technology, do not move forward and continue to \nsupport terrorism, do not move forward and continue to be a disruptive \nforce in Iraq, do not move forward and continue to be a disruptive \nforce in the world, by having a more prodemocratic regime in this \ncountry.\n  What this amendment does is add $12.5 million for the Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors--again, for public diplomacy in Iran--as well as \n$12.5 million for the Iran Democracy Fund. It is a total of $25 million \nin addition to the 75 in the bill. We also authorize using the language \nfrom the Iran freedom and support bill. This is a bill that has strong \nbipartisan support, close to 60 cosponsors, I think 56 or 57 as of this \ndate. It is very strongly bipartisan. It is supported by a lot of the \ngroups with interests in the Middle East.\n  We put authorizing language in here to make sure this money is spent \nin conformity with how the Congress would wish it to be spent. This is \nCongress putting its imprimatur on this supplemental appropriation \nlanguage the President has put forward.\n  Having spoken to Secretary Rice and the President about this \nlanguage, one of the reasons they put forward this money in the \nsupplemental is because of the strong support Congress has shown both \nin the House and the Senate for the Iran Freedom and Support Act. We \nare using this opportunity to provide more direction for the use of \nthis fund from the Congress, which I think is vitally important.\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\n  In my opinion, today there is no more important foreign policy area \nthan in dealing with the emerging and present threat of Iran. To be \nvery honest, the Congress has done nothing to address this issue. We \nhave not stepped forward and articulated what our policy is within \nIran. We do this with this amendment. We say as a sense of the Senate \nthat we express support for a transition to democracy within Iran. That \nis language included in this amendment. We make clear statements about \nwhat we intend and what our direction is, what this money is to be used \nfor. We provide a broader outline than what is in the current \nlegislation.\n  I hope this language would be supported. We fence this money within \nthe money for the State Department in this legislation so we are not \nstealing money from anywhere else. We are just making sure that the \n$100 million is spent in this area and we provide more guidance for the \nadministration to do so.\n  I am hopeful this language can be accepted by both sides. As I said \nbefore, this is a bill that has strong bipartisan support and this \nlanguage also has very strong bipartisan support.\n  I thank again the Senator from Oregon for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3665\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the pending amendment which I offered last \nnight and discussed briefly with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Cochran, is before the Senate at this time. It deals \nwith the most expensive and the most needless giveaway that taxpayers \nladle out to the oil industry. It is something called royalty relief. I \nwill take a few minutes to explain to the Senate how this works.\n  The oil companies are supposed to pay royalties to the Federal \nGovernment when they extract oil from Federal lands. In order to \nstimulate production when the price of oil was cheap, the Federal \nGovernment reduced the amount of royalty payments the companies had to \nmake, certainly a logical argument for doing something such as that \nwhen we are not getting the production we need. When prices are cheap \nand we do not have incentives, then there is an argument for some kind \nof royalty relief. But now that the price of oil has soared to over $70 \na barrel, the discounted royalty payments amount to a needless subsidy \nof billions and billions of dollars.\n  Now, to his credit, the President has essentially said, look, we do \nnot need this huge array of incentives for the oil industry when the \nprice is over $50 a barrel. Now we are looking at $70 a barrel. So a \nprogram that one could argue on behalf of when the price of oil was \ncheap has lost all its rationale at this critical time when we, of \ncourse, are seeing record prices, record profits, and now record \nroyalty subsidies to the companies, as well.\n  What we have before the Senate is truly a bizarre situation. The \nSenate is working on a supplemental spending program that is designated \nas emergency spending because our Government does not have the money to \npay for it. Yet the Senate is still willing to distribute, needlessly, \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer money.\n  This program, by the General Accounting Office, is designed to lose \nat a minimum $20 billion. There is litigation underway with the oil \ncompanies surrounding this program. If that litigation is successful, \nit is possible this program will cost our Government $80 billion; $80 \nbillion then becomes twice the amount that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi has in the legislation that is considered emergency \nspending.\n  Experts in and out of Government have said recently this subsidy \nmakes absolutely no sense. For example, from the other body of the \nCongress, Congressman Richard Pombo, the chairman of the natural \nresources committee, is not a person that anyone would call anti-oil in \nhis views about Government. This is what Congressman Pombo, the \nchairman of the natural resources committee, had to say a little bit \nago about royalty relief: There is no need for an incentive. They have \na market incentive to produce at $70 a barrel.\n  Michael Coney, a lawyer for Shell Oil--again, not a place one would \nnormally look to hear anti-oil rhetoric espoused, said that under the \ncurrent environment, we don't need royalty relief.\n  Even the original author of this program, the very respected former \ncolleague Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, essentially the person \nwho put this whole thing together, thinks this program is out of whack.\n  Senator Johnston said:\n\n       The one thing I can tell you is this is not what we \n     intended.\n\n  So I come to the Senate today with a simple proposition. My \nproposition is, royalty relief can only be obtained if it is needed to \navert a supply disruption or prices drop and there is no incentive for \npeople to produce in the United States.\n  The distinguished Senator in the chair, Senator Coburn, knows a great \ndeal about the oil business. I want to make sure there are incentives \nfor production. But the President of the United States, to his credit, \nhas said you don't need incentives when oil is over $50 a barrel. It is \nat $70 today.\n  (Mr. McCain assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Not long ago when the oil company executives came before \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I went down the line and \nasked them if they needed the various tax breaks. To a person, they all \nsaid no. So now we are seeing a bit of discussion about whether all of \nthese tax breaks are needed by people in the oil business.\n  It is one thing to talk about new initiatives--and we will be \ndebating a variety of additional approaches, windfall profits taxes and \nthe like--and it is quite another to be spending billions and billions \nof dollars out the door when those subsidy payments defy common sense, \ndefy essentially what the President of the United States said, that we \nought to get out of the subsidy business when oil is over $50 a barrel. \nThat is what I am proposing in this particular amendment.\n  What it comes down to is the U.S. Government ought to stop adding \nsweetener to the Royalty Relief Program. At every opportunity over the \nlast few years--and I see the distinguished Senator in the chair has \nzeroed in on wasteful programs, to his credit, for a long time--at \nevery opportunity we have seen this program sweetened and sweetened and \nsweetened, all at the taxpayers' expense. To give the Senate an idea of \nhow out of control this particular program is, as I understand it, the \nprevious Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Norton, actually went out \nand sweetened up the old contracts to provide even more royalty relief \nat a time when prices, again, were way above the threshold that the \nPresident of the United States has indicated we should not be offering \nsubsidies to.\n  This is an important debate in this whole question of tax breaks and \nwindfall profits tax and the like. It is clearly going to spark a lot \nof debate and differences of opinion among colleagues.\n  This, in my view, is not even a close call. When Congressman Pombo \nfrom the other body, the chair of the natural resources committee, says \nwe did not need this incentive, when we have people from Shell Oil \nsaying we do not need the Royalty Relief Program, when we have the \noriginal author of the program, our former colleague Senator Bennett \nJohnston, saying this is not what he intended, I sure hope that is a \nwakeup call to the Senate. This is not a close call.\n  We are going to see, according to the General Accounting Office, a \nminimum of $20 billion head out the door as a result of this program.\n  By the way, it was sweetened up also in the energy conference last \nyear. In fact, it was done almost in the dead of night because nobody \ncould make a case for sweetening up this program anymore in broad \ndaylight. So essentially, with virtually no debate, even last year, in \nthe Energy bill, after the previous Secretary of the Interior, \nSecretary Norton, had kept adding to the program, the Congress \ncontinued to enrich this program and needlessly offered these \nsubsidies.\n  Mr. President, I think a little bit of history is in order. \nCertainly, back in the middle 1990s--this program is, essentially, one \nthat is a decade old--you could make an argument for the Government \nbeing involved in an incentives effort. Certainly, when the price of \nenergy was low and we needed opportunities to incentivize production, \nso\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\nbe it. That was a case where some targeted efforts on the part of \nGovernment to stimulate production could make some sense.\n  The Government is now out of the targeting business. For example, \nthere are no limits on who gets royalty relief. The President of the \nUnited States did not say: Oh, we ought to draw distinctions between \npeople who get these various subsidies. The President of the United \nStates said: We don't need Government subsidies when the price of oil \nis over $50 a barrel.\n  So what happened, essentially, after the program got off the ground \nin the early 1990s is folks who were supposed to be watchdogging the \nprogram did not do their job. They did not pay attention to it. So \nthere was an original threshold for this program of about $34. The \nprice of oil today is $70-plus a barrel. They were talking, in the \nmiddle 1990s, about $34 being the threshold level for the subsidy.\n  But what happened is, during the Clinton administration, some folks \nin the Government agency, the minerals program, who were supposed to be \nwatchdogging this program just missed it. Some have described it as a \nbureaucratic blunder. However you want to call it, the reality is, \nGovernment, in the middle 1990s, was not doing right by the taxpayers. \nThe Government should have been watchdogging this program. They should \nhave seen there would be an effort by some in the oil industry to \nenrich themselves and use the taxpayer to essentially create an \nincentive that was unjustifiable and inexplicable, if you looked at \nwhat we are seeing today. Yet the money just kept pouring out the \ndoors.\n  So what we have is a brandnew subsidy--new because it was added \nduring the energy legislation, at a time when the price of oil was \nalready above $55 per barrel. Certainly, the industry cannot make a \nclaim they need this kind of incentive, as they have said in the past.\n  They have been drilling, and drilling without this particular \nincentive. In fact, we have seen, fortunately, some increase in \ndrilling and production over the past 2 years without this particular \nincentive. There is no doubt in my mind, if you look at the record \nprices and if you look at the record profits, the drilling is going to \ncontinue if and when the amendment I have before the Senate is adopted.\n  I wish to emphasize, this legislation does give the Bush \nadministration a significant amount of discretion in terms of operating \nthe Royalty Relief Program. If the President, if the Secretary of the \nInterior, for example, determines that an absence of royalty relief \nwould cause a disruption in oil supply, they set it aside, go back to \nthe Royalty Relief Program. If the price of oil were to drop \nprecipitously again, once more, you can provide oil royalty relief. But \nwhen the companies make record profits, when they charge record prices, \nit seems to me they do not need these record amounts of subsidies.\n  So the supplemental we are on the floor debating now involves $35 \nbillion. The amendment I hope to have adopted today would pick up a \nsignificant portion of the costs of the supplemental that have been \ndesignated as emergency spending.\n  If the litigation that is now taking place surrounding this program \nis successful--and I do not think anyone can divine the results of that \nlitigation--it is possible the Government will be out $80 billion for \nthis particular program. That is twice the amount--twice the amount--of \nthe money this legislation involves.\n  Now, colleagues--and I see a number of Senators on the floor--this is \nthe granddaddy of all the oil subsidies. This is the biggest and this \nis the most unjustifiable of all the breaks.\n  By the way, we have had good ideas coming from colleagues. And \nprobably the best single idea--and the distinguished Senator from \nArizona has had an interest in these issues for some time--the Senator \nfrom Wyoming has said, to his credit, he wants to target the tax \nincentives for oil drilling to get more out of existing wells. There is \na lot of evidence that perhaps a third of the oil that is in these \nexisting wells is being left behind because we have never retooled the \ntax laws to get more from existing wells.\n  So there are good ideas, Mr. President and colleagues, and Senator \nThomas from Wyoming deserves credit for one of the best. But I will \ntell you, there are some real turkeys out there. And one of them is \nthis existing program which provides royalty relief where there is no \ncase to do so. This is an out-of-control program. This is a program \nwhich has lost its historical moorings. It made sense in 1995, when the \nprice of oil was cheap, but it sure does not make any sense today.\n\n  When I asked the executives who came before the Energy Committee \nrecently--the CEOs of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Texaco, ConocoPhillips, BP, \nand Shell--I asked them specifically if they needed these new \nincentives. All of them said they did not.\n  So I am offering this amendment today that prohibits the Department \nof Energy from providing any additional royalty relief so long as the \nprice of oil is above $55 per barrel. That is the price at which the \nPresident said oil companies do not need incentives to explore.\n  The amendment, as I have indicated, provides an exception in cases \nwhere royalty relief is needed to avoid supply disruptions because of \nhurricanes or other natural disasters or if the price of oil were to \nfall. But with oil selling for more than $70 a barrel--way above the \nprice for which the President said incentives were not needed--Congress \nought to stop giving away more taxpayer money for unnecessary \nsubsidies. We ought to prohibit further royalty relief, use this money \nto pay down the deficit, as the distinguished Senator from Arizona has \nsuggested on this floor on more than one occasion, and save our \ncitizens' hard-earned tax dollars for more worthy uses.\n  Consumers of this country are already paying more at work. They are \npaying more at home and as they drive everywhere in between. It seems \nto me we certainly ought to give them a break in their personal energy \nbills before we continue the operation of a program that the General \nAccounting Office has said will cost taxpayers a minimum of $20 billion \nand could end up costing taxpayers $80 billion, if the litigation over \nthis program is successful.\n  Mr. President, I see other colleagues on the floor. I have not had \nanybody come to the floor and say they are going to oppose my \namendment. If no one does--and I am not going to yield quite at this \npoint--I am anxious--and the chairman of the committee, Senator \nCochran, has been very gracious in his discussions with me. I am \nanxious to go to a vote. I know the Senator from Mississippi treats all \nMembers fairly, and I have told him I am ready to go to an up-or-down \nvote on my amendment and get the Senate on record as making sure we \nsave this money which is being needlessly frittered away.\n  No one has come to the floor of the Senate to say they object to the \namendment. The amendment is very straightforward. It says we are not \ngoing to have royalty relief unless the President says we have to have \nit to avoid a disruption or the price of oil falls. This is a program \nwhich does not make sense. We ought to save the money.\n  I, at this point, would like to propound a request to the \ndistinguished chair of the committee. I would be prepared to allow the \nSenate to move on to other business if we could agree upon a time when \nthere could be an up-or-down vote on my amendment. Would the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from Mississippi, \ngive me his thoughts? And can we enter into an agreement so you can \nmove ahead with the important work you are doing and we can lock in a \ntime for a vote on my amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I will be \nhappy to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am willing to yield so that the chairman \nof the committee can respond to my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent. The Senator \nfrom Oregon should request unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, be allowed to \nrespond to my request, and that after he has completed his response I \nreclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I will be happy to respond to the \nSenator's inquiry. Responding to the Senator's inquiry, I am not, as \nmanager of the bill, deciding who offers an amendment or what the \ncontent of the amendment is or how long the amendment can be discussed, \nwhether or not there will be a tabling motion offered to any amendment \nor reaching an agreement with each Senator as to when a vote would \noccur on the amendment. The Senate rules control all of those issues. \nAs manager of the bill, I am not going to inject myself in trying to \nmanage to the extreme minutiae of the procedures of the Senate the way \nthis bill is considered. I think we have rules that are here for a \npurpose. We ought to follow the rules.\n  We have other Senators who have offered amendments already which are \npending and were pending before the amendment of the Senator from \nOregon. They have a right, and I am not going to do anything that would \nabridge or infringe upon that right, to call for the regular order at \nany time. And the Senate would go back to the consideration of those \nearlier amendments.\n  So I cannot give the Senator any assurance, except you should be \ntreated like any other Senator; no different whatsoever. You have the \nright to talk about your amendment, and eventually it will be disposed \nof in some way. But I am not going to put it ahead, reach an agreement \nthat it should go ahead of any other issue before the Senate.\n  This an emergency, urgent supplemental appropriations bill to fund \nthe war in Iraq, the global war on terror, provide the Department of \nDefense and Department of State with funds that are needed now to \nprotect the national security interests of our country, and to assist \nin the recovery from Hurricane Katrina and other such events.\n  That is the business of the Senate. I wish to see it handled in an \nexpeditious way, under the rules of the Senate, and then we wind up the \nbusiness of the Senate on this bill and any amendments thereto in a \nworkmanlike way, with fairness to all, Republicans and Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think it is going to be a long day \nbecause I intend to stay here and make the case for this outrageous \nrip-off being eliminated. This is an extraordinary waste of taxpayer \nmoney. Colleagues know I always try to work in a bipartisan way. I \nalways want to expedite the business of the Senate.\n  The last time the Senate looked at energy, after midnight, in the \nmiddle of the night, there was an effort to sweeten this program and \nadd more cost to taxpayers that cannot be justified. As I understand \nit, I may have misspoken on this point; the total amount of the \nsupplemental bill is $100 billion. The cost of litigation over this \nprogram, if successful, could be $80 billion. The General Accounting \nOffice estimates that at a minimum, the Government is going to be out \n$20 billion. My amendment alone could pay a significant portion of what \nis needed to cover this emergency spending legislation.\n  The Government is here talking about an emergency spending bill \nbecause there isn't the money in order to pay for these essential \nprograms. Yet at a time when we have an emergency spending bill and we \ndon't have the money in order to take care of needs, the Government \nkeeps ladling out billions of dollars. All I want to do is prevent what \nwe saw last year in the Energy bill. We are now going to do it \ndifferently. We are going to stay here, and we are going to stay at \nthis discussion until the Senate votes up or down as to whether we want \nto keep sweetening a program with billions and billions of dollars at a \ntime when there is no commonsense reason for this particular program.\n  I have come to admire the Senator from Arizona. We serve together on \nthe Commerce Committee. I particularly appreciate his tenaciousness. He \nhas taught me an awful lot about it. Frankly, that is what is needed. \nSomebody has to stay here and stay at this until we drain this swamp. \nTo continually shovel out billions and billions of dollars, when the \nPresident of the United States has said we don't need these incentives \nwhen oil is over $50 a barrel, I don't see how anybody can argue for \nthe continuation of this program in its current form.\n  I said I am not going to chuck the program in the trash can. All I am \ngoing to say is, you get royalty relief if the price of oil goes down \nor we need royalty relief to avoid disruptions. That is a \nstraightforward proposition. It certainly ensures that we go back to \nwhat was originally contemplated. Even the authors of this program, \npeople such as our former colleague Senator Bennett Johnston, are \nscratching their heads and saying: This program is completely out of \ncontrol. It makes no sense in its current form.\n  I don't see how you can argue something that at its outset was \ndesigned to promote production when prices were cheap. By the way, a \nlot of the sponsors of this legislation always said this program was \ncost free. I was amazed to hear that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Through the Chair, I ask unanimous consent to have Senator \nMcCain propound his question, and when I have responded, I would be \nable to reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the Senator yields for a question, then \nhe maintains the right to the floor. I by no means want to deprive him \nof that.\n  Is the Senator from Oregon concerned that he is not going to get a \nvote on this amendment? Because it seems to me if the amendment is \nproposed and it is in order, at some point, after disposing of the \npending amendments, unless there is something I don't understand, the \namendment of the Senator from Oregon would then be subject to a vote. \nAs the Senator from Oregon knows, there are several other pending \namendments that we think are important as well, particularly having to \ndo with earmarks.\n  I note this morning in a Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, the No. 1 \nconcern of Americans is earmarks. I find it very interesting that they \nare sick and tired of the absolutely incredible stuff we have loaded \ninto this bill. The Senator from Oklahoma and I have an amendment about \nseafood marketing. The Senator from Oregon, I am sure, probably \nremembers that last year they spent some half a million to paint a \ngiant salmon on a 737. The same money would go to that same outfit in \nthis bill that is supposed to be for the war in Iraq.\n  I am sorry for the long question. I apologize to my friend from \nOregon. Is it his concern that he will not get a vote on this amendment \nor that he needs a vote now? Perhaps for the rest of us who are waiting \nto offer amendments, he could clarify. I thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor his courtesy.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend. Before we got into seafood marketing \nand the question of earmarks, it seemed to me that your point was a \nvery logical one, sometimes too logical for the Senate. That is, how do \nyou get a vote around here? What I was asking the distinguished \nchairman of the committee is if we could get agreement to have a vote \nat a time certain or conceivably to have my proposal included in the \nnext group of amendments to be voted on. But, yes, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, without that commitment, I am very \nmuch convinced that we won't get an up-or-down vote on this outrageous \nboondoggle, a huge expenditure of many billions of dollars that as \nrecently as the energy conference, there were no votes. It was done in \nthe middle of the night. It was snuck in after midnight.\n  The reason why: Because nobody was able to do what I am trying do \nright here on the floor of the Senate, which is to say, we are going to \ndo this in broad daylight. If Senators want to vote in favor of a \nprogram that subsidizes, when we are over $70 a barrel and the \nPresident of the United States says we don't need those subsidies, then \nSenators can so vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may, if the Senator will yield for an additional \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not require unanimous \nconsent. He retains his time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Very good.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My understanding from talking to the floor staff, I say \nto the Senator from Oregon--and the distinguished chairman can probably \nhelp\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\nout on this--is we have a number of amendments in order which are going \nto be voted on, I think by an agreement between the two leaders, which \nis the general procedure around here.\n  Nothing is more outrageous, as the Senator from Oregon pointed out, \nthan these things that are stuffed into conference reports. But this \nisn't a conference report. This is an initial bite at an appropriations \nbill. I hope that perhaps we could work out something so we can \ncontinue with the amendment process and set a time for votes on all \namendments, with the amendment of the Senator from Oregon in order \nfollowing the others, as is the normal procedure. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Oregon could ask for that again, we could move forward. We all \nknow that everybody's time is limited.\n  I thank the Senator for responding to my question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. To respond to my friend from Arizona, he is very good at \nworking out arrangements to get votes on these matters that are so \nimportant to the public interest. Perhaps it is possible, through his \ngood offices, to persuade Senator Cochran and others that we can make \narrangements. I am not anxious to hold up the time of the Senate. By \nthe way, I was here late last night, and I would have been prepared to \nvote last night. So this Member was prepared to vote last night. I am \nprepared to vote now. I am prepared to give up the floor as long as \nthere is a commitment that we get a vote. But the handling of this \nprogram is a disgrace.\n  You cannot make an argument for having no accountability whatsoever \nat a time when billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are used. That \nis what happened during the energy legislation where in the dead of \nnight, not only was the program preserved, the program was sweetened at \na time when the President says you cannot make the case for these kinds \nof subsidies.\n  We will continue with this discussion. My door, as always, remains \nopen to colleagues. I would like to think I was bipartisan before it \nbecame fashionable to be bipartisan. I note that Senator Kyl is a \ncosponsor of the legislation. Senator Lieberman has joined on as a \ncosponsor of the legislation. I remain anxious to work with Senators to \nget this worked out.\n  We have been talking a lot about lobbyists. We have had a lobbying \nreform bill and the Senate has acted. It was not all I wished it were, \nbut at least it was a beginning. Talk about special interests and about \nthe clout of lobbyists, this program is a textbook case of how a \nhandful of savvy lobbyists can hotwire the political process and end up \ncosting taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. The law itself, \nthrough the handiwork of all these lobbyists, is full of confusing \nlanguage, language that has lent itself to a wide variety of \ninterpretations. We are almost running a lawyers full employment \nprogram with this particular initiative. It will be in court endlessly, \nas far as I can tell. It was a program that was sweetened by the \nadministration, even at a time when the President said you didn't need \nadded incentives when oil was over $50 a barrel.\n  I have mentioned some of the problems we saw in the previous \nadministration. I guess nobody was home watchdogging the particular \nprogram there in the minerals department because they were supposed to \nhave a threshold in terms of when subsidies would be dispensed. But \nwhat you have seen with this particular program is how a handful of \ninsiders, very clever lobbyists, have been able to get the Government \nto give away billions and billions of dollars. I don't understand how \nany Member of the Senate could go home, face a town meeting in their \nparticular community, and make the case for having this program in its \ncurrent form at this crucial time. Do Senators want to go home, meet \nwith folks in grange halls and senior centers and the like--I just got \nclobbered on the way to a meeting about these prices--and say, gosh, we \nhave to continue this royalty relief program? Essentially what you have \nis a multiyear fiasco.\n  It began in 1995. At that time, with the price of energy low, you \ncould make a case for this particular program. But over the years, and \nparticularly in the last few years with high prices, what you have is a \nsituation where you have a program mushrooming in cost, mushrooming in \nterms of the toll it takes on taxpayers. The Bush administration has \neven confirmed that the Government will lose billions of dollars in \nroyalties.\n  So this argument some have made that this program costs nothing--we \nheard that in the energy debate last year. It is an argument that the \nRoyalty Relief Program costs nothing. Now that is contradicted by the \nBush administration itself, which has indicated that it is going to \nhave to waive billions and billions of dollars in royalties.\n  There is a lawsuit underway, as I have noted. The lawsuit challenges \nwhat amounts to one of the few restrictions on the cash drawer the oil \ncompanies look to, and I gather that the oil companies have a pretty \ngood chance of prevailing there. So we would see even more money \nshoveled out the door in the days ahead. Some have called this program \none that was noncontroversial. I will tell you that I don't think you \ncan explain this to anybody in broad daylight. That is why the actions \nwith respect to sweetening the program were taken in the middle of the \nnight. After the CEOs of all of the major oil companies have come \nbefore a joint hearing of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committees, \nsaying, in response to my question, that they agreed with the \nPresident's position that when the price of oil is more than $55 per \nbarrel, they don't need incentives to explore for oil and gas, I wish \none Senator would come to the floor today and say here is why we need \nthe Royalty Relief Program.\n  I note that I have been trying to get a vote on this particular \namendment since last night. Not one Senator has come to the floor and \nsaid that they oppose my amendment. I cannot get a commitment for a \nvote up or down. And given what has happened with these oil interests \nand this program, that is not acceptable to me, and I cannot imagine \nthat it is acceptable to the American people.\n  We have a supplemental that is going to cost $100 billion. If the \nlitigation is successful, we will see the Government out of up to $80 \nbillion. The General Accounting Office estimates the minimum cost of \nthis program will be $20 billion. So at some point, it seems to me, the \nSenate has to step in and say we are going to have some accountability \nhere for taxpayer money; we are not going to sit on our hands when the \nmoney pours out the door.\n  In terms of the timeline, there are a couple of dates that I think \nare particularly important. In January of 2004, the Department of the \nInterior apparently expanded the royalty incentives--the incentives the \ncompanies would be getting under this particular program. About a year \nafter that, the President of the United States made his statement with \nrespect to what kind of incentives there should be for people in the \noil business. He said, as I have noted today, with oil at $70 a barrel, \nthe Government ought to get out of the business. That is the President \nof the United States. The President said we don't need these \nincentives. By the way, he made no distinction in terms of the kind of \ncompanies involved. He just said the Government doesn't need to be \npouring out subsidies when the price of oil is $70 a barrel.\n  The next key date was in the summer of 2005----\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield to my colleague for a question and \nthen continue discussing my amendment.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon for \nyielding for this question. I appreciate what my friend brings to this \nissue in trying to make sure we are dealing with the budgetary \nsituation that faces our Nation in a straightforward manner. I \nappreciate his advocacy here this morning.\n  My question to my friend from Oregon is whether he would be willing \nto yield time for me to simply offer an amendment that I could do at \nthis point in time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am under the impression that I cannot \nyield to my friend--I certainly would like to--without in essence \nlosing my right to stay on the floor. As I said earlier when we had \nquestions from the Senator from Arizona and others, I would very much \nlike to get a time commitment, because I know the Senator has important \nlegislation he\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nwould like to have considered, and I also see my friend from Texas, \nSenator Cornyn. This is not my favorite way of getting the business of \nthe Senate done. But my understanding is I cannot give up the floor to \nanother Senator for purposes of their having consideration of their \namendments.\n  Reluctantly, I tell my good friend, a wonderful addition to the \nSenate, that I cannot do that at this time. I also see our friend from \nArizona here. He may be working his magic with the leadership and the \nChair so as to be able to at some point lock in a vote. I would be \nhappy if I could get a commitment that the Senate would vote on this \namendment. I would be happy to let colleagues proceed for several hours \nand have a chance to do their important work.\n\n  I note once again that not one Senator of either political party has \ncome to the floor and said they want to defend this multibillion dollar \nprogram in its current form. That is an astounding thing. I was very \npleased to get Senator Kyl this morning as a cosponsor of the \nlegislation, and Senator Lieberman and others. But what is stunning is \nin this place you can hardly get everybody to agree to go out and get a \nsoda pop. Yet in discussing this legislation, nobody has stood up and \nsaid they are going to defend the Royalty Relief Program in its current \nform.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask my friend if he would yield for \nanother question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Once again, as part of the unanimous consent agreement, I \ndo yield for a question.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, to my friend from Oregon, I ask if he \nwould object to a unanimous consent request on my part to offer an \namendment concerning a fire emergency disaster we are facing across our \nNation in the West--something that also affects the State of Oregon--\nand to agree not to object to my unanimous consent request to offer \nthis amendment and to speak to this amendment for a period of no more \nthan 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me propound this to the Chair. My \nunderstanding is if I yield to the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nfor purposes of these unanimous consent requests, I would lose the \nopportunity to be considered, after he discussed this, automatically. \nMy understanding is I cannot yield to the Senator from Colorado without \nlosing my place. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It requires unanimous consent to yield for \nanything but a question. So it could be propounded as a unanimous \nconsent request that the Senator from Colorado would be recognized, \nfollowed by the recognition of the Senator from Oregon, as long as no \nother Senator objected.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, I tell my friend from Colorado that this is not my \npreferred choice of doing business in the Senate. I was ready to vote \nlast night. I am ready to vote now. I am ready to vote as part of a \npackage of amendments. My understanding is I cannot yield the floor at \nthis time without losing my place. I reluctantly have to decline.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask another question of my friend. All \nI am attempting to do, as many colleagues here are attempting to do, is \nput an amendment on file so we can make them part of the pending \nbusiness. We can have a unanimous consent for you to yield to me for 2 \nminutes so I can offer my amendment. Part of that unanimous consent \nwould be that we then go back to the Senator's amendment. I think we \ncan get down to at least offering one more amendment.\n  I ask the Chair whether I am correct in my assumption that if there \nis no objection to my unanimous consent request, then I can offer my \namendment and then return the floor to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: However much I would \nlike to do what the Senator from Colorado has suggested, I cannot do \nthat without losing my place on the floor, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator could do what the Senator from \nColorado is talking about by unanimous consent, as long as no other \nSenator objected to what he was asking.\n  Mr. WYDEN. So if the Senator from Colorado propounds a unanimous \nconsent request asking that he be allowed to speak for a couple of \nminutes so as to be able to offer his amendment, at the end of those 2 \nminutes, what he has offered is set aside and the business of the \nSenate would once again be my amendment, the Chair is advising that \nthat could be done?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It first takes unanimous consent for the \nSenator from Colorado to even ask for unanimous consent while the \nSenator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me say I am going to have staff work \nwith the Parliamentarian for a bit--my staff and Senator Salazar's \nstaff, and others--to see if we can address the concern of the Senator \nfrom Colorado. Maybe we can get a number of Senators involved in this \nso we can lock in some actual votes.\n  I would be very pleased to get a commitment from the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, to have my amendment \nincluded in the next group of votes. That is a pretty simple request--\nsomething that goes on here very often. It seems to me if we cannot do \nthat, and I am not included, then I guess I have to stay at my post \nhere and say that I think the taxpayers ought to get some protection \nand we ought to stop the ripping off, the persistent plundering of tax \nrevenue, at a time when the President and everybody else says you \ncannot justify these kinds of incentives. If I can get a commitment \nfrom the distinguished chairman from Mississippi to have my amendment \nincluded in the next group of votes, and we will get an up-or-down \nvote, I would certainly like to save my larynx and let the Senate get \nabout its business.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nwithout his losing the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator asked if I would agree that \nhe could have an up-or-down vote at a specific time or in a certain \norder. That in itself treats the Senator in a way that is different \nfrom the way every other Senator would be treated under the rules of \nthe Senate.\n  We have opportunities for making points of order against an amendment \nthat every Senator has under the rules. Any Senator could move to table \nthe Senator's amendment and get the yeas and nays. But he is insisting \nthat his amendment be treated different from that required under the \nrules in that he wants an up-or-down vote and he wants it in a certain \norder.\n  His amendment was not in the first order of business when the Senate \nstarted its work today. There were other amendments pending. But the \nSenator, by unanimous consent, proceeded with his offering of an \namendment.\n  All I am suggesting is, I cannot be the referee for the duration of \nthe handling of this bill and decide whose amendments get up-or-down \nvotes, whose amendment can be tabled or a motion to table can be made, \nwhether parliamentary objections can be made to proceeding on an \namendment. Any person can be recognized to debate the amendment and \ntalk without interruption until 60 Senators vote to cut off debate of \nthat Senator who is talking.\n  So I am not going to make, I can't make, it is not appropriate for me \nto make rules that, in effect, limit all of the other Senators in the \nrights they have under the rules of the Senate.\n  This is just plain and simple. He is asking for special treatment of \nhis amendment, and I don't have the power to do that and be fair at the \nsame time to every other Senator. So that is why I am not agreeing to \nthe unanimous consent request. I don't think it is appropriate that I \ndo that.\n  His amendment ought to be treated just like anybody else's amendment. \nBut he comes out here after amendments are being set aside at his \nrequest and offers his amendment and asks that we agree to vote up or \ndown at a particular time. I have heard from some Senators who have \nconcerns about the amendment.\n  The Energy Committee has jurisdiction of this legislation. I am \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, not the Energy Committee. The \nEnergy Committee has the right to review any suggested change in \ncurrent law on matters coming within the jurisdiction of their \ncommittee, and that is being denied by offering this amendment to\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\nan appropriations bill and then asking the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee to guarantee that there be an up-or-down vote \nat a particular time. So I can't agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, by way of responding to the distinguished \nChair, the Senator is not asking for special treatment. What we do in \nthe Senate again and again--it is the common practice, something that \ngoes on every week--is we have debates on amendments and then Senators \nhave those amendments put into a group, and when there has been a group \nof amendments put together and all Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave been notified that there will be votes, then there are votes.\n  That is all that I have asked for. There is no request for a specific \ntime. Do it at 1, 2, 3. Do it whenever we have a block of amendments so \nwe can get on and hear from Senator Cornyn and Senator Salazar, and I \nnow see the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from \nPennsylvania here as well.\n  I don't understand why we can't get a commitment that at some point--\nwhat goes on here regularly, that Senators get votes as a group of \namendments is considered--that be done.\n  I come back to the point, having had now considerable amount of \ndiscussion, that not one Senator has said they want to defend the oil \nroyalty relief in its current form. I think that is incredible. I \ncertainly expected some opposition. I was pleased when Senator Kyl and \nSenator Lieberman said they wanted to be cosponsors. I expected people \nto come on over here and oppose it. And I think the reason there is no \nvocal opposition to this program is exactly what we saw in the energy \nconference committee last year. You can't defend this program in broad \ndaylight. That is why it was sweetened in the middle of the night. A \nprogram that made no sense, was already a boondoggle, got even sweeter \nwith additional sums now going out the door.\n  I have noted that if the litigation of this program is successful, it \nis possible that the Government will be out a sum close to the entire \ncost of the supplemental program.\n  So I repeat to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, nothing \nwould please me more than to enter into an agreement to allow others to \ngo forward, and my amendment could be voted on in exactly the way the \nSenate customarily does business; that is, when we have a block of \namendments, a group of amendments that Senators have had a chance to \ndiscuss and consider, we would then take a vote. But for some reason, \nwe are not going to do that with respect to this multibillion-dollar \nsubsidy program, a program that has the Government subsidizing these \ncompanies through royalties when oil is $70 a barrel, and the President \nof the United States says we ought to be out of the subsidy business \nwhen oil is over $50 a barrel.\n  I have a unanimous consent request ready to go so I can satisfy \ncolleagues. I now see the distinguished Senator from New Jersey is \nhere, the Senator from Florida is here, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania is here. There are a lot of folks who would like to have a \nchance to speak, and nothing would please me more than to let them get \nabout that business.\n  I have not been here as long as the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, but I have not had an instance such as this ever happen to \nme in the Senate when I ask: Can I get a chance, as part of a group of \namendments, or at some point, an up-or-down vote, and no efforts are \nbeing made to work something like that out. I think it is unfortunate. \nI am going to have to remain at my post, and colleagues who want to ask \nquestions--does the Senator from Florida seek to ask a question?--I \nwill be able to respond and reclaim my time.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for \npurposes of a question and that he retain the floor.\n  Mr. President, to the Senator from Oregon, I certainly commend him. \nSomething is out of whack where we have a system of payments, royalty \nor otherwise, or tax credits, otherwise can be characterized in the \nvernacular of the street as giveaways, to an industry that at this \npoint is reporting their first quarter profits. It is expected today or \ntomorrow that ExxonMobile will report a profit in excess of $9 billion \nfor 3 months. That is profit for 3 months. That doesn't include the \nother major oil companies.\n  So I ask the Senator from Oregon, he has made a proposal--I don't \nknow if it is the one that is on the floor right now--to eliminate the \n$1.5 billion giveaway. Will the Senator flesh out that particular \nproposal?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is not the amendment that I offer. I will tell the \nSenator that I am trying to roll back the subsidy program that is the \ngranddaddy of all of them. This is the one that is going to fleece \ntaxpayers the worst. This is the one that the General Accounting Office \nsays at a minimum will cost taxpayers $20 billion.\n  So the Senator from Florida, who has had a great interest in energy \npolicy and serves on the committee, is talking about something else, \nbut he has made the point again that there are a host of these \nsubsidies. But the billion-dollar program that the Senator from Florida \nis talking about is peanuts compared to what we are talking about here.\n  What we are talking about here--I see the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, is here. He was, I know, a close friend of Senator \nJohnston, who was the original author of this program. Senator Johnston \nhas said that he didn't intend anything like what this program has \nturned out to be. Congressman Pombo, the chair in the other body of the \nnatural resources committee, said: You don't need this incentive. \nNobody has ever called Congressman Pombo anti-oil. Even the people at \nShell Oil say you don't need this kind of incentive in this climate.\n  The Senator from Florida makes a good point that there are a variety \nof subsidies that go out to oil companies, but the one that the Senator \nfrom Florida is talking about is really small potatoes compared to what \nwe are talking about here. I appreciate the question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Once again, under our unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wonder if the Senator from Oregon would agree, I have \nheard the comment that the normal process is for a Senator to offer an \namendment and to have an opportunity to get a guarantee of a vote. I am \nsure, would the Senator agree, that the Senator's amendment is subject \nto an amendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course. I will tell my good friend from Alaska, I have \nbeen surprised that somebody hasn't come to the floor to speak against \nmy amendment or to second-degree it, or anything of the sort. I have \nbeen here since last night, I will say--reclaiming my time--I have been \nhere since last night discussing this, and no Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, has come and opposed the amendment that I am offering. No \none has tried to second-degree it.\n  I think at this time what I would like to do----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been trying for 25 years to get a \nvote on ANWR. I fully intend to offer ANWR as an amendment in the \nsecond degree to the Senator's amendment, and then I want to help him \nget a vote. I want to help him get a vote right now. That is exactly \nwhat I have been waiting to do for 25 years.\n  So I serve notice, I will offer an amendment in the second degree, \nthe ANWR bill. I do hope we will vote on it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, just so we can make \nsure all the dots are connected, I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be voted on during the next group of amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, will that bar my offering \nof my amendment on ANWR? Is the amendment still subject to an amendment \nin the second degree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is nothing in this agreement that would \nbar a second-degree amendment.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Further reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Alaska has \npropounded a question that has not been fully answered--at least I \ndidn't understand the answer--to permit him to offer the amendment he \nwould seek to offer to this amendment. So before I yield for that \npurpose, I want to be assured that the Senator's rights are protected \non this side of the aisle and that we are not guaranteeing an up-or-\ndown vote in so doing on the underlying amendment.\n  I don't want to treat that amendment any differently from any other \namendment that might be offered. That is my concern. Maybe I should \nframe that in the form of a parliamentary inquiry. I do so inquire of \nthe Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the Chair said before, there is not \nanything in the unanimous consent request that would stop somebody from \noffering a second-degree amendment to the amendment of the Senator from \nOregon.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, this \ndoes not bar an amendment in the second degree; is that correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I repeat my parliamentary inquiry. Does \nthe Senator's request----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair's answer is there is nothing in the \nunanimous consent request that would stop the Senator from Alaska from \noffering the second-degree amendment.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am going \nto withdraw----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How does the \nSenator seek to clarify--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GRAHAM). The Senator has the right to \nwithdraw his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to withdraw my unanimous consent \nrequest at this time, and my staff is happy to work with Senator \nStevens, as we have done on so many issues, to see if we can work \nsomething out that is acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, having said that, I want to state once \nagain that I am anxious to work with all of the Senators who are on the \nfloor, and I am sure there are others hovering about the Chamber, to \nget on with the business of the Senate. All I want to be able to do is \nwhat I think is pretty customary in the Senate, and that is to get a \nvote at some point--at the time when we have the next set of \namendments. But clearly, there are those here who don't want to allow \nthat. So I think I will just have to persist.\n  One additional area I want to focus on, I say to my colleagues, is \nthat I and others, particularly a bipartisan group on the Energy \nCommittee, have been trying to get an explanation from the Interior \nDepartment for months and months about what is going on with this \nprogram. What we would like to do is see if we could get some \naccountability.\n  A number of Senators wrote back in January to express our concerns. \nWe never got an answer. And what I would like to do is highlight a few \npoints of the Senators' concerns because I think, once again, they go \nto this point about whether there is going to be some accountability in \na multibillion-dollar program that has been costly to our taxpayers.\n  The Senators said, in a January 24, 2006, letter:\n\n       There is a series of steps the Interior Department can take \n     to remedy the flaws with this program. For example--\n\n  The letter notes--\n\n     you could reinstate the full audits of the royalty relief \n     program that have been scaled back during the Bush \n     administration.\n\n  Now, as to auditing this program, auditing a multibillion-dollar \nprogram that you can't justify at a time of $70-a-barrel oil costs, you \nwould think that having these audits would be pretty much a no-brainer. \nYou would say that the Interior Department, particularly after they \nhave been criticized by their Inspector General on this particular \npoint, would be willing to step up the audits. They would be willing to \ntake some steps, some concrete steps, to make sure that so many \ntaxpayer dollars weren't being wasted. Unfortunately, that has not \ntaken place. We haven't seen the audits that even the Inspector General \nhas called for in the program.\n  Another step that has been noted by the Senators would require \nenforcement of existing rules for this program, such as those requiring \ncompanies to start paying royalties when market prices reach a \nthreshold level. Again, we have seen no response--no response--to \npractical, concrete suggestions that Senators have made to make sure we \nget some accountability into this particular program.\n  I also note that Senators have indicated they would be supportive of \nlegislation that would require greater accountability for this program \nso that, in effect, it would be possible for people to see how it \nactually works in broad daylight. That, too, is probably too logical, \nand I would only say that given the fact that this program was \nsweetened--and expensively so--behind, essentially, closed doors last \nyear, it seems to me that at a minimum we ought to have greater \nopenness for this program, additional funding for auditors, and that, \ntoo, has not been forthcoming.\n  So concrete suggestions made by Senators to better watchdog this \nprogram and to protect the billions and billions of taxpayer dollars \nthat are needed are highlighted by our challenge right here, which is: \nAs we debate an emergency spending bill, a bill that is an emergency \nbecause the Government really doesn't have the money to pay for it, we \nare still seeing billions of dollars go out the door needlessly.\n  In addition, the letter from the Senators states:\n\n       We are troubled by the suggestion that companies involved \n     in the program have made differing representations of the \n     costs to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \n     Department of Interior.\n\n  These are both Federal agencies. In order for the Congress to carry \nout its own oversight responsibilities and probe the magnitude of these \ndiscrepancies, what the Senators asked is for information with respect \nto oil and gas prices over the last few years. Once again, it looks to \nme like a very reasonable kind of request, and I want to highlight \nagain that when you have an out-of-control program, when you have \nSenators making practical suggestions like having better audits, like \nhaving better enforcement of existing laws, saying we ought to follow \nup on discrepancies in the information that is furnished to the \nGovernment, that strikes me as a no-brainer. Every Member of the Senate \nshould say: Of course, we want to watchdog the way these monies are \nbeing spent.\n  I would like to read a little bit about these disparities in the \ncosts of the program. Johnnie M. Burton, Director of the Interior \nDepartment's Minerals Management Service--I am just going to read from \na report, a news report on it--said the disparities, the differences in \nthe information that was furnished by the industry ``were mostly the \nresult of deductions that the regulations let companies take, reducing \nthe sales price they report to the government.''\n  Now let's just think about that. The companies take these deductions; \nthat reduces the sales price that is reported to the government; and \nstill the Department of Interior won't step in and say: We are going to \ntry to straighten out these discrepancies in the information about this \nprogram.\n  To read further, the Director of this program said that she, ``had \nnot known and could not explain why companies were reporting higher \nsales prices to their shareholders and to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission than to her office.''\n  Once again, that is an extraordinary statement, a statement that \ncomes from the Director of the Minerals Management Program. And she \nwraps it up,\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nwhen she is asked by the news media to respond--and I will quote here \nfrom the news reports:\n\n       I can't answer because I don't know. We don't look at SEC \n     filings. We don't have enough staff to do all of that. If we \n     were to do that, then we would have to have more staff and \n     more budget. You know, there is such a thing as budget \n     constraint, and it has been real tough, let me tell you.\n\n  So what we have is the Government not even getting the straight story \nabout the program. You have Senators saying that different \nrepresentations of costs by the companies are being given to the SEC \nand the Department of Interior, and yet the person who runs the program \nsays: I don't know, can't do it. Can't get to the bottom of how a \nmultibillion-dollar program operates.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, this is the granddaddy of all \nof the oil subsidy programs. My friend, Senator Nelson from Florida, \ncame to the floor to talk about a particular subsidy he was concerned \nabout and said that the cost of the subsidy was about $1 billion. That \nis certainly a lot of money to the people of South Carolina and the \npeople of Oregon. This program that I am saying we ought to rein in and \nget some accountability over involves, according to the General \nAccounting Office, a minimum--a minimum--of $20 billion. And, if the \nlitigation that surrounds the Royalty Relief Program is successful, we \nwould see the cost to the Government be $80 billion.\n  I have been at this for several hours. No Senator of either political \nparty has come to the floor and made a case against my amendment. I \nhave been pretty surprised about it. I was pleased to have Senator Kyl \nand Senator Lieberman sign on as cosponsors of my particular effort. \nBut I would sure like to have a dialogue in the Senate with respect to \nthe program. I think we have a good handle on how to reform it.\n  We would say: You can have royalty payments when you need them. It is \nnot rocket science. It is very straightforward. If the price of oil \ngoes down, if the President of the United States says we are going to \nhave a disruption of our oil markets, then you can stay royalty relief. \nIt is not a complicated proposition. But all I can conclude is that \nSenators--we have had a number of Senators come over and yet nobody has \nsaid anything against my amendment. That seems to say, well, just chew \nup our day letting this fellow from Oregon hold forth.\n  I have not had to do this in my time in the Senate. It is not a whole \nlot of fun when you have colleagues and friends who obviously put in a \nlot of work, a lot of time into amendments that they feel strongly \nabout. I have asked on several occasions to see if I could just get an \nopportunity to have a vote, up or down, in some kind of fashion, at \nsome point when we do the next block of amendments. But we haven't been \nable to get that agreement, so here we are, working through lunchtime \non this particular program.\n  I will also tell the Senate with respect to where we are right now \nthat the amount of the subsidy that is out there today could increase--\nthis is in an article from U.S. News and World Report--fivefold. So we \nare talking about billions of dollars that go out the door today, and \nif the litigation is successful, then we will see vast additional sums \ngoing out.\n  In the speech that the President made earlier in the week, the \nPresident, to his credit, said that he really didn't see the case for \nsubsidies with the price of oil well over $70 per barrel. I don't see \nanybody making that argument. I don't see anybody making it outside of \nthe Senate. And as I have said over the course of the morning, I don't \nsee anybody making it in the Senate today. I wish somebody would \nbecause maybe then we could begin a real discussion and we could get on \nwith what the Senator from Mississippi desires, which is to complete \nhis important legislation. But we have not been able to have that kind \nof debate, nor have we been able to get a commitment to have this \namendment come up as part of a block.\n  About the only thing we know for certain is we have a program that is \ncompletely out of control, and even the original author of the \nlegislation, our former colleague, Senator Johnston, has indicated \nthat.\n  Under the Energy bill that was signed into law last summer, the \ncompanies were given new subsidies in the form of reduced royalty fees. \nThe way that came about is we did not have any floor votes, we didn't \nhave extended debate as we are having this morning; it was done after \nmidnight in the conference committee. It was done after the claim was \nmade that this would not cost anybody anything. That is pretty \nfarfetched. The General Accounting Office says it will cost a minimum \nof $20 billion.\n  The Senate has indicated that we are concerned about the practices of \nlobbyists. I say to Senators, this is a classic case. This is one you \nwould write in the textbooks, of how a small group of lobbyists can \nfigure out a way--essentially behind closed doors and in the dead of \nnight when people are not exactly following debate about energy policy, \nafter midnight--to work their will. So I am doing something I have not \ndone in the Senate and that is to say I am going to stand here and try \nto do my very best to protect taxpayers. I think it is critical right \nnow, when we are dealing with emergency spending legislation. This \nprogram alone uses up a decent portion of the tab for this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Colleagues have talked a bit about tax breaks and the like, but we \nhave not had any real discussion before today about royalties under the \nMinerals Management Program. That is what we are talking about here. \nThe House discussed it in its legislation. I think that is why we ought \nto discuss it.\n  I don't think this is going to harm in any way the incentives to \nproduce oil in this country. We certainly need to do that. We are as \ndependent on foreign oil as we were 20 years ago. I personally think \ngetting a new energy policy is about the most patriotic thing we can do \nin our country. Getting a new energy policy is about as red, white, and \nblue as it gets. But you sure don't get a new energy policy if you are \ngoing to keep sweetening, with billions of dollars, a program that \ndoesn't work, a program that has lacked oversight, lacked \naccountability.\n  By the way, I have mentioned it has been bipartisan. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. I have highlighted \nthe fact that the previous administration, the Clinton administration, \nsomewhere, someplace in the bureaucracy, was not watchdogging this \nprogram, was not watching the threshold that was needed to ensure that \nthis money would be used wisely.\n  By the way, they were talking about $34 a barrel at that time. Now \nthe price of oil is over $70 a barrel. The President of the United \nStates says we don't need subsidies when it is over $50 a barrel.\n  My hope is we can get this Minerals Management Program under control. \nIt needs to be under control. The bill that came over from the House \naddresses the royalties issue as well. I think it is time for the \nSenate to step up. This is a subsidy that is not needed at this time. I \nwish some Member of the Senate would come to the floor and say, Let me \ntell you why the subsidy is needed. We have three Senators on the floor \nand certainly a lot of others have been coming through at various \ntimes, but Senator Johnston, who made the case years ago that this \nprogram was needed in the 1990s--I think Senator Stevens probably knows \nthe most about the history of the program of any of us--I think Senator \nJohnston's argument in the 1990s was the gulf coast was hurting. The \ngulf coast had gotten clobbered. Senator Johnston and others were \nconcerned about how things were going to go in the future. The price of \nenergy had dropped very dramatically. The concern of Senator Johnston \nwas that you were going to see very little investment unless you had \nchanges in the Government's policy.\n  I know people at that time--I have seen the press reports--were \ncomparing the Gulf of Mexico to the Dead Sea. We are not faced with \nanything like that. In fact, the program worked well in those middle \n1990s.\n  Now we have a very different situation. Now we have a very different \nclimate. In fact, those are virtually the words that were used by one \nof the lawyers from the Shell Oil Company. The lawyer from the Shell \nOil Company said we don't need royalty relief in this kind of \nenvironment, in this kind of climate.\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\n  I hope we will get the Senate to dig into the merits of this. I have \nread the comments from news reports, from Senator Johnston. Senator \nJohnston told the press recently:\n\n       The one thing I can tell you is this is not what we had \n     intended.\n\n  Given all of the fuzzy and confusing language that was in this \nprogram, what we have seen is the companies, those that have tried to \nmilk this program in every way possible, have been able to do it. I was \nparticularly troubled by some of the changes the Secretary of Interior, \nSecretary Norton, made administratively. But I think the Senate, in \ngoing forward with this discussion, ought to reflect on some of the \ncomments that have been made by people who I think have been about as \nsupportive of the oil industry as they possibly could be. In the other \nbody, the chair of the natural resources committee, Congressman Pombo, \nsays:\n\n       There is no need for an incentive. They've got a market \n     incentive to produce at $70 a barrel.\n\n  Think about that comment of Congressman Pombo. Congressman Pombo is \nsaying there is no need for incentives right now.\n  I wanted to be sensitive in my amendment to the fact that things can \nchange. We always have to deal with that in any legislative proposal. \nWhat I said is, look, the President of the United States says we could \nhave a supply disruption. If the President of the United States says, \nfor example, that with prices going down we need to reinstitute the \nprogram, so be it. But that apparently is not acceptable to some here \nin the Senate so we cannot get an opportunity at some point to get a \nvote.\n  But this is high-stakes stuff, folks. This is not small sums of \nmoney. Senator Nelson raised a question that was important to him about \na particular subsidy program he was concerned about. It involved $1 \nbillion. But as a number have noted, if the legal battles that are \ntaking place right now about the Royalty Relief Program are successful, \nwe are talking about upwards of $30 billion in additional royalty \nrelief over the next few years. How much more do we need to prod those \nwho care about this to look at reforming this particular program? \nCertainly they don't need more incentives to go out and drill. Nobody \nneeds to prod the oil industry in that regard. We have seen a great \ndeal of effort on the part of the Senate to make it attractive to be in \nthe energy business. But what I am seeking to do, with the support of \nSenators Kyl and Lieberman and I know other Senators, is to get this \nprogram under control, is to have some accountability. It seems to me \nwhat we are faced with is essentially a trifecta of subsidies.\n  First, you have the companies getting tax breaks. The Joint Tax \nCommittee has estimated that the costs of those would be in the \nvicinity of $10 billion. I am beginning to think we are making some \nheadway on that particular point because we are hearing Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle say they want to review those tax breaks. When \nwe had the executives come before the Energy Committee, I went right \ndown the row and asked each one of them if they needed the tax breaks \nin the new Energy bill. When it got to broad daylight, they said they \ndidn't need those particular tax breaks. So I think we are making some \nheadway.\n  I then went to the Senate Finance Committee and was able to get a \nmodest reduction in the tax breaks the companies would get. That is now \nin the reconciliation bill. I think it is the only actual cut in tax \nbreaks the companies have gotten in quite some time. I am hopeful that \nwill make its way into the reconciliation legislation. Senator Grassley \nand Senator Baucus have been extremely helpful in that regard.\n  But the first part of the trifecta is essentially the tax breaks. I \nam hoping we can get Senators of both political parties at a minimum to \nreview them, review them comprehensively--something that hasn't gone \non. Yesterday, to their credit, Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus \nindicated they would begin that particular review.\n  The second part of the trifecta is we have mandatory spending \nprograms. That was one that Senator Nelson spoke about earlier, one \nthat involves $1 billion.\n  Then we come to the Royalty Relief Program, which is the big daddy, \nthe granddaddy of all the subsidy programs. That is the one I have said \nI am not going to let the Senate duck any longer.\n  It appears both the Chair and the ranking minority member have left \nthe floor. I think that is unfortunate because I want to try to work \nout an effort to move ahead on this. But I will continue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, under our unanimous consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am the senior member of the Appropriations Committee \nand former chairman, and I will be happy to work with you to arrange \nconsideration of ANWR at any time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the distinguished Senator. I know the Senator, \nhaving chaired the Appropriations Committee, is anxious to try to work \nthis out. My door is open to try to do that. If the Senator can do what \napparently we couldn't get worked out with Senators McCain, Salazar, \nNelson, and others, no one will be happier than I.\n  I want to note exactly what the amendment does. It blocks the Federal \nGovernment from sweetening the already sweetheart royalty deals that \nare being dispensed under this legislation. This is needed because even \nas the prices have shot up, the previous Secretary of Interior was \ngiving more royalty relief to the companies. It has been reported in \nthe press that the Secretary of Interior made the incentives more \ngenerous by raising the threshold prices. Her action allowed drillers \nto escape royalties in 2005, when prices spiked to record levels. She \nalso offered to sweeten the contracts that were not generous enough, in \nher opinion.\n  Think about that one. She went back and offered to sweeten the \ncontracts that she felt were not generous enough, contracts the \ndrillers signed before the new regulations were approved. What this \namendment does is it prohibits the kind of sweetening of the deals for \nthose who are drilling when prices are high.\n  When prices are high and we have no threat of disruption, then I am \nsaying the Government has to step in and watchdog this program and do a \nbetter job for the taxpayers.\n  These are royalty deals which are already laden with sugar. They do \nnot need any further sweetening. What is needed in the Senate is for \nthe Senate to say now we are going to do what has not been done; we are \ngoing to step in and protect the taxpayers and the American people.\n  Under this amendment I am trying to get up in front of the Senate, \nthe next Secretary of Interior would not be able to do what was done \nlast year and give away more royalty relief when oil prices are above \n$55 per barrel. That is what we are all about today.\n  I hope we will have discussion of other aspects of the oil business. \nI know that colleagues have amendments of a variety of types they wish \nto offer.\n  But these are the sweetest deals in town. They are laden with sugar. \nThey do not need any further sweetening. And at some point you have to \nask, Is the Senate ever going to draw the line and have some real \naccountability in this program?\n  I have now been speaking about this for probably close to 3 hours. No \nMember of the Senate has spoken in favor of running the Royalty Relief \nProgram the way it is. I want to repeat that. After 3 hours of debate \nand a chance for anybody here in the Senate to come and say, Look, I \nthink it is important, I think we ought to keep the program the way it \nis, nobody in the Senate has come before this distinguished body and \nmade the case for this program on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think that says it all. Nothing could better illuminate the history \nof this out-of-control program than the fact that nobody has opposed it \nhere or has opposed my amendment on the floor of the Senate.\n  The way decisions are made with respect to this program is like what \nhappened with the conference committee in 2005 on the Energy bill. \nAfter midnight, when nobody would have a chance to see what was going \non, an argument was made that this doesn't cost any money. A couple of \nSenators were present. They said, You have to be kidding. There has \nbeen one Government report and audit after another of\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\nthis program. Nobody can say with a straight face that this program \ncosts nothing. Yet that was the argument made after midnight in the \nenergy conference. So this legislation kept getting sweeter and sweeter \nand sweeter.\n  Billions of dollars are at stake. We already have record prices. We \nalready have record profits. The question becomes, Are we going to have \nrecord royalty payments?\n  I think it is important now for the Senate to draw the line. I want \nto make sure the Senate is aware of how my amendment would work. Right \nnow the oil companies are supposed to pay royalties to the Federal \nGovernment when they extract oil from Federal lands. To stimulate \nproduction when the price of oil was cheap, the Federal Government \nreduced the amount of royalty payments the companies had to make. Now \nthat the price of oil has shot up to over $70 a barrel, the discounted \nroyalty payments amount to a needless subsidy of billions and billions \nof dollars.\n  So the practical effect of all of this is the Senate works on a \nsupplemental spending program. It is called an emergency because the \nGovernment doesn't have the money. That is why we are in this situation \ntoday. We have an emergency. The Government doesn't have the money, but \nyet the Senate is still willing to look the other way when billions and \nbillions of dollars go out the door at a time when the President of the \nUnited States has said you don't need subsidies when the price of oil \nis over $50 a barrel.\n  Experts in and out of the Government share my view that this subsidy \ndefies common sense. I have described the views of the chairman of the \nnatural resources committee, Congressman Pombo, who talked about what \nthe folks at Shell Oil have said. Former Senator Johnston wrote this \nparticular program. There isn't anybody defending this program in its \ncurrent form. That is the amazing part of this debate. Nobody has stood \nup and said, I want the Royalty Relief Program to operate just the way \nit is. I thought for sure we would have some discussion about this \ntopic. I thought somebody would actually stand up and oppose what I am \ntalking about. Somebody might say, Look, just because you say it is the \ngranddaddy of all subsidies doesn't mean it doesn't do any good. But \nnobody has done that. In the course of speaking at some length about \nthis particular program, nobody here in the Senate has said they want \nto come to the floor and defend it. I think that tells a whole lot \nabout the situation we are in.\n  By the way, I think it says a lot about whether the Senate is willing \nto hold these companies accountable and is going to watchdog the \nprogram which costs billions and billions of dollars.\n  We have all had our phones flooded with folks concerned about the \nprice of oil. I heard a discussion from the distinguished Senator from \nArizona who said that earmarks were the top question he had heard about \nfrom citizens. Like the Senator from South Carolina, I have an enormous \namount of respect for the Senator from Arizona. But I think while \nearmarks are certainly important--and I don't want to get into some \nkind of competition about what is the most important--I can tell you \neverything I am seeing right now is that gasoline prices is the issue \nthe American people want to address.\n  I want a new energy policy. I am anxious to work with colleagues to \ndo so. As I have spoken here on the floor of the Senate, I would say \narguably the best idea we have seen in energy as it relates to \nproduction comes from our friend from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, who has \npointed out that we are probably not getting a big chunk of the oil \nproduction out of existing wells. It is an amazing thing; experts in \nthe field say we may be losing as much as a third of what is out there \nin existing wells. If you go and get that oil, first, you begin to add \nto the production that all Senators want to encourage but also you do \nsomething that is sensible for the environment because you don't run \nthe risk of additional environmental problems.\n  As we have looked at on the Commerce Committee under the \ndistinguished chair, Senator Stevens, there is a lot of new technology \nin the oil business. So it is possible to capture some of the gases \nthat are emitted and better protect the environment. There are good \nideas for getting a fresh energy policy and certainly increasing \nproduction.\n  As I have said publicly and privately, I think Senator Thomas is one \nof the best. But there are also some programs that make no sense. This \none doesn't. This one is the biggest of them all. If the Senate is \nserious about reining in these practices that drain our Treasury, which \nis a factor in our having to come to the floor and ask for emergency \nspending programs, then I think we have to tackle this kind of program.\n\n  Government subsidies--sure, you can make a case for them when the \nprice is low, when you have to stimulate production, and when our \neconomy needs a shot in the arm. But billions of dollars of royalty \nrelief for the companies with these kinds of prices? I don't get it. I \ndon't think it is even a close call. Perhaps that is why we have not \nseen anybody come to the floor and argue on behalf of doing business \nthis way.\n  My amendment would ensure that you have royalty relief when it is \nneeded. When you need royalty relief, under this particular amendment--\nwhen there is a supply disruption or when prices fall--you would be \nable to have that relief. But it ought to be targeted. It ought to be \ntargeted as it was in the middle 1990s. That was a period when the \nprice of energy was way down. Parts of our country that could produce \noil were hurting. There was a judgment made before my good friend from \nSouth Carolina and I were in the Congress, there was a judgment made in \nthe middle of the 1990s to say, all right, let us give these companies \na break. If they go out and take some risk, if they will go out and \ndrill and take those chances as you do as part of the free enterprise \nsystem because the Government wanted to encourage production at an \nimportant time, there was bipartisan consensus that it be done.\n  The author of the program, Senator Johnston, our former colleague \nfrom Louisiana, put together an impressive coalition to get it passed. \nAs I have quoted Senator Johnston here on this floor recently, what we \nhave isn't anything close to what was intended. He was kind of baffled \nabout the whole thing. He said the whole thing is confusing.\n  It is time for the Senate to say that on the biggest subsidy program, \nthe one that costs the most, which is going to be greater, as far as I \ncan tell, than all of the subsidies combined, and if the litigation \ninvolving this program costs approximately what the whole supplemental \ncosts, this is the program we have to deal with.\n  I don't think it passes the smell test to keep dispensing billions \nand billions of dollars of royalty relief at this time from the \ntaxpayers' wallet. This is a program that was useful a decade ago. But \nnobody could say that we need these kinds of incentives at this time.\n  Back when they were talking about this program in the middle 1990s, \nthe price of oil was in the vicinity of $34 or $35 a barrel. That was \nthe threshold they were talking about at that time. Now the price of \noil is twice the threshold that was used back in those days, in the \n1990s.\n  This is a program that it seems to me the Senate has to step in and \nstart watchdogging. One of the reasons I have come to the floor of the \nSenate today is because the Department of the Interior won't even \nanswer questions from Senators. After there were news reports earlier \nthis year, a number of Senators asked very practical questions. They \nwanted to know about additional audits; they wanted to make sure there \nwas an effort to enforce the law; they pointed out discrepancies in \nreports on this program; that the Securities and Exchange Commission \nwas given one set of facts and statistics and the Department of \nInterior was given another set of facts and statistics. Think about \nthat. We now have companies not even using the same information the \nGovernment has so the Government can watchdog the program. Then they go \nover to the person who heads the Minerals Management Office, which runs \nthis particular program, and what that person says is, Gosh, we don't \nknow. We don't have the auditors. We can't keep track of this. We are \nnot people with expertise. I guess I could see that point if it were \ninvolving a small program; in other words, you would be talking about \nsomething with\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\na modest sum of money, and they said they did not have enough auditors. \nSenators could work on a bipartisan basis and beef up the program. But \nit was not an emergency because you were talking about a much smaller \namount of money. We know the phrase a billion here, a billion there \nstarts to add up to real money. Everett Dirksen talked about millions; \nnow we are talking about billions.\n\n  The point is, this is not a small program. This is one of the biggest \nprograms, $20 billion minimum. The General Accounting Office says $20 \nbillion minimum is involved. If the litigation surrounding this program \nis successful, it could approach the amount that would pay for the \nentire emergency supplemental program. That is pretty amazing.\n  One program subsidizing the companies with royalty relief--and no \nSenator has come to the Senate over the last few hours to defend the \noperation of the program in its current form--one program can pick up \nthe tab for most of the emergency supplemental. Yet we cannot get a \nvote up or down as part of any kind of practice that resembles what the \nSenator from South Carolina and this Senator have customarily seen in \nthe Senate.\n  We have a discussion over a batch of amendments. Usually a big batch \nof amendments takes a reasonable period of time. I have done this. The \nSenator from South Carolina has done it scores and scores of times. \nThen the amendment you offer is put into a package of other amendments, \nand there is a vote at a time when Senators of both political parties \nhave been notified and all Members are aware of what is coming up in \nthe Senate. We cannot do that. Somehow, we cannot do that.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, \nhas returned. I have propounded a variety of different questions to see \nif we could at some point do what is the customary practice in the \nSenate, which is at some point have a vote, at some point that is \nconvenient for all who want to offer their amendments. As far as I can \ntell, we are not having any discussions about how to do that. I have \nnot heard any discussions about others who want to amend this in some \nway. We have, essentially, a one-sided discussion. This side would very \nmuch like to see if we can move forward and get about the business of \nthe Senate.\n  I have outlined the key questions about a program which is a classic \nexample of what happens when you do not have the Government \nwatchdogging the taxpayers' wallet. The money does not fly out of the \nsky and land in Washington and all of a sudden get used for one program \nor another. This is taxpayers' hard-earned money.\n  We have a situation in South Carolina, Oregon, and elsewhere where \npeople are getting clobbered at the pump. They are all up in arms about \nthe cost of gasoline. We have these record prices at the pump. We have \nrecord profits people constantly read about, and the CEOs get pensions. \nSome of the pensions the CEOs are getting come to sums that are greater \nthan whole communities, as far as I can tell, in terms of their pension \nrelief. So citizens hear about this sort of thing and want to know what \nthe Congress is doing to straighten out the priorities.\n  What this is about, folks, is straightening out the priorities. I \ndon't think the priorities ought to be to have a minimum of $20 billion \nused for a royalty relief program when the price of oil is over $70 a \nbarrel. The priorities ought to be for the kinds of things the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi and his counterpart on the \nDemocratic side have been working to get done. We do have emergencies. \nWe have emergencies we have to address. I want to see it done. I will \ntell the Senate when we are subsidizing an amount that could possibly \ncome to the full cost of this supplemental, this cries out for the \nSenate to step in.\n  I am going to do everything I can do and will continue to try to \nengage colleagues on both sides of the aisle so we can do what is \nnecessary to protect the public; that is, essentially reining in a \nprogram that has been driven by a small number of lobbyists. A small \nnumber of lobbyists for a small number of companies has figured out how \nto make off with the bank. That is essentially what has happened. We \nhave a program that very few know much about.\n  When it hit the newspapers a few months ago, Senators and others were \nup in arms. It is fair to say very few knew a great deal about how the \nprogram operated. Those headlines--``General Accounting Office Says \nMinimum of $20 Billion Will Be Lost''--should have served as a wake-up \ncall.\n  After we saw those news reports, Senators began writing letters, some \nof them bipartisan, saying to the Department of Interior: Give us the \nfacts about the program. They said: We have read all these reports \nindicating what a waste of money, what a colossal waste of money this \nis. Give us the facts.\n  The Department of Interior has stonewalled Senators who are trying to \nget the facts about how the program works. The Senators pointed out the \ndiscrepancies in the information furnished. Senators pointed out there \ndid not seem to be people watching this program and watchdogging \nit, but still no response from the Department of Interior.\n\n  So we get to the point, it seems to me, that somebody ought to come \nto the Senate and describe how an industry that is finding profit \neverywhere it looks ought to be given more relief from the Federal \ntaxpayer. That is what it comes down to. This industry is doing \nexceptionally well. Everyone understands the importance of energy \nproduction. We understand the importance of seeing it produced in the \nUnited States. But the good ideas for getting production going in this \ncountry are not ones that drain the Treasury of billions and billions \nof dollars. The good ideas are the kinds of ideas offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, who talks about getting \nmore production out of existing wells. That is the kind of thing we \nought to be doing to get a new energy policy, a red, white, and blue \nenergy policy that is patriotic.\n  Frankly, our energy policy does a great disservice to those who honor \nus by wearing the uniform overseas. I know the Senator from South \nCarolina has been a great advocate for those people. When I meet with \nfolks in the military, I say: You have honored us with your \nextraordinary service by wearing the uniform and putting your health \nand the well-being of your family on the line. I want to get a new \nenergy policy so it is less likely that your kid and your grandkid will \nbe off in the Middle East fighting another war where people are saying \nit is about oil.\n  We owe it to those courageous people who honor our Nation by wearing \nthe uniform to get them a fresh energy policy from ideas such as those \noffered by Senator Thomas. This program is not one of them.\n  I see one of my cosponsors of this legislation in the Chamber. I am \necstatic he has arrived in the Chamber, and I yield to him under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. KYL. May I ask my colleague a couple of questions with the \nunderstanding he retains the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I compliment the Senator from Oregon for bringing this \nmatter to the attention of the Senate. It is my pleasure to cosponsor \nthe amendment with the Senator. I also compliment the chairman of the \nCommittee on Appropriations for his patience, his great patience, and \nhis willingness to work with everyone and try to get this bill to a \nconclusion.\n  Let me first ask a couple of questions to make sure everyone knows \nexactly what we are talking about. It is my understanding that back in \n1995, the Congress passed something called the Deepwater Royalty Relief \nAct designed to encourage the development of new sources of energy and \nthat there were some mandatory provisions in that act that required the \nwaiver of the payment of royalties from Federal land, from oil \nextracted from Federal land. The concept was we wanted to encourage the \nproduction of more oil and gas on these Federal lands and the best way \nto do that would be to enable the oil companies to keep the revenues \nand not pay the Government any royalties. Is that your understanding of \nthe original concept of this legislation?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator has summed it up very well. And at least \nreduce royalties.\n  Mr. KYL. And then what happened was in the Energy bill we adopted, we \nthought, well, if it was a good enough\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\nidea then, even though these mandatory provisions of the act expired in \n2001, it would be a good idea to continue them, but the administration \nat that time, observing the fact that oil prices were going up now, \ncame to the conclusion that the extension of this royalty relief was \nnot necessary and, in fact, issued its statement of policy on the \nEnergy bill on June 14, 2005, saying the President believes that \nadditional taxpayer subsidies for oil and gas exploration are \nunwarranted in today's price environment and urges the Senate to \neliminate the Federal oil and gas subsidy and other exploration \nincentives contained in the bill.\n  So when the President made his statement about whether we should \nextend this mandatory royalty relief, he was saying at that time--this \nwas in June of 2005, not quite a year ago; the prices were up but not \nnearly where they are now--but even at that level he was saying this \nprovision is not necessary to encourage more exploration. Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. It is Congress that kept \nladling out this money and the President, to his credit, has been \nmaking the point that these subsidies are not needed.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I ask further, the number that I have of the estimate \nof how much this is going to cost the American taxpayer over the next 5 \nyears is $7 billion. Does that number comport with what the Senator \nfrom Oregon has?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The General Accounting Office has said this program will \ncost, at a minimum, $20 billion. I am looking at the headline of the \nnewspaper that ``GAO Sees Loss in Oil Royalties of At Least $20 \nBillion,'' but one of the calculations has been $7 billion.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, $7 billion may be a very low estimate. Is $20 \nbillion over a 5-year period?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is over 25 years. And the cost, if the litigation \nthat is underway is successful, the evidence indicates that could add \nup to $80 billion. The entire supplemental is $100 billion, so \ndepending on how this litigation turns out before too long, the amount \nof money involved could be close to the cost of the entire \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I noted that the Senator said something \nearlier in his remarks that I thought was very important in the context \nof our consideration of this supplemental appropriation. We all agree \nwe have to appropriate the funds not only for relief from the hurricane \nto States such as that of the Presiding Officer, but also to ensure \nthat everything our troops need to conduct their activities in the war \nagainst terror is provided to them and that the bulk of the money in \nthe supplemental appropriations bill is going for that purpose, but \nthat this is emergency spending we have not offset in any other way.\n  What the Senator from Oregon has pointed out is that actually, in \ngreat measure, a great deal of this could be offset if we simply \neliminate some of the costly taxpayer subsidies such as that which is \nthe subject of this amendment, so that we are in total agreement that \nwe have to provide this funding for our military, and that one way we \ncan help to pay for it is for the taxpayers to not have to continue \nthis subsidy, which by all accounts is totally unnecessary to produce \nadditional oil and gas, at least at this time.\n  Let me ask the Senator further, I don't know what the crude oil price \nwas in June of last year when the President made his statement that \nthis royalty was simply not necessary, but it probably was somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of half of what it is today. Maybe the Senator has an \nidea on that. But the estimates today, I think--when I last looked at \nthe market--were about $72 a barrel. Therefore, if it is true the \nmeasure was not necessary a year ago, as lawyers say: a fortiori, it is \nnot needed today.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon have any thoughts on that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, I think the Senator has summed it up. The price of \noil has doubled in the last 5 years. The Senator from Arizona asks \nabout last year. I think, again, speaking off the top of my head, it \nwas somewhere in the middle sixties somewhere, the price of oil per \nbarrel. But I think the bottom line is, the Senator from Arizona is \ncorrect, it is now well over $70 a barrel. And that is vastly higher \nthan the amount the President says would warrant an incentive.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me ask another question of the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Your amendment does not just wipe out this provision that waives \nroyalties but, rather, allows for a situation, as I understand it, when \nthe price drops to a point where maybe some incentive is necessary to \nprovide for this production. It actually does not eliminate the \npossibility of that incentive. Is that correct? Could the Senator \nexplain that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am very grateful for the Senator from Arizona getting \ninto this discussion because what I have tried to do is ensure we will \nhave royalty relief when it is needed. Essentially one of two \nconditions would be met, and then you could have the royalty relief \nresume. One is, as the Senator from Arizona has said, the price of oil \nfalls and you do need incentive.\n  The other, which, in effect, gives the President of the United States \nthe last word, is a stipulation that allows the President, through the \nSecretary of the Interior, to say--if we need to prevent a disruption \nof supply; if the President determines we would have a disruption of \nsupply at this crucial time when our country is at war--then the \nPresident of the United States can say: We will resume the Royalty \nRelief Program because we need this incentive for production; it is my \njudgment that without this Royalty Relief Program we would have a \ndisruption in supply.\n  Mr. KYL. So, Mr. President, if I could kind of summarize this point, \nit seems to me this amendment represents kind of a win-win situation in \nthat we have the opportunity now to save the American taxpayers a lot \nof money--money that is not necessary to stimulate the production of \noil and gas at this time because the price of oil is so high. But it is \nalso a win in the sense that the Senator from Oregon has drafted the \nlegislation in such a way that should we need that ability to stimulate \nproduction in the future--for example, should we be in a wartime \nsituation and the President determines we have to do everything we can \nto produce more domestic oil--that the authority exists and would \ncontinue to exist. The Senator from Oregon is not eliminating that \nauthority but noting that is one of the protections in his amendment.\n  So it seems to me that either way we have protected the American \ntaxpayer, the American consumer, and, of course, the American citizen \nin a time of war. So it is a little hard to argue there could be a bad \nresult from this since at the time you might need this kind of \nstimulus, it would be there or at least potentially would be there.\n  Let me make another point and ask a question. I happened to have been \nwatching television the other night late, and I believe it was the \nDiscovery Channel, watching the drilling off of our coast down to the \ndepths of--I have forgotten how many miles. It was incredible. The \npeople on the rigs were saying they never dreamed years ago they could \ndo that, that they would be able to do that. Certainly the Presiding \nOfficer, being from the State of Louisiana, knows a lot more about this \nthan I do. I was impressed with the ability of these people to explore, \nto find the oil, and then to be able to drill at such great lengths, \nand to be able to pull that oil out of the ground in a way that, while \nvery expensive, was still profitable and could, therefore, contribute \nto the domestic oil production in the United States.\n  At a time when it does not appear it is at all necessary to provide \nthis kind of royalty relief, it seems to me we ought to be taking our \nhat off to those who produce this kind of critical product in our \nsociety during a time of war.\n  My understanding, at least from some folks I talked to, was that at \nleast the companies that were asked about this at the time said they \ndid not even need this royalty relief, that they could do this work, \nthat the price of oil was such that they could pull it out of the \nground.\n  So like the Senator from Oregon, I am a bit mystified about who the \nfolks were who came in, whether it was in the dead of night or \nwhenever, and extended this in the Energy bill. I would note this is \none of the reasons I voted against the Energy bill, by the way. I saw \nthe President's Statement of Policy saying we don't need this \nprovision. It was a mystery to me why it remained. It was clear it was \ngoing to cost a lot of money.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n  The Senator from Oregon has now quantified how much that is. Again, \nthe estimate I have, over 5 years, is at least a $7 billion cost to the \ntaxpayers. At a time when we are looking for revenues to offset the \ncost of the war, it seems to me to be a perfect opportunity to achieve \ntwo good policy objectives: save some money for the American taxpayer, \navoid the bad policy of subsidizing something that does not need to be \nsubsidized, but retain the ability to continue stimulating our domestic \nproduction if and when we need to have such a policy to do so.\n  So I commend the Senator from Oregon for his work. I am very pleased \nto cosponsor it. I hope through the processes of the Senate at some \npoint we can get this matter to a vote.\n  Again, the distinguished chairman of the committee has left the floor \nmomentarily, but I want to commend him for his patience in trying to \nwork out all of these things. I suspect somehow or other we are going \nto be able to sit down and work out a vote on this since it is pretty \nhard for me to see where any opposition to this amendment could come \nfrom based upon the fine arguments the Senator from Oregon has made.\n  So, again, I commend the Senator from Oregon. I am very pleased to \ncosponsor this and will work in every way I can to bring it to a vote \nso we can effect the policy.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves, I hope the Senator can \nstay a bit longer as well because I so appreciate his insight and input \non this issue.\n  The Senator from Arizona has been making these points ever since--in \nthe Finance Committee and in the Energy Committee we were talking about \nthis legislation. And you and I and others said: Let's think through \nnow how to use scarce taxpayer resources wisely. Let's take out a sharp \npencil and say there are going to be some areas that you set aside, and \nthere are going to be some areas you promote.\n  I have been talking about Senator Thomas's efforts at some length \nhere today because I think Senator Thomas gets it in terms of what we \nought to be looking at as far as our long-term needs in terms of \nproduction.\n  The Senator from Arizona said we should be taking our hat off to \npeople who produce energy. I certainly second that. And I am glad the \nSenator has done that. I want to say I think what we are trying to do \nin our amendment--and you and I and Senator Lieberman in particular--is \nwe are saying not only do we want to be supportive verbally of what \npeople are doing to produce energy in our country, but we want to say, \nas we have outlined in the royalty relief amendment we are talking \nabout here, is they can get royalty relief when it is needed. In other \nwords, this is not a bunch of verbiage where people come over to the \nfloor of the Senate and say: Oh, maybe you will be able to do this; \nmaybe you will be able to do that.\n  I think what we have spelled out, as a result of your thoughtful \nquestioning, is that when relief is needed--either the prices are down \nor we have a threat of disruption--not only are we going to say we are \nfor the producers, we are going to back it up, and they will be in a \nposition of being able to secure that royalty relief support.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for additional \nquestioning.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has made a very important \npoint I want to second; that is, at the time this was being debated, I \nrecall the Senator for Oregon, in his comments, making the same points \nI made, which were that it is important for us to be supportive of \nAmerican industry being able to do the things we want it to do, but \nthat since we are talking about taxpayer dollars, we need to be very \ncareful that if there is some kind of support for industry, that it is \nvery well thought out, that it is not open ended, hopefully, it is not \nmandatory, that we retain enough flexibility, let's say, so when the \nconditions no longer warrant the support of a particular industry we \nwill no longer do that.\n  Now, all of us in this body can have different ideas about when that \nis appropriate. I happen not to be a big fan of subsidies. Some others \nmay like them a little bit more. But at least the Senator from Oregon \nand I have been consistent for a long time wanting to know the facts \nabout whether support for a particular good cause was necessary with \nrespect to the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. If it was necessary for \nthe national good during a time of war, for example, then I think the \nconsensus is there to always do it. But what we said is: Is it \nnecessary at this time? We were talking about a situation where oil was \nat least $10 a barrel cheaper than it is today. Even the President was \nsaying at that time: This particular subsidy is not necessary.\n  So it seems to me that colleagues who may have supported the bill at \nthe time would have no reason not to support our amendment here because \nthis is a very specific and differentiated item. It is not the entire \nEnergy bill; it is one very specific little provision. It is a \nprovision that will save us a lot of money if we can get it amended the \nway we are talking about doing. And its relevance to this supplemental \nappropriations bill--whatever the germaneness provision is--its \nrelevance is very clear.\n  It would be nice if we could offset some of the spending we are going \nto have to engage in here to support our troops with real savings. This \nis an area where we can achieve real savings because the royalty is \nsimply not needed at this time for the purpose that it was originally \nput in the legislation.\n  So this would be consistent with the policy we have talked about for \na long time. And I think it makes very good policy sense for the \ncountry to begin to put it into place in the future. When you need \nsomething like this, fine. But when you do not need it, then don't \nsaddle the taxpayers of the country with an expenditure that simply \ntakes money out of their pocket and is not needed by the producers, who \nare going to be producing the oil, in this case, in any event.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  I would also say with respect to this issue of relevance, not only \nwould we be able to save a significant chunk of the tab for this \noverall emergency supplemental, but the House, the other body, at page \n64 of their bill, talks specifically about the Minerals Management \nService. So we are already seeing some concern, at least on the part of \nthe other body, that the Congress ought to be looking at this program.\n  So it is my hope--and you were talking about making sure there is an \neffort to watchdog this program. Now is when you watchdog it because \nthe spigot is on, and it is gushing taxpayer money. It is gushing \ntaxpayer money at a time when the Government does not have it. And the \nGovernment's lack of funds has forced the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi to come and work on an emergency spending measure because \nthe Government does not have any money.\n  So I think that highlights why this is so important. And, once again, \nwell into 3 hours of discussion on this, I want to review for \ncolleagues that we have not been able to work out an arrangement to get \na chance to vote on this as part of a batch of amendments. No Senator \nhas come to the floor to speak against this amendment. No Senator, \nneither political party, has said this amendment is off base.\n  What we just heard from the distinguished Senator from Arizona, who \nsits on both the Finance Committee and the Energy Committee, is that we \nneed this. We need this to make sure we watchdog the use of taxpayer \ndollars. This program worked in the 1990s.\n  It boosted oil production substantially. We were all glad to see it. \nBut the fact is, the President says we can get the production now \nwithout these kinds of subsidies when the price of oil is over $70 a \nbarrel. I am hopeful we can continue to work--I see the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Cochran, here to get it worked out--so that we \ncould do what is customary in the Senate, and that is make this \namendment part of a batch of amendments.\n  I do want the Senate to know a little bit about the payment terms of \nthis program and how this program works in terms of royalties and \nrentals. I will read a little bit from a Congressional Research Service \nreport that describes it. The leases are conditioned upon payment to \nthe Government of a royalty of at least 12.5 percent in amount\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nor value of oil or gas production that is removed or sold from the \nleased land. Leases subject to rates in effect after December 22, 1987, \ngenerally pay a 12.5-percent royalty, but this percentage can increase \nif a lease is canceled because of late payments and then reinstated. \nThe Secretary of Interior also has the power to reduce the oil royalty \non a noncompetitive lease if it is deemed to be equitable to do so.\n  Once again, we are talking about very favorable terms for the \ncompanies. We are talking about noncompetitive leases. We are talking \nabout something I don't think anybody sees in the private sector in \nMississippi or Louisiana or Oregon, but yet that is the way we do \nbusiness in this particular program.\n  The Congressional Research Service goes on to say: For oil and gas \nleases, the royalty must be paid in value unless the Department of the \nInterior specifies that a royalty payment in kind is required. Once the \nroyalty has been paid, the Secretary is required to sell any royalty or \ngas except whenever, in their judgment, it is desirable to retain the \nsame for the use of the United States.\n  That is the heart and soul of how this program works. The Secretary \nis given this extraordinary waiver authority to suspend or reduce \nrentals and royalties under certain conditions. Unfortunately, we have \nseen some problems in terms of the Secretary using that discretion. \nThat is one of the reasons I have come to the floor and raised this \nconcern.\n  Senators know who is getting the profits. I have tried to talk about \nthe trifecta: The profits that are being made, the mandatory spending \nthat goes out the door in terms of this program. Then we have the \ngranddaddy of them all, the question of royalty relief. What it really \ncomes down to is the Senate's saying, after years of decisions being \nmade about this program behind closed doors, we are actually going to \nhave a debate about this and at some point work out a way to take a \nvote on it. I don't think that is an unreasonable position.\n  This is a program that is out of control. This is a program that \nensures that billions of subsidy dollars will fly out the door, even \nwhen the President says it is not necessary. The price of oil is $70 a \nbarrel plus right now. The President said hold the line on the \nsubsidies when it is over $50 a barrel. The Royalty Relief Program \nholds no lines.\n  Essentially, the Royalty Relief Program is a wish list for a handful \nof very powerful interests who have figured out how, behind closed \ndoors, to have their way with the program. This is the sweetest of the \nsweetheart deals. It needs to change. I would like to see a Senator \ncome to the floor and defend the Royalty Relief Program as it is \npresently constituted. This involves billions and billions of dollars.\n  For example, think about what we could do for the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. That is a program about which many Senators \nhave been concerned. Think about what we could do for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program if we reconfigured the Royalty Relief \nProgram to one essentially based on need, with prices going down, or \nsupply disruption being the only factors in making a decision about \nwhether to have the royalty relief.\n  We could have plenty of money left over for deficit reduction, even \nafter helping the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has a bill that has a number of \nprovisions in it I strongly support. But budgets are about choices. As \na Senator, I cannot explain to the people of my State how a program \nlike this is going to be run like business as usual. When billions of \ndollars are shoveled out the door, when independent audits continually \nsite the lack of controls, when the companies that look to this program \ngive one set of facts to one agency and another set of facts to another \nagency, that is unacceptable. That is what I want to change. I guess we \nwill be here on the floor of the Senate a while in order to try and get \nit worked out.\n  I am reading again from news reports. The General Accounting Office \nhas said that the best case for the amount of money that would be lost \nto the American taxpayer is $20 billion. The press has already reported \nthat this would involve an instance where energy prices are over what \nis called the so-called threshold in the years ahead. The companies \nthat have sought this have won a huge victory at taxpayers expense. \nThey have won legal victories in the past. All the more reason for \nCongress to step in and establish some accountability and ground rules. \nThere are prospects that if they win their next lawsuit, we could be \nspending another $50 or $60 billion over the years ahead on top of the \nmost optimistic projection for the cost of the program, which would be \n$20 billion. We are talking about big sums of money.\n\n  I would like to read from a report that shows how conservative these \nnumbers are. The New York Times said, in an analysis of this program, \nthat the General Accounting Office based its estimate on the assumption \nthat crude oil would sell for about $45 a barrel, a level well below \nwhat was then the $66 cost in the futures market. So these are very \nconservative projections. I am concerned that with the General \nAccounting Office lowballing the cost of the program, the tab to the \ntaxpayers will be much greater than anyone has envisioned.\n  I hope Senators will want at some point to come to the floor and see \nif we can work out a way to vote, look at further suggestions and \nrevisions. If they don't, we will have to stay at it and continue to \ntalk about this issue.\n  I want to address one of the issues that came up in the discussion \nover the Energy bill, that somehow this program wasn't going to cost \ntaxpayers any money. Folks said that with a straight face. They said: \nNo, it is not going to cost people any money. We are going to have to \nfigure out a way to deal with this issue.\n  They said: It is not going to cost people any money. That statement \nwas made by some of the supporters of the program back in 1995. They \nsaid in 1995 this would produce revenue for taxpayers, and they were \nconcerned that people were somehow saying otherwise.\n  The reality is, this has not been a no-cost program. This has been a \npricing program. This is a program that is going to cost the taxpayers \nbillions and billions of dollars. It is the biggest of the programs. I \nam still struck by the discussion that we had with Senator Nelson \nearlier. Senator Nelson was concerned about a program that cost a \nbillion dollars. That is a lot of money to taxpayers, a billion-dollar \nsubsidy. Here we are talking about a program that could go to $80 \nbillion. Senator Cochran's supplemental comes in, I believe, in the \nvicinity of $100 billion. Depending on how the litigation plays out, \nthe amount of money involved comes to an amount equal to what will be \nspent in this emergency supplemental.\n  This is a subsidy that is more than a dubious use of taxpayer \nresources. This is a subsidy for which there is no logical argument at \nall. We are not seeing low prices. We are not seeing an investment \nclimate with ominous signs over it--quite the opposite. We are seeing \nan investment climate in energy that is certainly promising. If we look \nat stocks and profits and the like, energy prices have been very high. \nWe are not talking about crude oil selling for $16 a barrel. Back in \n1995, that is what they were talking about. They were talking about \ncrude oil selling for $16 a barrel.\n  Let's think about that. In 1995, when this program was originated, \nwhen there was a discussion about how to proceed and move ahead, the \nprice was $16. Now we have prices at over $70 a barrel. How can one \nargue that a program that was conceived at a time when we were talking \nabout prices of under $20 a barrel is needed when the price of oil is \nover $70 a barrel? That is what we are dealing with here, and that is \nwhy I and others want to rein in this program.\n  To furnish all of this royalty relief on top of the record profits \nand on top of the record cost, I don't get. I don't get how, when you \nhave the industry prospering as it is today, and taxpayers, \nparticularly the middle class, feeling the crunch, how do you make the \nargument that you ought to use taxpayer dollars this way?\n  I have introduced tax reform legislation targeted to the middle \nclass. The reason I have is that the middle class today is being \nsqueezed as we have never before seen. Certainly, we have not seen it \nin the last 50 years. For the last 50 years, when corporate profits\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nhave gone up, when you have seen increases in productivity, the middle \nclass has benefited. We have seen them enjoy the fruits of expanded \nprofits and productivity. We are not seeing that today.\n  The middle-class folks from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oregon are \ngetting shellacked. This bill cannot do everything that is needed for \nthe middle class, certainly, but it seems to me what we can say is the \nmiddle-class person should not see their tax dollars used for a program \nsuch as this that is totally out of control. I wish to see middle-class \nfolks get a break. When I have my community meetings at home--and, like \nother Senators, I get to every part of the State--I have these open \nmeetings and folks can come in. Almost always the second word is \n``bill.'' First, it is medical bill, and then gas bill, then home \nheating bill, then mortgage bill, then tax bill. The middle-class folks \ncannot keep up.\n  So if the Senate keeps this program going in its current form, as \nopposed to what I am trying to do, which is to reconfigure it, target \nit to where it is needed, what will happen when Senators go home and \nmiddle-class people ask them about what is being done? In effect, what \nis happening is that tax dollars from middle-class people, at a time \nwhen they need a break and some relief--they would have to say that \nessentially they go into the coffers of the Government and then out \nthey go in terms of billions of dollars of royalty relief, when the \nPresident of the United States says it is not necessary. That doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  This is essentially a debate about priorities. What I think we ought \nto be doing, especially on this middle-class issue, where people making \n$40,000, $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 have been hit so hard and they \nare living payday to payday--that is how middle-class folks get by. \nThey get their paycheck and they use it until the next one comes along. \nThe Federal Reserve said not long ago that middle-class people have \nseen virtually no increase in their net worth over the last 5 years.\n  Whose side is the Senate on? Are we on the side of those who want to \nkeep milking this Royalty Relief Program, at a time when it is not \nneeded, at a time when we are seeing record profits and record costs or \nare we on the side of middle-class folks? I want to be on the side of \nmiddle-class folks. I want to better protect the use of their tax \ndollars. This is the most flagrant waste of tax dollars I have seen in \na long time. That is why no Senator comes to the floor of this body to \ndefend it.\n  This is such an exorbitant expenditure. This is such a waste of \ntaxpayer dollars that no Member of the Senate wants to come to this \nfloor and defend the way this program is now being run. That is what it \ncomes down to. Nobody wants to defend it, but somehow we cannot work \nout a way to get a vote and to actually see where the Senate stands on \nwhether this program ought to continue as it is, or whether the Senate \nis willing, as I am proposing, to try to change it and make sure that \ninstead of special interests and lobbyists being able to hotwire this \nwhole program behind closed doors and talk to people at the Department \nof Energy, that we stand up for the public. It is all about choices.\n  At a unique time in our country's history, when we are seeing an \nextraordinary economic transformation, when the people of Louisiana, \nOregon, and Mississippi are not just competing against somebody down \nthe road and we are competing against tough global markets--those in \nChina and India--I want to see us change our priorities. I want to see \nus pay for this legislation responsibly.\n  Senator Cochran has a bill that in many respects, I believe, makes a \nlot of sense. I am anxious to go forward with his legislation and see, \non a bipartisan basis, how we can deal with the emergency needs of our \ncountry. What I am not willing to do, however, is to look the other way \non this program any longer. I am not willing to do it. We may have a \nvote at some point. Maybe I will prevail and maybe I will not. When I \ntalked to Senator Cochran this morning, we were talking about the way \nthe Senate works. The Senator from Mississippi has always been very \nfair in the past. He said: Look, the Senate debates and then the Senate \nhas, through its customs and rules, a way to ensure that the Senate \ntakes a position. That is all I am asking. I am asking that the Senate \ndo what it customarily does. What we do, as far as I can tell, \npractically every single week we are in session--almost every week I \nhave been here, we deal with a variety of issues that come up from \nSenators in the form of amendments. The amendments are debated and then \nthe Senators have an opportunity to have the Senate go on record on \ntheir particular amendment as a part of a group of measures that are \nconsidered. That is not what is going on here. I am curious why.\n  I wish we would hear from some who possibly oppose the legislation \nwhy we cannot do what is done virtually every week in the Senate, which \nis to have a debate, have a discussion, and then the Senate makes a \njudgment on whether a particular amendment or effort is meritorious.\n\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Washington, who is such a \nwonderful advocate for the Pacific Northwest. She has done \nextraordinary work, particularly on infrastructure, on port security, \non making sure we have good investments in transportation. You cannot \nhave big league quality of life with a little league transportation \nsystem. So what we find is when the Senator from Washington wants to \nsee scarce dollars go into infrastructure and into port security, and a \nnumber of the valuable areas she has been advocating, we cannot do that \nbecause a minimum of $20 billion is going to be lost to this particular \nprogram, and if the litigation is successful, it will be $80 billion.\n  So, again, this is going to come down to choices. I like the kinds of \nchoices the distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, has \nbeen talking about. I think she said we ought to focus on middle-class \nfolks, we ought to focus on infrastructure, we ought to focus on a \nhandful of choices in a difficult budgetary climate. But it is not \ngoing to be possible to have the resources the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington has been talking about if you continue to throw money \nout the door in a wasteful fashion. That is what it is all about.\n  This is not very complicated. It has been documented. How the Senate \ncan essentially stiff the General Accounting Office on its \nrecommendations to get some controls on this program is beyond me. I \nguess that is still what some wish to do. But I am going to do \neverything I can to prevent it. This program, as Senator Bennett \nJohnston said some time ago, is not what was intended. Those are not my \nwords. Those are not the words of Senator Kyl or Senator Lieberman, my \ncosponsors of this particular effort. Those are the words of the author \nof the legislation, who hails from the same State as the distinguished \nSenator in the chair. So with the author of the program saying it \nwasn't intended, with people all across the political spectrum saying \nyou don't need royalty relief in this particular climate, I wish to see \nthe Senate take a position up or down as to whether this kind of \nroyalty relief is needed.\n  If the Senate doesn't, it seems to me what the Senate is saying is we \nwill do business as usual, in terms of all of these subsidies. In other \nwords, we talk a lot about tax breaks and the like and what we might be \ndoing on some of them. This is the biggest subsidy. This is No. 1. This \nis the one that counts if we are serious about all of the speeches that \nare given about cutting back needless subsidies to the oil sector. \nSenator Nelson summed it up very well. He was concerned about spending \na billion dollars in terms of a subsidy program that was ill-advised. I \nthink Senator Nelson is on track, and I am anxious to find out more \nabout the program he is concerned about. But that is a tiny fraction of \nwhat is at issue.\n  So I think if the Senate is concerned about changing our energy \npolicy, at a time of record profits, at a time of record prices, it \ncannot duck the big ticket items. You cannot say you are serious about \nusing taxpayer money more prudently and then pass on the programs such \nas this one at the Minerals Management Office that count. In \nparticular, you should not duck them when all of the evidence indicates \nthat the historical rationale for starting this program in the 1990s, \nwith low prices and a need to boost production, isn't present any \nlonger.\n  I see colleagues on the floor. I see my friend from Colorado, Senator\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nSalazar. He did extraordinary work in what was called, I think, the \nGang of 14, I believe, in terms of getting the Senate to come together \non some judicial nominations. Perhaps he can work his great talent into \nfinding a way for us to move ahead now. Senator Murray is also one who \nis no weak soul in terms of parliamentary procedure. I see two good \nfriends on the floor.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon for \nyielding a few minutes to give him a break so he can take a drink of \nwater and continue his dialog. He raises a very important point in the \nargument he has been advancing for the last several hours. I very much \nrespect his passion on the issue.\n  I request of my friend from Oregon to enter into a consent to allow \nat least my amendment to move forward, and perhaps two or three others \nof colleagues who have been waiting in the wings, with the \nunderstanding that upon the offering of those amendments, then the \nfloor would return to him.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: I am very anxious to \naccommodate the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I will tell \ncolleagues I am vastly more interested in accommodating my colleague \nthan anyone can imagine at this point. But my understanding, and I need \nto have this clarified by the Chair, is that if I were to do what the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado has asked, I would lose my \nopportunity to automatically come back to the floor; is that a correct \ninterpretation?\n  Mr. President, I hope it is not because I would love to do exactly \nwhat the Senator from Colorado has asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that would \ndepend entirely upon the exact terms of the unanimous consent request \nand that a unanimous consent request could be so structured to avoid \nwhat the Senator is talking about.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is probably one of the most encouraging things I have \nheard in hours.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Oregon yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If I can respond, just to ensure that we are absolutely \ncorrect on this point, what I would like to do--and, hopefully, we can \nwork it out in a matter of minutes----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from Oregon will yield for a unanimous \nconsent request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oregon so yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator to yield without losing his right to \nthe floor immediately after----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Without losing my right to the floor immediately after the \nquestion; of course, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado be allowed to call up his amendment and offer it, and at \nthe end of that time, to immediately return the floor to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am only stating this reservation to be able to propound \na parliamentary inquiry of the Chair. If the unanimous consent request \nis propounded exactly as the distinguished Senator from Washington has \nso stated, would it be possible for the Senator from Colorado to offer \nhis amendment and then the Senate would automatically return to \nconsideration of my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As the Chair understands it, the pending \nunanimous consent request would return control of the floor to the \nSenator from Oregon but does not specifically address the issue of \nwhether his amendment will be the pending amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Washington to modify \nher unanimous consent request so that at the conclusion of Senator \nSalazar's offering his amendment, not only would I be recognized but \nthat we would again be dealing with my specific amendment so I would \nnot lose the opportunity to come back to my amendment which is before \nthe Senate after Senator Salazar has completed. So it would require a \nunanimous consent modification.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I so modify my unanimous consent request \nthat the Senator from Colorado be allowed to offer his amendment, and \nthen at the conclusion of his offering that amendment, he would set it \naside, and we would return to the pending amendment, which is the Wyden \namendment, with the floor being under the control of Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding of the unanimous consent request that this would give the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon the right to have his amendment the \npending business after disposition of the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado. If that is correct, my conclusion is that we are placing in \nthe hands of one Senator by this action a decision as to what the order \nof business is of the Senate, the order in which amendments can be \nconsidered, specifically these two, and that they have priority over \nany other motion or action that could be taken by any other Senator \nunder the rules of the Senate. Under that assumption, I am obliged to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague that I think the \nattempt here is that the Senator from Colorado simply would like a few \nminutes on the floor this afternoon to offer his amendment. I don't \nthink he is trying to supersede the order of any other amendments. The \npending business of the Senate is the Wyden amendment, so the intent of \nthe Senator from Colorado is simply to have a few minutes on the floor \nto offer his amendment. He has been here numerous times throughout the \nday simply asking for that time, and then we will return to the current \norder of the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If that is a unanimous consent request, I reserve the \nright to object to it and make a further observation. By this \nprocedure, if the unanimous consent requests--plural now--are approved, \nno other Senator has a right to offer an amendment even to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Oregon. No one has the right to \nmove to table the amendment of the Senator from Oregon which \nestablishes his amendment by the request in a position that no other \nSenator has a right to expect.\n  Everybody is governed by the same rules, but in this instance, the \nSenator from Oregon is trying to construct a situation where he is not \nunder the same rules. His rule is that he is entitled to an up-or-down \nvote without any further amendment, without there being an opportunity \nto move to table by any Senator in the Senate. That is inappropriate.\n  That is a modification of the rules without discussion of it and is a \nbad precedent to set. He is governed by the same rules as all Senators \nare. We should not make any exception in that. There has been no cause \nshown for that. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I very much regret the action of the \ndistinguished Chair of the committee because I am extremely interested \nin having the Senator from Colorado be able to offer his amendment, and \nI thought that what the Senator from Washington did was very \nconstructive.\n\n  I repeat, this Senator seeks no special treatment. I have been trying \nsince last night, when Senators went home and I came to the floor to \noffer it, to do something that goes on in the Senate every single week. \nI know of no week since I have been in the Senate when the Senate has \nnot done what it is that I hope to work out very quickly so that \nSenator Salazar can offer his amendment.\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n  We have debates--mine, Senator Salazar, and others--and then the \nvarious amendments are clustered together so that at some point the \nSenate goes on record. I haven't asked for anything other than that.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has talked about various issues I have \nnot addressed in any way. What I have said is, I would like to see the \nSenate do with my amendment what the Senate does every single week the \nSenate is in session, which is to bring together a group of amendments. \nThat is all I am asking for and still hope to work out.\n  I yield to the Senator from Colorado for the purposes of his \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oregon. I ask him \nthe question as to whether a short period of discussion, perhaps \nbetween the Senator from Oregon and the distinguished chairman from \nMississippi and the distinguished Senator from Washington may allow us \nto work out some kind of procedural framework where not only the \namendment that I am proposing to offer is able to be offered, but in \naddition to that, Senator Menendez, who has been here waiting several \nhours to offer an amendment, might offer his amendment, as well as \nseveral of my colleagues who are here, including Senator Conrad and \nearlier Senator Byrd.\n  The suggestion I am making to my friend from Oregon is if we take a \nbreath, we might be able to get perhaps three or four amendments \noffered on the Democratic side and three or four amendments offered on \nthe Republican side, allowing the Senator from Oregon to return back to \nhis amendment as the pending business of the Senate.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I wouldn't just like to \ntake a breath, I would like to take multiple breaths at this point. \nUnfortunately, what we have been told by the Chair is that it is not \npossible to work out some kind of format so that at some point, as part \nof a batch of amendments, mine could be considered.\n  As to the question the Senator asked about working with the \ndistinguished Chair of the committee, I will tell you that half an hour \nbefore the Senate came in, I called the distinguished Chair of the \ncommittee, and I asked that we do exactly what the Senator from \nColorado said. In other words, I was concerned about just this \nscenario. And so about 9:30 or so, I called the distinguished chair of \nthe committee, Senator Cochran, and said: I am willing to do \nsomersaults to work this out so as to be fair to all Senators because \nhaving watched this program grow and grow behind closed doors, and \nwatch this sugar-ladened program get sweeter and sweeter over the \nyears, I have seen all the big decisions made behind closed doors. So \nfearing exactly what the Senator from Colorado has talked about, I \ncalled the chair of the committee at 9:30 in an effort to try to work \nthis out.\n  Ever since 9:30--and now I guess we are about at 2 o'clock--that has \nbeen my interest. It will continue to be my interest.\n  The Senator from Colorado says I ought to have an opportunity to take \na breath. I will tell him, I wish it was more than one.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a response \nsince he referred to his conversation with this Senator this morning?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Without losing, again, my place, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The Senator did \ncall me, as he said, and asked if he could get a vote on his amendment, \nbe recognized to debate his amendment. I said I am not in the business \nof picking out which Senator can speak first. This is the Senate. The \nfirst Senator who rises when we go in today and says ``Mr. President'' \ngets recognition and can talk about anything that Senator wants to talk \nabout, for as long as he or she wants to talk about it, and can offer \nany amendment to any pending amendment, can have the attention of the \nSenate. But that is not my prerogative, it is the Presiding Officer's \nprerogative to recognize Senators.\n  I told him I wished him well with his amendment in terms of getting \nrecognition, offering it, and talking about it and proceeding. Go \nahead, you don't have to get my permission.\n  That was pretty well the extent of the conversation. The fact is that \nthere are 21 pending amendments that come ahead of the Senator's \namendment. There are 21 in all; 20 come ahead of the Senator. His is \nthe last one that has been presented to the Senate.\n  I can read the list. We have had some that have been adopted, some \nthat have failed, and some that are still pending without action by the \nSenate. Those Senators have a right to have their amendments \nconsidered. So he is asking that we put his amendment to the top of the \nlist from 21 to 1 and that no amendment can be offered to his amendment \nand that it can't be tabled on a motion of another Senator. That is not \nfair to all the other Senators. That is not fair to the Senate. That is \nwhy I am unable to agree to give him those rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I can reclaim my time, the Senator from \nMississippi is a person of enormous integrity. I agree with the vast \nmajority of what the Senator has said with respect to our conversation. \nThe only part I take exception to is I did not ask to be put to the \nhead of the line. I have never asked to be put to the head of the line. \nI told my friend from Mississippi that I had offered the amendment last \nnight, so it was the pending business, and I said, fearing exactly what \nwe have seen, that I was open to just about any possible way to do what \nthe Senate always does, and that is to have amendments considered, have \nthem put in to a batch, and voted. So I simply want to say, because I \ndo have the highest regard for the Senator from Mississippi, that I \nagree with the vast amount of what he has said, but I do take exception \nto the part where I asked to be put ahead of other Senators. I said I \nam open to working this out in any way. Frankly, I don't really care \nwhether it is even in the first batch of votes that the Senate would \ntake. If we can work it out so it is in the second batch of votes, fine \nby me as well.\n\n  I see now we have the Senator from New Mexico here who knows more \nabout this program than anybody else, frankly, on the planet. I am glad \nhe is here, and I hope we can have a discussion about this, because I \nhave been troubled by the fact that we are not having debate about it, \nand maybe the presence of the Senator from New Mexico will get us to \nthe point where we can get to a vote.\n  Senator Kyl and I both serve on the committee. Like you, Senator \nCochran, Senator Domenici is very fair. He and I have disagreed on \nloads of issues. When I think of Senator Domenici, I always think of \nfairness--always. That is what I am interested in, having become a part \nof all of this. To me, fairness--fairness--is when the Senate has a \ndebate, and we have had that now for many hours, and amendments are \npulled together in a cluster, and I am open to being part of the first \ncluster or the second cluster. And maybe there are other ways to work \nthis out. I would have been very pleased to have done what Senator \nSalazar and Senator Murray are talking about.\n  Would the Senator from New Mexico like me to yield to him for a \nquestion? I yield to the Senator, again, under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the kind words. \nI think we are wearing the patience of the chairman thin, so we ought \nto get on with doing what we can. I want to ask the Senator--I want him \nto take this fairly and squarely, and when I am finished, if you don't \nbelieve what I am saying, then I would like very much for you to have \nyour staff go take a look to see if I am right or not.\n  First of all, Senator, I think you made a mistake with your \namendment. I think the amendment is wrong in that under current law--\nand what the Secretary has done under current law--the oil companies \nwill pay more royalties than they are going to pay under your \namendment. You set a threshold, for instance, on oil of $55, if I read \nyour amendment correctly. Your staff is there and they can confirm \nthis: $55. The Secretary has already established the threshold for oil \nat $36. So the difference is that at $34, they start--that is the break \npoint, and you have made a mistake in taking it all the way up\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\nto $55. It shouldn't be $55 when it is much lower. It means that the \noil companies are going to pay much more at a much lower level of the \nprice under existing law than under your amendment.\n  So your amendment should not be adopted. I want to be fair, but I \njust want to tell you it shouldn't.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will ask: Do you know that? I started off by asking \nif you know that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do. And in response specifically to the Senator, nothing \nin the amendment says that threshold couldn't be lower. Of course, the \nthreshold should be addressed in a responsible way. All we are saying \nis that we are not going to shovel taxpayer money out when it is over \n$55 a barrel. But nothing in my amendment says the threshold couldn't \nbe lower, and that is why it better targets the resources and would do \nsomething about it.\n  Again, the General Accounting Office is not some group with a \npolitical ax to grind; it is the Government Accountability Office, the \npeople we hire as our auditors who have been talking about all the \nwaste in this program.\n  As the distinguished chair of the committee knows because he has seen \nthe letter from the Senators, this program is so riddled--so riddled--\nwith questionable issues, the companies don't even give the same facts \nto the government. They say one thing to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and say another thing to the Department of the Interior, and \nthe Department of the Interior people say: Well, we don't know what to \nmake of it.\n  So I am very glad the Senator is on the floor, and if the Senator \nwould be willing to work with me, I am interested in trying to do what \nSenator Kyl and I and Senator Lieberman have been working on with this \nbipartisan amendment. But in response to the particular point made by \nthe chairman of the committee, nothing in this amendment says that the \nthreshold couldn't be lower, and obviously it needs to be.\n  I think now the Senator from Colorado is next, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Oregon. \nI would like to ask a question of my friend from Oregon and a question \nof the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. If we can find an \nagreement that will allow three amendments from the Democratic side and \nthree amendments from the Republican side, and then at the end of those \nsix amendments being sent to the desk, returning back to your amendment \nas the pending business of the Senate, is that something that the \nchairman of the committee would object to? If we were to offer a \nunanimous consent agreement with respect to those six amendments and we \nwould agree to what those six amendments would be, would then the \nchairman of the committee object to us moving forward with that kind of \na unanimous consent agreement, understanding that we would be returning \nto the amendment of the Senator from Oregon at the end of that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator propose that as a unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I do propose that as a unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving my right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, again, wanting very much to accommodate the \nSenator from Colorado, could the Chair clarify that if we did what the \nSenator from Colorado is talking about exactly as he has so stated, \nthat after that group of amendments, I believe it was six that the \nSenator from Colorado talked about, we would return to the amendment \nthat I am offering being the pending business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the proposed unanimous consent agreement \nof the Senator from Colorado, after the six amendments are read from \nthe desk and briefly discussed, the Wyden amendment would remain the \npending amendment and the Senator from Oregon would have the floor.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, as I \nunderstand the Senator's request, this would prevent the Senator from \nNew Mexico from offering an amendment to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Oregon. It would also prevent returning to the first \namendments that were offered and that are the pending business of the \nSenate; specifically, amendments offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, \nMr. Coburn.\n  I understand that he would like to have his amendments considered and \nvoted on in the regular order in which they were filed by the Senate. \nAn alternative to the proposal of the Senator from Colorado is to go to \nthe regular order. But as long as the Senator from Oregon has the \nfloor, if he doesn't ask for the regular order, no other Senator can, \nas I understand it, because we don't have the floor for that purpose. \nSo, again, what the Senator from Oregon is trying to do is to design a \nsituation that benefits him, puts him in priority over all the Senators \nwho have amendments pending, and provides that he will get an up-or-\ndown vote on his amendment; that it won't be subject to any amendment, \nthat it can't be tabled. That is not fair. I can't agree to that. So I \nam compelled to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. To clarify, the Chair \nwould note that the unanimous consent agreement proposed by the Senator \nfrom Colorado does not address in any way votes on any amendments.\n  The objection is heard. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to again highlight that this Senator \nvery much wants to accommodate the Senator from Colorado and to do \nexactly what he is talking about--what I wanted to do hours and hours \nago, but the chair of the committee is the one who has objected. I \ncalled the chair a half an hour before we went into session, knowing \nthat we were really looking at the prospects of this kind of gridlock \nbecause I know the decisions about this multibillion-dollar boondoggle \nhave always been made behind closed doors.\n  When I offered this amendment last night, and it was pending when he \ncame in this morning, I knew there was the potential for this. I called \nthe Senator from Mississippi a half an hour before we went into session \nthis morning in an effort to try to work out what is done in the Senate \nall the time.\n  I see Senator Dodd here who is our leader on the Rules Committee and \nknows vastly more about this than I. But what I tried to say is let's \ndo what is done in the Senate every single week. You consider a big \nbatch of amendments, and at some point after both sides have been \nnoticed, then you go to a vote. You go to a vote so that both sides are \naware of what is going on.\n  I have also offered here that I wouldn't even be in the first cluster \nof amendments that were considered. So that, again, even though my \namendment was pending last night, when we came in, we could have \ncolleagues get the first votes. Colleagues would get the first votes \nbefore my amendment. But what I am forced to conclude, and why I am \ngoing to stay here and try to stand up for taxpayers, is that virtually \nnothing is acceptable other than what we saw in the Energy Conference \nagreement where oil royalty relief got sweeter for a handful of \ncompanies, after midnight, in the middle of the night, with no \naccountability.\n  This is a program with a minimum cost of $20 billion. If the \nlitigation involving this program is successful, the tab for this \nprogram will be $80 billion. That is virtually the amount we are \ntalking about in terms of emergency spending.\n  So the Senate is looking at the bizarre situation of having an \nemergency supplemental because the Government doesn't have the money. \nYet even though we have an emergency supplemental, we are sending out \nthe door billions and billions of dollars that the General Accounting \nOffice has deemed wasteful. I don't think that makes sense.\n  I am willing, again, to yield to my friend from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for \nyielding, once again. I would like to ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. To my friend from Mississippi, the unanimous consent \nrequest that I made earlier would essentially allow the work of the \nSenate to continue forward for a brief period of time while we would \nhave three Republican amendments and three Democratic amendments to be \noffered.\n  As I understood your statement, you believe that would then allow my \ngood friend from Oregon to essentially control the floor throughout his \namendment to essentially supersede the other amendments that are \npending--some 21 amendments, as I understand that to be the case. I do \nnot think that was at all the nature of the unanimous consent request \nthat I made.\n  What I suggested that we would do with my unanimous consent request \nis that we move forward with the filing and then move forward with the \npending business of the Senate with six amendments in total. And at \nthat point in time we would return to the amendment of the Senator from \nOregon, without prejudging whether or not there is going to be a vote \nat all on the amendment of the Senator from Oregon. So I would like \nclarification from the chairman of the committee as to what will happen \nvia the unanimous consent request that I previously made, which was \nobjected to by the chairman of the committee, with respect to the \npending business that is currently before the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a response?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to inform the Senator that this would \ndisadvantage some 10 Senators who have already filed and argued and had \ntheir amendments pending for consideration. You would urge that we have \nsix more amendments offered from three Republican and three Democratic \nSenators and add those to these and then have a vote, I guess, on the \nWyden amendment? Instead of voting on those which we would take up in \nregular order, if we could ask for the regular order? It puts you in \ncharge of managing the business of the Senate, setting priorities for \nthe amendments that can be offered when that priority has already been \nestablished.\n  I think what we should do is follow the regular order. That is all I \nhave said from the beginning. But Senator Wyden wanted to come in \ntoday, get recognized, offer his amendment, and have an up-or-down vote \non it without any other intervening business--no amendments, no motion \nto table. I don't know of anybody who has ever gotten a deal like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, what Senator Salazar \nand I are both saying is we do not want to be at the head of the line, \nbut we want to have a place in the line, which is the custom of the \nSenate. The custom is that you have these debates, you have these \ndiscussions, and at some point the leadership on both sides gets \ntogether. I see the distinguished leader, Senator Reid, and Senator \nDurbin. What happens is they get together with Senator Frist and \nSenator McConnell after everybody has had a chance to discuss their \namendments. Then at some point you get in the queue.\n  I have enormous respect for the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi. That is why I called him a half hour before we even went \nin today, in an effort to try to work this out. He consistently says I \nwant to be at the head of the line; I want special treatment.\n  I don't want to be at the head of the line, but I think at some point \nSenators ought to have a place in line. My amendment was offered late \nlast night because I stayed here, again anticipating the possibility of \nthis. So it was pending when we came in.\n  So Senators are very clear, I am interested in working out what \nSenator Salazar wants to do. I am interested in amendments being \nclustered as we traditionally have done in the Senate. What I am not \nwilling to do is this: At a time of record profits, at a time of record \ncosts, I am not willing to sit by while record amounts of royalty \nrelief are handed out while all of the independent auditors say it \nought to be stopped.\n  I have read to my colleagues, for example, that in the other body the \nchair of the natural resources committee, Congressman Pombo--hardly \nanti-oil, as our good friend, the chair of our Energy Committee, knows; \nCongressman Pombo has consistently been proproduction--Congressman \nPombo says we don't need this incentive for production. Those are his \nwords, you don't need an incentive for production at a time when oil is \n$70 a barrel.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Dorgan have a variety of approaches they \nwant to explore with respect to the Tax Code, and Senators will weigh \nin, one way or another. There is a trifecta of programs now. There are \ntax breaks, there is mandatory spending, and there is royalty relief, \nwhich is the granddaddy of all of these breaks. I do not see how we can \njustify sweetening this sugar-laden giveaway again and again and do it \nbehind closed doors.\n  I have been out here I guess upwards of 4 hours. I sure wish this \nwere not necessary. I would certainly like to do what Senator Salazar \nhas been talking about, which is get an order for these amendments and \nall of us find a reasonable place in line. But I am not going to sit by \nwhile taxpayers get fleeced again. I am just not. I may lose when it \ncomes time, if we can get one, to vote, but until then I am just going \nto hold forth.\n  We have colleagues here. Senator Dodd, for example, knew the author \nof the program very well. Senator Bennett Johnston was the author of \nthe program. Senator Bennett Johnston has said nothing like what we \nhave seen was what he intended.\n  There are no people arguing on behalf of doing business as usual, as \nI guess some in the Senate want to consider. But all of the independent \nexperts--the lawyers for Shell oil company--again not the first place \nyou look for anti-oil kinds of arguments--the lawyers for Shell oil \ncompany say you don't need this kind of break in this sort of climate. \nSo you have Congressman Pombo, you have the folks from Shell oil \ncompany, you have the author of the program, Senator Bennett Johnston--\nall of them weighing in.\n  If the litigation that is now underway with respect to this program \nis successful, I would say to colleagues, the tab for this program \ncould be $80 billion. The emergency supplemental is $100 billion. So \nover the life of this program, it could come to a very significant \nfraction of what we need to do in terms of the emergency spending. The \ndistinguished chair of the committee is on his feet, and I am glad to \nrecognize him for a question at this time, keeping my place here on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, first of all, I don't quite know how to ask \nthe question, but I am going to try. Are you aware that the years of \n1998 and 1999--for 2 full years, all the leases that were issued had no \nthresholds in them? Are you aware of that, Senator?\n  Mr. WYDEN. To respond to the chairman, I am very much aware. It is \nclear that some of those in the Clinton administration--and I have \ntalked about this at some length. Frankly, those omissions by midlevel \npeople in key level positions in the Clinton administration have \ncontributed mightily to this problem. If they had been doing their job \nand been watching this threshold question, we would not be in this \nproblem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the chairman knows, I believe energy policy has to \nbe bipartisan. We have the distinguished Senator from Tennessee in the \nchair. I have been talking to him for some weeks on an innovative \napproach we would like to explore. I want to do business in a \nbipartisan way. I think I was bipartisan, frankly, before it even \nbecame fashionable around here. But I am telling you this has to end. I \nam glad the Senator from New Mexico has brought up the point about how \nwe got into the situation.\n  By the way, during the Clinton years when folks weren't watchdogging \nthis program, as I say--the Senator from New Mexico knows a lot more \nabout this than I do--the price of oil was $34 a barrel. We were \ntalking about a price that was a fraction of the cost right now. So \nwhat you have is a program that was designed when the price of oil was \n$16 a barrel. The folks in the Clinton administration muffed the ball \nin the middle of 1990 when the price was $34 a barrel. Now the \nPresident of the United States comes along and says, to his credit, \nlet's knock off the subsidies\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nat a time when the price of oil is more than $50 a barrel. That is what \nI am trying to do in this particular amendment.\n  This program made sense in the middle 1990s, when folks in the oil \npatch were hurting. Probably Senator Dodd remembers a bit of that \nhistory. Senator Johnston, whom we all respect so much, came to people \nin the Senate and talked about the need for the program. Folks in that \npart of the country were hurting, and the price of energy was very low. \nThere was a good argument saying there was a role for Government.\n  I have sat in many hearings with the distinguished chairman of the \nEnergy Committee where we talked about the notion that there is a role \nfor the private sector, a role for Government. We want production. What \nI have done in my amendment is say--Senator Kyl and I got a little bit \ninto this--not only are we going to put a lot of verbiage behind the \nnotion that we are going to support production, what I said is, if \nthere is any evidence this incentive is needed--the President says we \nwill have a disruption of supply--if the price of oil goes down, bingo, \nthe Government can get back into the royalty business. That is what we \nare trying to do here.\n  I recall that energy conference committee, I say to my friend from \nNew Mexico. The decisions were made on this particular provision after \nmidnight. I am not even completely sure how it came about. I don't \nbelieve I was even in the room. But this time, the Senate is going to \ntake a position, if I have anything to say about it. As colleagues \nknow, I have had plenty to say in the last 4\\1/2\\ hours. I very much \nwant this worked out so we can get to the point of a vote.\n  Did the distinguished chairman want the floor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield in a different way, so I could \nspeak for 5 minutes and return the floor to you and you lose none of \nyour rights?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Let me propound a parliamentary inquiry. I would very much \nlike to do what Senator Domenici, the chair of the Energy Committee, \nhas asked for. If I yield to him to speak for any amount of time, will \nI lose my place to be able, on the pending amendment, to speak on it? \nWould the Chair so advise at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The answer is yes, unless you ask by unanimous \nconsent that the floor be returned to you and it is approved without \nobjection.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my understanding is that puts us in exactly \nthe same position as we had with Senator Salazar. I would like to make \nthe same offer to the distinguished chair of the committee, because I \nwould very much like to respond positively to his request, if we can \nwork with the staffs to propound a parliamentary request to deal with \nwhat the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, has asked. I would very \nmuch like to do it. Perhaps we can get our staffs together and perhaps \nwork it out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just heard the Chair say what it would take for this \nto be appropriate. I ask unanimous consent that which he has just \narticulated be the unanimous consent request before the Senate, and I \nask that the Senate grant it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again I think we have to be very clear on this. If the \nSenator from New Mexico is granted his unanimous consent request and he \nspeaks for whatever time he desires--frankly, probably more power to \nyou if you go longer--if he speaks for whatever time the Senator from \nNew Mexico desires, does it automatically come back to me to speak on \nmy pending amendment? That is what I am asking the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nSenator from New Mexico desires 5 minutes to speak, and when he is \nconcluded the floor will be returned to the Senator from Oregon and the \npending business will be his amendment, if the unanimous consent of the \nSenator from New Mexico is approved without objection.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators and Senator \nWyden, if you would please lend me your ear because I would like to be \nhelpful.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I wish to be clear that what the Senator from New Mexico \nasked for was a request to speak for 5 minutes and then we would return \nto consideration of my amendment specifically in its current form, and \nI would be recognized to speak on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Nothing else will be in order \nduring the 5 minutes except that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 5 minutes. I would like very much \nfor anybody who is trying to fix this parliamentary problem to just \nlisten for a minute.\n  First of all, most of the problem that has been discussed by the \ndistinguished Senator in terms of royalties that are allegedly not \nbeing paid by oil companies which are indeed drilling successfully \noffshore--most of those have occurred during the years of 1999 and \n1998. Let me repeat, there are oil companies which are drilling and \nwould otherwise owe some kind of royalties, and those are companies \nthat did business during the years 1998 and 1999. They got leases those \nyears, and mistakes were made. I am not accusing the Clinton \nadministration because it is Democratic. The truth is, they made the \nmistakes. They issued them without the right to collect royalties on \nbehalf of the Federal Government.\n\n  Along comes an auditing company that finds them and says: Look at \nthese companies. They are getting away with hundreds of millions of \ndollars. Yes, they are. But read their contracts. They are not \nobligated to pay any because the U.S. Government messed up. We didn't \nobligate them to pay any. I don't know what to do about that.\n  I can come to the floor and yell and cry that we are losing revenue, \nbut these companies are going to have to gratuitously decide to pay or \nthey do not owe it. So we can come down here and talk forever about \nthat. Obviously, the amendment by my good friend from Oregon will do \nnothing about the leases of 1998-1999, for if you tried to do something \nabout them you would be doing nothing. You cannot come to the floor of \nthe Senate and say leases already issued upon, which the work has been \ndone upon, which the Government sought not to charge anything, we have \nchanged our mind, and we are going to make them pay. That is not the \nsubject of his amendment. Read it. It doesn't purport to do that. That \nis point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2, the amendment doesn't do what the Senator says it does. \nThis year, the Secretary--this Secretary--stopped royalty relief at \n$35.86 per barrel. The amendment by the distinguished Senator is \ntalking about $55 a barrel. He is saying the same thing--that we will \nstop royalty relief at $55 instead of $35. Obviously, his amendment in \ntoday's market is a malady. It doesn't do anything. The Secretary has \nalready one-upped his amendment. The Secretary has put the relief line \nat a lower price per barrel than his amendment.\n  I don't know, again, what he is trying to do with the amendment. \nFirst, he can't affect the so-called Clinton year lease which he has \nbeen talking about. And he deserves to tell the public that the \ncompanies have gotten away with a lot of money there. That is a nice \nspeech. And it deserves to be given, but he isn't fixing that because \nyou can't fix it. He isn't fixing the existing leases because he is \nsetting a threshold that is higher than the price that the Secretary \nhad set, and the price of oil is higher than both of them. So we are \ngoing to collect all the royalties we can get, and I do not know how we \nare losing anything.\n  I don't know what the speeches are about in terms of losing that much \nmoney, nor do I know what the amendment is doing. What I do know is \nthat from this point forward the Energy bill that we passed has some \nlanguage that could be fixed.\n  I have an amendment that fixes it. It makes it permissive. It says \nthe Secretary may in the future set these limits. The Secretary may in \nthe future set the dollar amount from which you base royalty relief. I \nhave an amendment that I think sooner or later we\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\nshould adopt that says it should not be made, but the Secretary shall \nset these limits. That is an amendment that I have that I think the \ngood Senator from Oregon ought to take. I will give it to him. He ought \nto put it in instead of his, and he will have solved one of the \nproblems by making it mandatory.\n  I thank you profusely for the 5 minutes which has turned into 7\\1/2\\. \nI talked too long, but I thank you for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask permission to propound a unanimous \nconsent request. May I propound a unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n3665 by the Senator from Oregon be made the last amendment in order and \nthat it be subject to no second-degree amendment; that is, when we \ndispose of approximately 31 amendments, there would be a vote on his \nwith no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  First of all, the Wyden amendment No. 3665, I think, was offered just \nbefore the Santorum amendment last night. The Santorum amendment No. \n3640 was offered on the subject of Iran. I am not able to agree to his \namendment being voted on without any amendment. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \npropounding that unanimous consent request because I think now it is \nclear what has happened in the Senate; that is, it will not be possible \nto get an up-or-down vote at any point on rolling back this outrageous \nboondoggle that wastes taxpayer money.\n  My good friend from New Mexico made the point, and I want to kind of \nsummarize it because I think we are getting close to being able to wind \ndown.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Of course, I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator's understanding the same as mine, that no \nmatter how he tried to do all the different proposals which he has made \nhe is not being allowed a vote by the majority? Is that your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The distinguished Democratic leader is exactly right. We \nhave done summersaults since last night. I called the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Cochran, half an hour before we went in in an effort \nto try to work it out. I have been supportive of Senator Salazar's \nrequest. But what we saw in the last few minutes is the ball game--you \ncan't get a vote up or down in the Senate on a ripoff of taxpayer \nmoney. It is not me who concluded it; the General Accounting Office has \ndone that. The Shell Oil Company says we don't need this particular \nincentive right now.\n  In the other body, the chairman of the natural resources committee \nsays you don't need it. Even the author of the bill says it is not \nworking as he intended.\n  But what we saw as a result of the request of the Senator from Nevada \nis that the Senate is not going to take a position on the granddaddy of \nall oil company subsidies. This is the biggest, folks. This is the one \nthat really counts.\n  I want to respond briefly to the distinguished chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Domenici. Senator Domenici essentially said a little \nbit ago that there were great problems in 1998 and 1999 with some in \nthe Clinton administration who weren't watchdogging the program. I very \nmuch share the chairman's view. I talked about this probably two or \nthree times over the course of the morning and early afternoon.\n  Where I take exception with my friend, however, is he essentially \nsaid the Clinton administration caused all of these problems, and along \ncame Secretary Norton who cleaned it up. That was essentially the \nargument.\n  I would like to read verbatim and then enter into the Record a \ndiscussion in the New York Times of what happened under Secretary \nNorton. While I respect the chairman of the committee tremendously, I \nwant the Senate to know what happened over the last few years.\n\n       Gale Norton, who stepped down this month as Interior \n     Secretary, moved quickly to speed up approval of new drilling \n     permits. Starting in 2001, she offered royalty incentives to \n     shallow-water producers who drilled more than 15,000 feet \n     below the sea bottom. In January 2004, Ms. Norton made the \n     incentive far more generous by raising the threshold price. \n     Her decisions meant that deep-gas drillers were able to \n     escape royalties in 2005 when prices spiked to record levels \n     and would probably escape them this year as well.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       She also offered to sweeten less generous contracts the \n     drillers had signed before the regulation was approved.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 27, 2006]\n\n       Vague Law and Hard Lobbying Add Up to Billions for Big Oil\n\n                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)\n\n       Washington, March 26.--It was after midnight and every \n     lawmaker in the committee room wanted to go home, but there \n     was still time to sweeten a deal encouraging oil and gas \n     companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       ``There is no cost,'' declared Representative Joe L. \n     Barton, a Texas Republican who was presiding over \n     Congressional negotiations on the sprawling energy bill last \n     July. An obscure provision on new drilling incentives was \n     ``so noncontroversial,'' he added, that senior House and \n     Senate negotiators had not even discussed it.\n       Mr. Barton's claim had a long history. For more than a \n     decade, lawmakers and administration officials, both \n     Republicans and Democrats, have promised there would be no \n     cost to taxpayers for a program allowing companies to avoid \n     paying the government royalties on oil and gas produced in \n     publicly owned waters in the Gulf.\n       But last month, the Bush administration confirmed that it \n     expected the government to waive about $7 billion in \n     royalties over the next five years, even though the industry \n     incentive was expressly conceived of for times when energy \n     prices were low. And that number could quadruple to more than \n     $28 billion if a lawsuit filed last week challenging one of \n     the program's remaining restrictions proves successful.\n       ``The big lie about this whole program is that it doesn't \n     cost anything,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, a \n     Massachusetts Democrat who tried to block its expansion last \n     July. ``Taxpayers are being asked to provide huge subsidies \n     to oil companies to produce oil--it's like subsidizing a fish \n     to swim.''\n       How did a supposedly cost-free incentive become a \n     multibillion-dollar break to an industry making record \n     profits?\n       The answer is a familiar Washington story of special-\n     interest politics at work: the people who pay the closest \n     attention and make the fewest mistakes are those with the \n     most profit at stake.\n       It is an account of legislators who passed a law riddled \n     with ambiguities; of crucial errors by midlevel bureaucrats \n     under President Bill Clinton; of $2 billion in inducements \n     from the Bush administration, which was intent on promoting \n     energy production; and of Republican lawmakers who wanted to \n     do even more. At each turn, through shrewd lobbying and \n     litigation, oil and gas companies ended up with bigger \n     incentives than before.\n       Until last month, hardly anyone noticed--or even knew--the \n     real costs. They were obscured in part by the long gap \n     between the time incentives are offered and when new offshore \n     wells start producing. But lawmakers shrouded the costs with \n     rosy projections. And administration officials consistently \n     declined to tally up the money they were forfeiting.\n       Most industry executives say that the royalty relief \n     spurred drilling and exploration when prices were relatively \n     low. But the industry is divided about whether it is \n     appropriate to continue the incentives with prices at current \n     levels. Michael Coney, a lawyer for Shell Oil, said, ``Under \n     the current environment, we don't need royalty relief.''\n       The program's original architect said he was surprised by \n     what had happened. ``The one thing I can tell you is that \n     this is not what we intended,'' said J. Bennett Johnston, a \n     former Democratic senator from Louisiana who had pushed for \n     the original incentives that Congress passed in 1995.\n       Mr. Johnston conceded that he was confused by his own law. \n     ``I got out the language a few days ago,'' he said in a \n     recent interview. ``I had it out just long enough to know \n     that it's got a lot of very obscure language.''\n\n\n                       a subsidy of disputed need\n\n       Things looked bleak for oil and gas companies in 1995, \n     especially for those along the Gulf Coast.\n       Energy prices had been so low for so long that investment \n     had dried up. With crude oil selling for about $16 a barrel, \n     scores of wildcatters and small exploration companies had \n     gone out of business. Few companies had any stomach for \n     drilling in water thousands of feet deep, and industry \n     leaders like Exxon\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\n     and Royal Dutch Shell were increasingly focused on \n     opportunities abroad.\n       ``At the time, the Gulf of Mexico was like the Dead Sea,'' \n     recalled John Northington, then an Energy Department policy \n     adviser and now an industry lobbyist.\n       Senator Johnston, convinced that the Gulf's vast reservoirs \n     and Louisiana's oil-based economy were being neglected, had \n     argued for years that Congress should offer incentives for \n     deep-water drilling and exploration.\n       ``Failure to invest in the Gulf of Mexico is a lost \n     opportunity for the U.S.,'' Mr. Johnston pleaded in a letter \n     to other lawmakers. ``Those dollars will not move into other \n     domestic development, they will move to Asia, South America, \n     the Middle East or the former Soviet Union.''\n       Working closely with industry executives, he wrote \n     legislation that would allow a company drilling in deep water \n     to escape the standard 12 percent royalty on up to 87.5 \n     million barrels of oil or its equivalent in natural gas. The \n     coastal waters are mostly owned by the federal government, \n     which leases tens of millions of acres in exchange for \n     upfront fees and a share of sales, or royalties.\n       Mr. Johnston and other supporters argued that the \n     incentives would actually generate money for the government \n     by increasing production and prompting companies to bid \n     higher prices for new leases.\n       ``The provision will result in a minimum net benefit to the \n     Treasury of $200 million by the year 2000,'' Mr. Johnston \n     declared in November 1995, denouncing what he called \n     ``outrageous allegations'' that the plan was a giveaway.\n       He won support from oil-state Democrats, Republicans and \n     the Clinton administration. Hazel O'Leary, the energy \n     secretary at the time, said the assistance would reduce \n     American dependence on foreign oil and ``enhance national \n     security.''\n       Representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana, then a \n     rising Republican leader, declared that the inducements would \n     ``create thousands of jobs'' and ``reduce the deficit.''\n       Many budget experts agree that the rosy estimates were \n     misleading. The reason, they say, is that it often takes \n     seven years before a new offshore field begins producing. As \n     a result, almost all the costs of royalty relief would occur \n     outside of Congress's five-year budget timeframe.\n       Opponents protested that the cost estimates were wrong, \n     that the incentives amounted to corporate welfare and that \n     companies did not need government incentives to invest.\n       ``They are going to the Gulf of Mexico because that's where \n     the oil is,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of \n     California, during a House debate. ``What we do here is not \n     going to change that. We are just going to decide whether or \n     not we are going to give away the taxpayers' dollars to a lot \n     of oil companies that do not need it.''\n       Industry executives and lobbyists fanned out across Capitol \n     Hill to shore up support for the program, visiting 150 \n     lawmakers in October 1995. The effort succeeded. A month \n     later, Congress passed Mr. Johnston's bill.\n\n\n                        a missing escape clause\n\n       To hear lawmakers today, they never intended to waive \n     royalties when energy prices were high.\n       The 1995 law, according to Republicans and Democrats alike, \n     was supposed to include an escape clause: in any year when \n     average spot prices for oil or gas climbed above certain \n     threshold levels, companies would pay full royalties instead.\n       ``Royalty relief is an effective tool for two things: \n     keeping investment in America during times of superlow \n     prices, and spurring American energy production when massive \n     capital and technological risks would otherwise preclude \n     it,'' said Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of \n     California and chairman of the House Resources Committee. \n     ``Absent those criteria, I do not believe any relief should \n     be granted.''\n       But in what administration officials said appeared to have \n     been a mistake, Clinton administration managers omitted the \n     crucial escape clause in all offshore leases signed in 1998 \n     and 1999.\n       At the time, with oil prices still below $20 a barrel, the \n     mistake seemed harmless. But energy prices have been above \n     the cutoff points since 2002, and Interior Department \n     officials estimate that about one-sixth of production in the \n     Gulf of Mexico is still exempt from royalties.\n       Walter Cruickshank, a senior official in both the Clinton \n     and Bush administrations, told lawmakers last month that \n     officials writing the lease contracts thought the price \n     thresholds were spelled out in the new regulations, which \n     were completed in 1998. But officials writing the regulations \n     left those details out, preferring to set the precise rules \n     at each new lease sale.\n       ``It seems to have been a massive screw-up,'' said Mr. \n     Northington, who was then in the Energy Department. No one \n     noticed the error for two years, and no one informed Congress \n     about it until last month.\n       Five years later, the costs of that lapse were compounded. \n     A group of oil companies, led by Shell, defeated the Bush \n     administration in court. The decision more than doubled the \n     amount of oil and gas that companies could produce without \n     paying royalties.\n       The case began as a relatively obscure dispute. Shell paid \n     $3.8 million in 1997 for a Gulf lease and soon drilled a \n     successful well. But the Interior Department denied the \n     company royalty relief, saying that Shell had drilled into an \n     older field already producing oil and gas. The decision \n     hinged on undersea geography and the court's interpretation \n     of language in the 1995 law.\n       A typical field, or geological reservoir, often encompasses \n     two or three separately leased tracts of ocean floor. \n     Interior Department officials insisted that the maximum \n     amount of royalty-free oil and gas was based on each field. \n     Shell and its partners argued that limit applied only to each \n     lease.\n       Perhaps shrewdly, the oil companies sued the Bush \n     administration in Louisiana, where federal courts previously \n     had sided with the industry in spats with the government.\n       The fight was not even close. In January 2003, a federal \n     district judge declared that the Interior Department's rules \n     violated the 1995 law. If the department ``disagrees with \n     Congress's policy choices,'' Judge James T. Trimble Jr. \n     wrote, ``then such arguments are best addressed to \n     Congress.''\n       What might have been a $2 billion mistake in the Clinton \n     administration suddenly ballooned into a $5 billion headache \n     under Mr. Bush.\n       But even as the Bush administration was losing in court, it \n     was offering new incentives for the energy industry.\n       Mr. Bush placed a top priority on expanding oil and gas \n     production as soon as he took office in 2001. Vice President \n     Dick Cheney's task force on energy, warning of a deepening \n     shortfall in domestic energy production, urged the government \n     to ``explore opportunities for royalty reduction'' and to \n     open areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \n     drilling.\n       Gale A. Norton, who stepped down this month as interior \n     secretary, moved quickly to speed up approvals of new \n     drilling permits. Starting in 2001, she offered royalty \n     incentives to shallow-water producers who drilled more than \n     15,000 feet below the sea bottom.\n       In January 2004, Ms. Norton made the incentives far more \n     generous by raising the threshold prices. Her decision meant \n     that deep-gas drillers were able to escape royalties in 2005, \n     when prices spiked to record levels, and would probably \n     escape them this year as well.\n       ``These incentives will help ensure we have a reliable \n     supply of natural gas in the future,'' Ms. Norton proclaimed, \n     predicting that American consumers would save ``an estimated \n     $570 million a year'' in lower fuel prices.\n       Ms. Norton's decision was influenced by the industry. The \n     Interior Department had originally proposed a cut-off price \n     for royalty exemptions of $5 per million British thermal \n     units, or B.T.U.'s, of gas. But the Independent Petroleum \n     Association of America, which represents smaller \n     producers, argued that the new incentive would have little \n     value because natural gas prices were already above $5. \n     Ms. Norton set the threshold at $9.34.\n       Based on administration assumptions about future production \n     and prices, that change could cost the government about $1.9 \n     billion in lost royalties.\n       ``There is no cost rationale,'' said Shirley J. Neff, an \n     economist at Columbia University and Senator Johnston's top \n     legislative aide in drafting the 1995 royalty law. ``It is \n     astounding to me that the administration would so blatantly \n     cave in to the industry's demands.''\n\n\n                        Incentives Keep Growing\n\n       Last April, President Bush himself expressed skepticism \n     about giving new incentives to oil and gas drillers. ``With \n     oil at $50 a barrel,'' Mr. Bush remarked, ``I don't think \n     energy companies need taxpayer-funded incentives to \n     explore.''\n       But on Aug. 8, Mr. Bush signed a sweeping energy bill that \n     contained $2.6 billion in new tax breaks for oil and gas \n     drillers and a modest expansion of the 10-year-old ``royalty \n     relief'' program. For the most part, the law locked in \n     incentives that the Interior Department was already offering \n     for another five years. But it included some embellishments, \n     like an extra break on royalties for companies drilling in \n     the deepest waters.\n       And energy companies, whose executives had long contributed \n     campaign funds to Republican candidates, pushed to block any \n     amendments aimed at diluting the benefits.\n       The push to lock in the royalty inducements came primarily \n     from House Republicans. The only real opposition came from a \n     handful of House Democrats, in a showdown about 1 a.m. on \n     July 25, according to a transcript of the session.\n       ``It is indefensible to be keeping these companies on the \n     government dole when oil and gas prices are so high,'' \n     charged Representative Markey of Massachusetts, who proposed \n     to strip the royalty provisions. ``We might as well be giving \n     tax breaks to Donald Trump and Warren Buffett.''\n       Mr. Barton, the Texas Republican, brushed aside the \n     objections. He reassured lawmakers that the new provisions \n     would not cost taxpayers anything.\n       When Mr. Markey proposed a more modest change--having \n     Congress prohibit incentives if crude oil prices rose above \n     $40 a barrel--Republicans quickly voted him down again.\n       ``The only reason they waited until after midnight to bring \n     up these issues is that they couldn't stand up in the light \n     of day,'' Mr. Markey said in a recent interview. ``They all \n     expected me to give up because it was so late and I didn't \n     have the votes. But if nothing else, I wanted to get these \n     things on the record.''\n\n\n                         A Royalty-Free Future?\n\n       It is still not clear how much impact the reduced royalties \n     had in encouraging deep-\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\n     water drilling. While activity in the Gulf has increased \n     since 1995, prices for oil and gas have more than quadrupled \n     over the same period, providing a powerful motivation, \n     experts say.\n       ``It's hard to make a case for royalty relief, especially \n     at these high prices,'' said Jack Overstreet, owner of an \n     independent oil exploration company in Texas. ``But the oil \n     industry is like the farm lobby and will have its hand out at \n     every opportunity.''\n       The size of the subsidies will soar far higher if oil \n     companies win their newest court battle.\n       In a lawsuit filed March 17, Kerr-McGee Exploration and \n     Production argued that Congress never authorized the \n     government to set price cut-offs for incentives on leases \n     awarded from 1996 through 2000. If the company wins, the \n     Interior Department recently estimated, about three-quarters \n     of oil and gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico will be \n     royalty-free for the next five years.\n       Mr. Markey and other Democrats recently introduced \n     legislation that would pressure companies to pay full \n     royalties when energy prices are high, regardless of what \n     their leases allow.\n       But Republican lawmakers and the Bush administration have \n     signaled their opposition.\n       ``These are binding contracts that the government signed \n     with companies,'' Ms. Norton recently remarked. ``I don't \n     think we can change them just because we don't like them.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Giving Away $7 Billion in Royalties\n\n       November 1995--Deep Water Royalty Relief Act is passed, \n     allowing companies to avoid paying some royalties on oil and \n     gas produced in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico.

The department omits price \n     thresholds that would cut royalty relief if oil and gas \n     prices rose above about $34 a barrel for crude and about $4 \n     per thousand cubic feet of natural gas.\n       2000--Interior realizes the error and quietly adds price \n     thresholds into new leases--but the old leases remain valid.\n       2001--A vice presidential task force issues National Energy \n     Policy recommendations, urging the government to open up more \n     federal lands and waters to oil and gas development to \n     ``explore opportunities for royalty reductions.''\n       March 2003--U.S. District Court in Louisiana knocks down a \n     restriction on the volume of royalty-free oil and gas a \n     company can produce. This effectively doubles or triples the \n     incentives.\n       Jan. 23, 2004--Interior expands royalty incentives for deep \n     gas producers, letting them avoid royalties if price is below \n     $9.34 per million B.T.U.'s--higher than average price to \n     date.

Bush signs energy bill Aug. 8.\n       February 2006--Interior Department budget shows that \n     royalty breaks could cost government more than $7 billion \n     over next five years, even though it expects oil prices to \n     remain above $50 a barrel.\n       March 17, 2006--Kerr-McGee, a large Gulf of Mexico \n     producer, sues the federal government in a test case to \n     receive all deepwater royalty incentives, regardless of how \n     high prices are, for all leases signed from 1996 through \n     2000. If suit is successful, government projections indicate \n     taxpayers could lose more than $28 billion over five years.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. There we have it, folks. In essentially the late 1990s--\n1998-1999--as the distinguished chairman of the committee has pointed \nout, the Clinton administration dropped the ball. No question about it. \nIt was costly to taxpayers.\n  But I have just read a recitation of how the Secretary of the \nInterior compounded the problem and how on her watch the sweetener got \neven sweeter. The price of oil was still shooting up. The price of oil \nhad doubled over the last few years, and she just kept ladling out the \nsugar. It just kept coming.\n  Then, on top of it, we had the energy conference agreement between \nthe House and the Senate. So on top of the problem that we see stemming \nfrom the last administration and then Secretary Norton sweetening the \npot even more, we then had in the energy conference agreement additions \nto the royalty program, additions at a time when clearly they were not \nin the public interest.\n  I think we are close to being able to move ahead in the Senate. I \nwant to have some discussion with the floor manager, the distinguished \nSenator from Washington.\n  But what we have seen in the last few minutes as a result of the \nunanimous consent request propounded by the Senator from Nevada is that \nthis Senate will not be allowed to vote at any time on the granddaddy \nof all of the subsidies. We have tried to work out arrangements to have \na vote that would be fair to both sides. I have propounded a variety of \nrequests through the Chair in an effort to do it. But somehow for some \nreason continuing this outrageous use of taxpayer money seems to be the \nbig priority around here.\n  I am staggered. I can't understand. I cannot understand why the \nSenate would say at a time of record profits, at a time of record \nprices, it would want to continue to dispense record royalty relief.\n  The President of the United States said, to his credit, that we don't \nneed all of these incentives when the price of oil is over $50 a \nbarrel. This program started when the price of oil was $16 a barrel.\n  As the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has indicated, the last \nadministration muffed it when the price of oil was $34 a barrel. But \nSecretary Norton has made it worse. The energy conference agreement \nadds more sugar on top of it. I wish to see the Senate step in and \nprotect the public.\n\n  I see my good friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Oregon, I know he has been on the \nfloor since this morning and I know this issue is of great importance \nto him and the Nation. I want to make sure for those who have been \nfollowing the debate from the beginning that they understand exactly \nthe issue.\n  As I understand it, we are talking about those private companies that \ndrill for oil on lands owned by the people, by the Federal Government, \nand how much money they will receive for drilling oil. I ask the \nSenator from Oregon, if he could, in the simplest terms, to explain to \nme how much is at stake here? How much did the taxpayers pay in these \nroyalty payments to those who are drilling for oil on land that the \npeople, the Federal Government, owns?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his question. We \ntried to get into this something like 5 hours ago. It is very helpful \nto have the Senator from Illinois asking exactly the question he has \nasked.\n  The way this program works is that the oil companies are supposed to \npay royalties to the Federal Government when they extract oil from \nFederal lands. In order to stimulate production when the price of oil \nwas cheap, the Federal Government reduced the amount of royalty \npayments the companies had to make.\n  It is my view and the view of all of the independent experts, \nincluding our former colleague in the House, Congressman Pombo, who \nchairs the Committee on Resources, it is the view of all of these \nexperts across the political spectrum that with the price of oil \nsoaring to over $70 a barrel, the discounted royalty payments amount to \na needless subsidy of billions and billions of dollars. The General \nAccounting Office has estimated that at a minimum it would be $20 \nbillion. There are projections because there is litigation underway.\n  For some oil companies, even this is not enough, so they keep \nlitigating and trying to get more and more and more. There are \nestimates that if the litigation is successful, the Government would \npay $80 billion just in royalty relief. And that $80 billion would pay \na significant fraction of the entire cost of this emergency spending \nbill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, so that \nI understand it, if I own an oil company and I want to drill on \nsomebody else's land, in this case the land of the Federal Government, \nI was required to pay the Federal Government for drilling oil that \nbelonged to somebody else that I was going to sell, and if the price of \noil was so low that it did not justify drilling, they would appeal, the \noil companies would appeal to the Federal Government, saying, we will \npay less for what we are drilling because the price of oil is so low, \nthus this royalty payment for drilling oil on Federal Government land.\n  Now the tables have turned and the price of every barrel of oil \nbrought out of Federal land is worth $70 to $75 and the Senator from \nOregon is arguing why in the world would you give them relief from \ntheir royalty payments\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nwhen they are making so much money on oil that comes out of Federal \nlands that we all own.\n  It would seem to me the Senator's argument is that the oil companies, \nwhich are doing quite well, thank you, are going to experience a \nwindfall if the price of oil goes up and the amount they have to pay to \nthe Federal Government continues to be discounted or lowered. So they \nwant it both ways. They want the consumer to pay more at the pump and \nthey want the taxpayers to receive less for the oil they are taking \nfrom land they do not even own.\n  Am I missing something in this analysis?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator has said it very well. In a climate \nsuch as this, when prices are high, they get to privatize their gains \nand socialize their losses. This makes no sense at all. This is a \nprogram designed for a period when production was down and the price of \noil was very low.\n  What I have tried to do--because I have spent a lot of hours sitting \nnext to the distinguished chairman of our committee, the Energy \nCommittee, who points out, and correctly so, that energy is a volatile \npart of our economy--I made an exception so that if the President of \nthe United States says there is going to be a supply disruption or the \nprice of oil falls back down again, bingo, we are back to looking at \nroyalty relief.\n  The Senator from Illinois puts it very well.\n  To drive home the point, I say to the Senate, particularly the \nSenator from Illinois who did great work on the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, we could have taken care of the needs of the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program plus have money left over for \ndeficit reduction if we were to stop this wasteful expenditure of \ntaxpayer funds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Oregon will yield for a question, \nthrough the Chair, you were suggesting in your amendment we should no \nlonger subsidize the extraction of oil by private companies from \nFederal lands when they are clearly in a very profitable position. We \nshould no longer ask taxpayers to give up royalties which they were \nentitled to because the oil companies frankly are doing well and the \ndiscounted oil was designed for the times when they were doing poorly.\n\n  If I understand what the Senator is saying, the same oil companies \nhave been going to court challenging the Federal Government when it \ncomes to these royalty payments and royalty discounts, so with all the \ntalk about too much litigation, it turns out some of these oil \ncompanies believe litigation is a healthy thing if it protects their \nprofit margins and protects their Federal subsidy.\n  If the Senator from Oregon would be kind enough to explain to me \nexactly what the impact of his amendment would be on this bill and how \nmuch money it could bring back to the Treasury for purposes already \noutlined--whether it is the LIHEAP program or money for education or \nhealth care, whatever it might be, that currently is going to oil \ncompanies that are doing well and experiencing record profits.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator asks a very good question. This is the \ngranddaddy, this is the biggest subsidy the Government gives--to the \noil sector.\n  The General Accounting Office, which did a review of this, indicates \nthat a minimal projection is $20 billion for the cost of the program. \nIf the litigation is successful, it is up to $80 billion.\n  What we have is, at a time when middle-class folks, the people who \nare living paycheck to paycheck and being squeezed as hard as they are, \nat a time when our Government ought to be looking at trying to give \nthem a break, give them a bit of help, what we are seeing is the \nmiddle-class folks have their tax dollars flow into the Federal \nGovernment and go out in terms of royalty relief at a time when the \nprice of oil is vastly above the amount the President has indicated. It \nis for that reason I felt so strongly about this.\n  I also point out this is a program that grew under Secretary Norton. \nAfter the initial mistakes with the previous administration, it was \nadded to by the energy conference legislation between the House and the \nSenate which sweetened the sweetheart deal even more.\n  I am saying this is enough. We do not need record royalty payments on \ntop of record profits and on top of record prices. I have said I will \ndraw the line. I have not done anything like what I have done today in \nthe Senate since I have been here. I have had the pleasure of serving \nwith the distinguished Senator from Illinois for a long time, going \nback to the days when I had a full head of hair and rugged good looks. \nI have never done anything like this. I regret this tremendously. But \nwe have to protect the taxpayers of this country.\n  I am happy to yield if the Senator from Illinois has anything \nfurther.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will ask the Senator, you are asking for an opportunity \nto call your amendment to be voted on up or down, whether this subsidy \nto profitable oil companies will continue or whether the money will \ncome back to the Federal Treasury. Is that your intention in taking the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is exactly what I have been seeking since last night \nwhen I called the distinguished chairman of the committee, and what I \nindicated, contrary to what has been said in the Senate, I am not \nseeking any special treatment. I have not been seeking to be put first \nin the line. What I have been seeking is what I have seen virtually \nevery week since I have been in the Senate.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois is an expert in the rules, \nand it is my understanding that what we customarily do, we debate a \nvariety of amendments, then we cluster them into a group, five, six, \neight--sometimes the number will vary--and at some point the Senate \ngoes on a vote.\n  I offered to the chairman of the committee to be put in the second or \nthird cluster. I don't have to go first if colleagues feel strongly \nabout this, but at some point it seems to me we ought to say the Senate \nis accountable, at a time with record profits and record prices, for a \nprogram that is the biggest of them all. That is the Royalty Relief \nProgram.\n  I am happy to yield further.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask a procedural point for those following this debate.\n  I ask the Senator from Oregon, it is my understanding that what the \nSenator is doing is consistent with the Senate rules which allows a \nSenator to take the floor and offer an amendment. As long as he can \nstand and offer his amendment and speak to it, he controls the floor, \nwhich is what the Senator from Oregon is doing. Many people have seen \nthis depicted in movies and otherwise, but this is the classic element \nof the Senate procedure, that a Senator can insist on his right to have \nan amendment voted on. Clearly there is a disagreement in the Senate. \nUntil that disagreement is resolved, as long as the Senator from Oregon \ncan stand, if I am not mistaken--he can correct me if I am wrong--he is \nasserting his right as a Senator to do so.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Illinois. That is essentially my \ndesire.\n  What we have seen, particularly in the discussion between the \ndistinguished Democratic leader and the chairman of the committee, is \nit is the intent of those who oppose this amendment that they will not \nallow a vote. Not now, not at any point. That is what we have learned \nas a result of the discussion between the distinguished Senator from \nNevada and the distinguished chairman of the committee, for whom I have \na great deal of respect but simply disagree with on this point.\n  We have heard people say, I am asking for special treatment, that I \nwant to go first. That is not the case. I respect the rights of all \nSenators. I offered the last amendment before the Senate adjourned last \nnight which made my amendment pending this morning. I have asked a \nvariety of times now to work something out with Senator Salazar and the \nchairman of the committee, the chairman from Mississippi, and that is \nnot possible, so the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, \ncalled the question. He basically asked, are we ever going to get a \nchance to vote. It is clear we will not.\n  That is very unfortunate. In a few minutes--my friend from Colorado \nhas been here and has been so patient--I will probably take one last \ncrack at seeing if we can protect taxpayers' interests and see if we \ncan work something out to do what the Senate normally does, which is to \ncluster these\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\namendments. If that is not the case, I could talk until I fell over, \nfrankly, but it is clear the folks who are opposed to this do not want \nto vote in any way, shape, or form. They are saying at a time of record \nprofits, at a time of record prices, we ought to keep ladling out this \nmoney. As the Senator from Illinois said, this is on the people's land. \nWe are talking about oil companies extracting oil not from land they \nown but from land that belongs to the people of this country.\n  So a judgment was made in the 1990s, give energy development a break \nfrom the price of oil, when the price of oil is low, when production is \ndown. It made sense then. It boosted production in those critical \ntimes. However, it certainly does not make sense to argue for a program \nwhen the price of oil is over $70 a barrel and you compare that to what \nwe saw when this program originated; the price of oil was $16 a barrel, \na fraction of what people are paying, and production was also down at \nthat time.\n  This comes down to a question of choices. Whose side are you on? Are \nyou on the side of the taxpayer in an instance where the General \nAccounting Office has documented what a rip-off this program has become \nor are you on the side of a handful of special interests that have \nfigured out a way to hotwire this special program that gives them such \ngreat advantages?\n  I wish the case were, as the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Domenici, has indicated, the problems were with the Clinton \nadministration and then the next administration cleaned them up, but as \nI read into the record, the problem got worse. It got worse twice. \nFirst, as a result of the actions by the Secretary of the Interior; \nsecond, as a result of what was done in the energy conference \nagreement.\n  By the way, some of what we heard in the energy conference agreement \nwas just preposterous, not from the Senator from New Mexico, but some \nin the energy conference agreement said: Oh, this oil royalty program \nhas no cost. It doesn't cost anything at all.\n  Now, I do not know how in the world you argue that when the General \nAccounting Office and others have talked about billions and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars flooding out the door. But I think it shows to what \nextraordinary lengths some will go to protect this program, which is \nsuch an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n  My goodness, there are a lot of ways you could use $20 billion to $60 \nbillion. How do you explain you are trying to pay for an emergency \nspending bill when the Government does not have the money to cover the \nemergency spending and yet you are still shoveling out billions and \nbillions of taxpayer dollars, at a time when the President of the \nUnited States, to his credit, has said we do not need these incentives \nwhen the price of oil is over $50 a barrel?\n  So this has been, for this Member of the Senate, a very unique \nexperience. I wish we could get a vote on this amendment. I think this \ndoes a disservice to the taxpayers of this country.\n  I wish to mention what it means in terms of the globe. I, like all \nSenators, see the men and women who honor us every single day by \nwearing the uniform for our country. They put themselves in harm's way. \nThey risk their physical health, their mental health, their well-being, \nand put their families at risk because they honor us every day by \nwearing the uniform of the United States. It seems to me the people who \nwear that uniform and are fighting today on our behalf in Iraq deserve \nan energy policy that is going to make it less likely their kids and \ntheir grandkids are going to be off in the Middle East another time in \nthe next few years in a war with implications for oil. To do that, to \nmake our country's energy secure, we have to stop programs that rip off \nthe taxpayers like this Royalty Relief Program.\n  Now that I see Senator Domenici here, I say to the chairman, I have \ntried to indicate in the course of the day that, frankly, one of the \nbest things we have been talking about over the last few years comes \nfrom a Senator from your side of the aisle, Mr. Thomas. Senator Thomas \nmakes the important point that we are probably losing something like a \nthird of all the oil from existing wells, and we don't have incentives \nto go and do that drilling from existing wells.\n  I have been supporting Senator Thomas because I think it is good for \nproduction, and I think it is good for the environment, especially \nright now, because what we have learned in terms of environmental \nprotection is that you can get more out of existing wells, capturing \nthe gases, what is called sequestration, in order to protect the \nenvironment.\n  So I want it understood by colleagues: One, I want to work in a \nbipartisan way; two, I think that arguably what Senator Thomas has \ntalked about is one of the best new ideas to get a fresh energy policy \nthat is red, white, and blue. But I do not see how you are going to get \nincentives for the kind of constructive thing Senator Thomas has been \ntalking about if you are shoveling money out the door for wasteful \nprograms like royalty relief.\n  So I see the Senator from New Mexico is on his feet. I say to the \nchairman, the distinguished Senator from Colorado had asked I recognize \nhim first. But let us structure this so the Senator from Colorado can \nask his question, and then we will structure this so we can hear from \nthe chairman of the committee.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nyielding a minute for a question. I would hope if we are getting to an \nend of this discussion, which has been on the floor now for the last 4 \nhours, we can move forward in some orderly fashion with respect to the \nconsideration of other amendments here on this Thursday before I know \npeople have to leave.\n  So it would be my request to the chairman of the committee that we \ntry to come up with some arrangement that will allow those Senators who \nhave been waiting in the wings to come forward and offer amendments, in \nan orderly process to come forward and offer those amendments in the \nnext few hours.\n  I would ask a question of the chairman----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nwant to give up the floor quite yet. I think the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado, through the Chair, has to ask me the question.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Through the Chair, I ask permission to ask a question of \nmy colleague from Oregon.\n  Assuming that in a few minutes or a few hours you give up the floor, \nwhich you currently now claim to make the very passionate argument you \nhave been making for the last 4 hours, would it be----\n  Mr. WYDEN. Five hours.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. For the last 5 hours, as you have tried to get a vote on \nthis amendment you have offered, would it be in order, then, for us as \na Senate to come to some kind of an agreement on how we move forward \nwith the orderly processing of additional amendments that go beyond the \namendment you are offering now?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The distinguished Senator from Colorado has not actually \npropounded a unanimous consent request, but it is very much my interest \nin accommodating the Senator from Colorado.\n  I think, frankly, colleagues, to repeat, for those who are just \ncoming in, after the discussion between Senator Reid and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and the objection that was made by the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, it is evident that it will not be allowed \nthat there be an up-or-down vote on the granddaddy of all of the \nsubsidy programs for the oil industry.\n  This is the big one. This is the one that counts. And the Senate will \nnot, as a result of the discussion between the Senator from Nevada and \nthe Senator from Mississippi, be allowing a vote on it. I believe that \nis a bad deal. It is a bad deal for taxpayers. It is a bad deal for our \ncountry. I do not believe that is the way the Senate ought to be doing \nbusiness. But that is the judgment of the Senate. I respect the \njudgment of the Senate.\n  And let us now----\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, may I ask my colleague from Oregon to \nyield a minute of time to me while maintaining his right to the floor?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I certainly want to do that as part of our consent \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nI think we are winding down to a close. The Senator from New Mexico is \nno longer standing, but if he desires to ask a question, I want to give \nhim the opportunity to do it.\n\n  Does the Senator from Colorado seek to ask a question?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I seek to ask a question and to make a unanimous consent \nrequest that following the conclusion of your presentation here that we \nmove forward to the consideration of an amendment I will send to the \ndesk, and to establish also that Senator Conrad from North Dakota be \ngiven the opportunity to send an amendment to the desk and to speak on \nit, as well as I believe there are Senators on the chairman's side who \nwould also like to offer an amendment, including Senator Coburn. So \nhopefully we could come up with some kind of arrangement that allows us \nto move forward in an orderly fashion that can then assure that several \nother amendments can be considered yet this afternoon.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon still has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I am very interested in getting on with this. I do want to show \ndeference to my good friend, the chair of the full committee, Senator \nDomenici. So what I would like to do next, before we try to finally \nwork this out, is to, again, consistent with the unanimous consent \nagreement--if the chair of our full Energy Committee, on which I am \nproud to serve, would like to be recognized for a question, I would be \nhappy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I say to the Senator, I have no \nquestion at this point. I thought the Senator was getting close to a \npoint where he was going to withdraw his amendment, after which time I \nwas going to speak. If that is not the case, then we will do something \nelse.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reclaiming my time, so the Senate is clear, I have \nabsolutely no intention of withdrawing my amendment. But it is evident, \nas a result of the discussion between Senator Reid and Senator Cochran, \nthat there is no inclination or willingness on the part of some in the \nSenate for us to do what we customarily do, which is to take up these \namendments, Senators talk about them, and after a number of them are \ntalked about, we cluster the votes, we inform Senators of both \npolitical parties, and the Senate is held accountable.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Virginia here, Mr. Warner, who, \nagain, has seen many more instances of the Senate trying to work its \nwill than I. But I would only say, in the time I have been here, \nvirtually every week the Senate does what I have been seeking, which is \nthat Senators discuss their amendments, they are then clustered, and at \nsome point the Senate has a vote.\n  I have made it clear I am not interested in being first in line. I am \nnot interested or committed to being part of even the first cluster of \nvotes. That is not asking for special treatment. That is asking that \nthe Senate do what it has done again and again and again. It is the \ncustom of the Senate but apparently will not be the practice that is \nfollowed with respect to this sweetheart deal that wastes billions of \ntaxpayer dollars at a crucial time in our country's history.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, while you have been here many \nhours, I have been here a few this afternoon. This is a very unusual \nsetting. You speak of your rights. We have rights, too. You have the \nfloor. We cannot debate the issue the way things are. If you would like \nto debate this, I would like to debate it because you have had some \nfree time here to talk about something that is not so.\n  I have already asked you once, and I will ask you again--I will ask \nyou whether or not--I will ask it a different way: How much do you \nthink the Congressional Budget Office says your amendment--this great \namendment that is going to stop all of this thievery--can you tell us \nhow much it is going to yield to the taxpayers of the United States? I \nwill tell you the answer. The Congressional Budget Office says zero.\n  You understand, this great amendment that has been spoken of, this \nprocess that he has--I don't know what it is. It is an amendment that \nsets a threshold. It sets a threshold that is higher than the threshold \nthat exists that was already established by the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  I don't know how in the world, I ask the distinguished Senator, that \nis going to yield anything to the people of this country. Maybe you can \nexplain it to us. I believe it is going to yield zero because the \namendment is meaningless the way it is drawn. It is not a program. It \nis not a process. It is an amendment that sets a new threshold, I say \nto Senator Salazar, a threshold that is not even needed because the \nSecretary has already set a threshold that does more for the taxpayer \nthan his amendment.\n  So I don't know what we are down here arguing about. I have been \nwaiting my turn until I cannot wait any longer.\n  So I have just violated the rules. I didn't ask a question, I gave a \nspeech. I hope you listened. The speech is: The Congressional Budget \nOffice says this grandiose amendment that is going to stop the \ngrandfather of all thievery is going to yield zero dollars to the \nTreasury of the United States. I assume that means that it is not \neffective, it does nothing. It does nothing because--I just told you \nwhy it does nothing. It sets a threshold that is higher than the \nexisting threshold; therefore, it yields nothing. I don't know what \nelse we can do. Why should we let you have a vote on that? I am going \nto offer an amendment to that, a second-degree amendment that is very \nsimple. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to offer a second-\ndegree amendment.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I withdraw the request and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I would like to respond briefly to the \nSenator from New Mexico, who I thought was going to ask a question. I \nsee he is leaving the floor, but I would first say that if the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico thinks what I am proposing is \nmeaningless, I can't figure out why so many people have spent so much \ntime and so much effort trying to avoid a vote on it. I don't get that. \nIf this is so meaningless and so useless, it would seem to me we could \nhave disposed of it about 10:15 in the morning.\n  It is clear that the reason there has been all this opposition to the \namendment is because it really does address a key kind of question, and \nthat is saving taxpayers money. If it were meaningless, we could have \ngone to a vote hours and hours ago. The people who have pushed the \nhardest for this program have always tried to do it in the shadows. \nThis program was expanded after midnight in the energy conference \ncommittee. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico has left the \nfloor, which is unfortunate because I would like to engage him in a \ndialog.\n  All that I have sought, as demonstrated through Senator Reid, is an \nopportunity to vote on this issue.\n  To once again deal with the key point the Senator from New Mexico has \nmade, nothing in this amendment says the threshold couldn't be lower \nfor dispensing this money. It simply says we should set an upper level \nthat reflects what the President of the United States has said. If this \namendment is as meaningless as the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico has said, let's go to a vote. Let's vote on it and save \ntaxpayers money.\n  The General Accounting Office says this program is going to cost a \nminimum of $20 billion. If the litigation is successful, it will be $80 \nbillion. While I have great respect for the Senator from New Mexico, \nhis argument that all of this never costs or saves anything is what we \nhave been hearing for years. We were told in the energy conference \nagreement between the House and the Senate that this program costs \ntaxpayers nothing. Backers of this program in the debate between the \nHouse and the Senate said with a straight face that royalty relief \ncosts taxpayers nothing. Now we have heard an argument that an effort \nto rein in the cost of this program is meaningless as well. I guess \nbecause, once again, we are\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nhearing that none of this costs money. It doesn't save any money. I \nguess this program just happens by osmosis.\n  That is not what the General Accounting Office says. If the \nlitigation involving this Royalty Relief Program is successful and \ntaxpayers are out $80 billion, the people of this country are going to \nremember this day. They are going to say that the Senate had a chance \non a bipartisan basis to do something sensible, and that is to \nreconfigure this program to ensure that there is royalty relief when it \nis needed. The legislation says the President can run the Royalty \nRelief Program if there is any evidence that it would disrupt supply. \nThe amendment says that if the price goes down, of course, the original \nrationale for this program, royalty relief could be paid.\n  This amendment puts in place the kinds of safeguards we need for a \nchanging environment in the energy field. What it doesn't do is \ncontinue to write blank checks to a handful of special interests who \neven the author of the program has now described as getting something \nand being part of a program that was different than what he intended. \nThis is not somebody who is hostile to the program; this is somebody \nwho wrote the law and said this is not what was intended.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada for coming to the floor earlier and trying to get the \nopportunity for a vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Oregon has clearly \nestablished that he will not get a vote on this most important \namendment. I am disappointed. There are many disappointed Senators. I \nam sure there are millions of disappointed Americans. There are a \nnumber of Senators here who wish to offer amendments. For lack of a \nbetter way of describing this, I reflect back on a time when I was \ndoing something similar to the Senator from Oregon, and Senator Byrd \nwas the leader of the Democrats at the time.\n  He said to me: Would the Senator yield? And I said yes. He said: How \nmuch longer are you going to talk? So I reflect back on those days. I \ntold him I had a goal that I wanted to make. He said: Fine. Shortly \nthereafter, we went on to other matters.\n  I am wondering, because we have other Senators on both sides of the \naisle to either offer amendments or do some voting, does the Senator \nhave an idea how much longer he has a right to maintain the floor?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator's question, particularly in \ndeference to colleagues on both sides of the aisle and all the help the \ndistinguished leader has given me throughout. I would say that I would \nstay here all night. I would stay here until they literally had to take \nme off the floor because I couldn't stay here any longer to save \ntaxpayers billions and billions of dollars on what amounts to the \nbiggest giveaway to the oil industry. This is the one which really \ncounts. Various other programs are a small fraction of the cost of it. \nI would stay here for as long as it took, if I thought the other side \nwas willing at any point in any kind of fashion to allow an up-or-down \nvote on whether we are going to be on the side of the taxpayers or \nwhether we are going to continue to side with the oil companies and \nprotect a program which all the independent auditors say is a great \nwaste of money.\n  But what we have seen over the course of the last 5\\1/2\\ hours is \nthat the Senate is not going to be able on this issue to operate the \nway it customarily does, where you have amendments debated and \ndiscussed and then they are clustered for a vote. As summed up by the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, they think something like this, \nonce again, doesn't cost anything, when everybody who has looked at it \nindependently says it is a huge drain of taxpayer money. I want to \nprotect the middle-class folks and the folks who are hurting, whose \ntaxpayer money flows in to Government and then flows out for this \nprogram at a time when the President of the United States has said the \nsubsidy is not needed.\n\n  I would stay here all through the night if I thought the opponents \nwere ever going to allow a vote. It is clear they are not.\n  We are going to come back to fight this another day, just as in the \nconference agreement, where those special interests sweetened the pot.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Oregon--an athlete, went to college \non a basketball scholarship, certainly he has the stamina to stand as \nlong as necessary--that the point has been made. I, therefore, ask at \nthe end of his speaking for another 3 minutes that we go into a quorum \ncall and when the quorum call is called off, Senator Cochran then would \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object, and it is not my desire to \nobject, I think the point has been made. This is a sad day for the \ntaxpayers of this country. When folks pull in to the gas station \ntonight and in the days ahead and they pay these record prices and they \nsee these record profits, I hope they may have heard a little bit of \nthe discussion here today, that while they are getting clobbered at the \npump, the taxpayers are spending needlessly billions and billions of \ndollars, billions of dollars that are being wasted, not by my \ndetermination but by independent auditors. I wish that today we could \nhave done right by all those middle-class folks and our citizens who \npull up to the gas station. This is the big one, folks, in terms of \nenergy subsidies. This is the one with the most money. This is the one \nthere is no logical case for when oil is $70 a barrel. I am going to be \nback making this fight again and again, if the people of Oregon are \nwilling.\n  Madam President, in deference to my colleagues who have been \nextraordinarily patient in the course of the day, while I do not \nwithdraw my amendment, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair rule on the unanimous consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator restate the request?\n  Mr. REID. That we go into a 5-minute quorum call, after which Senator \nCochran would be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can seek consent for the Senator \nto be recognized after the quorum call has been called off. He cannot \nlimit the length of the quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that after the quorum call is \nterminated, Senator Cochran be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The order was to recognize the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate the fact that we are now \nprepared, I assume, to proceed with consideration of other amendments \non the emergency supplemental bill, H.R. 4939. For the information of \nSenators who would like to know what the status is, we have over 20 \namendments that have been filed and are pending before the Senate. A \nnumber of those have been offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn, who divided amendment No. 3641 into 19 divisions. As I \nunderstand the parliamentary situation, each one of these divisions is \nconsidered under our procedures as a separate amendment and a separate \nvote could occur on each.\n  I am further advised that the Senator from Oklahoma would like to \ncall up some of these amendments and have them debated and disposed of.\n  There are other amendments. For example, last night there were four \nfiled by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, which remain pending. \nThe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, likewise has four amendments \npending. Senator Warner of Virginia has two amendments pending. The \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has an amendment that is pending. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, has an amendment. The Senator \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Wyden, has debated and discussed his amendment at \nlength today. These are amendments which are already pending. It is my \nhope that we can dispose of some of those amendments before proceeding \nto consider\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nother amendments. That is my suggestion for an orderly procedure that \nthe Senate should follow.\n  I know the Senator from Colorado has been on the floor from time to \ntime today indicating that he has an amendment he would like to offer. \nI don't want to stand in the way of his offering that amendment, but I \nsay this to the Senate just to give everyone equal information and \nknowledge of the status of the bill. We need to proceed to get these \namendments disposed of--agreed to or defeated or amended and agreed to \nor whatever is the pleasure of the Senate. I don't intend to try to \nlimit Senators in how long they can speak, but I hope we will not abuse \nthe rules of the Senate to make arguments that prolong the debate on \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. That is the subject before the \nSenate. I hope we can stick to the subject.\n  Having said that, I am happy to yield the floor, and we will be glad \nto work with other Senators to either work out agreements on \namendments, have votes on amendments, vote to table amendments, or \nwhatever the pleasure of the Senate may be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending business be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \nbeen on the floor for 4 hours today. I filed amendments, brought them \nup before anybody else brought an amendment up here, other than four \nprior ones that I brought up.\n  I don't want to stop anybody from offering amendments, but the way we \nclear them is to debate the ones already on line. Those of us who have \namendments that have been out and offered, I suggest that the regular \norder ought to go forward, and as we finish those--nobody is planning \non cutting that off or trying to limit anybody. With that, I believe \nthe proper thing for us to do would be to go to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I, \nlikewise, have been in this Chamber for many hours just like the \nSenator, waiting to get back to the regular order and to allow \namendments to come forward and to debate those amendments. I don't \nintend to speak long in offering my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may offer my amendment, speak on it \nfor no more than 5 minutes, and then following my presentation, the \nSenator from Oklahoma be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3645\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3645.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3645.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for critical hazardous fuels and forest \n health projects to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires and mitigate \n             the effects of widespread insect infestations)\n\n       On page 246, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n               HAZARDOUS FUELS AND FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS\n\n       Sec. ____. In addition to any other funds made available by \n     this Act, there is appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, \n     Wildland Fire Management, $30,000,000 for hazardous fuels and \n     forest health projects focused on reducing the risk of \n     catastrophic fires and mitigating the effects of widespread \n     insect infestations: Provided, That the amount provided under \n     this heading is designated as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today to offer a very \nstraightforward amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill before us. I offer this amendment because we in the United States, \nespecially in the western part of the country, are looking at a great \nfire disaster emergency that requires this Senate in a last chance to \naddress the issue and do something about the fires that will rage \nacross the West in the summer. The emergency is created by the extreme \nthreat of wildfires as a result of the great droughts we have had as \nwell as widespread insect infestations that make massive fires a \nreality across the West. I am pleased to be joined in this amendment by \nSenator Max Baucus.\n  In the West, the seasonal wildfire potential outlook map shows above-\nnormal fire danger in the Western United States. Arizona, New Mexico, \nColorado, Utah, Nevada, and Idaho have increased fire dangers to \ncontend with, as well as the State of Montana. The outlook also shows \nTexas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida to have \nincreased fire risks. While the Southeast United States may not have as \nmuch Forest Service land as the West, that region has its hands full \ncleaning up from the hurricanes. I support the supplemental bill for \nthat purpose, as well as to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand other places.\n  At the same time, many western forests are facing a force that is \nleaving thousands upon thousands of acres of our forests subject to \nfire in local community after local community. It is something I \nbelieve the Senate must act on now that we have the opportunity. \nMontana and northern Idaho, for example, are experiencing the largest \nmountain pine beetle infestation in 20 years, with nearly 1.1 million \nacres infested in 2005, compared to 675,000 in 2004. The State of \nWashington is reporting a mountain pine beetle epidemic, and 554,000 \nacres are now infected, which is a 28-percent increase from the \nprevious year. Meanwhile, my State of Colorado has over 1.5 million \nacres that have been infested by bark beetles. After these infestations \ncome through a forest, they leave behind entire stands of trees--\nsometimes thousands of acres--that are more susceptible to fire due to \nthe dried-out conditions and increased fuel loads in those forests.\n  I believe we must consider this situation from the point of view of \nour rural communities throughout the West. Many of these communities \nare surrounded by already dry forests. These communities are now \ncontending with insect infestations that are further increasing the \nfire danger. When you combine these factors, I believe the local \ncommunities are very right to be alarmed and concerned that the \ningredients are here for catastrophic fires in the coming fire season.\n  Just this week, an article in USA Today noted that Federal \nforecasters predict the wildfire potential this spring and summer is \n``significantly higher than normal'' and that the areas at risk, from \nAlaska to the east coast, ``are so far-flung that the Federal \nGovernment's more than 20,000 firefighters and fleets of ground and air \nsupport could be spread thin if fire danger lingers long in any area.''\n  The Forest Service annually conducts hazardous fuels and forest \nhealth projects. However, the funding available to the Forest Service \nis not living up to the commitments made by Congress in the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act. Healthy Forests authorizes $760 million a year \nfor hazardous fuels projects, and Congress has appropriated less than \n$500 million of those funds per year. The funding is simply not keeping \nup with the increasing needs that today have been estimated at over $1 \nbillion per year.\n  My amendment will provide the U.S. Forest Service with an additional \n$30 million to conduct critical hazardous fuels and forest health \nprojects to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires and to mitigate the \neffects of widespread insect infestations.\n  Private land owners and local governments are doing all they can to \ncombat this problem. They are using chainsaws to protect their homes, \nthey are spraying trees, and they are devising protection plans. They \nwonder, however, if they are not alone in this fight. They wonder if \nthe Federal Government is asleep at the wheel in the face of this \npotential disaster.\n  This year, we know, could be worse than other years in the West. We \nmust provide emergency funding so that the Forest Service can conduct \nhazardous fuels and forest health projects that are already approved \nand are sitting on the shelf.\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\n  I agree with many colleagues who have raised legitimate concerns \nabout adding spending to this bill that is not really intended to \naddress an emergency situation. But that is not the case with this \namendment. This amendment addresses a real imminent threat, and the \nsituation is urgent. We must take action now. I am reminded by the \nreports of spring fires in Colorado, where we have seen 13 firefighters \nkilled in a fire at Storm King, 135,000 acres of land burned in what \nwas called the Hayman Fire, which consumed a large part of four \ncounties of the State of Colorado.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain and Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin be added as cosponsors to the fallen hero amendment, \nwhich I have offered. It is No. 3643.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman be added as a cosponsor to my amendment on improvised \nexplosive device training. It is No. 3644.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, my colleague from Oklahoma is seeking \nrecognition. I appreciate his courtesy, and I look forward to his \ndebate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3641, Division II\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask that division II of my amendment \nNo. 3641 be in order at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to ask for the regular \norder with respect to his amendment. Division II is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I thank the chairman for protecting my \nright to be back on the floor in regular order. But I want to go \nthrough again with the American people what is supposed to be an \nemergency bill by our own rules: It is a bill that is necessary, \nessential, and vital; sudden, quickly coming into being, not building \nup over time; it is an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \nimmediate action; it is unforeseen, unpredictable, unanticipated, and \nnot permanent but temporary only in nature.\n  This second division of my amendment is an amendment that removes $15 \nmillion. It is simple. In this bill is $15 million for the promotion of \nseafood. Seafood consumption in this country is at an all-time high. If \nyou look around the country, look on television, look at magazines--the \nbeef producers do this, but they get no Federal money. The pork \nproducers do this, but they get no Federal money. The poultry producers \ndo this, but they get no Federal money. The milk producers do this, but \nthey get no Federal money in terms of their promotion. They pay \nindividually to have a promotional sequence. As a matter of fact, there \nis a Louisiana Seafood already in existence.\n  So what we are going to do is take and give $15 million to a private \nentity of the seafood producers to spend to increase demand for \nseafood. That may be all right, but that is certainly not an emergency. \nIt is certainly not something that should be in an emergency bill that \nisn't going to be paid for by us but by our children and grandchildren.\n  I am not objecting to the fact that we want to try to increase the \ndemand for seafood, but if you look at the facts, the real problem our \nfisheries are having, especially with shrimp and those kinds of things, \nis with foreign competition. As you look at the problems associated \nwith it, there are more in terms of competition than there are in terms \nof lack of supply.\n  This is real simple. Why should we be subsidizing for one industry \nwhat we don't subsidize for any other industry? The National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration is where this money is going to go. \nThere is nothing in the bill to tell them what to do with it. According \nto them, ``We have no plans for how to spend this money.'' That is what \nNOAA said. They have no plans. It is not in the report language or in \nthe bill. So what will happen is the committee will tell them how to \nspend the money. We won't know how it is; it is not published now. If \nwe don't make a decision, we are not going to know.\n  Is there going to be oversight? Is somebody going to take a million-\ndollar salary out of this $15 million? We don't know. We don't have a \nmechanism in place to manage it. That is the problem. If this had come \nthrough an authorizing committee, studied by our peers, and they said \nthis is something in the long-term best interests of our country, then \nI probably would not be raising this issue. But I don't think that is \nwhat has happened here.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator yielding. My \nfellow Senator from Oklahoma has done a yeoman's job of trying to \nremind people that this is supposed to be an emergency supplemental. In \nevery case about which he has spoken, there is nothing emergency about \nthem.\n  I appreciate the fact that he talks about going through the \nauthorization process. We have a process that has been working for some \ntime that has a lot of checks and balances. I happen to chair the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We go through authorization and \nthe appropriators come along.\n  I applaud him for reminding people what is an emergency and what is \nnot. Let me remind my fellow Senators that we have a President of the \nUnited States who agrees with the Senator from Oklahoma. The President \nhas said he is going to veto this bill on the items that are not \nemergencies and have nothing to do with national security, defense, or \nwith the emergency Katrina. We already have enough signatures on a \nletter saying we will sustain that veto. So we are going to end up \ndoing this.\n  I think a lot of this is an exercise in futility. People cannot \nresist the opportunity to come forward where they can be seen offering \nmore and more of the taxpayers' money for something that is not an \nemergency. I only wanted to say I applaud him for doing this. I think \nhe is being overworked. Hopefully, we will have this solution with the \nPresident's veto. We should not be in a position where we are having to \ndo that.\n  I applaud the Senator for what he is doing. That is my question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, reclaiming my time, the other point I \nwish to make is the proponents say this is to create a new niche market \nto reestablish the shrimp sales of the gulf coast. I want to help the \ngulf coast. I want to help them recover, but I want to do it in a way \nthat builds a long-term, satisfactory, strong fishing industry down \nthere.\n  We are at an all-time high in the consumption of seafood. Where our \nshrimp industry has been hurt is through globalization. The fact is, \nthe real damage done to that industry, besides what has happened as a \nresult of the hurricane, is they are getting beat in the world market.\n  I ask the Members of this body to think: Do we want to start this, \nand should we be doing it when cattle prices are down and producing \nmore beef? Should we do it for the beef producers? Should we do it for \nthe chicken farmers? In other words, should they not participate in \npaying for this rather than everybody else in America paying for it?\n  I would portend this is something that is not what we should be doing \nand it is not just about not wanting to help those people. I want to \nhelp them, but I don't believe this is the way to do it. This is a \nsmall amount of money in this $104 billion-plus bill, but it is a \nprinciple as we walk down the line: how do we say no to all these other \nagricultural interests when we have said yes to one.\n  I am very worried with the wording in the report language that \nrequires the committee to run this rather than requires the bureaucracy \nto run it when there is no instruction for the bureaucracy, which means \nit is not going to have sunshine and it is not going to have oversight. \nI think that is part of our problems with spending as well.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama is here. I will be happy \nto yield time to him for debate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today we continue to debate the provisions \nof H.R. 4939, the bill providing additional 2006 supplemental \nappropriations for\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nthe war in Iraq and recovery from Hurricane Katrina.\n  Other supplemental appropriations bills have been previously signed \ninto law dealing with the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, but none \nof those bills directly support the needs of the devastated fishing \nindustry in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The Senate's funding recommendations affecting the gulf coast fishing \nindustry were developed by the States Fisheries Commission and the Gulf \nof Mexico Fishery Management Council to meet local needs in cooperation \nwith Federal partners, including NOAA's National Marine Fisheries \nService.\n  The Gulf of Mexico is home to a significant share of the U.S. fishing \nindustry, representing almost 20 percent of commercial landings and \nroughly 30 percent of saltwater recreational fishing trips. The 2005 \nhurricane season had a major impact on both of these maritime sectors, \nbut it also devastated their shore-based infrastructure, ports, and \nfacilities that commercial harvesters and fishermen rely on, such as \ndocks, wharves, processing plants, distribution centers, and marinas.\n  Offshore, the hurricanes annihilated entire oyster beds along the \ngulf coast which has an immediate and long-term impact to the oyster \nharvesting industry. Considering that it will take years for many of \nthe oyster beds to rebound, the current economic impacts are only part \nof the assessment.\n\n  Throughout the gulf coast, over 2,300 vessels were federally \npermitted for shrimping. The Presiding Officer, coming from Alaska, \nknows a lot about fishing boats. The exact number of shrimp vessels \ndamaged or destroyed by the 2005 hurricanes is still largely unknown. \nHowever, one only needs to visit coastal communities such as Bayou La \nBatre, Gulfport-Biloxi, and Empire-Venice to see the overwhelming \neffects these hurricanes had on the entire fishing-based communities \nalong the gulf coast. With their boats gone and shoreside facilities \ndestroyed, many businesses are having to rebuild literally from the \nground up.\n  It is logical to presume that the damage from last year's hurricanes, \ncoupled with the rise of diesel fuel costs, could result in the \nincrease in the percentage of fishermen filing for bankruptcy. This \nbill will stabilize the number of vessels in the fishery and rebuild \nfishing facilities, allowing fishermen the opportunity to harvest a \ngreater proportion of the annual fish crop and increase their economic \nreturns.\n  Finally, I want to touch on the funding that has been included in \nthis bill for seafood marketing efforts because it has been the target \nof much criticism on the floor. I believe this funding is extremely \nimportant to the overall effort to restore this industry. We cannot \ndeny the fact that many consumers became increasingly wary of gulf \ncoast seafood following Hurricane Katrina. That is natural. To that \nend, I believe it is imperative that we restore consumer confidence. \nAll the work that has been done and all that we propose to do with the \nadditional spending in this bill will be wasted if no one purchases the \nseafood that comes from the gulf. Therefore, marketing efforts to \nreassure consumers that the seafood is safe are not wasteful but, \nrather, essential to the efforts to restore this industry.\n  The 2006 supplemental appropriations bill, as reported by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, contains significant funding to address many \nneeds of the devastated fishing industry in the gulf coast. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support the bill as reported and oppose any amendments \nthat might propose to strike funding provided for fisheries assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong support of the \nfisheries and seafood provisions in this supplemental appropriations \nbill to help a very important industry simply begin to get back on its \nfeet on the gulf coast. This is a vitally important industry, not just \nfor the gulf coast but for all of America.\n  I am very proud of Louisiana and our coastline and our fisheries. We \nare the largest producer of fisheries in the lower 48 States, second \nonly in the country to the home State, of course, of the Presiding \nOfficer. So it is a true national priority in terms of the service and \nthe food we yield to the country.\n  With two hurricanes, our nationally important fisheries sustained \nhuge damage. Individual fishermen and their families sustained huge \ndamage. Vessels, equipment, offloading and processing facilities, and \noyster farms will take years to recover. Because of this damage of \ntruly historic proportions, the administration, through the Department \nof Commerce, made a disaster declaration, which is appropriate under \nthe law, for fisheries specifically. However, for the first time in \nhistory, they did not follow up that disaster declaration with a \nrequest for certain emergency funding to meet that disaster.\n  The work of the full committee in the Senate, led by Senator Cochran, \nfills that gap by producing an important section of this bill devoted \nfor fisheries. I personally thank Senator Cochran for filling that gap \nbecause, again, it is a very real gap.\n  We had a disaster declaration, the highest ever in terms of fisheries \nlosses and devastation in the United States, but we had no \ncorresponding funding request from the administration in light of that \ndisaster emergency declaration. This section of the bill, again, is \nenormously important to meet those needs.\n  I want to turn specifically to the seafood marketing section which \nhas been a particular target of several Members, led by Senator Coburn, \nand they have brought up some very good points.\n  First, I begin by complimenting Senator Coburn on his work on many \nfiscal reform matters. I applaud it. I not only applaud it, because \ntalk is cheap, I support it in the vast majority of cases. Earmark \nreform, for instance, is something we desperately need in Congress, and \nI strongly supported those efforts a few weeks ago when they were \nbefore us, and I continue to strongly support those efforts.\n  I have no problem with the light of day being shone on all of these \nissues and our having to justify all specific spending items. So I \ncompliment him on his work in general.\n  But it is in that spirit that I stand to proudly defend this seafood \nmarketing issue and to completely rebut some notion that it has nothing \nto do with the hurricanes and nothing to do with an emergency \nsituation.\n  Really, what the argument comes down to is two words, two words that \nwe heard on television over and over again for weeks after the storm. \nAnd the two words are ``toxic soup.''\n  I have to tell my colleagues that the media coverage after the storm \nreally frustrated me. I grew up in New Orleans, LA. I was there in \nLouisiana. Obviously, I represent Louisiana now in the Senate. I was \nliving through the devastation and the challenges, and we had a lot of \ndevastation, we had a lot of challenges, we had a lot of screw-ups by \nall levels of government, certainly including State and local.\n  But the media coverage got a few things wrong, too. One of the things \nthey got very wrong was the constant, unrelenting for weeks repetition \nof this term ``toxic soup.'' To listen to the national media and the \nway they portrayed the situation, all of the city of New Orleans was \ncovered with toxins that would leave it virtually uninhabitable for \ndecades to come, and because of the toppling of rigs and other \nlocalized events which did occur in the gulf, there was a toxic soup \nspreading throughout many areas of the gulf and coastal Louisiana.\n  There were serious and real environmental issues. There were many \nenvironmental issues, dozens, hundreds of localized events, but they \nwere addressed as quickly and completely as possible by the good \nnational servants of the Coast Guard and many other agencies. Although \nthese events were real and serious, they did not create, they did not \namount to this toxic soup we heard about over and over through the \nnational media.\n  Again, the impression that was clearly left over and over was that \nall of New Orleans and much of the gulf and much of the gulf coast \nwhere fisheries were harvested was a toxic soup with life-threatening \ntoxins that would be in the area and seep into the water and seep into \nthe ground and be factors for literally decades to come.\n  When we have that sort of national media coverage 24 hours a day, \ndwelling on this theme over and over for\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nweeks, one can begin to imagine what it might do to the gulf coast \nseafood industry. It killed it. What Katrina and Rita hadn't \ndevastated, that media coverage absolutely did. And that is why an \ninformational campaign addressing, among other issues, that ``toxic \nsoup'' claim and the fact that it is just pure fiction, has no basis in \nscience, is very necessary for the immediate health of this industry, \nand is directly related to the emergency situation stemming from the \nhurricanes.\n\n  I want to compliment several agencies such as NOAA that have done \nimportant environmental testing and other work since the hurricanes and \nwhich certified that after thousands of tests and sampling of water and \nseafood from the Gulf of Mexico, that the seafood is absolutely safe to \neat. The States of Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana, along with \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, EPA, NOAA and others, have again \nanalyzed hundreds of samples of fish and shellfish from the waters. All \nof this testing across the board also proves that there is no broad-\nbased toxic soup; there is absolutely no danger in terms of that \nseafood from the gulf.\n  But as many thousands of these tests have been performed, guess what. \nHardly a single U.S. consumer has heard about it. Hardly a single U.S. \nconsumer knows about it. So in terms of the viability of the industry, \nit really doesn't matter, all of these tests being done, because it is \nnot common knowledge, and the word has not gotten out. That is the \nbiggest reason we absolutely need this informational campaign, this \npromotional campaign, again, that is directly related to the emergency \nsituation produced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  I would welcome Senator Coburn to put back up on his easel the \ndefinition of emergency, the definition that we are supposed to be \nfollowing for true emergency measures. That definition applies here \nbecause of the phenomenon I am talking about. That definition is \nabsolutely applicable here because we have an emergency situation for \nthe immediate future of our gulf coast fisheries industry, again, that \nwere devastated by the hurricanes, and much of the fisheries section of \nthis bill goes to that, trying to get processing plants and boats and \ndocks and essential equipment back and repaired, back up and running, \nand that is important. But just as important is the enormous harm that \nwas caused after the storm by very flawed national media coverage and a \nlot of misinformation summarized by those two words, ``toxic soup.'' \nThat is why this informational campaign, this promotional campaign is \nan emergency situation and is directly related to the hurricanes and \nabsolutely meets every one of the definitions Senator Coburn rightly \nsays we must be guided by.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will close. But in doing so, I urge all \nof my colleagues to please support the very important fishery \nprovisions in the bill. They are emergency measures. They are all \ndirectly related to the hurricanes, including the promotional campaign.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3626, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I quickly would like to address a small bit of \nhousekeeping, which is to ask unanimous consent to modify language to \nan amendment I already have at the desk, No. 3626, to take care of a \ntechnical matter, and the new language will be delivered to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 166, line 12, insert before the colon the \n     following: ``, and may be equal to not more than 50 percent \n     of the annual operating budget of the local government in any \n     case in which that local government has suffered a loss of 25 \n     percent or more in tax revenues due to Hurricane Katrina or \n     Hurricane Rita of 2005''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr President, the Gulf States from Texas to Florida have \nall been dealt serious blows this past hurricane season by Hurricanes \nKatrina, Rita, Wilma, and Dennis. The needs are tremendous across the \nentire Gulf Coast in the fishing communities which were hit hardest and \nfirst. Before these hurricanes, the gulf produced about 15 percent of \nthe Nation's domestic wild-caught seafood by weight and about 20 \npercent by value.\n  According to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nreport, these hurricanes shut down, damaged, or destroyed 90-100 \npercent of the commercial docking facilities, repair shops, ice houses, \noffloading facilities, net makers, recreational marinas, bait and \ntackle shops, and seafood restaurants and retail markets in eastern \nLouisiana, with similar, if somewhat reduced, impacts in Mississippi \nand Alabama. Most of these facilities remain closed today, 9 months \nlater.\n  On September 9, 2005, Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez declared a \nfisheries disaster for the Gulf of Mexico under the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct, which authorizes fisheries disaster assistance in such situations. \nOf the almost $90 billion in disaster funding appropriated by the \nCongress since these hurricanes, none has been directed at these \nfishing communities.\n  On top of the difficulty that gulf fishermen are experiencing in \nrebuilding their ability to catch and process gulf seafood, they are \nalso faced with the hurdle of getting that catch into the national \nmarketplace.\n  One issue that continues to hurt Gulf of Mexico fisheries products is \nthe labeling of the coastal Gulf of Mexico waters by the media as \n``toxic soup'' during the first few months after Katrina. For example, \nAnderson Cooper of CNN led a Katrina follow-up story with the chairman \nof the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board by asking him \nabout the ``toxic soup'' in which Gulf of Mexico fish are growing.\n  We need to put this issue to rest and rebuild seafood markets lost \ndue to these storms. This is critical to the recovery process. The five \nGulf States estimate that their fishing industries have suffered \nhundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales since these hurricanes. \nThey will not be able to recover unless they get help in getting this \nindustry back on its feet and getting back into the marketplace.\n  The key issue that the five Gulf State seafood promotion boards face \nis that once the continuity of product has been lost in any \nmarketplace, sales often are lost permanently to substitute products \nand reclaiming those markets is a long term challenge. Add the ``toxic \nsoup'' concerns to the mix and the need for marketing is greater than \never at a time when the state seafood board budgets are dwindling or \nexpended.\n  I will be brief because I know my colleague from Mississippi, and \nSenator Shelby from Alabama, who was the author of this portion of the \nsupplemental, have already covered these issues, and Mr. Vitter did a \nvery good job. Maybe I can contribute to the debate just by summing up \nhow critical this is and why this particular amendment, even though it \ninvolves only $15 million, should be defeated. It is an important part \nof what is going on here.\n  First, let me emphasize, again, that from Texas to Florida, \nthroughout the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and \nDennis have devastated the fishing communities. They are an important \npart of our communities, our economy, and our culture. It is not just \nbecause we like to see the shrimp boats sail off into the sunset or see \nthe oystermen out there tonging for oysters; it is because it is an \nimportant part of the economy. Fifteen percent of the Nation's domestic \nwild-caught seafood by weight and 20 percent of the value comes from \nthe gulf area. It is an area that makes an important economic \ncontribution. It is an important part of the seafood industry \nnationally, and it has never been properly marketed or exploited in the \nterms that it should be. We have already had problems with imports \nbeing flooded into the country in a way that undermines the industry, \nand now we have been hit by these hurricanes.\n  I emphasize this, too: that while we have passed some $90 billion--in \nexcess of that--for disaster funding as a result of these hurricanes, \nnone of it, zero, has gone to these fishermen and to the fishing \nindustry, for a variety of reasons.\n  First of all, it takes time to ascertain what the damages are. But \nwhen you lose it all, when you lose the processing plants, the boats, \nthe whole industry, it takes time to assess what we have lost and how \nwe are going to repair it, and how do we recover from the\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nfact that we lost this business. Even NOAA has indicated that these \nhurricanes shut down, damaged, or destroyed 90 to 100 percent of the \ncommercial docking facilities, repair shops, ice houses, offloading \nfacilities, netmakers, the whole thing.\n  Once you lose that market, it is difficult to get it back--maybe \nimpossible--but we have to make that effort. This is an important food, \nit is an important resource. It is an important value for the people. \nAnd the only way we are going to get it back is we are going to have to \nhelp them repair their vessels and to recover the losses they have had.\n  A lot of these, by the way, are minorities. In Biloxi, MS, a lot of \nthese fishermen are Vietnamese or Slovonians or Frenchmen, but a lot of \nthem are Vietnamese who lost their house, their truck, their boat, \ntheir livelihood. It would make you cry to see these people. This is \nclearly an area where we should provide this help.\n  So what this particular part would do would be to focus on us \nregaining the markets we lost. It is an important part of the recovery \nprocess. The five gulf States estimate that their fishing industries \nhave suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales since the \nhurricanes. The key issue that the five gulf States' seafood promotion \nboards face is that once the continuity of the product is broken, \ngetting it back takes effort and time. And then we add to that the bad \npublicity of the so-called ``toxic soup,'' which was an exaggeration \nfrom the beginning, by the way, we have to overcome that.\n  As a matter of fact, we find that the catch that is possible out \nthere could be very good. The problem is we don't have the boats to get \nthem. We don't have the plants to deal with them when they come in.\n  So I urge my colleagues, if there is anyplace that we ought to be \nproviding some help, it is the fisheries industry. It is absolutely a \npart of the critical recovery, just as much or more so than being able \nto have a way to rebuild your home or repair your home. You have to \nhave a job. For these people, there are not many other options for \njobs. So I urge the defeat of the amendment. I commend Senator Shelby \nand Senator Cochran for including this language in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come in support of the amendment. I know \nthat we don't have too much time since the distinguished managers would \nlike to get this bill moving, but let me just say that this is $15 \nmillion to be used, and I quote from the bill: ``Seafood promotion \nstrategy,'' which is Congress's attempt to sell consumers pork \nmasquerading as a fish.\n  Similar to other appropriations in this bill, this $15 million is not \nlimited to marketing seafood from the gulf coast region or other areas \nthat were affected by Hurricane Katrina.\n  For example, the Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board likely anticipates \na payout from these appropriations. We have come a long way from an \nemergency supplemental. The board has received--this Alaska Fisheries \nMarketing Board--has received over $30 million from the Federal \nGovernment since 2003 from similar provisions in appropriations bills. \nLast year, this board used a half million dollars to pay Alaska \nAirlines to paint a giant salmon on a 737. We called it the ``salmon-\n30-salmon,'' proving that fish do fly, thanks to the American taxpayer.\n  According to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, 73 percent of all \nAmericans say they eat seafood at least once a month, and 47 percent of \nall Americans consume more seafood now than they did 5 years ago. These \nrecord consumption levels were achieved without a pricey marketing \ncampaign financed by American taxpayers. It appears that Charlie the \nTuna and the Chicken of the Sea mermaid are doing their jobs just fine, \nwithout any help from the Federal Government.\n  Additionally, a recent CRS report states:\n\n       The marketability of catch from the gulf coast appears \n     little affected by contamination from storm runoff or \n     consumers' concerns.\n\n  Mr. President, let me save the American taxpayers $15 million right \nnow by telling all Americans now to eat seafood. Eat seafood. It is \ngood for you. There we go. C-SPAN has millions of viewers, and they \nhave heard the message. So the marketing campaign is complete. With the \nFederal budget deficit forecasted to reach $477 billion this year, I \ndoubt the American taxpayer would approve of Congress spending $15 \nmillion to promote the consumption of seafood when Americans are \nalready consuming record amounts of seafood.\n  Lastly, the CRS report also found that prior to Hurricane Katrina, \nthe gulf coast commercial shrimpers had been losing market share to \n``competition from less expensive foreign imports and domestic \nharvesters for several years.'' Therefore, this $15 million marketing \ncampaign seems to be targeted more toward stemming the success of less \nexpensive imports than assisting the gulf coast region's economy.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to strike \nthe fishiest smelling pork in this bill.\n  Let me just make one additional comment, if I could. It is clear--it \nis very clear--that what we have here is a broken process. Any defense \nmoney that we are taking out should have been part of the normal \nbudgetary process. I want to tell my colleagues that I and others have \nembarked on an effort to bring the emergency supplemental that pays for \nthe Iraq war into the normal budgetary process. We have been at war for \n3 years. This is the fourth year. There is no reason to do business \nlike this. It bypasses the authorization process, it bypasses any \nscrutiny by the proper committees, we then bring it to the floor, and \nit is filled with items such as this ridiculous $15 million for a \nseafood marketing campaign, and it grows and grows and grows.\n  Today, in the Wall Street Journal, there is a poll. It says: \n``Republicans sag in new poll.'' I found it very interesting that in \ndescribing the poll, in particular, Americans who don't approve of \nCongress blame their sour mood on partisan contention and gridlock in \nWashington. Some 44 percent call themselves tired of Republicans and \nDemocrats fighting each other. Among all Americans, a 39-percent \nplurality say the single most important thing for Congress to \naccomplish this year is curtailing budgetary earmarks benefiting only \ncertain constituents.\n  I want to repeat that, Mr. President. A 39-percent plurality of \nAmericans are sick and tired of the earmarking process that is going \non. Now, when are we going to respond to the American people? \nEveryplace I go, every town hall meeting I attend, my constituents tell \nme they are sick and tired of this. And, now, according to a Wall \nStreet Journal NBC poll, a 39-percent plurality say the single most \nimportant thing for Congress to accomplish this year is curtailing \nbudgetary earmarks benefiting only certain constituents.\n  This is a graphic example of what the American people are sick and \ntired of.\n  By the way, immigration reform ranks behind earmarks in congressional \naction that is desired by the American people. It concludes by saying:\n\n       Americans take dim views of both parties, giving Democrats \n     a positive rating of just 33 percent and Republicans 35 \n     percent.\n\n  We are at an all-time low in the favorable opinion of the American \npeople. This is an example. This $15 million is a very small but \ncompelling example of our need to change the way we do business. If we \nvote again to keep this in this bill, we are sending the message to the \nAmerican people that it is business as usual.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service to assure Americans of the safety and \navailability of the seafood from U.S. oceans. The service has done \nextensive environmental testing in the gulf, and it has shown no \nincrease in toxicity. The gulf seafood is just as safe as the seafood \nfrom Washington State or New England.\n  This amendment strikes the funding that could be used for seafood \nmarketing programs that get that information to the consuming public. \nThe Senate should defeat the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I was going to move to table the amendment, but I \nunderstand it is OK to have the vote on a voice vote or show of hands. \nSo I think we are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will agree with the chairman we are \nalmost ready. I just wanted to make a couple of points.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Wait a minute, I didn't yield the floor. I am standing \nhere. I asked for a vote.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table division II of \namendment 3641.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3709\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, just over 3 years ago the Armed Forces of \nthe United States were sent to fight a new war in Iraq. I was against \nthe entry of our country into that war. At that time, many \nrepresentations were made that this war would be quick and that it \nwould be easy.\n  On the eve of war, our Nation was already embroiled in a campaign \nthat sought to portray the invasion of Iraq as a quick and cheap way to \nrid the world of Saddam's regime and his supposed chemical weapons. We \nwere told that the intervention would be as quick as lightning.\n  We now know that the war plans called for a withdrawal of nearly all \nAmerican troops from Iraq by September 2003. Yet here we are, 3 years, \n1 month, and 2 weeks later and 135,000 American troops are still in \nIraq; 2,383 American troops have been killed; more than 17,500 American \ntroops have been wounded. And for what? For what, I ask?\n  We were told at the time that the reconstruction of Iraq would cost \nthe American taxpayer almost nothing. Former Deputy Defense Secretary \nPaul Wolfowitz said that we are dealing with a country--that is, Iraq--\nthat can really finance its own reconstruction and we can do that \nrelatively soon.\n  Yet here we are, and the total bill for Iraqi reconstruction being \nfooted by the American taxpayers is running into the billions of \ndollars. We were told at the time that the cost of military action \nwould be small. Secretary Rumsfeld claimed on January 19, 2003, that \nthe Office of Management and Budget had come up with a number that is \nsomething under $50 billion for the cost of that war. Yet here we are \nand the cost of military operations in Iraq is climbing beyond $290 \nbillion.\n  Astoundingly, the cost of the war in Iraq keeps increasing. According \nto a Congressional Research Service report released this week, the \nIraqi war costs $4.4 billion per month. How about that--$4.4 billion \nper month in fiscal year 2003; $5 billion per month in fiscal year \n2004; $6.4 billion per month in fiscal year 2005; and could reach $8.1 \nbillion per month during this fiscal year. That is an 84-percent \nincrease in the cost of the war in just 3 years.\n  The growing cost of this abominable war in Iraq must come as a shock \nto Americans who were led to expect a war that could be done on the \ncheap. But we should pause to ask, at a time when our Government is \ndrowning in red ink, how can it be that spending for the war in Iraq \nkeeps increasing year after year?\n  Passage of this supplemental appropriations bill will mean that \nCongress will have appropriated $320 billion for the war in Iraq and \nthe end is not yet in sight; there is no light at the end of the tunnel \nyet. That is not the end of the story.\n  The President has requested a $50 billion bridge fund for the next \nDefense appropriations bill which will inevitably be followed next year \nby another large emergency supplemental spending request. Mark my \nwords, it won't be too long before spending on the war in Iraq will \neclipse 10 times the figure Secretary Rumsfeld estimated in January of \n2003. Talk about being off the mark, talk about being wildly off the \nmark. Some measure of sanity has to be brought to the spiralling cost \nof the war.\n  Four times I have offered amendments to defense spending bills to \nstate the sense of the Senate that the President should include a full \nestimate of the cost of the war. I have talked until I am hoarse about \nthe cost of this war. Four times I have offered amendments through \ndefense spending bills to state the sense of the Senate that the \nPresident should include a full estimate of the cost of the war in his \nannual budget request. And four times the amendments have passed with \nstrong bipartisan support--Republicans and Democrats on that side of \nthe aisle and on this side of the aisle--and four times the amendments \nhave been ignored by the White House.\n\n  The administration's failure to budget for the war means that neither \nthe White House nor Congress is making the tough decisions about how to \npay for the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I support the war in Afghanistan. Yes. We were invaded. This country \nwas invaded. This country was attacked, and the enemy was in \nAfghanistan. I was for going after those guys. But I did not vote for \nthe war in Iraq. I said it was wrong.\n  There has been no earnest debate about how wartime spending is to fit \ninto the overall budget picture. Instead, the administration has relied \noverwhelmingly on emergency supplemental appropriations requests to \nfund the costs of the ongoing wars. These requests are not part of the \nregular budget debate in Congress, and they are often foisted upon the \nlegislative branch with little in the way of justification, which \nCongress is then pressed into passing with a minimum of scrutiny.\n  The reliance on supplemental appropriations bills is one symptom of a \ndisease that has struck Washington, and\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\nthat is the scourge of fiscal irresponsibility. According to data from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, since 2001, the White House has \nrequested a total of $515 billion in emergency supplemental \nappropriations. That is more than half a trillion dollars that simply \ndoes not appear in any of the budget plans passed by Congress.\n  This dependence--this dependence, I say--on supplemental \nappropriations dwarfs the requests of prior administrations. In fact, \nthe $515 billion of supplemental funding requests in the last 5 years \nis more than 3\\1/2\\ times--more than 3\\1/2\\ times--greater than all the \nsupplemental spending requests from the 10 years previous to the \ncurrent administration.\n  At a time when our country is facing huge deficits as far as the \nhuman eye can see, it is simply irresponsible for the administration to \ncontinue to short-circuit the budget process with a never-ending series \nof huge supplemental appropriations bills. There ought to be some \nfiscal discipline here in Washington, DC, and that means that the \nPresident ought to budget for the cost of the wars. The President \npretends that his budget reduces the deficit over 5 years, but he fails \nto include the full cost of the war in Iraq.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I offer an amendment, once again, to state \nthe sense of the Senate that the President should include in his next \nannual budget request a full estimate--a full estimate--of the cost of \nthe ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. My amendment states that any \nfunds requested by the President should be placed in regular \nappropriations accounts, and should be accompanied by a detailed \njustification for those funds.\n  The Senate must continue to call for responsible budgeting for the \ncost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I have appreciated the \nefforts of the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I \nhave appreciated that. And I thank Senator Stevens for his work with me \non the previous four times I have offered this amendment. He is an \noutstanding chairman of a very important subcommittee. I am grateful \nfor his past support of this amendment on this issue.\n  Now, the Senate--I apologize for my voice. When I was a boy, there \ncame a time when my voice changed. Well, it is changing again, \napparently. I guess I cannot claim to be a boy again.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You are getting young again, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am getting young again, I am told.\n  The Senate ought to go on the record once again in favor of fiscal \nresponsibility. With the cost of the war in Iraq escalating beyond $320 \nbillion, it is time to bring some sanity to the budget process. So I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment to tell the President to \nbudget for the cost of the wars.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator sending the amendment to the \ndesk?\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for a vote. I hope we can vote for this amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself, and \n     Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment numbered 3709.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on requests for funds for \n  military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for fiscal years after \n                           fiscal year 2007)\n\n       On page 117, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n\n SENSE OF SENATE ON REQUESTS FOR FUNDS FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS IN IRAQ \n        AND AFGHANISTAN FOR FISCAL YEARS AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2007\n\n       Sec. 1312. (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Title IX of the Department of Defense Appropriations \n     Act, 2006 (division A of Public Law 109-148) appropriated \n     $50,000,000,000 for the cost of ongoing military operations \n     overseas in fiscal year 2006, although those funds were not \n     requested by the President.\n       (2) The President on February 16, 2006, submitted to \n     Congress a request for supplemental appropriations in the \n     amount of $67,600,000,000 for ongoing military operations in \n     fiscal year 2006, none of which supplemental appropriations \n     was included in the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2006, as agreed to in the Senate on April 28, \n     2005.\n       (3) The President on February 6, 2006, included a \n     $50,000,000,000 allowance for ongoing military operations in \n     fiscal year 2007, but did not formally request the funds or \n     provide any detail on how the allowance may be used.\n       (4) The concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     2007, as agreed to in the Senate on March 16, 2007, \n     anticipates as much as $86,300,000,000 in emergency spending \n     in fiscal year 2007, indicating that the Senate expects to \n     take up another supplemental appropriations bill to fund \n     ongoing military operations during fiscal year 2007.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) any request for funds for a fiscal year after fiscal \n     year 2007 for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and \n     Iraq should be included in the annual budget of the President \n     for such fiscal year as submitted to Congress under section \n     1105(a) of title 31, United States Code;\n       (2) any request for funds for such a fiscal year for \n     ongoing military operations should provide an estimate of all \n     funds required in that fiscal year for such operations;\n       (3) any request for funds for ongoing military operations \n     should include a detailed justification of the anticipated \n     use of such funds for such operations; and\n       (4) any funds provided for ongoing military operations \n     overseas should be provided in appropriations Acts for such \n     fiscal year through appropriations to specific accounts set \n     forth in such appropriations Acts.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's vote. We have voted on this four times already.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, a small bit of housekeeping.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3628, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that language revisions be \nmade to my amendment No. 3628, which is already at the desk. And those \nrevisions, which are largely technical in nature, will be sent up to \nthe desk right now.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. We want to \nhave a chance to look at those before the Senator sends them to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. VITTER. That would be fine. This is an amendment that has already \nbeen presented to the minority side. This is a language revision of \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3628), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 253, insert between lines 19 and 20, the following:\n\n\n  allocation of hurricane disaster relief and recovery funds to states\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) In this section the term ``covered funds'' \n     means any funds that----\n       (1) are made available to the Department of Justice, the \n     Department of Interior, the Department of Labor, the \n     Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services under title II of this Act for hurricane disaster \n     relief and recovery; and\n       (2) are allocated by that department or agency for use by \n     the States.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including \n     title II of this Act)----\n       (1) before making covered funds available to any State, the \n     head of the department or agency administering such funds \n     shall apply an allocation formula for all States that take \n     into consideration critical need and physical damages to \n     property, equipment, and financial losses; and\n       (2) not later than 5 days before making such covered funds \n     available to any State, submit a report to the Committees on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     on the allocation formula that is being used.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3668\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I also call up and briefly wish to speak \non a new amendment, which I will also send to the minority side, \namendment No. 3668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3668.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the treatment of a certain Corps of Engineers \n                                project)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n                        LA LOUTRE RIDGE PROJECT\n\n       Sec. 7__. For purposes of chapter 3 of title I of division \n     B of the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, \n     and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-148; 119 \n     Stat. 2761), the water control structure in the vicinity of \n     La Loutre Ridge shall be considered to be an authorized \n     operations and maintenance activity of the Corps of \n     Engineers.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment does not cost any money. It \ndoes not increase the size or expense of the bill whatsoever. It does, \nhowever, add significant language regarding an issue that is very \nimportant to coastal Louisiana with regard to coastal flooding, and \nthat has to do with the now infamous Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, \nalso known as MRGO.\n  MRGO is considered by virtually everyone to be a real problem, a \nconduit of hurricane storm surge and a conduit of saltwater intrusion \nwhich has eaten away at our coastal marshland in southeast Louisiana \nand has produced increased vulnerability to coastal storm surge.\n  Many eyewitnesses and computer models confirm that MRGO contributed \nto enormous destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. Hundreds of \nthousands of acres of coastal lands have also been lost because of the \nsaltwater intrusion invited by MRGO.\n  My amendment, again, would not increase the funding in the bill. It \nwould not increase the cost of the bill. It would simply allow for a \nportion of the funds already appropriated in the last emergency \nsupplemental for hurricane recovery for the restoration of the banks of \nMRGO to also be used to begin implementation of a water control \nstructure to block hurricane storm surge from rolling up through MRGO \nto populated areas. Again, there is broad consensus that this needs to \nbe done to battle against this vulnerability.\n  In closing, I would simply underscore my amendment does not score, \ndoes not appropriate any new money.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Vote. Let's vote. Vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment by \nthe Senator from Louisiana?\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3709\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), and the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, when Congress adjourned on its 2-week \nrecess, I heard from many of my constituents back home in New Jersey \nthat they were somewhat shocked to find out that one of the most \ncritical elements of our security, the ports in the Nation, still were \nsubject to such vulnerability.\n  Just this weekend, we received a vivid reminder of the threat that \nstill exists when Osama bin Laden released yet another tape threatening \nto kill innocent Americans.\n  We often talk tough, but then sometimes we act weak. And nowhere is \nthat concern more urgent than at our ports where 4\\1/2\\ years after \nSeptember 11, we still don't know what is contained in 95 percent of \nall of the containers entering this country. That is a colossal \nfailure, and we are here to make sure that Congress takes steps to \nreverse it.\n  In the collapse of the Dubai Ports World deal, the eyes of the Nation \nwere riveted on this problem. Most Americans were shocked to discover \nthat only 5 percent--5 percent--of the containers passing through our \nports are\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\ninspected, and they demanded improvement.\n  In the wake of that deal, the Senate responded by approving our plan \nthat added nearly $1 billion to the budget to fund port security, and \nthat was a good first step. But as we said at the time, the proof will \nbe if Congress actually steps forward to follow through with the \nfunding.\n  The 9/11 Commission told us that to prevent a future terrorist \nattack, we had to think outside the box. But at our ports, we actually \nneed to think inside the container because we need to know what is in \nthe containers that enter the country through our ports every day.\n  The bottom line is that we need to get on the road to 100 percent \nscanning and inspections of the containers coming into this country, \nand we need to get there sooner rather than later. That is why this \namendment requires the administration to provide Congress and the \nAmerican people with a clear plan, with specific yearly benchmarks to \nachieve 100 percent inspections of containers.\n  The Appropriations Committee took a big step forward by approving \nSenator Byrd's amendment to spend $648 million to strengthen \ninspections, fund new radiation portals and cargo container systems, \nand add money for local port security grants. That is a dramatic \nimprovement over the other body's bill which did nothing to add \nadditional funding for port security.\n  But I believe we need to do more. To protect our ports at home, we \nhave to inspect containers abroad, before they arrive in our ports, our \ntowns, and our cities. We must also ensure that foreign ports, \nespecially those ports in less prosperous countries, are safe and \nsecure because this cargo comes to our ports as well.\n  The amendment, therefore, provides $50 million to help those \ncountries that may not have the wherewithal to achieve the latest cargo \nscanning technologies because without that kind of support, those ports \ncould remain the weakest link in our international port security chain. \nWe have to make sure they do not become the easy targets for terrorists \nlooking for lax security practices.\n  I listened a lot to those in the shipping industry, and officials \nhave stated that the Container Security Initiative operated by Customs \nand the Border Patrol is highly dependent on the willingness of a \nforeign port to participate in the program and to effectively implement \nsecurity measures. But even if a foreign port is prepared to \nparticipate and to implement security measures, they may lack the \nfunding to procure the technologies and to hire and train adequate \npersonnel to do so.\n  In compounding this potential security gap, the shipping industry has \nnoted there is inconsistency among U.S. ports in the way they operate. \nSo if there are already operational inconsistencies among U.S. ports, \none can only imagine how security measures are implemented at foreign \nports of origins shipping goods to the United States.\n  The additional funding I am calling for will help redress some of \nthose inconsistencies by providing some of the state-of-the-art \nscanning technologies used at U.S. ports in countries abroad.\n  While we are on the subject of technologies, I have heard from a \nnumber of Federal, State, and local officials working at the port in my \nhome State, Port Elizabeth in Newark, who have emphasized the critical \nneed of deployment of the most current detection and scanning \ntechnologies at U.S. ports. They are currently using first-generation \ndetection technologies, older technologies noted to be insufficient to \ncombat newer and more complex security threats.\n  Cargo volume at that port alone is expected to double by 2020. Space \nat most ports is at a premium. Access to freight is extremely \ndifficult. Cargo containers are often stacked end to end and door to \ndoor. We have to give Federal, State, and local law enforcement and \nHomeland Security officials near-term access to technologies that make \ntheir jobs feasible. We cannot send them out to fight a war with sticks \nand stones.\n  The complexity and vulnerability of the cargo container transport \nprocess only makes the need for robust technologies that much more \nimportant. My amendment, therefore, also provides $100 million for \nDomestic Nuclear Detection Office research and development. We have not \nsufficiently focused on creating second-generation technologies for \nnonintrusive inspections which the private sector is unlikely to \ndevelop. It is time for that to change.\n  Our technologies are only as good as the people operating them. That \nis why we also have included $10 million for CBP training. That \namendment would provide $10 million to train CBP officers so they can \nutilize new technologies and processes to improve port security.\n  It actually takes six such officers alone to safely operate one \nvehicle and cargo inspection unit. Right now at Port Elizabeth in \nNewark, they operate four of those mobile units and two stationary \nones. That is 36 officers dedicated solely to operating one scanning \ntechnology. Those officers need to be trained before they can operate \nthose units.\n  Cargo volume is forecast to increase. We want to see that in the \ncontext of our trade and economy, but terminal operators are extending \ncommercial hours to accommodate that increased cargo volume. We have to \nmake sure it moves quickly and safely. Doing so not only requires \neffective modern technologies but also a sufficient number of well-\ntrained staff to operate the scanning and detection equipment. That is \ngoing to require additional officers to be on the job for extended \nhours and even on the weekends.\n  Once we have the right technologies and a sufficient number of well-\ntrained CBP and Coast Guard officers with the tools to do their jobs, \nwe need to make sure that port workers who come in and out of the \nports, particularly into sensitive areas, are properly screened.\n  This is not about randomly excluding people we don't like from coming \nin. This is about ensuring that the men and women who are in essential \nparts of the cargo supply chain cannot be compromised by interests \nseeking to harm our Nation's port. That is where the Transport Worker \nIdentification Program comes in.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act, MTSA, enacted in 2002 \nrequires DHS to supply a worker identification card that uses \nbiometrics, such as fingerprints, to control access to secure areas of \nports or ships. The TSA was supposed to issue those credentials to more \nthan 6 million maritime workers in August of 2004. It is April of 2006 \nand nearly 2 years down the line, and there is still no nationwide port \nworker credential program.\n  If this was such a priority, such a critical part of our security, \nwhy hasn't it happened? The GAO report back at the end of 2004 said \nthat TSA didn't have a plan for managing this project. Guess what else \nthey said would happen without that plan. Failure to develop such a \nplan places the program at higher risks of cost overruns, missed \ndeadlines, underperformance. Missed deadlines--that obviously has \nhappened. Cost overruns, I wouldn't doubt it. And I suppose the jury is \nstill out on ``underperformance.'' They concluded that each delay of \nthe program to develop a credential card postpones enhancements to port \nsecurity and complicates port stakeholders' efforts to make the \nappropriate investment decisions regarding security infrastructure.\n\n  Just this week, Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff announced that \nDHS will finally begin background checks on port workers as a precursor \nto a nationwide rollout of this long-awaited port worker credential \nprogram by the fall of 2006. I am glad they are finally getting around \nto doing this.\n  But there is one problem, and that is that they lack fiscal 2006 \nfunding to implement the rollout. So we better hope that DHS has put \nsome money away in its coffers to pay for this big event. It is \nprobably not wise to bank on a timely passage of the 2007 spending bill \nin time to provide DHS with the funds they need for that rollout. We \ncan certainly hope that is the case, but I wouldn't want to jeopardize \na rollout of a critical program by banking on something that may or may \nnot happen in time.\n  That is why this amendment also allows DHS to have the funds \nnecessary on an urgent, near-term basis, so that we can finally, 2 \nyears later, get to where we need to be.\n  Let me close by reminding us all that strengthening security at our \nports is\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nnot going to be cheap. Given the budgetary challenges we face, we \nunderstand it is a difficult choice. But an attack on one of our ports \nwould not only cause a tremendous toll in loss of life, but it would \nalso shut down a port and all of the economic activity it generates.\n  Just in my home State of New Jersey alone, with the third largest \nport in the country, the mega port of the east coast, 200,000 jobs, $25 \nbillion of economic activity, that is what is at stake, in addition to \nthe lives.\n  If we could roll back the clock 10 years and spend a few billion \ndollars to raise the levees in New Orleans to be able to withstand a \ncategory 5 hurricane, we could have saved hundreds of lives, as well as \nthe billions of dollars more that it would take to rebuild that city. I \ndon't want our country to look back in hindsight a few years from now \nwith the realization that had we spent the necessary dollars now to \nimprove the security at our ports, we could have prevented a major \nterrorist attack.\n  Who among us would be satisfied in the aftermath of an attack that we \ndid not take the steps that we could have in order to prevent such an \nattack because we were unwilling to make the commitment to do so? That \nis the choice the Congress faces for the security of our country. It is \nan essential one that we need to make right now, and this amendment \noffers that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Menendez \namendment to adequately fund port and container security.\n  Our ports are vulnerable to a terrorist attack. We know this.\n  We only inspect about 5 percent of the shipping containers that enter \nour country.\n  Terrorists could smuggle themselves, traditional weapons, and nuclear \nor chemical weapons into a harbor.\n  From there, they could potentially launch an attack even more \ndevastating than 9/11.\n  In my home State of New Jersey--where we lost some 700 victims on 9/\n11--Federal officials have identified the 2-mile stretch between Port \nNewark and Newark Liberty International Airport as the most dangerous \ntarget in the United States for terrorism.\n  But port security is not just a local concern. Our ports are \nessential to the flow of goods and commodities in our national economy, \nand vital to our military; 95 percent of all goods imported into this \ncountry arrive by ship.\n  Mr. President, this administration's mishandling of the Dubai Ports \ndeal has highlighted the fact that our ports are still vulnerable.\n  We need a way to ensure that 100 percent of the containers coming \ninto our country are WMD-free.\n  The Bush administration has said that we can't check all containers \ncoming into the U.S. for WMD's.\n  But we check every airline passenger for weapons. We do not just look \nat an airline passenger's ticket and say ``OK, on paper, this guy looks \nfine.''\n  That is the Bush administration's current idea of port security--just \na simple look at the paperwork.\n  Mr. President, we need to check containers for WMDs. The amendment of \nmy friend, Senator Menendez, will give us the tools we need to do this. \nIt will adequately protect our ports, our economy and our lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Menendez amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate that. Mr. President, I rise to ask for a \nunanimous consent agreement so we can set in order the speakers that we \nhave left on our side. I see you have several on your side as well, so \nperhaps we can work together to do this. But we have remaining Senator \nConrad, who would like 7 minutes; Senator Levin who would like 2 \nminutes; Senator Schumer would like 5 minutes, and I would like 1 \nminute to offer an amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin. If we could \nset in order a time on those, we would be happy to go back and forth \nwith the Members on your side who would like to speak.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, if the Senator from Washington will yield, \nI would ask that on this side, following the Democratic speaker, \nwhoever that is, that I be allowed to speak, and then following me \nwould be Senator Cornyn, and that there be an intervening--since we are \nswitching sides back and forth, I assume that you would have somebody \nto put in the queue. So I would ask that you modify your unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would be happy to modify my unanimous \nconsent request to say that following the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nConrad be recognized for 7 minutes, that Senator Allard then be \nrecognized, Senator Levin for 2 minutes, Senator Cornyn for whatever \ntime he asks for, Senator Schumer for 5 minutes, and then Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if my colleagues would advise how much \ntime they have so we can let our Senators know when to be on the floor \nso we can move things along more quickly. Can the Senators from Texas \nand Colorado tell us how much time they want?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I want 1 minute to offer an amendment and then another \none I want to call up. I think I can get that accomplished within 7 \nminutes, so I request 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I need about 20 minutes, but I would be \nwilling to work with the other side if there are short-time speakers, \nto try to make sure people would not have to wait. So I am sure we can \nwork something out.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I amend my unanimous consent request, and \nI would ask for 1 minute for myself in the intervening time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Menendez \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3702\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nMenendez amendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up \namendment No. 3702.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss], for himself and \n     Mr. Isakson, proposes an amendment numbered 3702.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Relating to the comprehensive review of the procedures of the \n               Department of Defense on mortuary affairs)\n\n       On page 253, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n\n  COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW ON PROCEDURES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ON \n                            MORTUARY AFFAIRS\n\n       Sec. 7032. (a) Report.--As soon as practicable after the \n     completion of the comprehensive review of the procedures of \n     the Department of Defense on mortuary affairs, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the review.\n       (b) Additional Elements.--In conducting the comprehensive \n     review described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall also \n     address, in addition to any other matters covered by the \n     review, the following:\n       (1) The utilization of additional or increased \n     refrigeration (including icing) in combat theaters in order \n     to enhance preservation of remains.\n       (2) The relocation of refrigeration assets further forward \n     in the field.\n       (3) Specific time standards for the movement of remains \n     from combat units.\n       (4) The forward location of autopsy and embalming \n     operations.\n       (5) Any other matters that the Secretary considers \n     appropriate in order to speed the return of remains to the \n     United States in a non-decomposed state.\n       (c) Additional Element of Policy on Casualty Assistance to \n     Survivors of Military Decedents.--Section 562(b) of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3267; 10 U.S.C. 1475 note) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(12) The process by which the Department of Defense, upon \n     request, briefs survivors of military decedents on the cause \n     of, and any investigation into, the death of such military \n     decedents and on the disposition and transportation of the \n     remains of such decedents, which process shall--\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n       ``(A) provide for the provision of such briefings by fully \n     qualified Department personnel;\n       ``(B) ensure briefings take place as soon as possible after \n     death and updates are provided in a timely manner when new \n     information becomes available;\n       ``(C) ensure that--\n       ``(i) such briefings and updates relate the most complete \n     and accurate information available at the time of such \n     briefings or updates, as the case may be; and\n       ``(ii) incomplete or unverified information is identified \n     as such during the course of such briefings or updates; and\n       ``(D) include procedures by which such survivors shall, \n     upon request, receive updates or supplemental information on \n     such briefings or updates from qualified Department \n     personnel.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this bill that we are debating today \nwill appropriate somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 billion for \nongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the War on Terrorism. This \nmoney is important to ensure that our military has the resources \nnecessary to win this war and continue to be the best equipped, best \ntrained, and best led military in the world. However, there is another \nside to this war on terrorism that doesn't deal with money. It deals \nwith something more important than money, and that is people.\n  We are sending our young men and women overseas to faraway places to \nfight and win this war. These men and women are the most important part \nof this war--more important than any tank, any humvee, any airplane, or \nany ship that we will buy with the money that we will appropriate \nthrough the bill that we are debating today.\n  I have been to visit our young men and women fighting in Iraq on four \ndifferent occasions. I have gone on these trips with the intention of \nseeing firsthand what is happening in the theater and to say thank you \nto the men and women, with their boots on the ground, with the hope of \nencouraging our servicemembers who are on the front lines in this \nglobal war on terrorism. But as all of us who have gone to visit our \nsoldiers overseas find, we are the ones who wind up being encouraged \nand inspired by them. We are encouraged by their professionalism, their \nmaturity, their commitment, and their courage to do the job that our \ncountry has asked them to do.\n  However, we all know that some of these brave men and women do not \nreturn. Some of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have given \ntheir lives in this global war on terrorism. These men and women are, \nin the fullest sense of the words, fallen heroes who have given the \ngreatest sacrifice possible so that we in this country, as well as the \nIraqi people, the Afghan people, and people in less fortunate parts of \nthe world than the United States, can live in a world that is safe and \nfree from terror.\n  SGT Paul Saylor was one of these heroes. Sergeant Saylor was from \nBremen, Georgia, and was a member of the Georgia National Guard's 48th \nBrigade, assigned to the 1st Battalion, 108th Armor Regiment, serving \nin Iraq last summer. Sergeant Saylor's humvee was part of a six-vehicle \nconvoy and ran off the road into a canal early on the morning of August \n15, 2005, near Mahmudiyah, Iraq, and Sergeant Saylor drowned along with \ntwo of his fellow soldiers.\n  Due to several factors, Sergeant Saylor's body reached an advanced \nstate of decomposition before it was returned to the United States, and \nthe Saylor family was unable to view Sergeant Saylor's remains at his \nfuneral. I think we can all understand the extent to which this added \nto the grief of the Saylor family and can sympathize with them and any \nother family in this situation and commit ourselves to doing our \nabsolute best to ensure that this does not happen again.\n  The process and policies related to how we treat the remains of our \nfallen heroes and how we communicate and interact with their survivors \ndeserves the absolute highest priority that we can give. It is \nextremely unfortunate that survivors are ever unable to view the \nremains of their family members and, therefore, unable to say their \nfinal goodbye and obtain the sense of closure that we all know is so \nimportant in these situations. It is also the case that on occasion, \nsurvivors have been given incomplete or inaccurate information relative \nto what happened to their family members and how their remains were \nhandled after they died. This is also extremely unfortunate and adds \ngrief to an already grieving family.\n  The amendment that Senator Isakson and I have proposed calls on the \nDepartment of Defense to improve their current policy related to \nmortuary affairs, how the remains of servicemembers are handled, and \nhow the military communicates with survivors relative to their deceased \nfamily members. This amendment will ensure that we are doing absolutely \neverything we can to ensure the remains of our fallen heroes receive \nthe respect and care they deserve, and that their family receives the \nbest treatment, as well as the most timely, accurate information \npossible.\n  Specifically, this amendment calls on the Department of Defense to \nimprove policies related to refrigeration of remains in theater, the \nspecific time standards for movement of remains, as well as examine the \nfeasibility of forward locating autopsy and embalming operations from \nthe continental United States to theater, and modify any other factors \nthat could possibly shorten the time line for returning soldiers in a \nnondecomposed state.\n  This amendment also calls on the Department to improve their policies \nfor communicating with family members to ensure family members are \nbriefed by fully qualified Department of Defense personnel, that any \npartial or unverified information that families are provided is \nidentified as such, and ensures that the Department provides updates to \nthe family whenever new information becomes available.\n  Mr. President, the unimaginable grief and sorrow that a family \nexperiences when their soldier makes the ultimate sacrifice should not \nbe made even more distressing by not allowing the family an opportunity \nto say their final goodbye. I strongly commend the Saylor family for \ntheir courage and strength in sharing their family's experience and \ntheir comments relative to this process with us so that we in the U.S. \nCongress can work to ensure that other military families do not have to \ngo through the same thing.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3714\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment in order to call up Harkin amendment No. 3714.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3714.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase by $8,500,000 the amount appropriated for \n Economic Support Fund assistance, to provide that such funds shall be \nmade available to the United States Institute of Peace for programs in \n            Iraq and Afghanistan, and to provide an offset)\n\n       On page 126, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n   UNITED STATES INSTITUTE OF PEACE PROGRAMS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN\n\n       Sec. 1406. (a) The amount appropriated by this chapter for \n     other bilateral assistance under the heading ``Economic \n     Support Fund'' is hereby increased by $8,500,000.\n       (b) Of the amount appropriated by this chapter for other \n     bilateral assistance under the heading ``Economic Support \n     Fund'', as increased by subsection (a), $8,500,000 shall be \n     made available to the United States Institute of Peace for \n     programs in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (c) Of the funds made available by chapter 2 of title II of \n     division A of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \n     for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, \n     2005'' (Public Law 109-13) for military assistance under the \n     heading ``Peacekeeping Operations'' and available for the \n     Coalition Solidarity Initiative, $8,500,000 is rescinded.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3621\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand from the managers that \namendment No. 3621 has been agreed to on both sides. First, let me \ndescribe this amendment.\n  Mr. President, today we are holding expectations that a new unity in \ngovernment in Iraq will soon be completed. It has been long awaited. I \nhave just completed. I think, my seventh\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\ntrip there with Senator Levin and other Members of the Senate. We had a \ndelegation of six.\n  During the course of our inspection visit, it was repeatedly brought \nto our attention that there was a desperate need for additional \ncivilians from the Department of Energy to work on the power systems, \nthe oil, and from the Department of Justice to work on the civil \njustice system; from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to \nwork on the health situations. And I have been working with members of \nthe administration, and, indeed, the President himself on two occasions \nhas stressed the importance of encouraging more civilians within our \ncivil structure to go over and help this government fully establish \nitself, exercise the responsibilities of sovereignty, and to move \nforward.\n  There need to be modest corrections made to the existing law to \nenable the Secretaries and heads of the agencies to provide certain \nbenefits, inducements, and other situations with their respective \nindividual employees in the hopes that they can quickly give up the \nsecurity of their neighborhoods and life today and join the brave men \nand women of the Armed Forces in, hopefully, completing in a shorter \nperiod of time this task to provide for full sovereignty in Iraq.\n  Many civilian agencies and departments already have provisions to \nprovide pay, allowances, benefits, and gratuities in danger zones. \nHowever, others do not. This amendment applies to those currently \nwithout such authorities.\n  Over the past few months, the President has explained candidly and \nfrankly, what is at stake in Iraq and Afghanistan. The free nations of \nthe world must be steadfast in helping the people of these nations to \nattain a level of democracy and freedom of their own choosing.\n  It is vital to the security of the American people that we help them \nsucceed such that their lands never again become the breeding ground or \nhaven for terrorism as was Afghanistan for Osama bin Laden and Al \nQaeda.\n  We have seen how terrorists and insurgents in Iraq have failed to \nstop Iraq's democratic progress.\n  They tried to stop the transfer of sovereignty in June 2004;\n  They tried to stop millions from voting in the January 2005 \nelections;\n  They tried to stop Sunnis from participating in the October 2005 \nconstitutional referendum;\n  They tried to stop millions from voting in the December 2005 \nelections to form a permanent government under that constitution; and\n  In each case, they failed.\n  Just in the past few days, there have been significant, encouraging \ndevelopments toward forming a unity government in Iraq. Clearly, the \nefforts of administration officials and congressional members in \nmeetings with Iraqi leaders and parliamentarians have contributed to \nthese developments.\n  In my view, this represents important forward momentum, which has \nbeen long awaited. The new leadership in Iraq is making commitments to \ncomplete cabinet selection and take other actions to stand up a unity \ngovernment. This is a pivotal moment in that critical period many of us \nspoke about after the December elections. We must be steadfast and \ndemonstrate a strong show of support for Iraq's emerging government.\n  For 3 years now the coalition of military forces have, from the \nbeginning, performed with the highest degree of professionalism, and \nthey and their families have borne the brunt of the loss of life, \ninjury, and separation.\n  In hearings of the Armed Services Committee this year, with a \ndistinguished group of witnesses, and based on two--and I say this most \nrespectfully and humbly--personal conversations I have had with the \nPresident of the United States and, indeed, the Secretary of State, I \nvery forcefully said to each of them that we need to get the entirety \nof our Federal Government engaged to a greater degree.\n  The Department of Defense concurs. I was struck by the 2006 QDR which \nso aptly states that:\n\n       Success requires unified statecraft: The ability of the \n     U.S. Government to bring to bear all elements of national \n     power at home and to work in close cooperation with allies \n     and partners abroad.\n\n  I would add that General Abizaid, when he appeared before our \ncommittee this year, stated in his posture statement:\n\n       We need significantly more non-military personnel * * * \n     with expertise in areas such as economic development, civil \n     affairs, agriculture, and law.\n\n  I fully agree. I along with 5 other Senators heard the same \nsentiments from our field commanders and diplomatic officials during at \ntrip to Iraq and Afghanistan last month.\n  The United States has a talented and magnificent Federal work force \nwhose skills and expertise are in urgent need in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWe must provide our agency heads with the tools they need to harness \nthese elements of national power at this critical time.\n  I have spoken about this publicly on previous occasions. I have \nwritten to each cabinet secretary asking for a review of their current \nand future programs to support out Nation's goals and objectives in \nIraq and Afghanistan, and I have spoken to the President about this.\n  The aim of this bill is to assist the United States Government in \nrecruiting personnel to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to avoid \ninequities in allowances, benefits, and gratuities among similarly-\nsituated United States Government civilian personnel. It is essential \nthat the heads of all agencies that have personnel serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have this authority with respect to allowances, benefits, \nand gratuities for such personnel.\n  In my conversations with President Bush and the cabinet officers and \nothers, there seems to be total support.\n  The administration, at their initiative, asked OMB to draw up the \nlegislation, which I submit today in the form of an amendment.\n  I hope this will garner support across the aisle--Senator Clinton has \ncertainly been active in this area, as have others--and that we can \ninclude this on the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The urgency is now, absolutely now.\n  Every day it becomes more and more critical that the message of 11 \nmillion Iraqi voters in December not be silenced. We want a government, \na unified government stood up and operating. To do that, this emerging \nIraqi Government, will utilize such assets as we can provide them from \nacross the entire spectrum of our Government. Our troops have done \ntheir job with the coalition forces.\n  Now it is time for others in our Federal work force to step forward \nand add their considerable devotion and expertise to make the peace \nsecure in those nations so the lands of Iraq and Afghanistan do not \nrevert to havens for terrorism and destruction. I know many in our \nexceptional civilian workforce will answer this noble call in the name \nof free people everywhere.\n  I have sent a letter to the Chief of Staff at the White House in this \nregard on March 15, and I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2006.\n     Mr. Andrew H. Card, Jr.,\n     Chief of Staff, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Card: Over the past few months, the President has \n     candidly and frankly explained what is at stake in Iraq. I \n     firmly believe that the success or failure of our efforts in \n     Iraq may ultimately lie at how well the next Iraqi government \n     is prepared to govern. For the past 3 years, the United \n     States and our coalition partners have helped the Iraqi \n     people prepare for this historic moment of self-governance.\n       Our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan requires coordinated \n     and integrated action among all federal departments and \n     agencies of our government. This mission has revealed that \n     our government is not adequately organized to conduct \n     interagency operations. I am concerned about the slow pace of \n     organizational reform within our civilian departments and \n     agencies to strengthen our interagency process and build \n     operational readiness.\n       In recent months, General Peter Pace, USMC, Chairman, Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and General John Abizaid, USA, Commander, \n     United States Central Command, have emphasized the importance \n     of interagency coordination in Iraq and Afghanistan. General \n     Abizai stated in his 2006 posture statement to the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee that ``we need significantly more \n     non-military personnel * * * with expertise in areas such as \n     economic development, civil affairs, agriculture, and law.''\n       Strengthening interagency operations has become the \n     foundation for the current Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). \n     The QDR so aptly states that ``success requires unified \n     statecraft: the ability of the U.S. Government to bring to \n     bear all elements of national power at home and to work in \n     close\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n     cooperation with allies and partners abroad.'' In the years \n     since passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, \n     ``jointness'' has promoted more unified direction and action \n     of our Armed Forces, I now believe the time has come for \n     similar changes to take place elsewhere in our federal \n     government.\n       I commend the President for his leadership in issuing a \n     directive to improve our interagency coordination by signing \n     the National Security Presidential Directive-44, titled \n     ``Management of Interagency Efforts Concerning Reconstruction \n     and Stabilization,'' dated December 7, 2005. I applaud each \n     of the heads of departments and agencies for working together \n     to develop this important and timely directive.\n       I have sent letters to nearly all cabinet-level officials \n     asking for their personal review of the level of support \n     being provided by their respective department or agency in \n     support of our Nation's objectives in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n     Following this review, I requested that they submit a report \n     to me no later than April 10, 2006, on their current and \n     projected activities in both theaters of operations, as well \n     as their efforts in implementing the directive and what \n     additional authorities or resources might be necessary to \n     carry out the responsibilities contained in the directive.\n       I believe it is imperative that we leverage the resident \n     expertise in all federal departments and agencies of our \n     government to address the complex problems facing the \n     emerging democracies in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am prepared \n     to work with the executive branch to sponsor legislation, if \n     necessary, to overcome challenges posed by our current \n     organizational structures and processes that prevent an \n     integrated national response.\n       I look forward to continued consultation on this important \n     subject.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is the amendment was introduced by \nmyself, I think 2 days ago. There was some debate at that time. I know \nof no opposition to it.\n  Therefore, I ask the pending amendment be laid aside and that the \nSenate consider this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? The question is on agreeing \nto the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3620\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to bring up a second amendment. It \nrelates to the Carrier John F. Kennedy. I ask I be permitted here \nmomentarily to have this amendment called up.\n  The department of defense has submitted its report to the Congress on \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review for 2005 and, as we are all well aware, \nin the 4 years since the previous Quadrennial Defense Review the global \nwar on terror has dramatically broadened the demands on our naval \ncombat forces. In response, the Navy has implemented fundamental \nchanges to fleet deployment practices that have increased total force \navailability, and it has fielded advances in ship systems, aircraft, \nand precision weapons that have provided appreciably greater combat \npower than 4 years ago.\n  However, we must consider that the Navy is at its smallest size in \ndecades, and the threat of emerging naval powers superimposed upon the \nNavy's broader mission of maintaining global maritime security, \nrequires that we modernize and expand our Navy.\n  The longer view dictated by naval force structure planning requires \nthat we invest today to ensure maritime dominance 15 years and further \nin the future; investment to modernize our aircraft carrier force, to \nincrease our expeditionary capability, to maintain our undersea \nsuperiority, and to develop the ability to penetrate the littorals with \nthe same command we possess today in the open seas.\n  The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review impresses these critical \nrequirements against the backdrop of the National Defense strategy and \nconcludes that the Navy must build a larger fleet. This determination \nis in whole agreement with concerns raised by congress as the rate of \nshipbuilding declined over the past 15 years. Now we must finance this \ncritical modernization, and in doing so we must strike an affordable \nbalance between existing and future force structure.\n  The centerpiece of the Navy's force structure is the carrier strike \ngroup, and the evaluation of current and future aircraft carrier \ncapabilities by the Quadrennial Defense Review has concluded that 11 \naircraft carriers provide the decisively superior combat capability \nrequired by the national defense strategy. Carefully considering this \nconclusion, we must weight the risk of reducing the naval force from 12 \nto 11 aircraft carriers against the risk of failing to modernize the \nnaval force.\n\n  Maintaining 12 aircraft carriers would require extending the service \nlife and continuing to operate the USS John F. Kennedy, CV-67.\n  The compelling reality is that today the 38 year old USS John F. \nKennedy, CV-67, is not qualified to perform her primary mission of \naviation operations, and she is not deployable without a significant \ninvestment of resources. Recognizing the great complexity and the risks \ninherent to naval aviation, there are very real concerns regarding the \nability to maintain the Kennedy in an operationally safe condition for \nour sailors at sea.\n  In the final assessment, the costs to extend the service life and to \nsafely operate and deploy this aging aircraft carrier in the future \nprove prohibitive when measured against the critical need to invest in \nmodernizing the naval force.\n  Meanwhile, each month that we delay on this decision costs the Navy \n$20 million in operations and manpower costs that are sorely needed to \nsupport greater priorities, and it levies and untold burden on the \nlives of the sailors and their families assigned to the Kennedy.\n  We in the Congress have an obligation to ensure that our brave men \nand women in uniform are armed with the right capability when and where \ncalled upon to perform their mission in defense of freedom around the \nworld. Previously, we have questioned the steady decline in naval force \nstructure, raising concerns with regard to long term impacts on \noperations, force readiness, and the viability of the industrial base \nthat we rely upon to build our Nation's Navy. Accordingly, I am \nencouraged by and strongly endorse the Navy's vision for a larger, \nmodernized fleet, sized and shaped to remain the world's dominant \nseapower through the 21st century.\n  However, to achieve this expansion while managing limited resources, \nit is necessary to retire the aging conventional carriers that have \nserved this country for so long.\n  To this end, Mr. President, I offer this amendment which would \neliminate the requirement for the naval combat forces of the Navy to \ninclude not less than 12 operational aircraft carriers.\n  I spoke to this amendment 2 days ago. Several colleagues, I know, \nhave an interest in it. But here is the situation. John F. Kennedy \nbears one of the most famous names in naval history. That ship has \nsailed for 38 years in harm's way to defend the interests of this \ncountry. That ship has finally come to its resting place. It is now \nberthed in Jacksonville, FL. It has been the determination of the Chief \nof Naval Operations that its present condition--it is a conventionally \npowered ship--no longer enables that ship to perform its primary \nmission, namely launching and retrieving aircraft and other associated \nmissions of a carrier. Its systems have finally worn out. Its \npowerplant has worn out.\n  At 38 years of age and the enormous investment necessary to bring it \nback--if in fact they could repair it, and there is some doubt as to \nwhether even with the expenditure of huge sums they could repair it--\nthen the ship would have a limited life.\n  We have known for about 3 or 4 months about the condition of this \nship and the Navy's intention to retire it. A year or so ago, I and \nothers put in a law by which we told the Department of Defense that \nthey must maintain a fleet of 12 carriers. This amendment simply amends \nthat law such that that number is now 11, and thereby allows this ship \nto be retired.\n  I would point out to my colleagues, quite apart from the fame of this \nship, there are 2,000 sailors in the ship's company. If you added up \nall the family members of the total naval family of husbands and wives \nand children associated with that ship, it is probably as high as 5,000 \nindividuals. They must be considered, as to their future. Right now \nthere is no future. They have to\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nremain aboard that ship until certain steps are taken to begin to fully \ndeactivate it. But not all of them. Most will be transferred to other \nassignments and their families relocated.\n  It is costing the taxpayers $20 million a month to maintain that size \nof crew and this ship in Jacksonville, FL. I think it is the \nappropriate time the Senate recognize we must entrust to the Chief of \nNaval Operations, and to others, the decision to retire this ship. This \namendment is for that purpose. I am the last one to ever want to retire \nnaval ships, and I have had the experience as a former Secretary of the \nNavy, but I recognize that time comes. It has come with this famous \nship.\n  I do not want this issue to be used in a way to detract from the \nextraordinary record of this ship and the proud name it bears. I hope \nmy colleagues will agree to allow this amendment to be called up for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have to object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3715\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3715 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also ask unanimous consent Senator Clinton be included \nas original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment numbered 3715.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. This is an \namendment to pay for the war costs that are in the underlying \nlegislation. The alternative is to simply stack the war costs on the \ndebt. I believe these war costs should have been budgeted for and paid \nfor. Instead, we just keep putting it on the charge card.\n  I want to put in context our overall fiscal condition. This looks \nback to 2001, when we last had a surplus. Every year the deficits have \nbeen up, up, and away. This year they are projecting a deficit of $371 \nbillion. But that is the tip of the iceberg because the fact is the \ndeficit is much smaller than the amount that is being added to the \ndebt. This year we now anticipate the debt will be increased by $654 \nbillion. That is simply unacceptable, to be running up the debt in \nthese record amounts, especially before the baby boomers retire. If the \nbudget that is now stalled between the House and the Senate is adopted, \nthe debt will go up each and every year, $500 billion or $600 billion a \nyear, until we reach a debt of $11.8 trillion.\n  When this President came into office, the debt was $5.2 trillion. At \nthe end of his first year--we don't hold him responsible for the first \nyear because we were still operating under the policies of the previous \nadministration--we were in surplus. At the end of his first year the \ndebt was $5.8 trillion. At the end of this year it will be $8.6 \ntrillion, headed for almost $12 trillion. It is time we get serious \nabout dealing with the fiscal imbalances in this country.\n  Here is one of the results of this fiscal policy. It took all these \nPresidents, 42 of them, 224 years to run up $1 trillion of debt held by \nforeigners. This President in just 5 years has more than doubled that \namount, more than doubled the amount that 42 Presidents ran up in terms \nof foreign debt.\n\n  The Comptroller General of the United States, Mr. Walker, has warned:\n\n       Continuing on this unsustainable fiscal path will gradually \n     erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of \n     living, and ultimately our national security.\n\n  Let's pay for at least the war costs that are in this underlying \namendment. We can do that much. The emergency provisions, those things \nthat were unpredictable, maybe we can understand that those things \naren't paid for in the underlying amendment. But the war costs? My \ngoodness, we have been at war more than 3 years. These things should \nhave been budgeted for. They should have been paid for. That is what I \npropose in this amendment. I do it in a way that I think is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  We provide the same offsets as the Senate-passed tax bill, closing \nthe tax gap by shutting down abusive tax shelters and providing for \nother reforms. That raises $19 billion. That includes revoking tax \nbenefits for leasing foreign subway and sewer systems. What a scam that \nis. Companies are buying foreign sewer systems and depreciating it on \ntheir U.S. taxes, and then leasing them back to the foreign cities \nwhere those sewer systems exist. What a scam. Let's close it down.\n  We do it by ending loopholes for large oil companies, which raises $5 \nbillion; requiring tax withholding on Government payments to \ncontractors such as Halliburton, withholding that others are asked to \ndo in our society. Why not them? We do it by renewing the Superfund tax \nso that polluting companies pay for cleaning up toxic waste sites, \nwhich raises $9 billion; ending a loophole that rewards U.S. companies \nthat move manufacturing jobs overseas raises $6 billion; repealing the \nphaseout of limits on personal exemptions and itemized deductions for \nvery high-wealth individuals raises $28 billion; and by closing other \ntax loopholes and miscellaneous offsets of $1 billion.\n  This is the legislation, this is the amendment. It pays for the war \ncosts--$74 billion. We are going to see those who are serious about \nbeing fiscally responsible and those who just want to talk about it. \nThis is an opportunity to pay for the war costs that should have been \nbudgeted, that should have been paid for in the regular order.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. Let's get serious \nabout addressing the explosion of debt and deficits in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to offer an \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3701\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3701 on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Durbin, and Senator Mikulski, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] for himself, and Mr. \n     Durbin, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3701.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for critical emergency structural repairs \n                to the Capitol Complex utility tunnels)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                        TITLE __--OTHER MATTERS\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE BRANCH\n\n                        ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL\n\n                          Capitol Power Plant\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Capitol Power Plant'', \n     $27,600,000, to remain available until September 30, 2011: \n     Provided, That the amount provided under this heading is \n     designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this amendment would provide $27.6 million \nto the Architect of the Capitol to make emergency repairs to utility \ntunnels that serve the Capitol complex, including asbestos abatement. \nUnfortunately, this problem has come to our attention recently, and it \nis a serious crisis that can't wait for the fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations bill.\n  About 2 months ago, the Office of Compliance filed a complaint with \nthe Architect of the Capitol due to the conditions of these utility \ntunnels, including the possibility of tunnel cave-ins, the presence of \nunsafe levels of asbestos, inadequate means of emergency egress, and \ninadequate means of communications for those who work in the\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nutility tunnels. This is the first time the compliance office has filed \na complaint--a step up from a citation.\n  When this issue was brought to our attention, Senator Durbin and I \nheld oversight hearings with the Architect and demanded a plan to \nensure employees who work in the tunnels are protected from unsafe \nlevels of asbestos, fix falling concrete, provide adequate means of \negress throughout the tunnels, improve communications for utility \nworkers, secure the tunnels so only authorized employees are given \naccess, and review whether tunnel workers are receiving an appropriate \nlevel of environmental or hazardous duty pay.\n  In response, the Architect sent a preliminary plan for fixing the \ntunnels with a price tag that could ultimately reach several hundred \nmillion dollars. Frankly, I was shocked by the magnitude of this \nproblem and the cost estimate. I was appalled that this problem was \nidentified by the Office of Compliance in a citation 6 years ago, and \nhasn't been put on a fast track for addressing the health and safety \nproblems until Senator Durbin and I asked for a plan. These are serious \nproblems and high levels of asbestos have been found.\n  The amendment I am offering today includes funds to remediate \nasbestos, remove loose concrete, replace the roof of a section of one \nof the tunnels, add escape hatches, and improve the communications \nsystem.\n  We have reviewed the funding estimates with the Government \nAccountability Office. Notwithstanding the fact that some of the \nestimates are preliminary, they are warranted. I had hoped that we \ncould reprogram funds from within the Architect's budget but the \nmagnitude of the need is far beyond what could be found within the \nArchitect's budget.\n  I urge the Senate to agree to the amendment. I ask that it be agreed \nto by a voice vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was recently brought to our attention \nby the Office of Compliance that the utility tunnels which carry steam \nand chilled water throughout the Capitol complex are rapidly \ndeteriorating and are putting the workers who must enter these tunnels \nin extremely hazardous and potentially life-threatening situations. \nFalling concrete, the presence of asbestos, inadequate egress routes \nand a faulty communications system threaten the lives of the utility \ntunnel employees on a daily basis. Several of these tunnels are on the \nverge of collapse--not only threatening the lives of the workers in the \ntunnels, but potentially cutting off steam and chilled water to the \nentire Capitol complex. The $27.6 million in emergency funding that \nSenator Allard and I are requesting is critical to allow the Architect \nof the Capitol to expeditiously address the deplorable conditions that \nexist in these utility tunnels and make the changes necessary to assure \nthat the health and safety of the workers is not jeopardized. This \nfunding will allow the Architect's office to immediately begin critical \ndesign work on replacing the ``Y'' tunnel, which is in the worst \ncondition, including structural repair, egress improvements, asbestos \nabatement, and temperature improvements. The funding will also \naccelerate work on replacing the roof on the ``R'' tunnel and for other \ncommunications, structural repairs, and emergency escape routes. \nWithout this funding, we continue to place these employees in life-\nthreatening working conditions. I urge my colleagues to support this \ncritically needed funding.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise tonight along with my colleagues \nSenator Allard and Senator Durbin to speak in support of an amendment \nwe introduced today to the Emergency Supplemental bill. This amendment \nprovides $27.6 million in Federal funds to repair unsafe working \nconditions in the tunnels below the Capitol Building. This amendment is \nneeded now because the Architect of the Capitol has failed to \nameliorate hazardous conditions that exist in the tunnels beneath the \nCapitol. These conditions endanger the health of the tunnel workers and \ntheir families. Something needs to be done, and it needs to be done \nnow. That is why I am co-sponsoring this amendment.\n  I first learned of these horrible conditions when I received a letter \nsigned by 10 members of the tunnel shop that detailed the dangerous \nconditions that exist in the tunnels, and provided information that \nsome of these conditions have existed for at least 6 years. There is no \ndoubt, many of problems in the tunnels have only worsened during that \nperiod from neglect and further deterioration. Despite this, no action \nwas taken to make sure the workers were safe on the job. The conditions \nare so poor that in 2000 the Congressional Office of Compliance issued \ncitations to the Architect of the Capitol. Yet, it appears the \nArchitect of the Capitol ignored the citations and did not make the \nnecessary repairs or take immediate, effective steps to protect these \nworkers. It was clear that these workers came to me only after all \nother recourse failed them.\n  In addition, the utility workers informed me that the U.S. Capitol \nPolice as a matter of policy are not allowed to patrol the tunnels; if \nit is true that U.S. Capitol Police are forbidden from patrolling the \ntunnels because of the hazardous conditions, then the failure to \naddress these conditions also has created a potentially serious \nsecurity loophole that could endanger all of us who work in the Capitol \nand surrounding buildings. This is unacceptable.\n  I agree with the workers that something needs to be done, and it \nneeds to be done now. I have already demanded that the Architect of the \nCapitol at a minimum take immediate steps to protect the employees who \nwork in the tunnels, ameliorate all of the conditions for which \ncitations were issued in 2000, obtain a comprehensive and credible \nsafety assessment that specifically addresses all hazardous conditions, \nand particularly the issues raised by the tunnel employees, develop and \nimplement a plan to remedy the hazardous conditions and maintain a safe \nworking environment, and address the security concerns these tunnels \npresent.\n  The response I received was that the Architect needs additional funds \nin order to make the necessary repairs. This amendment would provide \nthe money needed to make sure that these brave men working in tunnels \nare safe. The tunnel workers should not have to wait another day to be \nassured of a safe and secure working environment. They already have \nwaited too long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3701) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have one other unanimous consent. I ask \nunanimous consent that notwithstanding the Salazar amendment is now \npending I be allowed to send up the second-degree amendment to his \namendment No. 3645.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to \nsending up a second degree?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and my dear \nfriend from Washington for helping to organize the amendment sequence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside, and \nI call up No. 3710.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3710\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 3710.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require reports on policy and political developments in \n                                 Iraq)\n\n       On page 126, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\n          REPORTS ON POLICY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAQ\n\n       Sec. 1406. (a) Reports Required.--The President shall, not \n     later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act and every 30 days thereafter until a national unity \n     government has been formed in Iraq and the Iraq Constitution \n     has been amended in a manner that makes it a unifying \n     document, submit to Congress a report on United States policy \n     and political developments in Iraq.\n       (b) Elements.--Each report under subsection (a) shall \n     include the following information:\n       (1) Whether the Administration has told the Iraqi \n     political, religious, and tribal leaders that agreement by \n     the Iraqis on a government of national unity, and subsequent \n     agreement to amendments to the Iraq Constitution to make it \n     more inclusive, within the deadlines that the Iraqis set for \n     themselves in their Constitution, is a condition for the \n     continued presence of United States military forces in Iraq.\n       (2) The progress that has been made in the formation of a \n     national unity government and the obstacles, if any, that \n     remain.\n       (3) The progress that has been made in the amendment of the \n     Iraq Constitution to make it more of a unifying document and \n     the obstacles, if any, that remain.\n       (4) An assessment of the effect that the formation of, or \n     failure to form, a unity government, and the amendment of, or \n     failure to amend, the Iraq Constitution, will have on the \n     ``significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with \n     Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a \n     free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for \n     the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq'' \n     as expressed in the United States Policy in Iraq Act (section \n     1227 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2006 (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3465; 50 U.S.C. 1541 \n     note)).\n       (5) The specific conditions on the ground, including the \n     capability and leadership of Iraqi security forces, that \n     would lead to the phased redeployment of United States ground \n     combat forces from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is proposed on behalf of \nSenator Collins, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and myself, which \nrelates to Iraq. It would require certain reports be filed by the \nPresident and the administration relative to political developments \nthat exist in Iraq. We have a new prime minister who has been \ndesignated in Iraq. It is an important step. It is a useful step toward \nhopefully achieving a government of national unity. However, there are \nsome very critical steps that lie ahead, including the completion of \nthat government of national unity so that the Prime Minister-designate \ncan then form a government and have that government approved by the \nassembly. It is an important step. It involves the Interior Minister, \nwho is in control of the police, the Defense Minister, who is in \ncontrol of the Army, the Oil Minister, who controls the nation's key \nresource--oil--as well as the other ministries that are involved in any \ngovernment of national unity.\n  It is critically important that the political process succeed in Iraq \nand that the pressure be kept on the Iraqis to achieve a government of \nnational unity, and as well to consider amendments to its constitution. \nTheir constitution has some deadlines that are imposed by them. It is \nthose deadlines which it is critically important be met. These are not \nour deadlines. These are not dates we set. These aren't dates which \ncertain things must happen by that we are determining. These are dates \nthat the Iraqi Constitution has set up for the completion of a national \ngovernment and for consideration of amendments to the Iraqi \nConstitution.\n  Our amendment says that the President of the United States should \nreport to the Congress every 30 days on the progress which is being \nmade in terms of the political solution which has to be achieved there, \nboth in terms of a government of national unity as well as \nconsideration of amendments to the Constitution. It would ask the \nPresident to report to us as to whether he has informed the Iraqis that \nthe continued presence of the United States military forces depends \nupon their meeting the deadlines which they have set for themselves.\n  It also requires an assessment of the effect which the formation of \nor the failure to form a unity government and the amendment or failure \nto amend the Iraqi constitution would have on the significant \ntransition to full Iraqi sovereignty and to the Iraqi forces taking the \nlead in support of a free and sovereign Iraq, thereby creating the \nconditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from \nIraq as expressed in our law.\n  That policy was adopted by this Senate last year. Also in the reports \nthat are required, it would mandate that the conditions on the ground \nbe set forth by the President and whether those conditions would lead \nto the phased redeployment of our ground combat force. It is a \nreporting requirement.\n  In conclusion, this is not the amendment which we referred to last \nweek because there is no reference in this reporting amendment anymore \nto a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The original form of this \namendment had a reference to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. That was \nruled not to be in order by the Parliamentarian. We have, therefore, \ndropped the sense-of-the-Senate reference. This is now exclusively a \nreporting amendment. We hope the Senate will adopt this at the \nappropriate time.\n  Again, I thank the Chair and I thank our friends who are trying to \nkeep this sequence and are managing this bill. We appreciate their \ncourtesies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I will be brief and explain the \namendments. I thank my friend from Texas and others for allowing me to \ngo ahead.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3723\n\n  The first amendment is a very simple one. It asks the GAO for a \nreport that includes a review of the mergers between ExxonMobil, \nChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, and other significant mergers in the oil \nindustry that have occurred since 1990, to look at the impact that \nvitiating the mergers would have on market concentration, market power, \nwholesale and retail petroleum prices, and an assessment of the impact \nof prohibiting any one company from simultaneously owning assets in \neach of the oil industry sectors: exploration, refining, and \ndistribution.\n  To me, very simply put, one of the problems--not the only one--we \nhave is we have allowed the oil industry to become too concentrated, \nletting the No. 1 and No. 2 companies merge because there was a lull in \nthe market at a given time, and then letting No. 3 and No. 4 merge. The \nsecond largest foreign company, which I think is the sixth largest \nAmerican company, all created too much concentration. I think it is one \nof the reasons that these days we see the price as high as it is.\n  The prices are sticking. When the spot market goes up, the price \nimmediately goes up; when the spot market goes down, the price takes a \nlong time to go down. When Katrina affected Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, \nand Illinois, and they get most of their oil from the gulf, the price \ngoes up the same amount in California.\n  I think it is high time that we reviewed these mergers. I don't know \nif they can be undone. I don't know what the effect would be, but to \nsit here and shrug our shoulders at this recent phenomenon of mergers \ndoesn't make much sense. This amendment asks that a review be done.\n  The amendment would also provide more funding to the Energy \nInformation Agency to assure accurate, real-time collection of price \nand data supply. I think we are not getting that kind of accurate \ninformation.\n  The big oil companies like to be shielded behind the wall of \nconflicting data and interesting jargon. It is too easy for them to \npull the wool over consumers' eyes. The EIA is a nonpartisan \ngovernmental agency. This amendment would allow better information to \ncome forward and make sure that we do the right thing.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3724\n\n  The second amendment deals with port security. I know my colleague \nfrom New Jersey has offered one. I have been involved in this issue for \na long time, as has he. When I went with my friend from South Carolina, \nSenator Graham, to Hong Kong to visit the ports there, I was utterly \namazed at the port security system they have. It showed that we could \nhave speed both in commerce and security. Their checking of containers \nfor nuclear and\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nother types of devices, checking in a variety of different ways, and \nhaving computers crossmatch those ways is incredible.\n  My amendment would require that the system we saw--not the specific \nsystem but what the system does that we saw--be implemented at all \ncontainer security initiative ports around the world within 3 years. \nThere are 43 CSI ports. They account for 80 percent of worldwide \ncontainer traffic. It would be a huge boon to preventing the worst that \ncould befall our country, and that is a nuclear weapon be smuggled into \nour ports.\n  The amendment mandates that every container pass through the same \ntype of layered screening system, as at the terminal port in Hong Kong. \nEvery container must pass through an advanced radiation portal, \ninternal imaging system, be tagged and cataloged with a label, an RRFI, \nor a GPS device. It would make us far more secure.\n  The second amendment also requires that Homeland Security send to \nCongress within 180 days a detailed plan on how to deploy this system.\n  Those are the two amendments. I look forward to debating them as we \nmove forward.\n  I thank my colleagues from Mississippi, Washington, and Texas for \ntheir courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside in order that I may call up the Kennedy \namendments numbered 3716 and 3688.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3716 and 3688 En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send the amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes amendments numbered 3716 and 3688 en bloc.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3716\n\n        (Purpose: To provide funds to promote democracy in Iraq)\n\n       On page 126, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n\n          UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ\n\n       Sec. 1406. (a) Of the funds provided in this chapter for \n     the Economic Support Fund, not less than $96,000,000 should \n     be made available through the Bureau of Democracy, Human \n     Rights, and Labor of the Department of State, in coordination \n     with the United States Agency for International Development \n     where appropriate, to United States nongovernmental \n     organizations for the purpose of supporting broad-based \n     democracy assistance programs in Iraq that promote the long \n     term development of civil society, political parties, \n     election processes, and parliament in that country.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3688\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the covered countermeasures process \n                             fund program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FUNDING FOR THE COVERED COUNTERMEASURES PROCESS \n                   FUND.\n\n       For an additional amount for funding the Covered \n     Countermeasures Process Fund under section 319F-4 of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6e), $289,000,000: \n     Provided, That the amounts provided for under this section \n     shall be designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress): Provided \n     further, That amounts provided for under this section shall \n     remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment No. 3716 provides $96 \nmillion for American non-governmental organizations helping Iraqis to \ncreate the essential building blocks of democracy. It also requires the \nSecretary of State to provide Congress with its short and long-term \nplans to strengthen democracy at the regional, provincial, and national \nlevels in Iraq.\n  Last year, Iraq passed several important milestones on the long road \nto democracy. However, as important as the two elections and the \nreferendum on the constitution were, they were not decisive, and it is \nfar from clear that democracy is being firmly established in Iraq.\n  The process of building democratic institutions is different and \nrequires patience in developing effective governmental structures, a \ngenuine rule of law, political parties committed to peaceful means, an \nactive civil society, and a free press. Constructive international \nengagement is essential as well in the case of Iraq. For a country as \nheavily repressed as long as Iraq, democracy will take even longer to \ntake root.\n  It is far from clear, however, that the Bush administration has a \nlong-term strategy--or even a short-term strategy--to solidify and \ncontinue the democratic gains that have been made so far.\n  American non-governmental organizations such as the National \nDemocratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, IFES, formerly known as the \nInternational Foundation for Election Systems, the International \nResearch and Exchanges Board and America's Development Foundation are \nwell respected in Iraq and throughout the world. Each has substantial \noperations in Iraq, and their work is essential to the administration's \ngoal of building a stable democracy in Iraq.\n  Yet despite their success so far in helping to promote democracy and \nthe enormous risks their employees take by working in the war zone, the \nadministration has made no long-term commitment to provide funding for \ntheir work in Iraq. Each organization operates on pins and needles, \nnever knowing when their funding for Iraq operations will dry up.\n  The American non-governmental organization IFES has been in Iraq \nsince October 2003. It has provided technical assistance in each of \nIraq's elections so far, and it has been asked to provide such \nassistance for regional and provincial elections scheduled for April \n2007.\n  It is also preparing for a possible second referendum on the \nconstitution, and is assisting as well in the enactment and \nimplementation of legislation governing the operations, of a new \nelection council for local elections.\n  Inexplicably, funding will run out in June, and the administration \nhas not yet committed any additional funds. None of the funds in this \nsupplemental spending bill are set-aside for it, and none of the meager \n$63 million requested in the fiscal year 2007 budget for democracy-\nbuilding is intended for IFES either. Our amendment would provide $20 \nmillion to sustain its democracy work in Iraq for the next 18 months, \nthrough the end of fiscal year 2007.\n  An independent media is also essential to a successful democracy. A \nU.S. non-governmental organization, the International Research and \nExchanges Board, IREX, is working in Iraq to see that the Iraqi people \nhave independent, professional, high quality news and public affairs \ninformation. To create an environment in which a free press can \nflourish, it is also seeking to establish a legal, regulatory, and \npolicy environment that supports independent media.\n  IREX's funding for these important programs is also running out, and \nit will be forced to close its operations this summer, which would pull \nthe rug out from under many struggling new press organizations in Iraq. \nOur amendment would provide $6 million to sustain IREX's democracy work \nin Iraq for the next 18 months.\n  In addition, the non-governmental organization America's Development \nFoundation provides essential aid to support and sustain civil society \nin Iraq. ADF and its partner civil society organizations in Iraq have \nprovided training and assistance to thousands of Iraqi government \nofficials at the national, regional, and local levels on issues such as \nanti-corruption, transparency, accountability, fiscal responsibility, \nwhistleblower protection, and the development of non-government \norganizations.\n  ADF wants to continue its work, but its funding will end in June. \nUSAID supports this work and has a contract pending, but it doesn't \nhave the resources to do so. Our amendment provides $16 million to \nsustain its work over the next 18 months.\n  Similarly, the National Endowment for Democracy has no clear sense of \nwhat the future holds for them in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\n  Two of the endowment's core grantees--the Center for International \nPrivate Enterprise and the Labor Solidarity Center in Iraq--have \nimportant democracy promotion functions.\n  Since opening a regional office in Baghdad in October 2003, the \nCenter for International Private Enterprise has worked to build \ncapacity for market oriented democratic reform in Iraq. It has provided \ntraining and grant support to approximately 22 Iraqi business \nassociations and chambers of commerce.\n  The Labor Solidarity Center works directly with Iraqi trade unions to \ndevelop skills in strengthening independent and democratic trade \nunions.\n  In addition, the endowment partners with 32 local organizations on \nthe ground in Iraq to promote and sustain civil society projects on \npolitical development, raising awareness of women's rights, and \nencouraging the free flow of information to Iraqi citizens.\n  The endowment wants to continue working directly with the Iraqi \npeople and be able to guarantee continuity in its democracy grants to \nIraqi organizations. But no funding is set aside in this bill or in the \nfiscal year 2007 budget for its programs.\n  Our amendment provides $10 million to sustain the democracy programs \nof the Center for International Private Enterprise, the Labor \nSolidarity Center, and the Endowment for Democracy's local partners for \n18 months.\n  Similarly, the International Republican Institute and the National \nDemocratic institute are doing truly impressive work in Iraq under \nextraordinarily difficult circumstances.\n  The International Republican Institute programs in Iraq have focused \non three principal goals: development of an issue-based political party \nsystem; establishment of the foundation for a more transparent and \nresponsive government; and the emergence of an active and politically \ninvolved civil society.\n  The National Democratic Institute supports a number of democracy \nprograms in Iraq as well, with emphasis on political parties, \ngovernance, civil society and women's rights. It has four offices in \nIraq to promote these essential building blocks of strong democracy, \nand it works directly with Iraqi partners and hundreds of local civic \norganization.\n  Both IRI and NDI want to continue to build these essential links \nbetween the government and political parties, in order to enable the \ngovernment to become more responsive and effective in addressing the \nneeds of Iraq's people.\n  Despite the impressive contribution of these two Institutes to \ndemocracy in Iraq, neither is guaranteed future funding for its \nprograms. The administration's budget provides only $7.5 million for \neach Institute--enough for just two months of operating expenses. Our \namendment provides an additional $22 million for each institute's \nessential democracy programs in Iraq for the next 18 months.\n  Thousands of Iraqis are working hard, often at great risk to \nthemselves, to develop civic groups, participate in political parties \nand election, and run for and serve in political office. The dramatic \npictures of Iraqis waving their purple fingers after voting in past \nelections remind us of the enormous stakes.\n  Progress to avoid civil war and defeat the insurgency is directly \nrelated to progress on democracy-building, and ongoing work on this \nall-important issue must be a top priority.\n  We must be clear in our commitment to stand by these organizations \nthat are working on the front lines in the struggle for democracy in \nIraq every day. We also need to demonstrate to Iraqis and others that \nwe are committed to Iraq's long-term democratic development. We need a \nlong-term plan and a long-term strategy that is backed by appropriate \nresources.\n  President Bush has called for patience in Iraq. He should heed his \nown advice. He can't speak about having patience for democracy in Iraq, \nand then cut funding for the groups who are assisting so capably in its \ndevelopment.\n  Our financial commitment to the organizations at the forefront of the \ndemocracy effort must be strong and unambiguous. By failure to \nguarantee continuity for their programs, we send a confusing signal \nthat can only be harmful for this very important effort.\n  We are now spending more than $1 billion a week for military \noperations for the war in Iraq. At this rate, it would take the \nmilitary less than 1 day to spend the $96 million provided in this \namendment for democracy promotion. Surely, we can commit this level of \nfunding for democracy programs over the next 18 months.\n  Regardless of whether we supported or opposed the war, we all agree \nthat the work of building democracy requires patience, skill, \nguaranteed continuity, and adequate resources.\n  It makes no sense to shortchange Iraq's political development. We \nneed a long-term political strategy, and we must back up that strategy \nwith the needed resources, if we truly hope to achieve a stable, \npeaceful and democratic Iraq.\n  Our amendment provides the resources necessary to ensure continuity \nin these democracy programs in Iraq, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3600\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, on amendment 3722, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Kyl be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the hour is getting late, but I \nappreciate the opportunity to talk a little bit about the impact of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita on the State of Texas.\n  As a member of the Committee on the Budget, I am keenly aware of our \nfiscal challenges. During the consideration of the budget resolution, I \nhad offered an amendment which would slow the growth of mandatory \nspending, hopefully to allow a little bit more flexibility so we can \nfund our Nation's priorities while we also manage our fiscal house.\n  The amendments I have offered that I wish to talk about at this time \nare No. 3699 and No. 3672. These amendments aim to make Texas whole \nfrom the 2005 hurricanes, and it won't cost the Federal Treasury a \nsingle dime more. They are specifically tailored to deal with the needs \nthat are true emergencies in every sense of the word.\n  I need to set the record straight about some misperceptions with \nregard to the state of my State; in particular, the impact these two \nnatural disasters, the worst storms in our Nation's history, Hurricanes \nRita and Katrina, had on the State of Texas.\n  Although the State was not hit directly by Hurricane Katrina, it was \nsignificantly affected by that storm. It came in a flood of evacuees \nfleeing New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. In a matter of days, the \nTexas population grew by roughly the size of an average U.S. city, some \nhalf a million people, many of whom you see pictured to my right in a \npicture of the Astrodome floor where the evacuees were housed \ntemporarily. It is estimated that at one point, there were 17,500 \npeople housed at the Astrodome. It was only one of four megasites in \nHouston to house evacuees. Another 4,000 were housed at Reliant Arena \nand 2,300 at Reliant Center. The George R. Brown Convention Center in \ndowntown Houston took the remaining people, about 2,800 evacuees.\n  I have shown a picture of the city of Houston, but this is just one \nlarge concentration of the evacuees of Hurricane Katrina. We can show \nsimilar pictures of evacuation sites and housing sites all around the \nState. It was obviously no small feat to take care of the needs of \nthese people who just had their homes and their lives taken away from \nthem as they previously knew them.\n  I remember shortly after this occurred there were many people who \nwould stop me here in the Senate, in the hallways of the Senate office \nbuildings, around Washington, DC, and elsewhere and tell me how \nthankful and grateful they were that the people of\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\nTexas were so willing to take in their neighbors at a time of need.\n  The fact is, a large number of the people who have come to Texas in \nthe wake of Hurricane Katrina are those with some of the greatest \nneeds. That was true where they lived previously--many of them in \nLouisiana--and among the people were those with the greatest needs in \nour country in general. This shows thousands of people in Houston and \nelsewhere who were in wheelchairs. This man has a cane, and many of \nthese individuals had special needs. They were not necessarily able-\nbodied when they came to the State. This obviously has put an \nincredible strain on Texas's local support systems in the midst of this \nflood, a flood of humanity.\n  This hurricane and the subsequent hurricane, Hurricane Rita, went \nstraight up the Sabine River between Texas and Louisiana. I still \nremember talking to one of the computer scientists who had actually \nmodeled the potential impact on the State if Hurricane Rita had not \ntaken a right-hand turn and gone up right through southeast Texas. He \nsaid that if a category 4 hurricane hit Houston, there would be a \nminimum of $80 billion in additional property damage. Thank goodness \nthat did not happen, and thank goodness there was no loss of life on a \nmassive scale. But that was primarily because of the evacuation of the \ncity of Houston and the fact that Mother Nature decided to spare \nHouston a direct hit while it took a right-hand turn straight up the \nSabine River between Texas and Louisiana.\n  The coast, private property, critical infrastructure, and millions of \nlives were devastated by the storm. As this picture indicates--and I am \nsure the Senator from Mississippi and other Senators from other States \ndirectly affected can identify with the devastation we see here--this \nis just one example of the devastation in southeast Texas caused by \nHurricane Rita.\n  In light of these two unprecedented events, Texas counties that were \nmost seriously affected need help, like the other affected regions of \nour country that are more visible. I am sorry to say, notwithstanding \nall of the good work that has been done by the Federal Government, the \nreimbursements now range in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but \nTexas has not been made completely whole as a result of these \nhurricanes.\n  I am deeply troubled by reports I have received from some that there \nis a widespread perception that Texas is doing just fine and that we \nsomehow managed to absorb half a million people, including their needs \nfor housing, food, security, health care, education, and employment, \njust to name a few, and that somehow some people still believe that \nTexas should have no special need for additional Federal assistance, no \nneed to make the State whole or to have restored to us a reasonable \nportion of the resources we willingly gave and continue to give to our \nneighbors in need.\n\n  Consider that the parishes of western Louisiana that were most \ndirectly affected by Hurricane Rita--not Katrina--were granted a much \nmore favorable Federal-State cost-sharing ratio of 90 percent Federal \nto 10 percent State versus the 75/25 that was granted to Texas. The \ncounties in southeastern Texas were denied that same benefit, even \nthough their damage was similar and they suffered a similar impact. The \nonly difference we are talking about here is on which side of the \nSabine River these counties were located.\n  I am in no way minimizing the devastation and destruction that \naffected places such as New Orleans and Mississippi, Alabama, and \nelsewhere. They have suffered tremendously. But the people of Texas \nhave experienced their share of destruction, as well. So I take this \nopportunity for a few moments to provide my colleagues with a summary, \na snapshot of the current situation in Texas nearly 9 months after half \na million evacuees flooded our State.\n  Based on FEMA registrations, an estimated 450,000 to 490,000 Katrina \nevacuees currently remain in Texas. Approximately 5,900 are individuals \nwith essential needs that I mentioned a moment ago, those who are \nmentally or physically disabled, frail, or otherwise require special \ncare. Approximately 286,000 of the evacuees are still housed in Texas \nhotels. Approximately 130,000 of them are in rental housing. Only \n27,000 housing units are now even available to the Texas Department of \nHousing and Community Affairs.\n  Many Texas communities were hit with a one-two punch: first, \nproviding shelter to half a million Katrina evacuees and then suffering \nenormous devastation from Hurricane Rita themselves. Funds are needed \nto provide housing assistance to Texas residents whose homes were \ndamaged by Hurricane Rita and to assist the nearly 400,000 residents of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama who continue to reside in Texas, \nalbeit on a temporary basis.\n  Unfortunately, Texas only received $74.5 million of the $11.5 billion \nmade available in the community development block grants in last year's \nDefense appropriations bill. The Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment has estimated that more than 27,000 homes in southeast \nTexas and 75,000 homes throughout the State were damaged or destroyed \nwhile thousands of businesses suffered heavy damage resulting in more \nthan $1 billion in loss. I have offered an amendment that ensures Texas \nand all other States affected by hurricane devastation receive no less \nthan 3.5 percent of the $5.2 billion included in the bill for CDBG.\n  I note that Senator Landrieu, from Louisiana, is one of the \nconsponsors of that amendment.\n  Considering Texas has taken in almost half a million evacuees, it \nseems reasonable we would receive a modest 3.5 percent of the funds \nallocated for housing.\n  With regard to jobs and welfare, currently about 62,000 evacuees are \nreceiving food stamps from the State of Texas allotment. Of these, 97 \npercent are from Louisiana. Sixty-one percent of the food stamp \nrecipients stated in a poll that they expected to return to their State \nwithin 3 months. Yet notwithstanding their response to the poll, they \nremain in Texas, and we must provide for them. Texas Workforce \nCommission has worked diligently to process more than 60,000 \nunemployment claims from Louisiana. Yet there are thousands more who \nwill need employment training skills as they remain in our State.\n  One of the amendments I have offered directs the Secretary of Labor \nto prioritize States that have taken in Hurricane Katrina and Rita \nevacuees when distributing the remainder of fiscal year 2006 national \nemergency grants.\n  I note that Senator Hutchison has joined me as cosponsor. I ask \nunanimous consent that she be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. With regard to health care to help accommodate the large \ninflux of people to Texas, my State was given a waiver by the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services that allows the State to reimburse \nproviders who incurred costs for uncompensated health care. Evacuees at \nany income level who did not have insurance coverage were provided \nmedically necessary health care through this waiver. Texas provided \nevacuees health care, long-term care, prescription medicines, and \nmedical transportation through two programs, Medicaid and the \nUncompensated Care Program. Those not eligible for the Medicaid Program \nbut who had incomes below a certain cutoff were provided coverage under \nthe Uncompensated Care Program.\n  I next will talk about education. This chart depicts an evacuee, a \nyoung lady who is showing up for elementary school. There were 45,099 \nKatrina evacuees enrolled in Texas on October 13. Today, there are \nstill about 36,000 Katrina children in our public schools alone. The \nphoto next to me depicts one of the many such centers that were quickly \nestablished at conference centers and temporary shelters to register \nchildren who had evacuated to our State. Each of these children \nrepresents a cost of about $7,500 a year for the State of Texas to \neducate.\n  Furthermore, approximately 5,000 Katrina evacuees are currently \nenrolled in Texas public universities and colleges. I give special \ncredit to Texas institutions of higher education that took in students \nand faculty from other States with limited reimbursement.\n  This massive evacuation, this wave of humanity, also has had an \nimpact on\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\ncrime in our State. According to a recent news article, evacuees have \nbeen victims of or accused of committing 39 of the 235 murders in \nHouston since last September, according to Houston's police chief, \nHarold Hurtt. In the month of January, Houston saw a 34-percent rise in \nfelonies over the previous year. This city had 800 officers retire in \nthe past 2 years; it recently moved 100 officers working in city jails \nto high-crime areas while also significantly increasing overtime. It is \nno small thing to reallocate those resources which are already \nstretched thin.\n  Texas has given generously of its resources to our neighbors during a \ntime of need. That is something we will continue to do and that we are \nenormously proud of. I have made a commitment to the people of my State \nthat I will do all I can to ensure that the affected communities are \nreimbursed for the cost of providing care to victims of Katrina and \nthat those affected by Hurricane Rita will receive fair treatment as \nthey also face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives.\n  This shown here is another picture. Here again, I am sure the Senator \nfrom Mississippi recognizes this kind of devastation, with cars turned \non end as a result of the force of the storm in southeast Texas. I am \ntalking now about Hurricane Rita again.\n  When the good people of my State signed up for helping their \nneighbors, they were in it for the long haul. We will continue to \nsupport the evacuees who come to our State, even as we work to recover \nourselves from Hurricane Rita. But I am here to make sure we have the \ntools and the resources necessary to do the job right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3599\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I believe we have no other amendments \nSenators want to offer on our side tonight.\n  I ask our colleagues on the other side if they have any further \namendments to offer tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank all Senators for the \ncooperation\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nwe received during today's consideration of amendments to H.R. 4939, \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill. We have taken up a lot \nof amendments to the bill, and we have heard a lot of debate. We know \nthis will continue probably on into next week before we complete action \non the bill. But we look forward to considering any suggestions that \nSenators have for improving the legislation. We would just as soon they \ndid not spend a lot of time finding ways to improve the bill. But we \nthink we made good progress today.\n  We thank all Senators and especially Senator Murray for her help in \nmanaging the bill today. Senator Byrd, the ranking Democrat, the senior \nDemocrat, on the committee, has been a friend for a long time, and I \nhave appreciated his help and counsel and advice and assistance as \nwell.\n  I know of nothing further to come before the Senate, so we will await \nthe advice of the leader before any further action is taken.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Florida was hit by four \nhurricanes in 2005, a devastating year for killer storms. Starting with \nDelmis in July, followed by Katrina in August, Rita in September, and \nfinishing with Wilma in October, when the hurricane season finally \nended, 39 of Florida's 67 counties had been declared Federal disaster \nareas. In the aftermath, 40,000 roofs were repaired by the Army Corps; \n``Blue Roof' program and approximately 3,000 temporary trailers were \nused as housing for Floridians left homeless by the storms.\n  While I am emely appreciative of the assistance extended to Florida \nby this body, today I joined Senators Cornyn and Hutchison of Texas and \nSenator Landrieu of Louisiana on an amendment to H.R. 4939, the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, which ensures no State will receive \nan allocation ofless than 3.5 percent of the $5.2 billion included in \nthis bill for disaster Community Development Block Grant funds. This is \nextremely important to the panhandle of Florida because the last \nsuppemental appropriation bill of fiscal year 2006 did not include \nHurricane Dennis.\n  After Dennis made landfall, 27 percent or over 12,000 homes were \ndamaged in Santa Rosa County the same region decimated by Hurricane \nIvan in 2004, Escambia County suffered $73.8 million in damages from \nDennis. Franklin County's oyster beds and processing plant were nearly \ndestroyed. Parts of Wakulla County were left under water by storm \nsurges of more than 10 feet. I have not forgotten Dennis' victims and \nwant them to know I am fighting for them.\n  South Florida will also benefit greatly from additional CDBG dollars. \nWith total insured losses of $8 billion, Wilma is ranked the second \nmost expensive hurricane among the eight to strike Florida during 2004 \nand 2005.\n  I thank the committee for crafting language in the bill we are now \nconsidering which would make communities impacted by Dennis eligible \nfor relief. Further, I note the House did not include similar language \nand urge my colleagues in the Florida delegation to fight to keep the \nSenate provision intact during conference.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment this afternoon and \ndiscuss this supplemental and the need to restore some fiscal \nresponsibility to this body. America has had some big challenges thrown \nat it over the last 5 years 9/11, the war on terror, and Hurricane \nKatrina and those challenges have required some commitment from the \nFederal Treasury. I accept that. But Congress can not continue to spend \nwithout restraint, and this administration can not continue to rely on \nthe use of emergency supplementals to circumvent the congressional \nbudget process.\n  When the President sent his budget request for fiscal year 2007 up to \nCongress, the administration indicated that Congress should expect some \nemergency supplemental requests as well. On February 16, the \nadministration asked for $92.2 billion in emergency funding for the war \non terror and hurricane recovery. I think we need to ask some tough \nquestions about budget processes and emergency funding requests. Do all \nof these dollars truly belong outside the normal budget and \nappropriations debate? I support the war on terror, and I am \nsympathetic to the devastation caused by the hurricanes, but neither of \nthose events justifies a blank check from Congress.\n  The President has asked for $92.2 billion, and I think that--at a \nminimum--we need to work our way back to that number in conference. We \nneed to take a careful look at all of the President's requests, as well \nas the priorities that other Senators have, and make a decision as to \nwhether these provisions are truly emergency needs.\n  I realize that some of my colleagues might take exception to these \ncomments, since I have pushed for agricultural disaster assistance. I \nbelieve the most important component of that package is the energy \nassistance payments, to help farmers manage unprecedented increases in \nthe cost of fuel and fertilizer price increases that were caused in \nlarge part by the hurricanes. Congress has been generous in addressing \ngulf coast recovery, but we cannot address some of the impact while \nleaving others to absorb the full impact of an unforeseeable disaster. \nProducers have waited and waited, watching one supplemental after \nanother go by without their legitimate concerns being addressed.\n  Budgets are about priorities--allocating the right amount of money to \nthe right places at the right time for the right reasons. We have \nlimited resources, and we need to allocate them wisely. I am confident \nthat, working in good faith with our colleagues in the House and the \nadministration, we can bring the overall dollar figure down, while \nstill addressing the truly pressing needs that are out there.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I had hoped we could have made further \nprogress on the emergency supplemental bill. Unfortunately, today we \nwere only able to dispose of two amendments with rollcall votes--only \ntwo amendments. I am disappointed that the Senator from Oregon \nprevented us from voting on some of the amendments that had been in the \nqueue, in line, and ready for votes.\n  Having said that, we know this is an emergency bill, supplemental \nemergency spending. Time is of the essence. Tomorrow there is a retreat \non the other side of the aisle, and therefore we will not be able to \nmake further progress. For that reason, I will send a cloture motion to \nthe desk to ensure we can finish this emergency bill at a reasonable \ntime next week.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I now send that cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     391, H.R. 4939, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \n     for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane \n     Recovery, 2006.\n         Bill Frist, Thad Cochran, Judd Gregg, Lamar Alexander, \n           Wayne Allard, Johnny Isakson, Mitch McConnell, Mel \n           Martinez, Orrin Hatch, Kay Bailey Hutchison, George \n           Allen, Norm Coleman, Pat Roberts, Richard Shelby, Larry \n           Craig, Richard Burr, Robert F.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who has been honored with a very distinguished \naward. I\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nunderstand that philanthropist Richard Goldman got the inspiration for \nthe Goldman Environmental Prize after reading about the winners of the \nNobel Prize, and wondering why there was no equivalent for \nextraordinary efforts to conserve our natural environment.\n  Now, less than two decades since its inception, the Goldman \nEnvironmental Prize has risen to rival the Nobel as a marker of \nachievement. Every one of this year's winners fought to protect the \nenvironment in a way that affected the lives of thousands, if not \nmillions, of others, often alone and at great personal cost. All of \nthem have my admiration. And I am grateful the Goldman Environmental \nPrize will continue to recognize and reward conservationists who \nprotect the land, and promote the well-being of the people who use it.\n  All of that said, I speak today for one reason. Craig Williams has \nbeen a friend for over 20 years, and an inspiration. Craig won this \naward because he dared to speak out against an immovable, hidebound \nbureaucracy--the Department of Defense--and he won. He is proof that, \nsometimes, David really can slay Goliath. This year, he has been \nhonored as the North American recipient of the Goldman Environmental \nPrize.\n  For 20 years, Craig's vigilance has proven invaluable in ongoing \nefforts to ensure the Department of Defense destroys its hundreds of \ntons of chemical weapons as safely and efficiently as possible. These \ndeadly materials are stored at Blue Grass Army Depot, which is near \nCraig's home in Berea, KY, and at several other locations across the \nUnited States. Thanks to his activism, we are closer than we ever have \nbeen to taking tangible steps towards removing these heinous weapons \nfrom the face of the Earth once and for all.\n  Craig's biggest fans are his neighbors, the people of Madison County, \nKY. To them, Craig is an absolute hero. Imagine if you lived just a \nshort distance away from over 500 tons of the deadliest materials ever \nconceived by man, VX nerve agent. As little as 10 milligrams of VX will \nkill a human being. That is about the mass of 10 grains of sand. If \ninhaled, death is immediate.\n  Too many people have lived for too long with that mortal threat \nhanging over them. Thanks to Craig, they can see light at the end of \nthe tunnel.\n  Obviously, Craig is very effective. But let me explain why he is so \neffective. First of all, he is tenacious. After 20 years of commitment \nto this cause--with little or no pay or recognition--he and the \nnationwide group of concerned citizens he founded, the Chemical Weapons \nWorking Group, are more active than ever.\n  A lot of people come to Congress every day with dire warnings about \nthis or that issue. And a lot of them turn out to be Chicken Littles, \nwarning about a sky that never falls. Craig is no Chicken Little. He is \ncredible, because he knows what he is talking about. I listen to Craig, \nas do my Senate colleagues, because he is so often right.\n  The work Craig and I have done together is a perfect model for how \ngovernment can and ought to work with the people it serves. Too often, \ncollaboration between lawmakers and informed citizens--also known as \nlobbyists, please excuse my language, I know that is a dirty word--is \nportrayed as unethical or sleazy.\n  The truth is that the vast majority of people who come to Congress \nfor help are people like Craig Williams. They have a lot of passion, a \nlot of knowledge, and want to persuade the government to use its power \nfor their cause.\n  Craig's cause is just, and his advocacy is persuasive. When Craig \ntells me something, I know it is worthy of consideration, and I will be \ninclined to move the levers of government to get the results he and I \nwant. For 20 years I have been happy to do just that. Government works \nbecause of people like Craig Williams.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Craig Williams on \nthis well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3693-S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO THE NEPALI PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about recent events \nin Nepal.\n  As Senators are aware, last February 1 King Gyanendra seized absolute \npower, dissolved the multiparty government, and imprisoned his \npolitical opponents. He justified his power grab as necessary to bring \npeace and democracy to that impoverished Himalayan nation that has been \nin the throes of a bloody conflict with Maoist insurgents for a decade.\n  Yet, as many predicted, in the past year the Maoists have gained \nstrength while Nepal's fledgling democratic institutions have been \nbadly weakened. Finally recognizing that the King's real purpose was to \nconsolidate his own power and take the country back to the feudal days \nof his father, the people lost patience.\n  Over the past few weeks, hundreds of thousands of Nepali citizens \ntook to the streets in a show of defiance and braved bullets, clubs, \nand tear gas to force the King to back down.\n  Tomorrow, Nepal's Parliament will reconvene and it is expected to \nbegin discussion of a date for the election of a constituent assembly \nto draft a new constitution. Among the key issues to be addressed is \nwhat role, if any, the monarchy will have in Nepal's democratic future. \nAnother necessary step will be to guarantee the army's subservience to \ncivilian authority.\n  I wish to pay tribute to the people of Nepal. They have suffered for \ngenerations from poverty, discrimination, corruption, and repression. \nYet through it all they have persevered, and they have shown that not \neven the most recalcitrant despot who uses the national army as his own \npalace guard can withstand the will of the people when they are \nprepared to risk their lives for freedom.\n  Today, Nepal begins a new chapter in its history. The future is far \nfrom certain and the road ahead is filled with potential pitfalls. But \nno one can doubt the opportunity that this moment offers, nor the \nimportance of what is at stake for Nepal.\n  It is up to Nepal's political parties, whose leaders have too often \nput their own personal ambitions ahead of the good of the country, to \nshow that they have a practical vision for the future and that they can \ngovern. In a democracy that means dialogue, it means tolerance, it \nmeans compromise, it means acting in good faith as representatives of \nthe people, it means keeping one's commitments, and it means being \nwilling to step aside for the next generation when it is their turn.\n  The Maoists must also recognize that the Nepali people's foremost \ndesire is peace. The Maoists have announced another cease-fire, which \nis welcome, but there is no justification for any return to violence. \nToo many innocent people have died and too many Nepali families have \nsuffered needlessly. It is time for the Maoists to renounce violence \nand join in a national dialogue to restore democracy and develop a \nstrategy to address the root causes of the conflict.\n  The international community, particularly India, the United States, \nGreat Britain, China, and the United Nations, also have an important \nrole to play in supporting Nepal at this critical time. Like \nAfghanistan, East Timor, and other unstable countries emerging from \nyears of conflict, Nepal will need technical assistance for the \nelection of a constituent assembly and the drafting of a new \nconstitution. It will need international monitors of the cease-fire and \nof the observance of human rights by both Maoists and the army. It will \nneed resources to help build the institutions of democracy and to hold \naccountable those on both sides of the conflict who are responsible for \natrocities.\n  During the 5 years of his troubled rein, King Gyanendra took Nepal to \nthe brink of disaster. He stubbornly ignored the pleas of Nepal's \nfriends. He shamelessly used the army to trample on the people's \ncherished rights. He squandered his opportunity to continue on the path \nof his predecessor to nurture democracy and help guide Nepal into the \n21st century.\n  The Nepali people, 15 of whom gave their lives in the protests, want \nnothing less than a democratic future. They want a government that \nrespects the worth of every Nepali, regardless of the family they come \nfrom, their ethnicity, religion, gender or profession. It is time for \nNepal's leaders to show that they are worthy of the Nepali people's \nconfidence and support.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3693-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3693-S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO THE NEPALI PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, last Thursday marked the seventh \nanniversary of the tragic Columbine High School shooting. None of us \nwill forget the sight of hundreds of terrified students running out of \ntheir high school while police and S.W.A.T. team members frantically \nsearched for 2 young gunmen who, before taking their own lives, had \nmurdered 12 innocent children, a teacher, and wounded 2 dozen other \nstudents.\n  In the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, I said I would try to make \na statement each week on the issue of commonsense gun safety to help \ndraw attention to an issue that, unfortunately, continues to go \nunaddressed. Heidi Yewman, who graduated from Columbine High School 13 \nyears before the shooting, wrote about her frustrations and the lack of \ncongressional attention to this issue in a recent newspaper editorial. \nAs she put it, ``This summer I will attend my 20-year high school \nreunion, and Topic A will be as it has been for the past seven years \nthe massacre and what hasn't happened since.'' I will ask that the text \nof Ms. Yewman's editorial be printed in the Record.\n  One of the things mentioned by Ms. Yewman that hasn't happened since \nthe Columbine High School shootings is a Federal requirement of a \nbackground check on the sale of all firearms, including those that are \nsold at gun shows. Under current law, when an individual buys a firearm \nfrom a licensed dealer, there are Federal requirements for a background \ncheck to insure that the purchaser is not prohibited by law from \npurchasing or possessing a gun. However, this is not the case for all \ngun purchases. For example, when an individual wants to buy a firearm \nfrom another private citizen who is not a licensed gun dealer, there is \nno Federal requirement that the seller ensure the purchaser is not in a \nprohibited category. This creates a loophole in the law, making it easy \nfor criminals, terrorists, and other prohibited buyers to evade \nbackground checks and buy guns from private citizens. This loophole \ncreates a gateway to the illegal market because criminals know they \nwill not be subject to a background check when purchasing from another \nprivate citizen even at a gun show.\n  During the 108th Congress, I cosponsored an amendment that passed the \nSenate which would have required background checks on all firearms sold \nat gun shows. However, when the Senate passed the amendment, the \nNational Rifle Association and its allies in the Senate then removed \ntheir support for the underlying bill and it was defeated. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has failed to address this important gun \nsafety issue since.\n  In the years since the Columbine High School shootings, Congress has \nalso failed to renew the 1994 assault weapons ban. On September 13, \n2004, this legislation was allowed to expire, allowing 19 previously \nbanned assault weapons, including the TEC-9 handgun used by the \nColumbine shooters, and other firearms with military style features to \nbe legally sold again.\n  I have cosponsored legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the \nassault weapons ban. Last Congress, the Senate adopted an amendment to \nreauthorize the assault weapons ban for 10 years. However, like the \namendment to close the gun show loophole, the bill to which the \namendment was attached was later defeated, and despite the fact that a \nbipartisan majority of Senators voted to support reauthorizing the ban \non assault weapons, the Republican leadership has refused to schedule \nanother vote on the issue.\n  Mr. President, the threat of gun violence in our schools and \ncommunities has not diminished. Last week alone, as families and \nfriends remembered those who were lost in the Columbine shootings, law \nenforcement officials apparently thwarted planned Columbine-style \nschool shootings in Kansas, Alaska, Mississippi, and Washington. \nAccording to published reports, students in at least two of these small \ntowns had already acquired the guns and ammunition necessary to carry \nout such an attack.\n  Were it not for the courage of the students who stepped forward to \nreport violent threats from their fellow students and the investigative \nwork by law enforcement officials that followed, another community \nmight well have had to face the horror that the residents of Littleton, \nCO, faced 7 years ago. Congress must take up and pass common sense gun \nsafety legislation to help prevent such tragedies from occurring in the \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the before-mentioned editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Columbian, Apr. 16, 2006]\n\n         Local View: Gun Advocates Ignore Lessons of Columbine\n\n                           (By Heidi Yewman)\n\n       This summer I will attend my 20-year high school reunion, \n     and Topic A will be as it has been for the past seven years--\n     the massacre and what hasn't happened since.\n       Seven years ago, this Thursday (April 20), two teenage \n     gunmen massacred 12 students and one teacher at my school, \n     Columbine High in Colorado. That teacher, my high school \n     basketball coach Dave Sanders, bled to death after being shot \n     in the chest; 24 other people were injured.\n       It was a terrible, sad day that sparked massive debate \n     regarding guns and gun laws in the United States. Much \n     discussion also centered on the nature of high school cliques \n     and bullying, violent movies and video games, but mostly on \n     guns like the two shotguns, the assault rifle, and the TEC-9 \n     assault pistol that the two troubled kids at Columbine used \n     to shoot their victims before killing themselves.\n       So what exactly has changed as a result of all that \n     despair, discussion and debate?\n       Virtually nothing.\n       Colorado and Oregon immediately passed initiatives \n     requiring background checks at gun shows. Today 32 states \n     still do not require background checks on gun purchases at \n     gun shows including Washington.\n       The Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired in 1994 and was not \n     renewed, putting guns like Tec-9s back on the streets.\n       In 2005 Congress passed and the president signed into law a \n     measure that, astonishingly, provides immunity from \n     prosecution for gun manufacturers and sellers.\n       The National Rifle Association is pushing hard to pass \n     ``take-your-guns-to-work'' laws in all 50 states that would \n     turn companies into criminals if they barred guns on their \n     private property. So far the legislation has been introduced \n     in 11 states.\n       Seven states have passed legislation that eliminates a \n     citizen's duty to avoid a threat, and allow the use of deadly \n     force before other options when a gun user simply feels \n     threatened.\n       You've got to give the NRA credit. It is an effective \n     lobbying organization that fights hard for its beliefs and \n     has enjoyed remarkable success in the past seven years. But \n     at what price? If only common sense had lobbyists.\n\n\n                          A massacre every day\n\n       Since the Columbine tragedy, 210,000 people have died in \n     America due to gun violence, and school shootings continue to \n     occur without much notice. Can you even remember the names of \n     the schools where kids were shot and killed in the past seven \n     years? It's become routine news, sandwiched between the \n     latest from Iraq and the weather.\n       Since 9/11, America has monitored library cards, listened \n     in on cell phone calls, tracked fertilizer purchases, and \n     made us take our shoes off before boarding an airplane, but \n     it has done almost nothing to make it harder for either \n     terrorists or criminals to buy guns. We continue to put the \n     right to own a Tec-9 over common sense precautions to protect \n     our nation and our kids. I find such inaction inexcusable.\n       Columbine did mobilize millions of moms across the nation, \n     and a small, vocal minority is railing against this country's \n     gun culture. In March, 32 states received grades of D's or \n     F's in the Brady Campaign's 2005 annual report card. \n     Washington state earned a D-plus and Oregon got a C-minus \n     because they haven't passed common sense gun laws that \n     protect our children and families. Do we perhaps think that, \n     because our memories have faded, the threat is any less real? \n     Don't we know that 10 of the 19 school shootings since \n     Columbine happened in the spring? Didn't Benjamin Franklin \n     say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing \n     over and over and expecting different results?\n       On April 20, 1999 I saw my high school turned into a morgue \n     for innocent teenagers. I truly thought the carnage would \n     prompt some meaningful change.\n       I was wrong.\n       I guess we're all just hoping that our child, our school \n     isn't next. But wishing won't make it so. What we can do is \n     call on our legislators to pass a law requiring background \n     checks at gun shows in 2007, legislation that we have been \n     trying to pass in Washington since Columbine.\n       I wonder if at my 30-year reunion the massacre at Columbine \n     High School will still be ``the worst school shooting in U.S. \n     history.''\n       Sadly, I doubt it.\n\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3694-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3694-S3695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   WELCOMING HIS EXCELLENCY ILHAM ALIYEV, THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Under President Ilham Aliyev's leadership, Azerbaijan \nhas made important contributions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo.

Mr. President, this week the North Korean Freedom \nCoalition, a bipartisan coalition of NGOs and individuals, will be \norganizing a rally on Capitol Hill at noon on Friday, April 28, 2006, \nin recognition of North Korea Freedom Day.\n  Largely through the persistent efforts of the coalition and many \nothers across the country, there has been an upsurge of interest in \nNorth Korea with Americans and particularly the faith communities. \nMembers of Congress, North Korean defectors, NGO leaders from the USA, \nSouth Korea, and Japan have been holding rallies, testifying before \nCongress, and personally sharing their stories with others and the \npress to help support the plight of North Koreans and, in particular, \nthe refugees in China and elsewhere. Thousands will gather to stand up \nfor the freedom, human rights, and dignity of the North Korean people.\n  Since the Stalinist country disclosed several years ago that it had \nrenewed efforts to develop nuclear weapons, not a single day goes by \nwithout Pyongyang carrying out more reckless deeds to escalate the \ncrisis or exchanging hostile threats with Washington, DC. With the six-\nparty talks dissolving without any progress, the current nuclear \nstandoff seems poised to continue, if not deteriorate. Many people \npoint out, and correctly so, the need for more scholarship on the \nnuclear threat that North Korea poses not only to East Asia but also to \nthe world.\n  The sad truth, however, is that amid the discussion of regional \nsecurity and nuclear nonproliferation for South Korea, Japan, and \nChina, as well as the war against terrorism for the United States, a \ncentral part of this issue has been neglected: the human rights of \nNorth Koreans.\n  It is hard to imagine a country whose citizens endure a worse or more \npervasive abuse of every human right. The Government prohibits freedoms \nof speech, press, assembly, association, religion, movement, and more. \nThe draconian penal code stipulates capital punishment and confiscation \nof assets for a wide variety of ``crimes against revolution,'' \nincluding defection, attempted defection, slander of the policies of \nthe state, listening to foreign broadcasts, and possessing \n``reactionary'' printed matter.\n  Those who escaped political concentration camps tell stories of \nhorror beyond imagination. Prison guards kill newborn babies in front \nof their mothers. A female prisoner dies after being beaten by prison \nguards like a soccer ball, with her wounds filled with maggots. Molten \nmetal is poured on Christians who refuse to disavow their faith. The \nopen goal of these camps, detaining political dissidents whose loyalty \nto the party is ``beyond recovery,'' is to eradicate three generations \nof their inmates. An estimated 1.5 million prisoners have been killed \nin the camps. Approximately 200,000 are currently imprisoned.\n  Those who risk their lives and succeed in escaping to China to find \nfood and freedom are not better off. The Chinese Government continues \nto violate refugees' rights and repatriates them to North Korea, where \nthey will most likely face persecution; North Korean refugees are \nexploited by those around them who threaten to report them to the \nauthorities. The sexual slavery of North Korean refugee women in China \nis an urgent human rights issue that has yet to attract the attention \nof the international community.\n  In 2004, Congress passed and the President signed into law the North \nKorean Human Rights Act. Since passage, much has been done and various \nprovisions of the bill have been implemented. However, much more \nremains to be done, especially in fully funding the authorization \ncontained in the bill. I ask that reports from State Department \nrequired by the Act be submitted to Congress. More importantly, it is \nabsolutely critical that we allow North Korean refugees seeking refuge \nin the United States to be allowed to do so as per the provisions of \nthe act and appropriate vetting processes. Nothing we do--not even \nfunding--will produce more tangible results of improving the human \nrights of North Koreans than this gesture that is a long and hallowed \npart of our history and tradition. We are a nation that welcomes those \nfacing persecution because we not only believe but practice the \nprincipal that ``to whom much is given, much is required.''\n  As the security concerns dominate headlines of all United States and \ninternational news media, the sufferings of 22 million North Koreans \nare missing from public awareness. It is in recognizing this desperate \nneed for more awareness of the North Korean human rights that the \ncoalition is organizing this timely and important event this week.\n  North Korean Human Rights Week will provide an opportunity for us to \nlearn more about this tragedy that is occurring right this minute. I \ncommend the organizers of the week, especially the members of the North \nKorean Freedom Coalition and its many volunteers who have given so much \nof their time in preparing for this important event.\n  It is time to shake ourselves off of shocked disbelief. And it is \ntime to break out of apathy and ignorance and stand up for human rights \nin North Korea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3695-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3695-S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL VOLUNTEER WEEK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as we celebrate National Volunteer Week, I \nwould like to take a moment to recognize four individuals for their \nextraordinary service to the Everybody Wins! program in Iowa.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Everybody Wins! is a literacy and \nmentoring program for elementary school students. The program gives \nadults the opportunity to spend one lunch hour a week reading with a \nchild in a public school. It is the ultimate power lunch.\n  Eight years ago, Senator Jim Jeffords recruited me to join him as a \nvolunteer for the Everybody Wins! program in Washington, DC. The time I \nspend at Brent Elementary is the most important and rewarding hour of \nmy workweek. My experience also convinced me of the need to expand this \nprogram to Iowa.\n  In 2002, Everybody Wins! Iowa was launched. The program began as a \nsmall pilot program in 3 public schools with 15 volunteers. From this \nmodest beginning, the program has grown, and now serves more than 260 \nstudents in 11 central Iowa schools.\n  The success of the Iowa program is due to the dedicated services of \nmany individuals. Today, I would like to recognize the service of four \npeople who served as founding members of the board of directors and who \nhave played a critical role in the development of Everybody Wins! Iowa.\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\n  Ray Walton was the initial spark to get the program started in Iowa. \nRay recruited the organization's first executive director and served as \none of the first volunteers in the program. He also served as vice \npresident and later as president of the board of directors. His \nleadership and dedication guided Everybody Wins! Iowa in those \nimportant early days.\n  Wilma Gajdel served on the board of directors for 3 years. She is \nalso the principal at Monroe Elementary, one of the three original \nEverybody Wins! schools. The input of educators is critical to the \nsuccess of Everybody Wins!, and Wilma's guidance has been invaluable. \nThe Everybody Wins! Iowa model was developed at Monroe under her \ncareful eye and has been adapted successfully by other schools in \ncentral Iowa.\n  Drew Gentsch served as the organization's first treasurer. In \naddition, he is a volunteer reader at Monroe Elementary, the father of \ntwo young children, and a busy attorney. Drew has also served as the \nchair of the board's finance committee, and he contributed many hours \nas he led the hiring committee for the board's first executive \ndirector. His professionalism and attention to detail have helped the \norganization flourish and grow.\n  B. MacPaul Stanfield is another busy attorney and father of two. He \nhas served as secretary of Everybody Wins! Iowa and is a volunteer \nreader at Monroe. He previously served as chair of the organization's \npersonnel committee. Mac held one of the most important positions on \nthe board as the person responsible for recording the minutes of the \nmeetings and attending to the myriad of other details that go into the \nsuccessful operation of a small nonprofit organization.\n  Service on a volunteer board of directors is not easy and requires \nhours of dedicated service. These four individuals gave generously of \ntheir time and talents to Everybody Wins! Iowa during its infancy. That \nservice provided a strong foundation for the organization. As they \nleave the board, I wish to express my sincere gratitude for their \ndedicated and selfless service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3696-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES MONROE\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize James \nMonroe, a Virginia patriot on the 248th anniversary of his birth and to \nhonor his service to our Nation as a soldier, legislator and as the \nfifth President of the United States of America. I rise today to honor \nhis undeniable legacy.\n  James Monroe, born April 28, 1758, Monroe attended the College of \nWilliam and Mary, fought with distinction in the Continental Army, and \npracticed law in Fredericksburg, VA. As a youthful politician, he \njoined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention which ratified \nthe Constitution, and became an advocate of Jefferson principles.\n  A student of Thomas Jefferson's after serving in the Revolutionary \nWar, James Monroe was an adherent of Mr. Jefferson's principles of \nindividual freedom and restrained representative government, which \nwould guide him through 50 years of public service. Elected to the \nVirginia General Assembly in 1782, Monroe served in the Continental \nCongress and in the first United Senate before his first two terms as \nMinister to France. He returned to his Virginia, and as many students \nof Mr. Jefferson have done since, served 4 years as a native Governor.\n  Elected President of the United States in 1816, Monroe's Presidency \nhas long been referred to as the Era of Good Feeling. James Monroe \nhelped resolve longstanding grievances with the British and acquired \nFlorida from the Spanish in 1819. James Monroe signed the Missouri \nCompromise that called for the prohibition of slavery in western \nterritories of the Louisiana Purchase, which James Monroe was \ninstrumental in obtaining. He renounced European intervention or \ndominion in the Western Hemisphere with one of our Nation's greatest \nforeign policy documents, the Monroe Doctrine.\n  In 1820, Monroe achieved an impressive reelection, losing only one \nelectoral vote, preserving the honor of a unanimous election for George \nWashington.\n  My own family has strong ties to the legacy of James Monroe. My wife \nSusan and I enjoyed our wedding on the grounds of his home: Ashlawn-\nHighland in Charlottesville. In fact, part of Monroe's property in \nAlbemarle County is now on the grounds of his teacher's great \ninstitution of learning, the University of Virginia and is respectfully \nreferred to as Monroe's Hill.\n  The life of James Monroe is one that embodied virtue, honor and \ncommitment during his accomplished life of public service. It is \nfitting that he would pass from this Earth on Fourth of July, 1831. It \nis with sincere admiration that I respectfully ask my colleagues to \nrecognize James Monroe's 248th birthday as a reminder of his remarkable \nand magnificent leadership for the people of Virginia and the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3696-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3696-S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   POLITICAL PRISONERS IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as President Bush prepares for his meeting \nwith President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, I rise to address important \nhuman rights concerns in that country.\n  Although hundreds of political prisoners have been freed due in part \nto pressure brought by the United States, it is believed that as many \nas 50 political prisoners remain in Azeri jails. Prior to the November \nelections in Azerbaijan, a group of businessmen and government \nofficials were arrested on charges of planning a coup. Among this \ngroup, there were former Minister of Economic Development Farhad \nAliyev, and his brother, Rafiq Aliyev. Because of his well-known \nopposition to Russia's increased influence in Azerbaijan and his pro-\nWestern stance, in addition to the antimonopoly initiatives he led \nprior to his arrest, many fear that Mr. Aliyev's and his colleague's \narrests were politically motivated. They are being held in the pretrial \ndetention center at the National Security Ministry, which is notorious \nfor its poor conditions and harsh treatment of prisoners. Human rights \norganizations in this country and in Europe have expressed concern \nabout the violations of the due process rights of the detainees in \nconnection with this case. Farhad Aliyev is a cardiac patient suffering \nfrom hypertension and hypertrophy. In a recent fact-finding mission, \nthe International League for Human Rights has verified that Mr. Aliyev \nhas been denied proper medical care and medicine for his heart \ncondition. As recently as this week, the International League for Human \nRights has indicated that Mr. Aliyev may have undergone another health \ncrisis and his lawyers believe he may have suffered a heart attack.\n  I urge President Bush and this administration to remind President \nAliyev of Azerbaijan's obligations before the international community \nand the importance of human rights in Azerbaijan and to request Mr. \nAliyev's immediate release on bail in light of his need for adequate \nmedical care. The case of Mr. Aliyev may be the litmus test of the \nAzeri government's good will and commitment to human rights. I ask \nunanimous consent that recent newspaper articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Apr. 21, 2006]\n\n                             After Hu, Who?\n\n       Busy times at the White House. This week Hu Jintao has been \n     George W. Bush's honoured guest. Next in line is Ilham \n     Aliyev. After Hu, you might say, who? During the Chinese \n     president's stay every word, smile and suppressed grimace has \n     been scrutinised, examined and analysed. I am not sure how \n     much we have learnt about the world's most important \n     geostrategic relationship. For his part, the president of \n     Azerbaijan will struggle just to be recognised in the U.S. \n     capital. Yet, strange though it seems, his visit says more \n     than does that of Mr. Hu about the direction of U.S. foreign \n     policy.\n       Mr. Aliyev has been leader of the Caspian state for nearly \n     three years. Notionally elected, in reality he inherited the \n     post from his father, once a member of the Moscow politburo \n     and still revered for rescuing the former Soviet republic \n     from post-communist collapse. Even now, heroic images of the \n     late Haydar Aliyev adorn the streets, offices and cafes of \n     the capital Baku.\n       Ilham, though, presents himself as a thoroughly modem \n     leader. He is fluent in English, takes holidays in the south \n     of France and waxes lyrical about his country's Euro-Atlantic \n     destiny. I met him last autumn in the presidential palace in \n     Baku. Gracious and persuasive, he consciously defied the \n     stereotypes of the Soviet-style tyrants who continue to rule \n     in much of this part of the world.\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\n       Beneath the well-cut suits, charming manner and rhetorical \n     commitment to western values, though, lies the same \n     determination to hang on to power. His election after the \n     death of his father in 2003 was rigged. So too, albeit \n     marginally less blatantly, were polls for the country's \n     national assembly last autumn. Politics and money are \n     inextricably intertwined. Azerbaijan, a clan-based society, \n     stands near the top of every international corruption index.\n       This is where Mr. Bush comes in. Small as it is, Mr. \n     Aliyev's fiefdom has strategic significance. Its geography--\n     the country borders Iran, Russia and Georgia as well as the \n     Caspian--puts it in the cockpit of the unspoken struggle \n     between Washington and Moscow for influence in the former \n     Soviet republics of the Caucasus and central Asia.\n       Its more immediate military utility has not escaped the \n     Pentagon. Donald Rumsfeld, the U.S. defence secretary, is a \n     regular visitor to Baku. The air corridor over Azerbaijan is \n     used for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Western \n     diplomats say that the U.S. has also established listening \n     posts in the south to eavesdrop on Iran. The Pentagon has \n     been refurbishing at least one former Soviet air base. For \n     his part, Mr. Aliyev, a secular Muslim, supported the \n     toppling of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.\n       Then, of course, there is the oil. The deep waters of the \n     Caspian hold large reserves of oil and gas. Azerbaijan has \n     begun pumping its share through a new pipeline connecting \n     the fields to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. \n     The political message is clear--Mr. Aliyev is ready to \n     snub Russia to serve the west's voracious appetite for \n     hydrocarbons.\n       So why wouldn't Mr. Bush welcome such a stalwart ally at \n     the White House? The answer is that Mr. Aliyev has \n     consistently brushed aside calls from Washington to edge his \n     country closer to freedom and democracy--and the U.S. \n     president has put the spread of political pluralism front and \n     centre of his foreign policy.\n       For Azerbaijan, last autumn's elections were set by \n     Washington as something of a test. A few month's earlier, \n     Condoleezza Rice, the U.S. secretary of state, had added \n     substance to Mr. Bush's democratic impulses. The days of \n     appeasing autocratic leaders in oil-rich Muslim states, Ms. \n     Rice declared in a much-trumpeted speech in Cairo, were over. \n     The stability this had brought was a cruel illusion. \n     America's security lay in the promotion of freedom and \n     democracy.\n       There would be incentives as well as penalties. In Mr. \n     Aliyev's case, I was told by a senior U.S. official, this \n     would include the prestige bestowed by the invitation to the \n     White House he had sought from the outset of his presidency. \n     The bargain seemed straightforward: the assembly elections \n     would be relatively free and Mr. Aliyev would get his photo \n     opportunity on the White House lawn. As it turned out the \n     poll was anything but fair but Mr. Aliyev, described this \n     week by the White House as a ``valued partner'', still gets \n     his trip to Washington.\n       Wait, I hear those weary foreign policy practitioners sigh, \n     the road to democracy in this part of the world was never \n     going to travel in a straight line. The geometry was always \n     going variable, as was the pace. There are far worse than Mr. \n     Aliyev and, in any event, Mr. Bush intends to tell him \n     straight that he expects more of him in future. Consistency, \n     the argument continues, can rarely be more than an aspiration \n     in foreign policy. It would be a mistake to make the pursuit \n     of the perfect the enemy of the possible.\n       Half-true. The most ardent American neo-conservatives or \n     European liberal internationalists do not expect Saudi \n     Arabia, for example, to abandon autocracy for democracy by \n     the day after tomorrow. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak might be \n     prodded harder and the democratic forces in Lebanon given \n     greater support, but transformation will take time.\n       The argument, though, does not work in the same way for \n     Azerbaijan. If Mr. Bush's words are to mean anything at all, \n     they must be shown to have substance precisely in places like \n     this. Of course, the country has strategic significance. It \n     goes without saying that the west wants its oil. But \n     America's failures in the Middle East during the second half \n     of the last century were based on just such so-called \n     realism.\n       Now, if it wants to preserve any credibility, Washington \n     must be seen to act where it can. And, in truth, Azerbaijan \n     is one of the easiest cases. Its relationship with the west \n     is grounded in mutual dependency. For all that Mr. Aliyev \n     might threaten to turn towards Moscow, he has no desire to \n     embrace Russia. He wants the west's approval and investment \n     in Caspian oil. He is susceptible, in other words, to \n     pressure.\n       Instead he can expect the White House red carpet and a few \n     gentle admonitions about trying to make the country's next \n     elections a little bit fairer than the last. So who, to \n     borrow a phrase, cares? The answer is all those people and \n     groups in Azerbaijan and well beyond who had hoped that the \n     U.S. president was serious in his commitment to the advance \n     of freedom and democracy. The winners are autocrats \n     everywhere. Oh, and, I suppose, the Teflon-like Mr. Rumsfeld.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 23, 2006]\n\n     Azerbaijan Leader, Under Fire, Hopes U.S. Visit Improves Image\n\n                           (By C.J. Chivers)\n\n       Next week, after years of waiting for an unequivocal nod of \n     Western approval, President Ilham H. Aliyev of Azerbaijan \n     will fly to Washington to be received at the White House, a \n     visit his administration hopes will lift his stature.\n       Being a guest of President Bush has been billed in Mr. \n     Aliyev's circle as a chance for the 44-year-old president--\n     dogged by allegations of corruption, election rigging and \n     repression of opposition figures--to gain more international \n     legitimacy.\n       ``We have long waited for this visit,'' said Ali Gasanov, a \n     senior presidential adviser. ``Now it has been scheduled, and \n     we hope that we will be able to discuss global issues.''\n       For President Bush, who has made democracy promotion a \n     prominent theme of his foreign policy, Mr. Aliyev's visit \n     could prove tricky.\n       Mr. Aliyev's invitation arrived during a period of \n     increasing diplomatic difficulties between the United States \n     and both Russia and Iran, countries that border Azerbaijan.\n       But while Azerbaijan's strategic location could hardly be \n     better and its relations with the United States have mostly \n     been warm, no leader in the region more fully embodies the \n     conflicting American objectives in the former Soviet Union \n     than its president.\n       Mr. Aliyev is a secular Muslim politician who is steering \n     oil and gas to Western markets and who has given political \n     and military support to the Iraq war. But his administration \n     has never held a clean election and has used riot police to \n     crush antigovernment demonstrations.\n       The invitation, made last week, has raised eyebrows in the \n     former Soviet world, where Mr. Bush's calls for \n     democratization have increased tensions between opposition \n     movements and the entrenched autocrats.\n       Opposition leaders have long said the United States' \n     desires to diversify Western energy sources and to encourage \n     democratic growth have collided in Azerbaijan. By inviting \n     Mr. Aliyev to the White House, they say, Mr. Bush has made a \n     choice: oil and location now trump other concerns.\n       Ali Kerimli, leader of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, \n     noted that when Mr. Aliyev was elected in 2003 in a vote \n     deemed neither free nor fair, the White House withheld an \n     invitation, awaiting improvement by Azerbaijan in promoting \n     civil society and recognizing human rights.\n       ``It is difficult for Azerbaijan's democratic forces to \n     understand what changed,'' said Mr. Kerimli, who was beaten \n     by the police as were several thousand demonstrators during a \n     crackdown on a protest over fraudulent parliamentary \n     elections last fall. The demonstration had been peaceful \n     until the police rushed in with clubs.\n       ``I think the White House must explain what has happened \n     when three years ago Aliyev was not wanted for a reception in \n     the White House, and now he falsifies another election and is \n     received,'' Mr. Kerimli said.\n       American officials insist nothing has changed, and say Mr. \n     Aliyev has been invited for what they call a ``working \n     visit,'' during which he will be urged to liberalize his \n     government and its economy, which is tightly controlled by \n     state officials and clans.\n       ``If we are going to elevate our relationship with \n     Azerbaijan to something that is qualitatively different, then \n     there has to be progress on democratic and market reforms,'' \n     a senior State Department official said. ``I am sure we will \n     talk in these clear and blunt terms.''\n       The United States' relationship with Azerbaijan rests on \n     three principal issues: access to energy resources, \n     international security cooperation, and democratic and \n     economic change.\n       On the first two issues, the United States has made clear \n     it is satisfied. Mr. Aliyev has supported new pipelines to \n     pump Caspian hydrocarbons away from Russia and Iran to \n     Western customers, and provided troops to United States-led \n     military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       Azerbaijan also grants overflight rights to the American \n     military and is cooperating with a Pentagon-sponsored \n     modernization of a former Soviet airfield that could be used \n     by American military planes.\n       Mr. Aliyev often welcomes foreign delegations to Baku, the \n     capital, describing in smooth English his efforts to push his \n     nation toward Western models of democracy and free markets.\n       But Azerbaijan has remained undemocratic. No election under \n     Mr. Aliyev or his late father, Heydar Aliyev, has been judged \n     free or fair by the main international observers. Instead, \n     fraud and abuse of state resources for chosen candidates have \n     been widespread.\n       Ilham Aliyev's government maintains a distinctly Soviet-era \n     state television network and has elevated Heydar Aliyev to \n     the status of a minor personality cult figure.\n       Moreover, Azerbaijan's government is often described as one \n     of the world's most corrupt. A criminal case now in federal \n     court in New York against three international speculators \n     describes enormous shakedowns and bribes in the late 1990's \n     at Socar, Azerbaijan's state oil company. Mr. Aliyev was a \n     Socar vice president at the time.\n       Last year the Azerbaijani government showed signs of \n     paranoia, arresting several people shortly before the \n     parliamentary election and accusing them of plotting an armed \n     coup.\n       Public evidence for the charges has been scarce, and a \n     lawyer for two of the men held in solitary confinement for \n     months since--Farhad Aliyev, the former minister of \n     economics, and his brother Rafiq--has urged\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\n     Congress to raise issues of their treatment when Mr. Aliyev \n     comes to Washington. (The president is not related to the \n     accused men.)\n       American officials say that Azerbaijan has been \n     liberalizing slowly, and evolving into a more responsible \n     state. But given Mr. Aliyev's uneven record and the \n     allegations against him, his visit has raised fresh questions \n     about the degree to which American standards are malleable.\n       ``Russian public opinion, when it looks at the United \n     States policy in Azerbaijan, cannot ignore the fact that the \n     United States has a desire not in favor of democracy but in \n     favor of profits and geopolitical domination,'' said Sergei \n     Markov, director of the Institute for Political Studies here \n     and a Kremlin adviser.\n       Mr. Markov and others have noted that the West has \n     penalized Belarus for police crackdowns after tainted \n     elections last month.\n       ``This is one of the reasons that Russian public opinion is \n     very suspicious of United States policies in the former \n     Soviet political sphere, and its propaganda about \n     democracy,'' Mr. Markov said.\n       ``Ilham Aliyev will be in the White House not because he \n     promotes democracy,'' Mr. Markov said. ``He will be in the \n     White House because he controls oil.''\n       In Armenia, Mr. Aliyev's invitation has also generated \n     interest.\n       Armenia fought Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a wedge of \n     territory within Azerbaijan's boundaries that each country \n     claims. The conflict has been frozen for several years, but \n     Mr. Aliyev's recent statements have often been bellicose.\n       ``The visit at this time should not be viewed as \n     appreciation of their democratic or other policies,'' Vartan \n     Oskanian, Armenia's foreign minister, said via e-mail.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 2006]\n\n                    Retreat From the Freedom Agenda\n\n                           (By Jackson Diehl)\n\n       President Bush's retreat from the ambitious goals of his \n     second term will proceed one small but fateful step further \n     this Friday. That's when, after more than two years of \n     stalling, the president will deliver a warm White House \n     welcome to Ilham Aliyev, the autocratic and corrupt but \n     friendly ruler of one of the world's emerging energy powers, \n     Azerbaijan.\n       Here's why this is a tipping point: At the heart of Bush's \n     democracy doctrine was the principle that the United States \n     would abandon its Cold War-era practice of propping up \n     dictators--especially in the Muslim world--in exchange for \n     easy access to their energy resources and military \n     cooperation. That bargain, we now know, played a major role \n     in the emergence of al-Qaeda and other extremist anti-Western \n     movements.\n       To his credit, the reelected Bush made a genuine stab at a \n     different strategy last year in Azerbaijan and another Muslim \n     country, Kazakhstan. Both resemble Iran or Iraq half a \n     century ago. They are rapidly modernizing, politically \n     unsettled, and about to become very, very rich from oil and \n     gas.\n       With both Aliyev and Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev \n     planning elections last fall, Bush dispatched letters and \n     senior envoys with a message: Hold an honest vote and you can \n     ``elevate our countries'' relations to a new strategic \n     level.'' The implicit converse was that, should they fail to \n     deliver, there would be no special partnership--no military \n     deals, no aid, no presidential visits to Washington.\n       Both Aliyev and Nazarbayev made token efforts to please \n     Bush. But both dismally failed to demonstrate that they were \n     willing to liberalize their countries rather than using oil \n     wealth to consolidate dictatorship. The State Department said \n     of Aliyev's parliamentary elections, ``there were major \n     irregularities and fraud.'' Nazarbayev's election was worse. \n     Since then, two of Nazarbayev's opponents have died or been \n     murdered in suspicious circumstances. Three of Aliyev's foes \n     are being tried this month on treason charges, and his \n     biggest rival has been jailed.\n       Aliyev is nevertheless getting everything he might have \n     hoped for from Bush. Aid is being boosted, the Pentagon is \n     drawing up plans for extensive military cooperation--and \n     there is the White House visit, which the 44-year-old Azeri \n     president has craved ever since he took over from his dad \n     three years ago. If Nazarbayev chooses, he will be next. He \n     has been offered not just a Washington tour but a reciprocal \n     visit by Bush to Kazakhstan.\n       Why the retreat on the democracy principle? Azeri observers \n     speculate that Bush may want Aliyev's help with Iran, which \n     is its neighbor and contains a large Azeri ethnic minority. \n     But administration officials tell me a more pressing reason \n     is a rapidly intensifying campaign by Russia to restore its \n     dominion over former Soviet republics such as Azerbaijan and \n     Kazakhstan--and to drive the United States out of the region.\n       Though nominally Bush's ally in the war on terrorism, \n     Russian President Vladimir Putin has cynically exploited \n     Bush's effort to promote democracy in Eurasia. His diplomats \n     and media aggressively portray Washington's support for free \n     media, civil society groups and elections as a cover for CIA-\n     sponsored coups. Autocrats who stage crackdowns, such as \n     Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov, are quickly embraced by Moscow, \n     which counsels them to break off ties with the U.S. military. \n     State-controlled Russian energy companies are meanwhile \n     seeking to corner oil and gas supplies and gain control over \n     pipelines, electricity grids and refineries throughout \n     Eurasia. If they succeed, Russia can throttle the region's \n     weak governments and ensure its long-term control over energy \n     supplies to Central and Western Europe.\n       In late February Putin arrived in Azerbaijan at the head of \n     a large delegation and proceeded to buy everything Aliyev \n     would sell, including a commitment to export more oil through \n     Russia. Earlier this month he welcomed Nazarbayev to Moscow, \n     and scored an even bigger success. Not only did the Kazakh \n     leader endorse Putin's plan for a Moscow-dominated ``common \n     economic space,'' but he also signed a deal that will double \n     Kazakhstan's oil exports through Russia. Despite heavy U.S. \n     lobbying, Nazarbayev has yet to firmly commit to sending oil \n     through a rival Western pipeline, which begins in Azerbaijan \n     and ends in the Turkish port of Ceyhan.\n       Putin's aggressive tactics forced the hand of the \n     administration, which had been holding back its White House \n     invitations in the hope of leveraging more steps toward \n     liberalization. ``We don't want to see Azerbaijan closed off \n     by the Russians, because that will close off the energy \n     alternative to Russia for Europe,'' one official said. He \n     added: ``If Azerbaijan falls under Russian influence there \n     will be no democracy agenda there at all.''\n       In short, the race for energy and an increasingly bare-\n     knuckled contest with Moscow for influence over its producers \n     have caused the downgrading of the democracy strategy. It \n     might be argued that the sacrifice is necessary, given the \n     large economic and security stakes. But, then, that was the \n     logic that prevailed once before. According to Bush, history \n     proved it wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3698-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3698-S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NORTH KOREA FREEDOM WEEK\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as we are in the midst of North Korea \nFreedom Week, I would like to speak to the human rights situation in \nNorth Korea. As we continually strive to protect the freedoms that this \ncountry holds dear, such as the freedoms of religion, press, speech and \nassembly that are recognized in our Constitution, we must also \nconcentrate on spreading these freedoms to those who do not enjoy them. \nAs these rights should be enjoyed by all people, not just Americans, \nfreedom must extend beyond our borders to reach those who live in a \nworld unknown to many of us, one that includes starvation and \ndeprivation of all freedoms. North Korea Freedom Week gives us the \nopportunity to shed light on the situation inside this oppressive \nregime.\n  Several years ago in order to help promote freedom throughout the \nworld, I began the Congressional Working Group on Religious Freedom. \nThe purpose of this group is to focus attention on issues of domestic \nand international religious freedom. As a group, we seek to uphold and \nhelp enforce the meaning of article 18 of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, which states: ``Everyone has the right to freedom of \nthought, conscience, and religion; this right includes freedom to \nchange his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in \ncommunity with others and in public or private, to manifest his \nreligion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.''\n  As has been noted by human rights groups and others, the human rights \nsituation in North Korea is severe. Hundreds of thousands of North \nKoreans have fled their country in hopes of survival and in search of a \nfree life. However, even if they manage to escape, they still live in \nconstant fear of repatriation and imprisonment. President Bush has \ncalled North Korea's autocratic leader, Kim Jong Il, a ``tyrant'' who \nruns ``concentration camps.'' Despite the country being embedded in \nsecrecy, unfortunate stories of persecution, starvation, and public \nexecutions for crossing the border manage to be released to the rest of \nthe world. Such actions under this regime are a terrible travesty.\n  While the North Korean constitution provides for ``freedom of \nreligion,'' such freedom does not exist. The U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom said in their 2005 annual report: ``By \nall accounts, there are virtually no personal freedoms in North Korea \nand no protection for universal human rights. In pursuit of absolute \ncontrol of all facets of politics and society, the government under \ndictator Kim Jong Il has created an environment of fear in which \ndissent of any kind is not tolerated. Freedom of thought, conscience, \nand religion or belief remains essentially non-existent, as the \ngovernment severely represses public and private religious activities \nand has a policy of actively discriminating against religious \nbelievers.\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nThere are a growing number of reports from North Korea refugees that \nany unauthorized religious activity inside North Korea is met with \narrest, imprisonment, torture, and sometimes execution by North Korean \nofficials.''\n  Furthermore, the U.S. Department of State's 2005 Country Report on \nHuman Rights Practices sums up North Korea's actions by listing \ndocumented or alleged human rights abuses over the years. Such \ninstances include: abridgement of the right to change the government; \nextrajudicial killings, disappearances, and arbitrary detention, \nincluding many political prisoners; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; torture; forced abortions and infanticide in prisons; lack \nof an independent judiciary and fair trials; denial of freedom of \nspeech, press, assembly, and association; government attempts to \ncontrol all information; denial of freedom of religion, freedom of \nmovement, and worker rights; and severe punishment of some repatriated \nrefugees.\n  I also want to note President Bush's appointment last August of \nAmbassador Jay Lefkowitz to the position of Special Envoy for Human \nRights in North Korea. The Special Envoy post was established under the \nNorth Korea Human Rights Act, and with this appointment, signaled the \nadministration's intensified attention to human rights in North Korea. \nI am confident that Ambassador Lefkowitz will continue to take steps \ntoward ending North Korea's suppression of freedoms.\n  As we in the Senate continue to address the persecution and the fears \nthat North Koreans face, it is my hope that we will do all we can in \norder to improve the conditions in this communist state and to spread \nthe freedoms that we all enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3699-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, Elie Wiesel once told us that ``a \ndestruction, an annihilation that only man can provoke, only man can \nprevent.'' Our American heritage calls upon each of us to stand up, to \nspeak out, and to act when we witness human rights abuses. As a global \nleader, the United States has a special and solemn obligation. We must \nlive up to this responsibility.\n  This week marked both Armenian Remembrance Day and Holocaust \nRemembrance Day. In the final years of the Ottoman Empire between 1915 \nand 1923, the world witnessed the mass killing of as many as 1.5 \nmillion Armenian men, women, and children. Five-hundred thousand \nsurvivors were expelled from their homes. Our U.S. Ambassador to the \nOttoman Empire Henry Morgenthau organized and led protests by foreign \nofficials against one of the most horrible tragedies of the 20th \ncentury.\n  Sadly and almost unimaginably, more human devastation followed. Later \nyears witnessed the Holocaust--the Nazis' systematic state-sponsored \npersecution and murder of 6 million Jews. In 1945, the U.S. Third \nArmy's 6th Armored Division liberated the Buchenwald concentration camp \nand the U.S. Seventh Army's 45th Infantry Division liberated Dachau in \nGermany.\n  We reflect in order to remember--honoring the dead, pledging never to \nforget atrocities of the past, and fighting to stop them today. In \n2004, then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told the U.S. Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that genocide has been committed in the \nSudanese region of Darfur. A consistent, widespread, and terrible \npattern of atrocities and burning of villages continues as the \nsituation in Darfur remains grim. I believe the U.S. must lead urgent \ninternational efforts to stop the killing in Darfur. We must act \nimmediately, working with the United Nations, NATO, and the African \nUnion to stop the ongoing violence. We must remain focused and never \nwaver in our fight to bring an end to the genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3699-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        2006 NATIONAL PARK WEEK\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think each of us enjoy walking on a \ntrail, learning a little more about our Nation's history, or perhaps \npaddling a canoe on a lake, river, or stream. Often we take part in \nthese activities in our national parks. This week, April 22 to April \n30, is National Park Week, a time when we can recognize all of the 390 \nunits of the National Park System. There will be special events going \non at parks throughout the system, and I encourage everyone to seek \nthem out and take part in them.\n  As I have mentioned before, I have a special attachment to \nYellowstone National Park, the world's first national park, located in \nWyoming, my home State. But Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park, the \nother National Park System units in Wyoming, and those across the \nNation, extending from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to Guam and \nAmerican Samoa, all remind us of ourselves, where we have been, and \nperhaps where we will go in the future. They have been called by others \nthe best idea we ever had.\n  America's national parks provide people of all ages with a wide range \nof opportunities to learn more about our country's natural environment \nand cultural heritage. The National Park Service provides a variety of \nprograms and activities for children, teachers, and communities \ndesigned to foster an interest in the natural environment and history \nand to cultivate a future generation of park stewards.\n  The theme for National Park Week 2006 is ``Connecting Our Children to \nAmerica's National Parks.'' This theme was chosen because of the vital \nrole children play in the future conservation and preservation of our \nnational parks.\n  Through the creation of innovative education programs such as the \nJunior Ranger Program, the National Park Service is fostering a new \nconstituency of park stewards. Today the Junior Ranger Program exists \nin more than 286 parks, striving to help connect youth to national \nparks and the National Park System and helping them gain an \nunderstanding of the important role of the environment in our lives.\n  The Junior Ranger Program encourages whole families to get involved \nin learning about, exploring and protecting our Nation's most important \nscenic, historical, and cultural places. Children have great enthusiasm \nfor the Junior Ranger Program because it helps connect them to \nsomething big our country and our shared heritage as Americans. \nAdditionally, online through WebRangers, kids can ``virtually'' visit \nthe parks at their own pace in their spare time and when they are not \nin the parks. In fact, one of the events that will take place this year \nduring National Park Week is a virtual, shared visit to Carlsbad \nCaverns National Park, which could involve more than 28 million \nstudents.\n  Of course, our visits to parks are enhanced through the interaction \nwe receive from the people who work in them. During this week, we \nshould also thank the thousands of National Park Service personnel, \nconcession and contract employees, volunteers of all ages, and others \nwho help to make our system of national parks the envy of and example \nfor the rest of the world.\n  As the chair of the National Parks Subcommittee, I will continue to \nsee that our system of parks retains its high standards. I would \nencourage each of you to spend some time in a national park unit, this \nweek and throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3699-S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECURING AMERICA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Securing \nAmerica's Energy Independence Act of 2006. This bill is designed to \nextend the investment tax credits for fuel cells and solar energy \nsystems in the 2005 Energy Policy Act through 2015.\n  Having reliable, clean energy is fundamental to economic prosperity, \nour national security, and protecting the environment. The Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 encourages homeowners and businesses to invest in \nsolar energy and fuel cell technologies through investment tax credits. \nThat law established a tax credit of 30 percent for investments in fuel \ncells, capped at $1,000, and a tax credit of 30 percent for investments \nin solar systems, capped at $2,000.\n  However, these credits will expire after 2 years, and therefore are \ntoo short lived to encourage significant market penetration or to \nstimulate expansion of manufacturing for solar energy or fuel cell \ntechnologies. Installations of solar energy or fuel cell systems \nrequire lead times of a year or more, and manufacturing expansion \nrequires a development schedule of 3 to 4\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nyears, similar to conventional powerplants. Financing of new projects \nis also more complex than for conventional powerplants because the \nlending industry is less familiar with these technologies.\n  Accordingly, I have proposed to extend the tax credits for an \nadditional 8 years. My legislation also would alter the cap on \nresidential solar credits to be based on system power, as opposed to \ncost, and would allow the credits to be taken against the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  As the market for fuel cell and solar technologies continues to grow \noverseas, long-term incentives are an essential tool to spur domestic \ninvestment and job creation. Extending these incentives for residential \nand business investments in fuel cell and solar energy technologies \nwill generate quality American jobs in manufacturing, construction, and \ninstallation across the United States.\n  Our legislation addresses energy independence and environmental \nconcerns, as well as job creation, with the power of American \ntechnology and ingenuity. I am pleased that Senators Menendez, \nLieberman, Snowe, Jeffords, Kerry, Cantwell, Salazar, and Clinton have \njoined me as original cosponsors of this legislation. In light of \nincreasing concerns about the security and affordability of energy \nsupplies, I urge favorable consideration of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3700-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOAN LESLIE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Joan Leslie, a \ntalented actress who served as a source of comfort and inspiration to \nmillions of Americans during World War II. On May 14, the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs in Connecticut will pay tribute to Ms. \nLeslie for her tireless devotion to our Nation's servicemen with a gala \nin her honor.\n  Born Joan Agnes Theresa Sadie Bordel on January 26, 1925, in Detroit, \nMI, Ms. Leslie made her professional debut at age nine. As a child she \nworked as a model and performed a song and dance routine with her two \nsisters before she got her big break in 1940 when she signed with \nWarner Brothers.\n  Joan Leslie shared the screen with many of the leading actors of her \ntime, starring with Humphrey Bogart in ``High Sierra,'' Gary Cooper in \n``Sergeant York,'' and James Cagney in ``Yankee Doodle Dandy.'' In \n1943, she became Fred Astaire's youngest dance partner, celebrating her \n18th birthday on the set of ``The Sky's the Limit.'' Through these \nroles, Joan Leslie became known as America's quintessential ``girl next \ndoor.''\n  As Ms. Leslie's popularity escalated, so did America's involvement in \nWorld War II. Americans found themselves turning to entertainers like \nJoan Leslie for reassurance about the goodness and strength of our \ncountry amid the tremendous stresses and burdens of war. Tens of \nthousands of American servicemen clung to Joan Leslie's picture as a \nreminder of the values they were fighting for and the loved ones they \nleft behind. Ms. Leslie willingly accepted the responsibility of her \nrole, taking it upon herself to visit the troops at defense plants and \nArmy bases. Joan Leslie and other entertainers like her played a \npivotal role in the overall war effort, serving as a source of comfort \nand inspiration for American soldiers and the rest of the country. \nUltimately, they served as a reassurance that our Nation would prevail.\n  It is only right that veterans of our Nation should honor \nentertainers like Joan Leslie, and I take particular pride in the fact \nthat the veterans of Connecticut have taken a leadership role in her \ntribute. Ms. Leslie not only filled the role of the girl next door on \nthe movie screen, but carried it into her personal life, as well. Her \nlife lives up to her reputation, which is a rare achievement for a \npublic figure. Perhaps her greatest accomplishments have occurred \noutside the public eye, as she has dedicated most of her life to \nraising her identical twin daughters, Patrice and Ellen, with her \nhusband, Dr. William Caldwell.\n  Joan Leslie served as a pillar of strength when America needed her \nmost. She deserves the thanks of a grateful Nation for a life of \nservice. I commend her for her continued dedication to American \nservicemen, and congratulate her, her husband, her children, and her \nother family members on this wonderful occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3700-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3700-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3700-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 282.

In that order, I have expanded the scope of the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, \n1997, with respect to the policies and actions of the Government of \nSudan, to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions \nand circumstances involving Darfur, as described below.\n  The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution 1591 of March 29, \n2005, condemned the continued violations of the N'djamena Ceasefire \nAgreement of April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Humanitarian and Security \nProtocols of November 9, 2004, by all sides in Darfur, as well as the \ndeterioration of the security situation and the negative impact this \nhas had on humanitarian assistance efforts. I also note that the United \nNations Security Council has strongly condemned the continued \nviolations of human rights and international humanitarian law in \nSudan's Darfur region and, in particular, the continuation of violence \nagainst civilians and sexual violence against women and girls.\n  United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1591 determined \nthat the situation in Darfur constitutes a threat to international \npeace and security in the region and called on Member States to take \ncertain measures against persons responsible for the continuing \nconflict. The United Nations Security Council has encouraged all \nparties to negotiate in good faith at the Abuja talks and to take \nimmediate steps to support a peaceful settlement to the conflict in \nDarfur, but has continued to express serious concern at the persistence \nof the crisis in Darfur in UNSCR 1651 of December 21, 2005.\n  Pursuant to IEEPA, the National Emergencies Act, and the United \nNations Participation Act (UNPA), I have\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\ndetermined that these actions and circumstances constitute an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States, and have issued an Executive Order expanding the \nscope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 to \ndeal with this threat.\n  The order blocks the property and interests in property in the United \nStates, or in the possession or control of United States persons, of \nthe persons listed in the Annex to the order, as well as of any person \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State,\n  --to have constituted a threat to the peace process in Darfur;\n  --to have constituted a threat to stability in Darfur and the region;\n  --to be responsible for conduct related to the conflict in Darfur \nthat violates international law;\n  --to be responsible for heinous conduct with respect to human life or \nlimb related to the conflict in Darfur;\n  --to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred arms \nor any related materiel, or any assistance, advice, or training related \nto military activities to the Government of Sudan, the Sudan Liberation \nMovement/Army, the Justice and Equality Movement, the Janjaweed, or any \nperson operating in the states of North Darfur, South Darfur, and West \nDarfur, that is a belligerent, a nongovernmental entity, or an \nindividual; or\n  --to be responsible for offensive military overflights in and over \nthe Darfur region.\n  The designation criteria will be applied in accordance with \napplicable domestic law, including where appropriate, the First \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\n  The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for blocking any \nperson determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \nfinancial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services \nin support of, the activities listed above or any person listed in or \ndesignated pursuant to the order. I further authorized the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to \ndesignate for blocking any person determined to be owned or controlled \nby, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or \nindirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to the order. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of \nState, is also authorized to remove any persons from the Annex to the \norder as circumstances warrant.\n  I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including \nthe promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers \ngranted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA, as may be necessary to \ncarry out the purposes of the order.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2663. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \ngrant programs to provide for education and outreach on newborn \nscreening and coordinated followup care once newborn screening has been \nconducted, to reauthorize programs under part A of title XI of such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague \nSenator DeWine to introduce legislation to protect the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society: newborn infants. Many people know the joy of \nparenthood. They also know the sense of worry about whether their kids \nare doing well, are feeling well, and are safe. Nothing is of greater \nimportance than the health and well-being of our children.\n  Thanks to incredible advances in medical technology, it is now \npossible to test newborns for more than 50 genetic and metabolic \ndisorders. Many of these disorders, if undetected, would lead to severe \ndisability or death. However, babies that are properly diagnosed and \ntreated can, in many cases, go on to live healthy lives. So newborn \nscreening can literally save lives.\n  Frighteningly, the disorders that newborn screening tests for can \ncome without warning. For most of these disorders, there is no medical \nhistory of the condition in the family, no way to predict the health of \na baby based on the health of the parents. Although the disorders that \nare tested for are quite rare, there is a chance that any one newborn \nwill be effected a sort of morbid lottery. In that sense, this is an \nissue that has a direct impact on the lives of every family.\n  Fortunately, some screening has become common practice in every \nState. Each year, over four million infants have blood taken from their \nheel to detect these disorders that could threaten their life and long-\nterm health. As a result, about one in 4,000 babies is diagnosed with \none of these disorders. That means that newborn screening could protect \nthe health or save the life of approximately 1,000 newborns each year. \nThat is 1,000 tragedies that can be averted families that can know the \njoy of a new infant rather than absolute heartbreak.\n  That is the good news. However, there is so much more to be done. For \nevery baby saved, another two are estimated to be born with potentially \ndetectable disorders that go undetected\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nbecause they are not screened. These infants and their families face \nthe prospect of disability or death from a preventable disorder. The \nsurvival of a newborn may very well come down to the State in which it \nis born, because not all States test for every detectable disorder.\n  The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in 2003 \nhighlighting the need for this legislation. According to the report, \nmost States do not educate parents and health care providers about the \navailability of tests beyond what is mandated by a state. States also \nreported that they do not have the resources to purchase the technology \nand train the staff needed to expand newborn screening programs. \nFinally, even when States do detect an abnormal screening result, the \nmajority do not inform parents directly.\n  Two weeks ago, I visited Stamford Hospital in my home State of \nConnecticut to talk to physicians and parents about newborn screening. \nI was joined there by Pamela Sweeney. Pamela is the mother of 7-year-\nold Jonathan Sweeney. At the time of his birth, Connecticut only tested \nfor eight disorders. He was considered a healthy baby, although he was \na poor sleeper and needed to be fed quite frequently. One morning in \nDecember of 2000, Pamela found Jonathan with his eyes wide open but \ncompletely unresponsive. He was not breathing and appeared to be having \na seizure. Jonathan was rushed to the hospital where, fortunately, his \nlife was saved. He was later diagnosed with L-CHAD, a disorder that \nprevents Jonathan's body from turning fat into energy.\n  Despite this harrowing tale, Jonathan and his family are extremely \nfortunate. Jonathan is alive, and his disorder can be treated with a \nspecial diet. He has experienced developmental delays that most likely \ncould have been avoided had he been tested for L-CHAD at birth. This \nraises a question. Why was he not tested? Why do many States still not \ntest for L-CHAD?\n  The primary reason for this unfortunate reality is the lack of a \nconsensus on the federal level about what should be screened for, and \nhow a screening program should be developed. Fortunately, that is \nchanging. In the Children's Health Act of 2000, Senator DeWine and I \nauthored language to create an Advisory Committee on newborn screening \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services. Last year, that \nAdvisory Committee released a report recommending that all States test \nfor a standard set of 29 disorders. Several States, including \nConnecticut, are already well on their way to meeting this \nrecommendation.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will give states an \nadditional helping hand towards meeting the Advisory's Committee's \nrecommendation by providing $25 million for States to expand and \nimprove their newborn screening programs. In order to access these \nresources, States will be required to commit to screening for all 29 \ndisorders.\n  Our legislation will also provide $15 million for two types of \ngrants. The first seeks to address the lack of information available to \nhealth care professionals and parents about newborn screening. Every \nparent should have the knowledge necessary to protect their child. The \ntragedy of a newborn's death is only compounded by the frustration of \nlearning that the death was preventable. This bill authorizes grants to \nprovide education and training to health care professionals, state \nlaboratory personnel, families and consumer advocates.\n  The second type of grant will support States in providing follow-up \ncare for those children diagnosed by a disorder detected through \nnewborn screening. While these families are the fortunate ones, in many \ncases they are still faced with the prospect of extended and complex \ntreatment or major lifestyle changes. We need to remember that care \ndoes not stop at diagnosis.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) to establish a national surveillance program for \nnewborn screening, and provides $15 million for that purpose. Such a \nprogram will help us conduct research to better understand these rare \ndisorders, and will hopefully lead us towards more effective treatments \nand cures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative so that \nevery newborn child will have the best possible opportunity that \nAmerica can offer to live a long, healthy and happy life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nAviation Fuel Tax Simplification Act. This bill would suspend the new \ntax system on aviation grade kerosene until we have time to adequately \naddress and study the impacts of such a proposal on aviation small \nbusinesses and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.\n  This bill addresses a problem created in the Highway Bill this body \npassed last year. That bill contained a change in the collection of \nfuel taxes for business and general aviation operators.\n  Prior to the Highway bill passing, jet fuel intended for \nnoncommercial use was taxed at 21.9 cents per gallon. Under the new \nprovision, all taxes on aviation jet fuel are collected at the diesel \nfuel rate, which is 24.4 cents per gallon. After collection at the \nhigher rate, the operator or ultimate vendor then has to file a claim \nwith the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, to be reimbursed for the 2.5 \ncent per gallon difference. Once, and only if, the vendor files the \nclaim do the tax revenues then get transferred to the Airport and \nAirway Trust Fund.\n  For general aviation, most of the entities that would be the ultimate \nvendors are the Fixed Based Operators, FBOs, located at the 19,200 \nairports, heliports and seaplane bases throughout the U.S. Most of \nthese FBOs are very small mom and pop businesses, and they do not have \nthe resources to comply with the IRS's ultimate vendor rules.\n  The Highway bill provision took effect last October, with little \nguidance from the IRS on how aviation fuel operators should apply the \nnew policy. This lack of guidance has created an onerous and convoluted \nprocess for taxing aviation jet fuel. It also presents an enormous \nadministrative challenge for aviation businesses, the overwhelming \nmajority of which have never been engaged in any sort of wrongdoing.\n  This provision was put in the Highway bill with the best of \nintentions in an effort to fight fuel fraud. However, I believe that \nprovision has fallen into the category covered by the rule of \nunintended consequences. Unfortunately, the reality is the impact on \nsmall aviation businesses far outweighs the intent.\n  In theory, the provision was put into place to address fuel fraud \nallegations directed at truck drivers filling up with jet fuel to avoid \nthe 24.4 highway/diesel fuel tax. In reality, jet fuel is considerably \nmore expensive than diesel fuel. It makes no sense to me that a truck \ndriver would pay at least $1 per gallon more to save 25 cents per \ngallon in taxes.\n  I have heard from many Montana providers on this issue and I think I \ncan safely say, while the intent was noble, the impact is far too \nburdensome. Because of the burden and the possible impact on the \nAirport and Airway Trust Fund I feel it necessary to immediately \nsuspend the new tax system. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to find a more appropriate way of curbing fuel fraud.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nDodd in introducing the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2006.\n  This important legislation would help States expand and improve their \nnewborn screening programs, educate parents and health care providers \nabout newborn screening, and improve follow-up care for infants with an \nillness detected through screening.\n  Newborn screening is a public health activity used for early \nidentification of infants affected by certain genetic, metabolic, \nhormonal and functional conditions for which there may be an effective \ntreatment or intervention. If left untreated, these conditions can \ncause death, disability, mental retardation, and other serious health \nproblems. Every year, over 4 million infants are born and screened to \ndetect such conditions, with an estimated 3,000 babies identified in \ntime for treatment. However, the number and quality of newborn \nscreening tests performed varies dramatically from State to State. The \nNewborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2006 aims to remedy these problems \nand improve newborn screening for all of America's newborns.\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n  This legislation is important because it provides resources to States \nto expand and improve their newborn screening programs and encourage \nStates to test for the full roster of disorders recommended by the \nAdvisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children. It \nis imperative that we test for the full roster of disorders. That is \nwhy we are introducing this legislation to provide adequate funds to \nget this program started. It authorizes $65 million in fiscal year 07 \nand such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 08 through fiscal \nyear 11 for grants to educate health care professionals, laboratory \npersonnel, and parents about newborn screening and relevant new \ntechnologies.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Dodd and me in co-\nsponsoring this important bill.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Newborn Screening Saves \n     Lives Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Currently, it is possible to test for more than 30 \n     disorders through newborn screening.\n       (2) There is a lack of uniform newborn screening throughout \n     the United States. While a newborn with a debilitating \n     condition may receive screening, early detection, and \n     treatment in 1 location, in another location the condition \n     may go undetected and result in catastrophic consequences.\n       (3) Each year more than 4,000,000 babies are screened by \n     State and private laboratories to detect conditions that may \n     threaten their long-term health.\n       (4) There are more than 2,000 babies born every year in the \n     United States with detectable and treatable disorders that go \n     unscreened through newborn screening.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO TITLE III OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE \n                   ACT.\n\n       Part Q of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280h et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 399AA.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to pharmacies under part D; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pharmacy Access \nImprovement Act of 2006.\n  The Medicare prescription drug benefit got off to a bumpy start. As \nthe new benefit was rolled out, the program experienced problems \nrelated to its computer system and databases. A lot of those problems \nhave been fixed. But a new computer program or new software could not \nfix a number of the problems that pharmacists faced.\n  The Medicare drug benefit made big changes to the pharmacy business. \nTransitioning dual eligible beneficiaries from Medicaid to Medicare \ndrug coverage affected the pharmacists who provide drugs. And \npharmacists have experienced problems dealing with the private drug \nplans that offer the new benefit.\n  I have been hearing from pharmacists in Montana who are struggling. \nThey are trying to help their patients. But they face great difficulty. \nThe success of the Medicare drug benefit ultimately depends on the \npharmacists who deliver the drugs. So we have to help them. And we must \nact now, before pharmacists find that they are no longer able to \nprovide drugs to Medicare beneficiaries, or to provide drugs at all.\n  This bill would provide the help that pharmacists need to continue \ndelivering the Medicare drug benefit. It would resolve problems that \nthey face every day as they provide Medicare beneficiaries with their \ndrugs. It would help ensure that pharmacies remain open and operable so \nthe drug benefit can be a meaningful part of beneficiaries' health \ncare.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would do several things to help \npharmacies. First, it would strengthen the access standards that drug \nplans have to meet. It is important that the drug plans contract with \nbroad and far-reaching networks of pharmacies. This bill would ensure \nthat the pharmacies that drug plans count in their networks provide \nreal access to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  It would also help safety net pharmacies to join drug plan networks. \nThese pharmacies have served the most vulnerable patients for years. \nThey should be able to continue to do so. Drug plans should not be \nallowed to exclude safety net pharmacies. Excluding them does a huge \ndisservice to needy beneficiaries. This bill would rectify the problems \nthat safety net pharmacies have encountered in participating in the \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  The Pharmacy Access Improvement Act would speed up reimbursement to \npharmacies. The delay that pharmacies have experienced in receiving \npayment from drug plans has sent pharmacies all over the country into \nfinancial frenzy. These delays have forced pharmacies to seek \nadditional credit, dip into their savings, or worse, as they try to \ncontinue operations. This bill would require drug plans to pay \npromptly. Most claims would be reimbursed within 2 weeks, making it \neasier for pharmacies to operate. And the bill would impose a monetary \npenalty on plans if they paid late.\n  One of the most common complaints from beneficiaries has been how \nconfused they are. One source of their confusion comes from the \npractice of co-branding. Co-branding is when a drug plan partners with \na pharmacy chain and then includes the pharmacy's logo or name on its \nmarketing materials and identification cards. This is confusing, \nbecause it sends the message that drugs are available only from that \npharmacy. And that is not true. To help end this confusion, the \nPharmacy Access Improvement Act would prohibit drug plans from placing \npharmacy logos or trademarks on their identification cards and restrict \nother forms of co-branding.\n  This bill would also require that pharmacists be paid reasonable \ndispensing fees for each prescription that they fill. Currently, some \nplans pay no dispensing fees. Other plans pay only nominal dispensing \nfees. Pharmacists are not able to cover their costs of dispensing \ndrugs. And that puts them at a severe disadvantage. It eats up their \nmargins from non-Medicare business. And it is unsustainable in the \nlong-run.\n  Some would say that it is too soon to consider legislation that \naffects the Medicare drug benefit. I disagree. The problems that \npharmacists are facing are real. And they are not going away. If we \nwait a year to consider the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act, it may be \ntoo late for many pharmacists and the beneficiaries whom they serve. We \nhave a duty to make the Medicare drug benefit as strong and robust as \nit can be. And the Pharmacy Access Improvement Act presents an \nopportunity for us to do just that. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Conrad, \n        and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2665. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nsimplify and improve the Medicare prescription drug program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Simplification Act of 2006. This bill would improve \nthe Medicare drug benefit by creating simple, understandable benefit \npackages. It would\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nprovide extra funds for State counselors who educate Medicare \nbeneficiaries about the drug benefit. And it would strengthen consumer \nprotections for beneficiaries who enroll.\n  Medicare drug benefits are critical to the health of our Nation's \nelderly and disabled. In 2003, after years of debate, Congress added \ndrug coverage to Medicare through passage of the Medicare Modernization \nAct, the MMA. I was proud to help pass that bill. The law was not \nperfect. But, as I said then, we should not let perfection be the enemy \nof the good. The MMA can go a long way toward helping those who need it \nmost.\n  But implementation of the law has been flawed. The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, was put in charge of ensuring \nthat the prescription drug benefit was fully operational by January 1, \n2006. The task was big. And CMS worked hard to get it done. \nUnfortunately, CMS's efforts have come up short in a few major areas.\n  First, CMS made the new program needlessly confusing. The law charged \nCMS with approving prescription drug plans. Last April, I urged CMS to \napprove only the plans meeting the highest standards, so that seniors \ncould choose among a manageable number of solid offerings. But CMS \nignored that advice.\n  Instead, CMS approved 47 plans in my State alone, and more than 1,500 \nnationwide. Furthermore, the differences between the plans are mind-\nboggling and difficult to sort out, even for the most-savvy consumer. \nBeneficiaries deserve better. They must be able to make apples-to-\napples comparisons in order to choose what is best for them.\n  There are other problems in the way that CMS chose to implement the \nnew program. Consumer protections are weak and inconsistent. The list \nof drugs covered by plans should not change in the middle of the year. \nPlan formularies should be transparent. And patients should be able to \nrequest exceptions to them using the same process and forms, no matter \nwhich plans the patients enrolled in.\n  Also, CMS terribly underfunded State Health Insurance Programs, known \nas SHIPs. These agencies are mainly staffed by volunteers who help \neducate and advise people about Medicare and the new drug benefit. They \nhave held thousands of community events and assisted millions of people \nacross the country. But they struggled to meet demand for help with the \nnew drug program. Last week, Montana AARP donated $40,000 of its own \nfunds to help the Montana SHIP keep enough staff and volunteers through \nthe May 15 deadline. CMS provided only $7,500 for a five-county region \nin Montana with an area bigger than Delaware. In contrast, CMS spent \n$300 million for an ad campaign, a bus tour, and a blimp.\n  Yet despite these ads, many seniors are still confused about the drug \nbenefit. When I asked Montanans how they feel about the new program, \nthey tell me that it is too complex and confusing.\n  Recent focus groups conducted by MedPAC, the group that advises \nCongress on Medicare policy, found the same the problem. According to \nMedPAC, beneficiaries are ``confused by the number of plans, variation \nin benefit structure.''\n  And a study released by the Kaiser Family Foundation says: ``the \nabsence of any standardization for many features of drug plan benefit \ndesign, and even some of the basic terminology used to describe these \nplans, adds to the challenges for beneficiaries'' and ``is likely to \nmake apples-to-apples comparisons across plans more difficult for \nconsumers.'' The report ``confirm[ed] the importance of federal \nsafeguards . . . to minimize unnecessary complexity in [the] Medicare \nprescription drug plan marketplace.''\n  The message is coming through loud and clear from constituents, \nresearchers, advocacy groups, and government advisers. We need to make \nthe Medicare drug benefit more understandable, straightforward, and \ntransparent. And that's what this bill would do.\n  First, the bill would make choices among prescription drug plans more \nsimple and straightforward. It would require the Federal Department of \nHealth and Human Services to define six types of drug benefit packages \nthat insurers could offer. In addition, Medicare and insurers would \nboth have to use uniform language, names, and terminology to describe \ndrug benefit packages. Seniors can reach informed decisions, but they \ndeserve clear options.\n  This approach is similar to the one Congress took with the Medicare \nsupplemental market. In 1980, Congress enacted the Baucus amendments to \nfix marketing abuses and consumer confusion with supplemental or \nMedigap plans.\n  Those reforms required private issuers to meet minimum standards and \nhave minimum loss ratios. Ten years later, Congress again took up \nMedigap reform, passing legislation that led to the standardization of \nMedigap policies. This resulted in a limited number of Medigap options, \neach with a fixed set of benefits. These changes were successful in \nhelping consumers to make comparisons and in strengthening consumer \nprotections.\n  My colleague and co-sponsor, Senator Ron Wyden, was instrumental in \nbringing about these reforms. And I thank him for his involvement then \nand today.\n  The bill that we are introducing today would build on these lessons \nand apply them to the Medicare drug benefit. By establishing six \nstandardized types of benefit packages that insurers can offer, the \nbill would help people to make apples-to-apples comparisons. It would \nmake choices more understandable. It would reduce confusion and help \nbeneficiaries make the decisions that are best for each individual. And \nit would do this while preserving the ability of insurers to compete in \nthe marketplace.\n  Second, the bill would provide extra funds to State Health Insurance \nPrograms through 2010. Putting information on the Internet, television, \nand a toll-free hotline is not enough.\n  Third, the bill would stop drug plans from removing medications or \nincreasing drug costs during the benefit year.\n  Fourth, the bill would prohibit insurance agents from engaging in \nunfair marketing practices that prey on vulnerable people--practices \nlike cold-calling seniors.\n  I believe strongly that Medicare beneficiaries need prescription drug \ncoverage. And, if CMS implements it correctly, the market-based \napproach envisioned in the MMA can deliver those benefits effectively. \nBut a market can work only if the product is well defined and consumers \nhave sufficient knowledge of it. As Adam Smith said: ``[Value] is \nadjusted . . . not by any accurate measure, but by the haggling and \nbargaining of the market.'' It's not fair to expect seniors and people \nwith disabilities to haggle and bargain if the choices are \nincomprehensible.\n  Some may say that lots of choice is good. This is true when people \nbuy cars or toasters. But, as many economists have shown, the health \ncare market is different. People want to choose their providers and \npharmacies. But they do not necessarily want to wade through a \nconfusing array of plans.\n  Some may say that we should hold off making changes until the market \nconsolidates. But that is both unfair and unrealistic. With more than \n1,500 plans in the market now, how much consolidation could really fix \nthe problem of confusion and complexity? Furthermore, the next \nenrollment period is fast approaching, and consumers are insisting on \nrelief now.\n  Some may say that enrollment is high, so why tinker with the benefit? \nBut look at the numbers. In 2003, CMS said that they expected 19 \nmillion Americans to sign up for the drug program. But so far, only 8 \nmillion have voluntarily enrolled. In Montana, only 42 percent of \npeople who have a choice about whether to sign up have done so. We can \ndo better than that. And with passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug \nSimplification Act, we will.\n  The MMA tried to balance the needs of private plans and \nbeneficiaries. But implementation has tilted that balance toward the \nprivate firms, rather than seniors and the disabled. The Medicare \nPrescription Drug Simplification Act of 2006 would restore the proper \nbalance needed to make the drug program work fairly for people with \nMedicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID. (for Mr. Kerry (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Lieberman)):\n  S. 2670. A bill to restore fairness in the provision of incentives \nfor oil and gas production, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2672. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat oil and gas companies will not be eligible for the effective rate \nreductions enacted in 2004 for domestic manufacturers; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Kerry). Mr. President, the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 contained $2.6 billion over 10 years in tax breaks for oil and gas \ncompanies. The bill also contained a $1.5 billion fund for an oil \nconsortium that brings the total handouts for oil companies to more \nthan $4 billion over ten years. These giveaways are on top of at least \n$6 billion in tax breaks already available to the oil industry through \n2009. And these new tax breaks come at a time when the world's largest \nenergy companies are reaping record-setting profits.\n  Just this week, President Bush said: ``Record oil prices and large \ncash flows also mean that Congress has got to understand that these \nenergy companies don't need unnecessary tax breaks like the write-offs \nof certain geological and geophysical expenditures, or the use of \ntaxpayers' money to subsidize energy companies' research into deep \nwater drilling. I'm looking forward to Congress to take about $2 \nbillion of these tax breaks out of the budget over a 10-year period of \ntime. Cash flows are up. Taxpayers don't need to be paying for certain \nof these expenses on behalf of the energy companies.''\n  Not long ago, we heard the top oil executives testify before Congress \nthat they don't need the tax breaks either.\n  Today I am introducing the Energy Fairness for America Act and the \nRestore a Rational Tax Rate on Petroleum Production Act of 2006. These \nbills repeal tax breaks for oil companies, close corporate tax \nloopholes that benefit oil companies, and repeal the new domestic \nmanufacturing deduction for oil and gas companies.\n  The Energy Fairness for America Act will repeal provisions approved \nin the recent Energy Policy Act, as well as pre-existing handouts. \nInstead of providing tax breaks to oil companies, the Energy Fairness \nfor America Act will save at least $28 billion for tax payers. This \nmoney can then go to provide relief to consumers suffering from higher \nenergy costs as well as investments in efficiency and renewable \ntechnologies that can benefit all Americans.\n  The Restore a Rational Tax Rate on Petroleum Production Act of 2006 \nwould repeal the new manufacturing deduction for oil and gas companies \nthat was enacted by Congress in 2004. Congressman McDermott is \nintroducing companion legislation in the House. This domestic \nmanufacturing deduction was designed to replace export-related tax \nbenefits that were successfully challenged by the European Union.\n  Producers of oil and gas did not benefit from this tax break. Initial \nlegislation proposed to address the repeal of the export-related tax \nbenefits and to replace with a new domestic manufacturing deduction \nonly provided the deduction to industries that benefited from the \nexport-related tax benefits. However, the final product extended the \ndeduction to include the oil and gas industry.\n  This legislation repeals the 2004 manufacturing deduction for oil and \ngas companies because these industries suffered no detriment from the \nrepeal of export-related tax benefits. At a time when oil companies are \nreporting record profits, there is no valid reason to reward them with \na tax deduction.\n  Many Members of Congress including myself support a windfall profits \ntax and providing this deduction to oil and gas companies operates as a \nreverse windfall profits tax. This deduction lowers the tax rate on the \nwindfall profits they are currently enjoying. Without Congressional \naction, this benefit will increase. The domestic manufacturing \ndeduction is currently three percent and is schedule to increase to six \npercent in 2007 and nine percent in 2010. This means that next year oil \ncompanies that are benefiting from this deduction will see their \nbenefits double and triple in 2010.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both the Energy Fairness for America \nAct and the Restore a Rational Tax Rate on Petroleum Production Act of \n2006. We owe it to the American people to eliminate tax benefits to the \noil industry at a time of record profits, record gas prices, and a \nprojected record deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2670\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President I rise today with my colleague Senator \nFeinstein to introduce a bill to combat gang violence and honor a young \ngirl from California, Mynesha Crenshaw, who was killed last year in a \ntragic shooting.\n  On November 13, 2005, a gang-related dispute broke out in San \nBernardino, CA and gunfire sprayed an apartment building, killing 11-\nyear old Mynesha Crenshaw and seriously wounding her 14-year old sister \nas they ate Sunday dinner with their family.\n  Imagine the fear and anguish the family and the community still feel \nover this tragedy a young girl, full of hope and promise, dead. Her big \nsister, wounded from the same gunfire, though thankfully she \nsubsequently recovered. Imagine the fear that this could happen again. \nOur hearts and our prayers go out to Mynesha's family and to the entire \ncommunity, which like so many others across the United States, has \nstruggled with gang violence.\n  Last year, there were 58 homicides in San Bernardino, a city of \n200,000 east of Los Angeles, and 13 more homicides so far this year. \nAnd just last month, two men were caught in a gang-related crossfire \nand died in Downtown San Bernardino. This has to stop. It is a waste of \nlife; it is unacceptable.\n  San Bernardino's diverse population of young people and their \nfamilies face many challenges, but San Bernardino also has a vibrant \nand united community, strong leadership, and a desire to come together \nto improve their city.\n  Mynesha Crenshaw's death galvanized over 1,000 residents to take to \nthe streets, demanding change. And some 40 community and religious \nleaders, public officials, and concerned citizens from San Bernardino \nhave joined together to form ``Mynesha's Circle'' to find solutions to \nthe plague of gang violence and to help San Bernardino's young people \ngrow up safe, finish school, and succeed in life.\n  I applaud Mayor Patrick Morris, Police Chief Michael Billdt, \ncommunity leaders Kent Paxton and Rev. Reggie Beamon and Robert Balzer, \nthe publisher of the San Bernardino Sun, for taking up this cause.\n  I want to also thank all the other members of ``Mynesha's Circle'' \nSheryl Alexander, Betty Dean Anderson, Donald Baker, Fred Board, Ruddy \nBravo, Hardy Brown, Cheryl Brown, Mark and Katrina Cato, Larry \nCiecalone, Stephani Congdon, San Bernardino City Schools Superintendent \nArturo Delgado, Tim Evans, San Bernardino County Schools Superintendent \nHerb Fischer, Rialto Schools Superintendent Edna Herring, Sheriff Rod \nHoops, Syeda Jafri, Walter Jarman, Rev. David Kalke, CSU President Al \nKarnig, William Leonard, Sheriff Gary Penrod, DA Michael Ramos, Sandy \nRobbins, Doug Rowand, Larry Sharp, Ron Stark, Tori Stordahl, Heck \nThomas, David Torres, Mark Uffer, San Bernardino Police Chief Gary \nUnderwood, Councilmember Rikke Van Johnson, Bobby Vega, and the Sun \nReader Advisory Board members: Daniel Blakely, Barbara Lee Harn Covey, \nMark Henry, Julie Hernandez, Lynette Kaplan, Brenda Mackey, James \nMagnuson, Julian Melendez, Ernest Ott, Jeffrey Pryor, John Ragsdale, \nGlenda Randolph, Nora Taylor, and David Torres.\n  I have pledged to do what I can at the Federal level to help San \nBernardino. And that is why today I am introducing ``Mynesha's Law,'' \nwith my colleague, Senator Feinstein.\n  ``Mynesha's Law'' will create an interagency Task Force at the \nFederal level, including the Departments of Justice, Education, Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, to take a \ncomprehensive approach to reducing gang violence and targeting \nresources at the communities in our nation most at risk. The resources \nwill come from proven existing Federal programs, including Child Care \nBlock Grants, Head Start, Even Start, Job Corps, COPS, Byrne Grants and \nother programs the Task Forces chooses.\n  Communities will be able to apply to the Department of Justices for \ndesignation as a ``High-Intensity Gang Activity Area'' and then be \neligible to receive targeted assistance from the Task Force.\n  The Task Force will be required to report annually to Congress on the \nbest practices and outcomes among the High-Intensity Gang Activity \nAreas and on the adequacy of Federal funding to meet the needs of these \nareas. If the Task Force identifies any programmatic shortfalls in \naddressing gang prevention, the report will also include a request for \nnew funding or reprogramming of existing funds to meet the shortfalls \nand the bill authorizes such sums to be appropriated.\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\n  In addition to ``Mynesha's Law,'' I am seeking a $1 million \nappropriation that the city of San Bernardino has requested to \nimplement a comprehensive gang intervention and prevention strategy \ncalled ``San Bernardino Gang Free Schools.'' The program would fund 10 \nprobation officers to provide gang resistance and education training to \n57,000 students, as well as case management and oversight for at-risk \nyouth.\n  I am also requesting a $3 million appropriation to renovate and equip \nwhat may be the most important organization for at-risk young people in \nthe area the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino.\n  The Boys and Girls Club is one of the few safe and supportive places \nin San Bernardino where young people can go after school to get help \nwith homework or play sports with their friends. Many community leaders \nbelieve the Boys and Girls Club is one of the best gang prevention \nprograms in San Bernardino and has helped many young people stay in \nschool and out of trouble.\n  This tragic shooting of Mynesha Crenshaw symbolizes the struggle that \nso many communities across the United States, like San Bernardino, face \nin combating gang violence and serves as a reminder of the nationwide \nproblem we face in protecting our children from senseless violence. I \nbelieve ``Mynesha's Law'' will help the children of San Bernardino, and \nacross our nation, grow up safely so they can reach their dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Mynesha's Law''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds--\n       (1) with an estimated 24,500 gangs operating within the \n     United States, gang violence and drug trafficking remain \n     serious problems throughout the country, causing injury and \n     death to innocent victims, often children;\n       (2) on November 13, 2005, a gang-related dispute broke out \n     in San Bernardino, California, and gunfire sprayed an \n     apartment building, killing 11-year old Mynesha Crenshaw and \n     seriously wounding her 14-year old sister as they ate Sunday \n     dinner with their family;\n       (3) this tragic shooting symbolizes the struggle that so \n     many communities across the United States, like San \n     Bernardino, face in combating gang violence, and serves as a \n     reminder of the nationwide problem of protecting children \n     from senseless violence;\n       (4) according to the National Drug Threat Assessment, \n     criminal street gangs are responsible for the distribution of \n     much of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other \n     illegal drugs throughout the United States;\n       (5) the Federal Government has made an increased commitment \n     to the suppression of gang violence through enhanced law \n     enforcement and criminal penalties; and\n       (6) more Federal resources and coordination are needed to \n     reduce gang violence through proven and proactive prevention \n     and intervention programs that focus on keeping at-risk youth \n     in school and out of the criminal justice system.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Native American Languages Act to provide \nfor the support of Native American language survival schools, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \namend the Native American Languages Act, NALA, that was enacted into \nlaw on October 30, 1990, to promote the rights and freedom of Native \nAmericans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages. \nSince 1990, awareness and appreciation of Native languages has grown. \nContinued action and investment in the preservation of Native languages \nis needed. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Daniel \nK. Inouye and Max Baucus, as we seek to improve the cultural and \neducational opportunities available to Native Americans throughout our \nNation.\n  Historians and linguists estimate that there were more than 300 \ndistinct Native languages at the time of first European contact with \nNorth America. Today, there are approximately 155 Native languages that \nremain and 87 percent of those languages have been classified as \ndeteriorating or nearing extinction. Native communities across the \ncountry are being significantly impacted as individuals fluent in a \nNative language are passing away. These\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nspeakers are not only important in perpetuating the language itself, \nbut also serve as repositories of invaluable knowledge pertaining to \ncustoms and traditions, as well as resource use and management.\n  The Native American Languages Act Amendments Act of 2006 would amend \nNALA to authorize the Secretary of Education to provide funds to \nestablish Native American language nest and survival school programs. \nNest and survival school programs are site-based education programs \nconducted through a Native American language. These programs have \nplayed an integral role in bringing together elders and youth to \ncultivate and perpetuate Native American languages. My bill would \nestablish at least four demonstration programs in geographically \ndiverse locations to provide assistance to nest and survival schools \nand participate in a national study on the linguistic, cultural, and \nacademic effects of Native American language nest and survival schools. \nDemonstration programs would be authorized to establish endowments for \nfurthering activities related to the study and preservation of Native \nAmerican languages and to use funds to provide for the rental, lease, \npurchase, construction, maintenance, and repair of facilities.\n  As Americans, it is our responsibility to perpetuate our Native \nlanguages that have shaped our collective identity and contributed to \nour history. For example, during World War II, the United States \nemployed Native American code talkers who developed secret means of \ncommunication based on Native languages. The actions of the code \ntalkers were critical to our winning the war and to saving numerous \nlives. My legislation would serve as another opportunity for our \ncountry to acknowledge and ensure that our future will be enhanced by \nthe contributions of Native language and culture.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to \nenhance the cultural and educational opportunities for Native Americans \nand Native American language speaking individuals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2675. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to set minimum \nfuel economy requirements for federal vehicles, to authorize grants to \nStates to purchase fuel efficient vehicles, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nincrease the fuel economy for our Nation's Federal fleet.\n  Americans are facing record high gasoline prices at over $3 per \ngallon. In some places in my State of California, people are paying \nover $4 per gallon. Oil is selling for over $75 per barrel.\n  We need to say ``enough is enough.'' We need to reduce our dependence \non oil and gasoline. We can do this without changing our quality of \nlife by investing in fuel-efficient cars.\n  The Federal Government must set an example to the American public by \nimproving the Nation's fleet. Each year, the Federal Government \npurchases 58,000 passenger vehicles. According to the Department of \nEnergy, the average fuel economy of the new vehicles purchased for the \nfleet in 2005 was an abysmal 21.4 miles per gallon.\n  In an era, where hybrid cars on the market that can achieve over 50 \nmiles per gallon (mpg), that level of fuel economy is unacceptable.\n  Instead, our government needs to purchase fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, \nand other light trucks.\n  This can be done today. I drive a Toyota Prius that gets over 50 mpg. \nThe Ford Escape SUV can get 36 mpg.\n  To have the Federal Government set an example for the American public \nand to create a larger market for fuel-efficient vehicles, I am \nintroducing the ``Fuel-Efficient Fleets Act of 2006.''\n  This legislation would require all new Federal fleet vehicles to \nobtain a minimum miles per gallon based on vehicle type. The new fuel \nefficiency standards would be as follows: 45 mpg for cars, 36 mpg for \nSUVs, 24 mpg for pickup trucks, 20 mpg for minivans, and 15 mpg for \nvans.\n  The bill establishes a phase-in schedule over 4 years to allow for \nflexibility in purchasing new cars.\n  Additionally, the bill has a provision to allow the standards to be \nincreased if technological advances allow fuel economy to improve.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $100 million in incentive grants for the \nStates' fleets to match or exceed the Federal standards.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill. This will be a good step to \nuse less gasoline in this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2676. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to enter \ninto partnership agreements with entities and local communities to \nencourage greater cooperation in the administration of Forest Service \nactivities on the near National Forest System land, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, last August I participated in the White \nHouse Conference on Cooperative Conservation. The conference reinforced \nthat conservation success can be achieved by collaboration. Many of the \nadvancements in conservation result from the commitment of individuals \nto work together and with local and Federal agencies. Cooperative \nconservation requires cooperative legislation.\n  That is why I rise to introduce the Forest Service Partnership Act, \nwhich will enhance the ability of the Forest Service to work \ncooperatively with local communities. Unfortunately, the authorities \nfor the Forest Service to work jointly with others are a complex \npatchwork of temporary authorities, which have resulted in differing \ninterpretations and lengthy procedures. Additionally, the existing \nauthorities need enhancements to accommodate today's resources \nconservation needs and allow for the delivery of a range of visitor \nservices and interpretive and educational materials.\n  The Forest Service Partnership Enhancement Act will better enable \ncooperative work with the Forest Service by consolidating and providing \npermanent authority for mutually-beneficial agreements with the Forest \nService. The legislation would also enable visitors to purchase health \nand safety items in remote Forest Service locations and permit joint \nfacilities and publications, which benefit the public.\n  In fiscal year 2005 alone, the Forest Service entered into more than \n3,000 cooperative agreements that would be permanently authorized \nthrough this legislation. These agreements leveraged $37.3 million in \nFederal funds with $32.8 million in private contributions for a total \nof more than $70 million worth of mutually-beneficial collaborative \nsuccesses. In my home State of Idaho, the Forest Service entered into a \npublic-private partnership for the construction of 1900 feet of new \nchannel and associated flood plain on Granite Creek. This project \nrestores habitat connectivity to approximately 6 miles of stream. The \ncooperative work of the Forest Service, Avista Utilities, the Idaho \nDepartment of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and 15 \nvolunteers from Trout Unlimited enabled the leveraging of $60,000 of \nForest Service funds with $120,000 from the participating partners.\n  Collaboration is necessary to bring lasting conservation success. The \nForest Service Partnership Act would enhance the ability of the Forest \nService to partner with other Federal agencies, local communities, \ntribal governments, and other interested parties, and I encourage the \ncommitment to collaborative conservation by supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2681. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nreports on the withdrawal or diversion of equipment from Reserve units \nto other Reserve units being mobilized, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nGuard Equipment Accountability Act. I want to thank my colleagues, the \nSenator from Delaware, Senator Biden, and the co-chair of the Senate \nNational Guard Caucus the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, who have \ncosponsored this important piece of legislation.\n  As a Nation, we have a solemn duty to honor, prepare, and properly \nequip all of our men and women in uniform.\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nThat includes our Reserves and National Guard.\n  The National Guard and Reserves represent an essential element of our \nnational defense, confronting our enemies in distant lands and \nresponding to threats of terror right here within our own borders. In \nWashington State, we face threats from volcanoes, tsunamis, and other \nnatural disasters. The National Guard played a critical role in the \nemergency response following the eruption of Mount St. Helens. We have \nrelied on the civil response capabilities of the Guard to protect our \ncommunities from wildfires, floods, and to secure our skies in the \nuncertain hours after 9/11. More recently, in the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, the National Guard responded with urgency and \ncompassion.\n  There are approximately 30,000 members of the National Guard \ncurrently deployed to places like Iraq and Afghanistan. About 500 \nmembers of the Washington National Guard are among them.\n  The men and women who serve in the National Guard are making a great \nsacrifice, fulfilling a distinct and important responsibility. And we \nowe them all of the resources necessary to safely and effectively \nachieve their mission.\n  Right now, there is simply too much uncertainty and when it comes to \nmaintaining adequate equipment levels for our National Guard.\n  When our Reserves and National Guard are deployed on operations \noverseas, they are deployed with equipment from their unit.\n  While serving abroad, their equipment becomes integrated with the \ngreater mission. As a result, when our men and women return home their \nequipment does not often return with them.\n  And too often there is no established plan or process to replace or \neven track that equipment once it's been left behind. As a result, too \nmany of our National Guard units are left underequipped--lacking the \nnecessary equipment for training or to respond to domestic civil \nemergencies.\n  The numbers are clear: According to the Department of Defense, the \nArmy National Guard has left more than 75,000 items valued at $1.7 \nBillion overseas in support of ongoing military operations.\n  Last October, the Government Accountability Office found that at the \ntime the Army could not account for more than half of all items left \nbehind and has not committed to an equipment replacement plan, as \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) policy requires.\n  Given the amount of equipment left behind in total, National Guard \nUnits in other States are surely facing a similar situation.\n  The provisions of my legislation would simply codify provisions of \nDepartment of Defense policy that are critical to providing our men and \nwomen in uniform with the protection and resources they deserve.\n  The National Guard Equipment Accountability Act would require a \ncomprehensive report about all transferred equipment. Within 90 days of \ndiverting equipment from any reserve unit to another reserve unit or to \nactive duty forces, the Secretary of the Army or Air Force would be \nrequired to report it to the Secretary of Defense.\n  The report must also include a plan to replace equipment to the \noriginal unit. Further, if a reserve unit returns from abroad but \nleaves equipment in the theater of operations, the Department of \nDefense would be required to provide a replacement plan for equipment \nto facilitate continued training.\n  Finally, my amendment would require a signed Memorandum of \nUnderstanding specifying exactly how withdrawn equipment will be \ntracked and when that equipment will be returned.\n  Given the current equipment situation, my legislation's provisions \nare crucial. Our soldiers have chosen to follow a noble and selfless \npath. We have a responsibility to give our active duty, reserve units, \nand the men and women of the National Guard, the very best resources so \nthey may fulfill their mission as safely and effectively as possible.\n  We must do so today and everyday for their sacrifice is immense and \nour gratitude is profound.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator Cantwell for \nher leadership on this issue. This bill is a direct result of what we \nhave seen traveling through our States and overseas.\n  Every time I travel to Iraq and Afghanistan, I am struck by the \ncommitment and professionalism of the men and women of our military. \nThey honor America with their service and dedication.\n  What is also noticeable to those of us who have been around for \nawhile is that it is impossible to tell who is in the Guard, the \nReserves, or the Active Duty.\n  Unfortunately, when those same brave men and women return home, it is \noften to units lacking the most basic equipment--radios, trucks, and \nengineering equipment.\n  This is not ``nice to have'' equipment. It is the essential stuff, \nthe most basic equipment, needed to respond to natural disasters or \nperform homeland defense missions.\n  When a governor calls the State Adjutant-General because there has \nbeen a major winter storm, severe flooding, or any natural disaster, \nthat governor expects the National Guard to have the ability to get to \nthe disaster area, assist those in need, and communicate with State and \nFederal leaders and others responding.\n  Today, many State Guard units may not be able to do those basic tasks \nbecause they do not have the equipment they need.\n  Why not? Three reasons.\n  First, for years the Guard was not given all of the equipment it \nneeded. Most units had 65 to 79 percent of what they needed. So they \nstarted the war short.\n  Second, in 2003 the Army began a policy of leaving equipment in Iraq \nto reduce transportation costs and to make sure that those in Iraq \nwould have what they needed. The Defense Department estimates that the \nArmy Guard has left over $1.7 billion worth of equipment in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has found that \nthe Army cannot account for over half of these items and, even worse, \nthe Army has no plan for replacing the equipment.\n  Third, the Army has a huge equipment bill because the equipment in \nIraq is being worn out at two to nine times the rate planned for and \nthe Army is trying to transform itself into a modular force with \nentirely new and different equipment.\n  So, I understand why we have equipment shortages. What I don't \nunderstand is why the Secretary of Defense doesn't have a plan to fix \nthe shortages.\n  In April of 2005, the Department of Defense issued a policy directive \nthat said every time equipment is taken from a Reserve unit, a plan had \nto be developed within 90 days to replace that equipment.\n  It's been a full year since the policy was made official and yet \nStates across the country are desperately short of needed equipment and \nhave not seen any plans.\n  Our legislation would simply make 000 live up to its rhetoric and \nprovide the plans it has promised.\n  There is more that we need to do to address equipment shortages \nthroughout all of our ground forces, but at a minimum we should all be \nable to agree to start by following the current policy of the Defense \nDepartment and make a plan to replace equipment that is not being \nreturned to State units.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 2682. A bill to exclude from admission to the United States aliens \nwho have made investments directly and significantly contributing to \nthe enhancement of the ability of Cuba to develop its petroleum \nresources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to respond to the \ncomments of several of our Senate colleagues. Many of my friends across \nthe aisle have recently spoken about Fidel Castro's announcement that \nhe plans to begin drilling for oil off the coast of Cuba. This means \nthat oil rigs will be operating just 50 miles from the Coast of Florida \nand near the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. My colleagues \nargue that if Castro can drill 50 miles from Florida, American \ncompanies must have the right to meet them on the same playing field \nand beat them at their own game. This line of reasoning, however, has \nseveral flaws.\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nSince when have we made any law or set any business or environmental \nstandard using Cuba as a model? I am astounded that we would attempt to \njustify our actions by holding up Castro's actions as an example to \nfollow.\n  The answer to Castro's outrageous proposal to drill 50 miles from \nFlorida is not to kick off a race to see who can set up the most rigs \nin our precious coastal waters--the answer is to hit back hard and fast \nto stop Castro from drilling so close to our shores.\n  At the same time, it is important to keep in mind that this debate, \nat its heart, is not about Castro. Preventing drilling off the coast of \nFlorida is about preserving one of America's most important coastlines: \na stretch of precious land and sea where critical environmental, \neconomic and military assets overlap. What is truly important to \nunderstand in this debate is how inextricably linked these three \nelements of our national interest are: environmental protection is \ncritical to the tourism industry that is the economic backbone of the \nsoutheastern United States, and above it all, our military uses this \nprotected area for essential land-, air- and sea exercises and testing.\n  Florida, as a community and an economic entity, has worked hard, \ntremendously hard, to build a $62 billion tourism industry employing \nnearly 1 million citizens. This industry would not exist on such a \nlarge, vital scale without the unique and precious environment that is \nthe beauty and essence of our state. Florida is windswept beaches, \nclear blue water, and the great ``River of Grass'' itself--the \nEverglades. And all of these wonders of nature are inhabited by some of \nAmerica's most beautiful and exotic wildlife: manatees, crocodiles, \npanthers and ospreys. We have learned the hard way that failing to \nprotect our environment has deadly consequences, consequences that will \nhave a stark impact on the very tourism industry that support so many \nfamilies in our state. In fact, Congress has invested some $8 billion \nin restoring this remarkable ecosystem. Now that investment is put at \nrisk.\n  In January 1969, an explosion at a California offshore drilling site \ncaused a 200,000-gallon crude oil spill off the coast. While small in \ncomparison to other spills, that incident dealt a devastating blow to \nneighboring beaches and aquatic life. As tides brought an 800-square-\nmile slick ashore, oil coated 35 miles of the coastline, blackening \nbeaches and killing thousands of birds, dolphins, seals, fish and other \nwildlife. A national outcry followed, and sparked a movement that led \nto legal bans on drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, including the \neastern Gulf of Mexico off of Florida.\n  This wise ban is now at risk--nearly 40 years after that deadly spill \nin California, must we be doomed to repeat the past? After so many \nyears and so much additional economic and environmental research, we \nknow better than ever that the real value lies in protecting the \ntourism industry and its environmental foundation. I refuse to see the \nlong-standing consensus against drilling off of Florida scrapped for \nthe sake of ``keeping up with the Castros.''\n  And, finally, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to the \ngrave consequences that oil drilling poses not only to America's \nbeaches and environment, but also to our national interests and foreign \npolicy. We must do all we can to prevent Castro from drilling for oil \nso close to the shores of Florida. Foreign oil companies must not \nprovide the props to support Castro's regime without facing stiff \npenalties.\n  For all of these reasons, I am introducing legislation today that \nwill nullify the agreement that defines the maritime borders between \nthe United States and Cuba. This agreement was negotiated in 1977--a \ndifferent era--when oil drilling so close to our shores was not \ncontemplated. The agreement draws a line through the middle of the 90 \nmiles of ocean that separate our two countries. Without this line, \nforeign oil companies have no legal basis for exploring in waters that \nare claimed by both the U.S. and Cuba. We cannot allow this agreement--\nnever ratified by the Senate--to enable Castro's foolhardy exploration \nfor oil in areas so near to some of the most pristine waters in our \ncountry.\n  The legislation also takes a second step to further dissuade foreign \noil companies from exploring for oil so close to our coastline. It will \nbar the Secretary of State from granting visas to executives of foreign \noil companies who invest in petroleum development off the North coast \nof Cuba. This legislation, an expansion of the landmark Helms-Burton \nlaw, is a step in the right direction. It is only a first step, but I \ncall on my colleagues to join me in preventing a tyrannical dictator \nfrom drilling for oil so close to our shores.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 35. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to clarify that the Constitution \nneither prohibits voluntary prayer nor requires prayer in schools; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States to clarify that the Constitution \nneither prohibits voluntary prayer nor requires prayer in the public \nschools of this country.\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\n  On September 25, 1885, an entrancing poem was published in the \nGlenville Crescent, the local paper in Gilmer County, West Virginia. \nThe poem was attributed to Mrs. Ellen Rudell King, the wife of the \nReverend David King, a man of the cloth who ministered to the citizens \nof Glenville, WV. Over time, people learned that the poem may have been \nwritten by the reverend as a gift to his wife Ellen, his soulmate. Just \nas my beloved Erma was my soulmate the West Virginia Reverend David \nKing also had a soulmate, his wife Ellen.\n  Today we recognize that his poem was a gift not just to his wife \nEllen but also to the State of West Virginia and to the Nation. In \nfact, when the poem was published at the end of the 19th century, its \ntone was so melodious, its message so inspiring, it drew the attention \nof a composer named Howard Engle. West Virginians know the story of \nwhat happened next. Howard Engle liked the poem so much that he decided \nto compose a tune to accompany its lyrical verse. In 1961, his musical \ncomposition became the West Virginia State song, known by its title \ntoday as ``The West Virginia Hills.'' Let me read for the Senators just \na few of the stanzas of this beautiful song:\n\n       Oh, West Virginia hills! How majestic and how grand, with \n     their summits bathed in glory, like our Prince Immanuel's \n     land! Is it any wonder then, that my heart with rapture \n     thrills, as I stand once more with loved ones on those West \n     Virginia hills?\n       Oh, the West Virginia hills! Where my childhood hours were \n     passed, where I often wandered lonely, and the future tried \n     to cast; many are our visions bright, which the future ne'er \n     fulfills; but how sunny were my daydreams on those West \n     Virginia hills!\n       Oh, the West Virginia hills, how unchanged they seem to \n     stand, with their summits pointed skyward to the great \n     Almighty's land! Many changes I can see, which my heart with \n     sadness fills; but no changes can be noticed in those West \n     Virginia hills.\n\n  Ah, ah, those West Virginia hills. For West Virginians, this song, \nwith its prayerful verse, has always been an uplifting reminder of the \nmemories of our childhoods, our fervent hopes for a bright future, a \ntestament to the beauty of our resplendent natural landscape, and a \nsource of solace in time of trouble.\n  Regrettably, since January, West Virginians have had good reason to \nseek such solace. As witnessed by all of America since this year began, \nWest Virginia has been beset by unspeakable tragedy. We have lost 18 \ncoal miners--favorite sons of the West Virginia hills--in Boone County, \nin Logan County, in Mingo County, and in Upshur County. In the words of \nour ancient sweet song, these tragic events ``our heart with sadness \nfills.''\n  But we West Virginians stand strong despite our grief, steadfast in \nour devotion to one another and to Almighty God, from whom all good \nthings come, from whom all blessings flow.\n  In our Easter season we celebrate the belief in both the resurrection \nof the dead and the life of the world to come. We know that while our \nway may not always be God's way, His way is the only way. Therefore, \nour way must be His way. We know that life's most bitter travails can, \nat times, sear the human soul, painfully driving good people to their \nknees--sometimes through no fault of their own. But we also know that \nas long as there is life, there is hope, and we know that hardship can \nbe endured and in fact diminished through the power--the ever working \npower--of prayer. We know this. We know it. We know it based on \nexperience.\n  Over these past 5 years, as I watched my childhood sweetheart, my \ndarling Erma--my darling Erma, who is in heaven now--I watched her fall \nill and become increasingly frail. But she and I prayed for each other. \nWe prayed every day. There were many good times--many good times--but \nthere were also times that were difficult. Through it all, it was our \nabiding faith, Erma's and mine which we celebrated in prayer together, \nwhich I believe kept us devoted to one another and to God for nearly 69 \nyears, through thick and thin, through good times and hard times. Our \nmarriage was literally made in heaven, and I believe its duration was \nGod's answer to our shared prayer.\n  So when I say that I know prayer can work miracles and move \nmountains, I speak from experience. I am a witness to the power of \nprayer.\n  But I am not unique. West Virginians have been and always will be a \ndeeply spiritual and reverent people. In that sense, it remains as true \ntoday as it was in 1885 that no changes can be noticed in those West \nVirginia hills.\n  The Apostle Paul has told us that in the face of affliction--in the \nface of affliction--it is our job not to give in to discouragement but \nto proclaim the truth openly and to commend ourselves to every man's \nconscience before God.\n  So for people of faith, the question remains how best to do this. How \ndo we lift our heads from the darkness to the light--from the darkness \nto the light? How do we help ourselves and others to keep the faith? \nThe answer lies in three simple words: Let us pray. The Gospel, St. \nJohn 14, verse 13, tells us that we can have this confidence in God: \nthat he hears us--yes, that he hears us whenever we ask for anything \naccording to His will. Not always according to our will but according \nto His will.\n\n  The importance of prayer throughout all of the millennia is \nrecognized by people of faith in nearly every denomination. Now get \nthis: Yet, in America, prayer is increasingly estranged from public \nlife. Some are hesitant to pray for fear they might offend someone \nelse. How ridiculous, to think that prayer can be offensive. Offensive \nto whom? Nonbelievers? Well, they need only close their ears. How sad, \nreally, that we cannot share our faith, particularly in an effort to \ncomfort others, without being accused of offending someone or, worse, \nviolating the first amendment to the Constitution.\n  Regrettably, that is the unfortunate situation that confronts the \nfaithful in America today. How can this be possible? Does anyone really \nbelieve this state of affairs is consistent with the intent of the \nFramers of the Constitution?\n  I have referenced the religious beliefs of our Founders many times on \nthe Senate floor, but I think it bears repeating. I think we should not \nforget the mindset of those who established our representative \ndemocracy, this Republic. They were not afraid of prayer. They believed \nin a Supreme Being, and they did not hesitate to say so. They were \nproud of their faith. They proclaimed it from the rooftops; yes, from \nthe steeple tops. They did not hang their heads in shame.\n  Listen. Listen. Listen to what John Adams said. He served as Vice \nPresident for 8 years under George Washington. He was a member of the \nContinental Congress. He signed the Declaration of Independence. In an \nentry in his diary on February 22, 1756, John Adams wrote:\n\n       Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the \n     Bible for their only lawbook and every member should regulate \n     his conduct by the precepts there exhibited. Every member \n     would be obliged in conscience to temperance, frugality, and \n     industry; to justice, kindness, and charity toward his fellow \n     men; and to piety, love and reverence toward almighty God. . \n     . . What a Utopia, what a paradise would this region be.\n\n  John Adams believed that the Bible could be our only lawbook--think \nof that. What a small but mighty tome.\n  What about Benjamin Franklin? Was he afraid to discuss religion for \nfear of offending sensibilities? No, heavens no. When the Congress \nestablished a three-man committee, of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and \nBen Franklin, to design a great seal of the United States, it was \nFranklin who suggested that the seal be one of Moses lifting his wand, \ndividing the Red Sea, with pharaoh in his chariot, overwhelmed by \nwater. His suggested motto was, ``Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to \nGod.''\n  Thomas Jefferson similarly suggested a Biblical theme, highlighting \nthe children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a \npillar of fire by night. These are vivid religious images that our \nFounding Fathers proposed be adopted as enduring symbols of our \nrepresentative form of government.\n  The Founders did not view these proposals as repugnant religiosity, \nsomething to be kept under wraps for fear of offending the popular \nculture. They were creating the culture.\n  I have long been opposed to what I call the censorship of religion in \nAmerica. I have said it before. I say it again. I don't agree with many \nof the decisions that have come down from the courts concerning prayer \nin the public schools or prohibiting the display of religious items in \npublic places. I believe in ruling after ruling some of our courts, led \nby the Supreme Court, have been moving closer and closer to prohibiting \nthe free exercise of religion in America, and it chills my soul. \nAmericans don't want religious censorship--\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nno. Ours is a religious nation. It may not seem so but it is. We are a \nreligious people. We may not seem so at times, not all of us, but we \nembrace religion as a people. We draw it close, close to us. We drape \nit over us, we draw it around us, we envelope our families in its \nprotective shield. We will not shun it. We will not deny it. We will \nnot run from it. We must be free to exercise our religious faith, if we \nhave a religious faith, whatever it may be.\n  The religion clauses of the first amendment state:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .\n\n  In my humble opinion, too many have not given equal weight to both of \nthese clauses. Instead, they seem to have focused only on the first \nclause which says ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion,'' at the expense of the second clause, which \nsays, ``or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''\n  Yes, that protects the right of Americans to worship as they please. \nI have always believed that this country was founded by men and women \nof strong faith whose intent was not to suppress religion but to ensure \nthat the government favors no single religion over another. This \nprinciple makes a lot of sense to me; namely, that government itself \nshould seek neither to discourage nor to promote religion. We can \nunderstand the outrage of many fine people of faith who today decry the \nnature of our public discourse, with its overt emphasis on sex, \nviolence, profanity, and materialism.\n  In addition, we live today with the omnipresent fear of another \nterrorist attack, global warming, avian flu, rising fuel and health \ncare costs, and a whole panoply of other potential calamities over \nwhich we seem to have little or no control. Our Nation has every reason \nto seek comfort through prayer.\n  Nearly 44 years ago, on June 27, 1962--I was here. I was sitting over \non that side of the Chamber, to my left, in the back row. Forty-four \nyears ago, on June 27, 1962, 2 days after the U.S. Supreme Court first \nstruck down prayer in schools, I made the following statement on the \nSenate floor. I said it then. I say it today.\n\n       Thomas Jefferson expressed the will of the American \n     majority in 1776 when he included in the Declaration of \n     Independence the statement, ``All men''--\n\nMeaning, of course, women, too--\n\n     ``All men are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness.''\n\n  Little could Mr. Jefferson suspect when he penned that line that the \ntime would come that the Nation's highest Court might rule that a \nnondenominational prayer to the Creator of us all, if offered by \nschoolchildren in the public schools of America during class periods, \nwould be unconstitutional. I believe this ingrained predisposition \nagainst expressions of religious or spiritual beliefs is wrongheaded, \ndestructive, and completely contrary to the intent of the illustrious \nFounders of this great Nation. Instead of ensuring freedom of religion \nin a nation founded in part to guarantee that basic liberty, a \nsuffocation or strangulation, if you might, of that freedom has been \nthe result. The rights of those who do not believe, and they are few in \nnumber who do not believe--the rights of those who do not believe in a \nSupreme Being have been zealously guarded to the denigration--and I \nrepeat, denigration--of the rights of those people who do so believe.\n  The Supreme Court has bent over backward to prevent the government \nfrom establishing religion--which is all right--but it has not gone far \nenough and, in fact, our government has fallen far short of protecting \nthe right of all Americans to exercise their religion.\n  The free exercise clause of the first amendment states:\n\n       Congress cannot make laws that prohibit the free exercise \n     of religion.\n\n  Well, it seems to me that any prohibition of voluntary prayer in the \npublic schools violates the right of our schoolchildren to practice \ntheir free religion, and that is not right. Any child should be free to \npray to God of his or her own volition, whether at home, whether at \nchurch, whether at school, period.\n  I am not a proponent of repeatedly amending the U.S. Constitution. I \nbelieve such amendments should be done only rarely and with great care. \nHowever, because I feel as strongly about this today as I have for more \nthan 40 years, I take this opportunity, once again, as I have at least \n7 times over the past 44 years, to introduce today a joint resolution \nto amend the Constitution to clarify the intent of the Framers with \nrespect to voluntary prayer in schools.\n  Our revered Constitution--this sacred document--was conceived by the \nFramers neither to prohibit nor to require the recitation of voluntary \nprayer in public schools. Consequently, the exact language of the \nresolution that I am introducing to amend the Constitution simply makes \nthat clear.\n  It states--get this:\n\n       Nothing in this Constitution, including any amendments to \n     this Constitution, shall be construed to prohibit voluntary \n     prayer or require prayer at a public school extracurricular \n     activity.\n\n  This resolution is similar to legislation that I introduced or \ncosponsored starting in 1962 but more recently in 1973, 1979, 1982, \n1993, 1995, and 1997.\n  I believe Members of the Supreme Court have placed exaggerated \nemphasis on the Framers' alleged intent to erect an absolute ``wall of \nseparation'' between church and state. I do not share that view.\n  I believe the right of every schoolchild to pray or not to pray \nvoluntarily, if he or she chooses to do so, is protected by both the \nfree speech and the free exercise clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Even the Supreme Court in the case of Lynch v. Donnelly, in 1984, \nagreed that the Constitution does not require the complete separation \nof church and state. Instead, it mandates an accommodation of all \nreligions and forbids hostility toward any.\n  Let me be clear that what we are talking about is not a radical \ndeparture. It is simply a reiteration of what should already be \npermissible under a correct interpretation of the first amendment.\n  My resolution does not change the language of the first amendment, \nand it would not permit any school to advocate a particular religious \nmessage endorsed by the government. My resolution would simply \nreiterate the Framers' intent that a child should be able to utter a \nvoluntary prayer. There is absolutely nothing unconstitutional about \nthat.\n  This resolution seeks neither to advance nor to inhibit religion. It \ndoes not signify government approval of any particular religious sect \nor creed. It does not compel a ``nonbeliever'' to pray. In fact, it \ndoes not require an atheist to embrace or to adopt any religious \naction, belief, or expression. It does not coerce or compel anyone to \ndo anything. And it does not foster any excessive government \nentanglement with religion.\n  This constitutional amendment is neutral. It is nondiscriminatory. It \ndoes not endorse state-sponsored school prayer. It simply allows \nchildren to pray voluntarily, if they wish to do so. It permits \nchildren to express themselves on the subject of prayer just as anyone \nis free to express themselves on any other topic.\n  As Justice Scalia recently held: ``A priest has as much liberty to \nproselytize as a patriot.''\n  The Supreme Court has held that the establishment clause is not \nviolated so long as the government treats religious speech and other \nspeech equally.\n  This resolution has a valid secular purpose, which is to ensure that \nreligious and nonreligious speech are treated equally, and this secular \npurpose is preeminent. This purpose is not secondary to any religious \nobjective.\n  In one of the more recent cases on the subject, the Supreme Court, in \nSanta Fe v. Jane Doe, reiterated that the religious clauses of the \nfirst amendment prevent the government from ``making any law respecting \nthe establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise \nthereof.'' But by ``no means,'' the Court held, ``do these commands \nimpose a prohibition on all religious activity in our public schools.''\n  ``Indeed,'' the Court ruled, ``the common purpose of the Religious \nClauses is to secure religious liberty.''\n  Thus, Justice Stevens wrote:\n\n       Nothing in the Constitution as interpreted by this Court \n     prohibits any public school student from unvoluntarily \n     praying at any time before, during or after the school day.\n\n  He went on to declare, though, that ``the religious liberty protected \nby this\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nConstitution is abridged when the state affirmatively sponsors a \nparticular religious practice or prayer.''\n\n  So let me reiterate that the resolution I am introducing today \naddresses only voluntary student prayer--not state-sponsored speech.\n  In one of her final rulings on this subject, Justice O'Connor held \nthat the first amendment expresses our Nation's fundamental commitment \nto religious liberty by means of two provisions--one protecting the \nfree exercise of religion, the other barring the establishment of \nreligion.\n  ``They were written,'' she said, ``by the descendants of people who \nhad come to this land precisely so that they could practice their \nreligion freely.'' And, ``by enforcing these two clauses,'' she said, \n``we have kept religion a matter for the individual conscience, not for \nthe prosecutor or the bureaucrat.''\n  We should keep it that way. We should keep it that way. We should \nkeep religion a matter for the individual conscience. But does keeping \nreligion a matter for the individual conscience mean that a schoolchild \nmust stand silent, unable to turn to God for comfort or guidance in \ntimes of trial or heartache? No. No. No. Not even our Supreme Court has \nrecognized that. Not every reference to God constitutes the \nimpermissible establishment of religion.\n  Where would we be without recourse to prayer?\n  As we know, even the mighty King David sought guidance from above. In \nPsalm, 17, he implores:\n\n       Hear, O Lord, a just suit; attend to my outcry; harken to \n     my prayer from lips without deceit . . . I call upon You for \n     You will answer me, O God; incline Your ear to me; hear my \n     word . . . keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the \n     shadows of Your wings.\n\n  In our Nation's Capitol, just off the Rotunda, there is a small room \ncalled the Prayer Room. I was there when it was first dedicated. A \nsmall room called the Prayer Room was set aside in 1954 by the 83rd \nCongress to be used for private prayer and contemplation by Members of \nCongress. The room is open.\n  Have you ever been there? If you haven't, you ought to go to see that \nPrayer Room. I go to it still from time to time.\n  The room is open when Congress is in session though not open to the \npublic. The room's focal point is a stained glass window that shows \nGeorge Washington kneeling in prayer. Behind him are etched these words \nfrom Psalm 16:1: ``Preserve me, o God, for in thee do I put my trust.''\n  What right do we have to take from schoolchildren their right to pray \na voluntary prayer when we preserve, protect, and defend and even \ncreate a seperate room to enshrine that same right to ourselves here in \nthe Senate?\n  St. Luke, the apostle, tells us that such efforts are as much in our \nown interest as they are in the best interests of a child. Here is what \nSt. Luke tells us:\n\n       Ask and you shall receive; seek and you shall find; knock \n     and it shall be opened to you. For whoever asks, receives; \n     whoever seeks, finds; whoever knocks is admitted. What father \n     among you will give his son a snake if he asks for a fish, or \n     hand him a scorpion if he asks for an egg? If you, with all \n     your sins, know how to give your children good things, how \n     much more will the Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to \n     those who ask him?\n\n  We must work to be certain that the free exercise clause remains as \napplicable and respected today as it was at the time it was conceived \nby the Framers.\n  We must guard its protection so that all Americans, including, yes, \nchildren, little children--suffer little children--retain their right \nfreely to practice their religion. Let us make certain that every \nindividual, including any child nestled in the West Virginia hills or \nanywhere else in America, can pray to God as they please.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 450\n\n       Whereas the mission of the National Safety Council is to \n     educate and influence citizens of the United States to adopt \n     safety, health, and environmental policies, practices, and \n     procedures that prevent and mitigate human suffering and \n     economic losses arising from preventable causes;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council works to protect lives \n     and promote health with innovative programs;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council, founded in 1913, is \n     celebrating its 93rd anniversary in 2006 as the premier \n     source of safety and health information, education, and \n     training in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council was chartered by \n     Congress in 1953, and is celebrating its 53rd anniversary in \n     2006 as a congressionally-chartered organization;\n       Whereas even with advancements in safety that create a \n     safer environment for the people of the United States, such \n     as new legislation and improvements in technology, the \n     unintentional-injury death toll is still unacceptable;\n       Whereas the National Safety Council has demonstrated \n     leadership in educating citizens of the United States on how \n     to prevent injuries and deaths to senior citizens as a result \n     of falls;\n       Whereas citizens deserve a solution to nationwide safety \n     and health threats;\n       Whereas such a solution requires the cooperation of all \n     levels of government, as well as the general public;\n       Whereas the summer season, traditionally a time of \n     increased unintentional-injury fatalities, is an appropriate \n     time to focus attention on both the problem and the solution \n     to such safety and health threats; and\n       Whereas the theme of ``National Safety Month'' for 2006 is \n     ``Making Our World A Safer Place'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2006 as ``National Safety Month''; and\n       (2) recognizes the accomplishments of the National Safety \n     Council and calls upon the citizens of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Dole, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Allen, and Senator Durbin to submit a resolution to \ndesignate June 2006 as National Safety Month. This year, the National \nSafety Council has selected ``making our world a safer place'' as its \ntheme for National Safety Month. And that is certainly a goal we want \nand need to achieve.\n  Public safety in the workplace, in our homes, and in communities, and \non our roads and highways is a vital challenge that we all face. \nAccording to the National Safety Council, more than 20 million \nAmericans suffer disabling injuries and 100,000 people die from their \ninjuries each year. In the United States, nearly 43,000 people die each \nyear from motor vehicle crashes, making auto fatalities the number one \nkiller of those between the ages of 4 and 34. Many of these deaths and \ninjuries could be prevented with increased education and information on \nproper precautionary measures.\n  The goal of National Safety Month is to raise public awareness about \nsafety and injury prevention in hopes of reducing these needless deaths \nand injuries. June also is an appropriate month to focus our efforts on \npublic safety since the summer season is traditionally a time of \nincreased accidental injuries and fatalities.\n  Throughout the month, the National Safety Council and other safety \norganizations will urge businesses to increase their safety standards \nin the workplace and provide information to individuals on injury \nprevention in all aspects of their lives.\n  I look forward to working with other Members of Congress and the many \nsafety organizations to help educate the public on the importance of \ninjury prevention and make our world a safer place.\n  I thank my fellow Colleagues for their support of this resolution and \nfor their continued dedication to public safety. I also would like to \nthank the National Safety Council, which celebrates its 93rd \nanniversary in 2006, as a leading source of safety and health \ninformation, education, and training in the United States. Their work \nis vital and makes a difference each and every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3722-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3722-S3723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 451--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT OF THE SENATE FOR THE \n RECONVENING OF THE PARLIAMENT OF NEPAL AND FOR AN IMMEDIATE, PEACEFUL \n                        TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Chafee, \nMr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Sununu) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 451\n\n       Whereas, in 1990, Nepal adopted a constitution that \n     enshrined multi-party democracy under a constitutional \n     monarchy, ending 3 decades of absolute monarchical rule;\n       Whereas, since 1996, Maoist insurgents have waged a violent \n     campaign to replace the constitutional monarchy with a \n     communist republic, which has resulted in widespread human \n     rights violations by both sides and the loss of an estimated \n     12,000 lives;\n       Whereas the Maoist insurgency grew out of the \n     radicalization and fragmentation of left wing parties \n     following Nepal's transition to democracy in 1990;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2001, King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya \n     and other members of the Royal family were murdered, leaving \n     the throne to the slain King's brother, the current King \n     Gyanendra;\n       Whereas, in May 2002, in the face of increasing Maoist \n     violence, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dissolved the \n     Parliament of Nepal;\n       Whereas, in October 2002, King Gyanendra dismissed Prime \n     Minister Deuba;\n       Whereas, in June 2004, after the unsuccessful tenures of 2 \n     additional palace-appointed prime ministers, King Gyanendra \n     reappointed Prime Minister Deuba and mandated that he hold \n     general elections by April 2005;\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra accused Nepali \n     political leaders of failing to solve the Maoist problem, \n     seized absolute control of Nepal by dismissing and detaining \n     Prime Minister Deuba and declaring a state of emergency, \n     temporarily shut down Nepal's communications, detained \n     hundreds of politicians and political workers, and limited \n     press and other constitutional freedoms;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, the mainstream political parties \n     formed a seven-party alliance with the Maoists and agreed to \n     a 12 point agenda that called for a restructuring of the \n     government of Nepal to include an end to absolute monarchical \n     rule and the formation of an interim all-party government \n     with a view to holding elections for a constituent assembly \n     to rewrite the Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas, since February 2005, King Gyanendra has \n     promulgated dozens of ordinances without parliamentary \n     process that violate basic freedoms of expression and \n     association, including the Election Code of Conduct that \n     seeks to limit media freedom in covering elections and the \n     Code of Conduct for Social Organizations that bars staff of \n     nongovernmental organizations from having political \n     affiliations;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered the arrest of hundreds of \n     political workers in January 2006 before holding municipal \n     elections on February 8, 2006, which the Department of State \n     characterized as ``a hollow attempt by the King to legitimize \n     his power'';\n       Whereas the people of Nepal have been peacefully protesting \n     since April 6, 2006, in an attempt to restore the democratic \n     political process;\n       Whereas on April 10, 2006, the Department of State declared \n     that King Gyanendra's February 2005 decision ``to impose \n     direct palace rule in Nepal has failed in every regard'' and \n     called on the King to restore democracy immediately and to \n     begin a dialogue with Nepal's political parties;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered a crackdown on the protests, \n     which has left at least 14 Nepali citizens dead and hundreds \n     injured by the security forces of Nepal;\n       Whereas the people of Nepal are suffering hardship due to \n     food shortages and lack of sufficient medical care because of \n     the prevailing political crisis;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra announced on April 21, 2006, that \n     the executive power of Nepal shall be returned to the people \n     and called on the seven-party alliance to name a new prime \n     minister to govern the country in accordance with the 1990 \n     Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas the seven-party alliance subsequently rejected King \n     Gyanendra's April 21, 2006 statement and called on him to \n     reinstate parliament and allow for the establishment of a \n     constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution;\n       Whereas on April 24, 2006, King Gyanendra announced that he \n     would reinstate the Parliament of Nepal on April 28, 2006, \n     and apologized for the deaths and injuries that occurred \n     during the recent demonstrations, but did not address the \n     issue of constitutional revision;\n       Whereas political party leaders have welcomed King \n     Gyanendra's April 24th announcement and stated that the first \n     action of the reconvened parliament will be the scheduling of \n     elections for a constituent assembly to redraft the \n     Constitution of Nepal.\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the reconvening of the \n     Parliament of Nepal and

Res. 451\n\n       Whereas, in 1990, Nepal adopted a constitution that \n     enshrined multi-party democracy under a constitutional \n     monarchy, ending 3 decades of absolute monarchical rule;\n       Whereas, since 1996, Maoist insurgents have waged a violent \n     campaign to replace the constitutional monarchy with a \n     communist republic, which has resulted in widespread human \n     rights violations by both sides and the loss of an estimated \n     12,000 lives;\n       Whereas the Maoist insurgency grew out of the \n     radicalization and fragmentation of left wing parties \n     following Nepal's transition to democracy in 1990;\n       Whereas, on June 1, 2001, King Birendra, Queen Aishwarya \n     and other members of the Royal family were murdered, leaving \n     the throne to the slain King's brother, the current King \n     Gyanendra;\n       Whereas, in May 2002, in the face of increasing Maoist \n     violence, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba dissolved the \n     Parliament of Nepal;\n       Whereas, in October 2002, King Gyanendra dismissed Prime \n     Minister Deuba;\n       Whereas, in June 2004, after the unsuccessful tenures of 2 \n     additional palace-appointed prime ministers, King Gyanendra \n     reappointed Prime Minister Deuba and mandated that he hold \n     general elections by April 2005;\n       Whereas, on February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra accused Nepali \n     political leaders of failing to solve the Maoist problem, \n     seized absolute control of Nepal by dismissing and detaining \n     Prime Minister Deuba and declaring a state of emergency, \n     temporarily shut down Nepal's communications, detained \n     hundreds of politicians and political workers, and limited \n     press and other constitutional freedoms;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, the mainstream political parties \n     formed a seven-party alliance with the Maoists and agreed to \n     a 12 point agenda that called for a restructuring of the \n     government of Nepal to include an end to absolute monarchical \n     rule and the formation of an interim all-party government \n     with a view to holding elections for a constituent assembly \n     to rewrite the Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas, since February 2005, King Gyanendra has \n     promulgated dozens of ordinances without parliamentary \n     process that violate basic freedoms of expression and \n     association, including the Election Code of Conduct that \n     seeks to limit media freedom in covering elections and the \n     Code of Conduct for Social Organizations that bars staff of \n     nongovernmental organizations from having political \n     affiliations;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered the arrest of hundreds of \n     political workers in January 2006 before holding municipal \n     elections on February 8, 2006, which the Department of State \n     characterized as ``a hollow attempt by the King to legitimize \n     his power'';\n       Whereas the people of Nepal have been peacefully protesting \n     since April 6, 2006, in an attempt to restore the democratic \n     political process;\n       Whereas on April 10, 2006, the Department of State declared \n     that King Gyanendra's February 2005 decision ``to impose \n     direct palace rule in Nepal has failed in every regard'' and \n     called on the King to restore democracy immediately and to \n     begin a dialogue with Nepal's political parties;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra ordered a crackdown on the protests, \n     which has left at least 14 Nepali citizens dead and hundreds \n     injured by the security forces of Nepal;\n       Whereas the people of Nepal are suffering hardship due to \n     food shortages and lack of sufficient medical care because of \n     the prevailing political crisis;\n       Whereas King Gyanendra announced on April 21, 2006, that \n     the executive power of Nepal shall be returned to the people \n     and called on the seven-party alliance to name a new prime \n     minister to govern the country in accordance with the 1990 \n     Constitution of Nepal;\n       Whereas the seven-party alliance subsequently rejected King \n     Gyanendra's April 21, 2006 statement and called on him to \n     reinstate parliament and allow for the establishment of a \n     constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution;\n       Whereas on April 24, 2006, King Gyanendra announced that he \n     would reinstate the Parliament of Nepal on April 28, 2006, \n     and apologized for the deaths and injuries that occurred \n     during the recent demonstrations, but did not address the \n     issue of constitutional revision;\n       Whereas political party leaders have welcomed King \n     Gyanendra's April 24th announcement and stated that the first \n     action of the reconvened parliament will be the scheduling of \n     elections for a constituent assembly to redraft the \n     Constitution of Nepal.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the reconvening of the \n     Parliament of Nepal and for an immediate, peaceful transition \n     to democracy;\n       (2) commends the desire of the people of Nepal for a \n     democratic system of government and expresses its support for \n     their right to protest peacefully in pursuit of this goal;\n       (3) acknowledges the April 24, 2006 statement by King \n     Gyanendra regarding his intent to reinstate the Parliament of \n     Nepal;\n       (4) urges the Palace, the political parties, and the \n     Maoists to immediately support a process that returns the \n     country to multi-party democracy and creates the conditions \n     for peace and stability in Nepal;\n       (5) declares that the transition to democracy in Nepal must \n     be peaceful and that violence conducted by any party is \n     unacceptable and risks sending Nepal into a state of anarchy;\n       (6) calls on security forces of Nepal to exercise maximum \n     restraint and to uphold the highest standards of conduct in \n     their response to the protests;\n       (7) urges the immediate release of all political detainees \n     and the restoration of full civilian and political rights, \n     including freedom of association, expression, and assembly;\n       (8) urges the Maoists to lay down their arms and to pursue \n     their goals through participation in a peaceful political \n     process; and\n       (9) calls on the Government of the United States to work \n     closely with other governments, including the governments of \n     India, China, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, and \n     with the United Nations to ensure a common and coherent \n     international approach that helps to bring about an immediate \n     peaceful transition to democracy and to end the violent \n     insurgency in Nepal.\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\n

Res. 453\n\n       Whereas charter schools deliver high-quality education and \n     challenge our students to reach their potential;\n       Whereas charter schools provide thousands of families with \n     diverse and innovative educational options for their \n     children;\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public entity that are responding to the needs of \n     our communities, families, and students and promoting the \n     principles of quality, choice, and innovation;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 40 States and the District of Columbia have passed \n     laws authorizing charter schools;\n       Whereas more than 3,600 charter schools are now operating \n     in 40 States and the District of Columbia, serving more than \n     1,000,000 students;\n       Whereas over the last 12 years, Congress has provided \n     nearly $1,775,000,000 in support to the charter school \n     movement through facilities financing assistance and grants \n     for planning, startup, implementation, and dissemination;\n       Whereas charter schools improve their students' achievement \n     and stimulate improvement in traditional public schools;\n       Whereas charter schools must meet the student achievement \n     accountability requirements under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 in the same manner as \n     traditional public schools, and often set higher and \n     additional individual goals to ensure that they are of high \n     quality and truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas charter schools give parents new freedom to choose \n     their public school, routinely measure parental satisfaction \n     levels, and must prove their ongoing success to parents, \n     policymakers, and their communities;\n       Whereas nearly 56 percent of charter schools report having \n     a waiting list, and the total number of students on all such \n     waiting lists is enough to fill over 1,100 average-sized \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas charter schools nationwide serve a higher \n     percentage of low-income and minority students than the \n     traditional public system;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State Governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas the seventh annual National Charter Schools Week, \n     to be held May 1 through 6, 2006, is an event sponsored by \n     charter schools and grassroots charter school organizations \n     across the United States to recognize the significant \n     impacts, achievements, and innovations of charter schools: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges and commends charter schools \n     and their students, parents, teachers, and administrators \n     across the United States for their ongoing contributions to \n     education and improving and strengthening our public school \n     system;\n       (2) the Senate supports the seventh annual National Charter \n     Schools Week; and\n       (3) it is the sense of the Senate that the people of the \n     United States should conduct appropriate programs, \n     ceremonies, and activities to demonstrate support for charter \n     schools during this week long celebration in communities \n     throughout the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 454\n\n       Whereas Malcom P.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate \npassed a resolution to designate the week of May 1 through May 6, 2006 \nas National Charter Schools Week. I was joined in offering this \nresolution by Senators Lieberman, Gregg, Frist, Carper, Vitter, \nLandrieu, Burr, Coleman, Allard, DeMint, and Martinez.\n  One of my last official acts as U.S. Secretary of Education in 1992 \nwas to write a letter to every school superintendent in America urging \nthem to create charter schools. That year, the Nation's first charter \nschool had opened its doors in St. Paul, Minnesota. I saw charter \nschools as ways to remove burdensome rules, regulations, and overhead \nso that teachers could have more opportunities to use their good \njudgment to help children and so parents could have more choices of \nschools. This was the time when General Motors' newest automobile plant \nwas a start-from-scratch facility making Saturn cars. Al Shanker, the \nlate president of the American Federation of Teachers, said then, ``If \nwe can have a Saturn plant, why not a Saturn school?'' A lot of \neducators agreed.\n  Today, there are over 3,600 charter schools serving more than 1 \nmillion students in 40 states and the District of Columbia. Over half \nof these schools report having waiting lists, and there are enough \nstudents on these waiting lists to fill another 1,100 average-sized \ncharter schools.\n  Charter schools play a unique role in public education by offering \nstudents a variety of options to meet their different learning needs \nand styles. They\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\nvary in specific mission and focus, but not in their commitment to \nexcellence and preparing students to succeed. In return for autonomy \nand freedom from burdensome regulations and policies, they accept \nstrict accountability for academic and fiscal success. If charter \nschools fail to educate their students well and meet the goals of their \ncharters, they are closed.\n  Charter schools are raising student achievement. Research shows that \ncharter school students are more likely to be proficient in reading and \nmath than students in neighboring traditional schools, and that the \ngreatest achievement gains can be seen among African American, \nHispanic, and low-income students. Research also shows that the longer \ncharter schools have been in operation, the more they outdistance \ntraditional schools in student performance.\n  It is worth noting that not all charter schools are high-quality, and \nnot all are outperforming traditional public schools. But charter \nschools whose students don't perform academically will close--as they \nshould. It is also worth noting the impact charter schools are having \non their neighboring traditional public schools. Districts with a large \nnumber of charter schools have reported that they are increasing \ninteraction with parents and creating new education programs, many of \nwhich are similar to those offered by charter schools. These \nimprovements benefit all our students, not just those who choose \ncharter schools.\n  I am pleased that twelve charter schools have opened in Tennessee \nsince passage of the State's charter school law in 2002. Ten of these \ncharter schools are located in Memphis, where they enjoy critical \nsupport from local school officials, dedicated private partners, and \nphilanthropic organizations.\n  Options for Memphis students range from programs for elementary \nstudents that stress mastery of reading, math, and foreign language \nskills to middle schools focused on health sciences and business. High \nschool options include charter schools that emphasize science, liberal \narts, or visual and performing arts.\n  I had an opportunity to visit one of these outstanding charter \nschools, the Memphis Academy of Science and Engineering (MASE), which \nwas the first charter school established in Tennessee. MASE provides an \nacademically challenging program to prepare at-risk students for \ncollege through an intensive math, science, engineering, and technology \ncurriculum in grades 7-9, including the first ninth grade AP Biology \nclass in the state. The school was established as an innovative public/\nprivate initiative aimed not only at training a well-educated workforce \nfor the city's rapidly growing bioscience industry, but also helping \nstudents excel in a technology-based environment, regardless of the \ncareer path they choose.\n  I am impressed by the school's clear record of achievement results. \nBy the end of eighth grade, MASE students--who were failing or at risk \nof failing in their previous schools--more than doubled their pass \nrates on State reading, math and science tests compared to their \nachievement in sixth grade prior to entering MASE. Last year, MASE was \nthe second highest performing school--public or charter--in Memphis, \nand a University of Memphis study found that MASE seventh graders \nscored better on the state math assessment than similar students in \npublic schools.\n  Unfortunately, Tennessee's highly restrictive charter school law does \nnot create the conditions that would enable more students to benefit \nfrom attending schools like MASE. The law received a grade of C in a \nrecent Center for Education Reform study, which found that higher \nstudent achievement and higher-quality, more viable charter schools are \nfound in States with stronger charter school laws.\n  Strong laws grant the power to approve charter schools to more than \none entity, including local school boards, State education agencies, \ncolleges and universities, and non-profit organizations. Strong laws \nalso grant greater freedom and independence to charter schools, \nguarantee full per-pupil funding, and do not restrict the number of \nschools that may open or students who may enroll.\n  States should take the opportunity during National Charter Schools \nWeek to examine their statutes and ensure that they create the \nconditions necessary to allow high-quality charter schools, and thereby \noptions for students, to flourish.\n  Charter schools are also a key element of the education revival \ntaking place in New Orleans, where Hurricane Katrina dealt a \ndevastating blow to a school system already plagued by low achievement \nand corruption. The city has a truly historic opportunity to transform \nits education system into a network of high-performing charter schools \nthat could serve as a model for urban education in the rest of the \nNation.\n  So far, 25 of 117 public schools have reopened in New Orleans. 70 \npercent of these schools are charter schools managed by the Recovery \nSchool District, the Orleans Parish School Board, or the State Board of \nEducation.\n  New Orleans officials are working diligently to open more schools to \nserve students as they return to the city. They have been assisted by a \n$21 million Federal Charter Schools Program grant, which helped reopen \ncharter schools damaged by the hurricanes, create new charter schools, \nand expand existing charter schools to accommodate displaced students. \nI am encouraged that Louisiana continues to receive applications to \nopen charter schools in New Orleans, but more work needs to be done to \nready facilities for approved schools to accommodate the substantial \nstudent enrollment projected for this fall.\n  Charter schools in other parts of the country also leapt into action \nto serve students impacted by Katrina. After the hurricane, the high-\nperforming Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), in partnership with the \nHouston Independent School District and Teach For America, exhibited \nextraordinary leadership by quickly opening a new charter school in \nHouston--New Orleans West College Prep--to serve over 300 students in \ngrades K-8 displaced by Hurricane Katrina.\n  According to KIPP co-founder Mike Feinberg, ``When there's a problem, \nwe at KIPP roll up our sleeves and look for a solution. Together with \nthe [Houston Independent] District and Teach For America, we hope to \nprovide students not only with a safe haven, but also with a rigorous \nacademic environment. Even if they are not at home, these students will \nreceive a top-notch education with caring, committed teachers.'' Mr. \nFeinberg's comments exemplify the attitude that motivates so many in \nthe charter school community--that of doing whatever it takes to get \nthe job done.\n  I expect that we will see charter schools continue to expand across \nthe Nation as word of their success spreads. Four years ago, the \nPresident signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act, which contains \nseveral programs that support charter school development, and provides \nschool districts with the option of converting low-performing schools \ninto charter schools. As we prepare to reauthorize No Child Left \nBehind, we'll take a close look at how these programs are performing to \nensure that the Federal Government is doing everything it can to help \ncreate and sustain viable, high-achieving charter schools.\n  I commend the charter school students, parents, teachers, community \nleaders and others who, working together, are helping transform our \nsystem of public education. I encourage my colleagues to visit a \ncharter school during National Charter Schools Week to witness \nfirsthand the ways in which these innovative schools are making a \ndifference in students' lives and in their communities.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res 454 \nhonoring a true transportation pioneer, Malcom McLean. His use of the \nintermodal shipping container--first used successfully in the United \nStates 50 years ago yesterday--streamlined the shipping process and set \nthe stage for our modem globalized economy through containerization.\n  Before the age of containerization, shipping raw materials and \nconsumer goods was an extremely arduous process; to transfer goods from \na ship to a train, or from a train to a truck, the merchandise first \nneeded to be unloaded, sorted, and reloaded. As a truck driver in 1937, \nMalcom McLean realized that the goods could be shipped more cheaply, \nefficiently, and quickly if they didn't need to be unloaded and re-\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nloaded into different shipping containers on each leg of a trip. He \ninvented a type of container that was durable and versatile enough to \nbe attached to a train, loaded onto a tractor-trailer, and secured to \nthe deck of a ship; the revolutionary idea created efficiencies in the \nprocess by making loading and un-loading at each step of the intermodal \nshipping process obsolete.\n  Mr. President, yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the Ideal X \nsetting sail from Port Newark, in my home State of New Jersey, and \nbound for Houston, TX. This historic trip marked the first successful \nimplementation of Malcom McLean's grand idea: it was the first time a \nship left U.S. loaded with intermodal containers, 58 in total. Putting \nthese containers on ships allowed for great cost savings in shipping--\nas much as 25 percent or more--and the triumphant voyage of the Ideal X \nsignaled that the exciting new method was indeed practical and \nworthwhile.\n  It is nearly impossible to overstate the importance of his \ninnovation. If you enjoy consumer products imported from overseas, or \nfrom distant areas of our own country, you can credit Malcom McLean's \nrevolutionary idea for making them more affordable. If you enjoy fresh \nproduce or baked goods from your local grocery store, thank McLean's \ninnovation for bringing them to market more quickly. Container\nization surely has made the world a smaller place by allowing goods \nfrom all over the world arrive at their destinations more cheaply and \nmore quickly, and our standard of living in America has improved \nmarkedly in the process.\n  Before I was elected to the Senate, I served as commissioner of the \nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1978 until 1982. I had \nthe opportunity to get to know Malcom McLean, a singularly focused man, \nwho was successful in nearly all of his pursuits because of his strong \nwork ethic and unmatched talent for innovation. While Mr. McLean passed \naway in 2001, his legacy lives on through his widow Irena McLean and \nhis family, and through his lasting contributions to industry in New \nJersey, the United States, and the entire world.\n  I encourage he Senate to adopt this resolution and honor a great \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3764-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING AND THANKING TERRANCE W.

Res. 455\n\n       Whereas former Chief of Police Terrance W. Gainer, a native \n     of the State of Illinois, had served the United States \n     Capitol Police with distinction since his appointment on June \n     3, 2002;\n       Whereas Chief Gainer had served in various city, state and \n     federal law enforcement positions throughout his thirty-eight \n     year career; and\n       Whereas Chief Gainer holds Juris Doctor and Master's \n     degrees from DePaul University and a Bachelor's degree from \n     St. Benedict's College, as well as numerous specialized law \n     enforcement and security training accomplishments and honors: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby honors and thanks Terrance \n     W. Gainer and his wife, Irene, and his entire family, for a \n     professional commitment of service to the United States \n     Capitol Police and the United States Congress.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this Senate resolution we just agreed to \nthanks Terrance Gainer, former Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. \nAlthough I don't have a formal statement, I have had an opportunity to \nwork with Chief Gainer very closely over the last several years. \nAlthough many of those interactions were in routine business, what we \nregard as routine business, at every moment he stood ready with the \nCapitol Police for any unexpected event. And those unexpected, tragic \nevents that I was able to work with him on, led me--seeing the way he \naddressed these issues, with dignity, with discipline, with a real \nunderstanding of what was at stake--to have a great deal of respect for \nhim, his approach, his character, his integrity and his \nprofessionalism.\n  It wasn't too long ago that many people were stranded inside of the \nRussell Building parking garage for an alarm that went off. I was able \nto go and talk to Chief Gainer about that, as they were determining \nwhat the etiology of that alarm was, and I got to see the full force of \nthat integrity and that discipline and that level of sophistication.\n  I wish him the best of luck and good fortune as he leaves behind his \ntremendous service here at the Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/27/senate-section/article/S3764-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MAY 1, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
