I thank the Chair, I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, 5 years ago Monday, we witnessed the murder of 3,000 \nAmericans in the largest terrorist attack on American soil in the \nNation's history.\n  September 11 was a day of loss but also a day of lessons. On \nSeptember 11, 2001, the American people learned there exists a group of \nkillers, fueled by a twisted version of Islam, who want to destroy \nAmerica. But we also witnessed how a group of passengers in one \nhijacked plane, United flight 93, banded together, fought back, and \nsaved countless lives in a simple, selfless act of heroism.\n  Today, we continue to fight the same group of killers not on an \nairplane over America but in a country in their own neighborhood, Iraq, \nand elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.\n  It is the same enemy, the same determination, the same goal. But \ntoday we are fighting the radical Islamists on their own turf because \nwe have a President who knows if America doesn't fight back, another \nSeptember 11 is inevitable.\n  Although the central front on the war in terror is Iraq, we have \ntaken the fight to every corner of the globe. We have improved our \nintelligence capabilities. We have programs in place to help watch what \nthe bad guys are doing, gather intelligence and disrupt their plans.\n  We have made progress. We passed the PATRIOT Act, developed effective \nterrorist surveillance programs, created the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, established the Director of National Intelligence, and tore \ndown the wall built by previous administrations which blocked critical \ncommunications between agencies.\n\n  That work has paid off. There has been no attack in the United States \nsince September 11. Afghanistan and Iraq are now free. They have held \nelections. They are taking control of their own security forces.\n  Yet while the threat level remains high, some in this country, and \nregrettably in this Senate, want to let our guard down. Some talk of \ngiving up the fight in Iraq. Let's not talk of ``troop redeployment'' \nand other such euphemisms. If America pulls out of Iraq now, it signals \nto our enemies we have given up.\n  On that day, the United States and the world will embark on a future \nof\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nfear and violence unlike what we have ever seen. It will be a black day \nfor freedom and democracy. It would embolden and encourage every \nreligious extremist and other enemies of the United States.\n  Letting our guard down is not a choice. It is an invitation to \ndisaster. The alternative to naysayers is to continue our efforts. \nAmerica must support the democratic governments in Iraq and elsewhere \nin their efforts to disarm militias and deter regional countries from \nundermining security there. We can't allow a minority of criminal \nextremists to intimidate Iraqi citizens.\n  While some talk of giving up the fight in the central front on the \nwar on terror, others leak sensitive details of legal classified \nintelligence programs to the media to further their political agendas. \nWe have seen our most important intelligence-gathering methods splashed \nacross the front pages of our newspapers for the world, including our \nenemies, to see. Leaks expose our methods of apprehending the enemy and \nerode the confidence of our allies.\n  Over the past year, there has arisen an apparent absence of fear of \npunishment in regard to the arbitrary divulging of highly classified \ninformation. That needs to change. Each of these leaks gravely \nthreatens our national security and makes it easier for our enemies to \nachieve their murderous and destructive plans.\n  The critics of this administration and our efforts to go after the \nenemies fail to understand the nature of our enemies, but they \nunderstand politics. I am afraid politics is what is driving some of \nour friends on the other side.\n  In the Intelligence Committee, the Democrats decided in 2003 they \ncould prove that the administration misled the people of America, \nmisused intelligence, and pressured the intelligence-gathering \nactivities. We had 2 years of discussion and debate and thorough \nreview. We concluded, the Intelligence Committee, as did the Silverman-\nRobb Commission and others that there was no pressure, that there was \nno misuse of intelligence. In fact, the intelligence was bad. But some \ncontinue to hold that view, even though the facts do not support those \nconclusions.\n  This is a long, hard battle. The people are being challenged and \ntested. Many are weary of war. My Democratic colleagues want to play on \nthe weary public, trying to convince them if the United States \nwithdraws from the rest of the world, our enemies will leave us alone. \nThey are tougher on our Secretary of Defense than they are on the \nenemy. They spent a whole lot of time on Wednesday talking not about \nhow to defeat terrorists in Iraq and elsewhere, rather, how to bring \ndown the Secretary of Defense. Thankfully, the President and the \nSecretary know the truth; that is, that our enemy will not stop, and \nany sign of weakness on America's part will be exploited fully.\n  Throwing in the towel on the war on terror is not an option. But the \nDemocrats--some--would have us believe that. Iraq's Ambassador to the \nUnited States said recently:\n\n       Plan B--abandoning the region to the religious fanatics and \n     Baathist terrorists--is nothing but a definition of defeat \n     dressed up to look like a vision for the future.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       A retreat on Iraq would encourage all the enemies of the \n     United States--and they are many--to be bolder and more ready \n     to challenge its interests everywhere. A radicalized, \n     totalitarian, fragmented Iraq, sitting on a lake of oil, \n     would become the center of a new and dangerous bloc \n     threatening the United States and world peace.\n       Not only would abandoning Iraq to its fate now be \n     irresponsible, it would almost certainly lead to \n     disintegration and dictatorship, with a high risk of a wide \n     regional conflict--a catastrophe for not just Iraq but also \n     for the United States and for world peace.\n\n  The Iraqis understand what is at stake. The administration \nunderstands what is at stake. Those on this side of the aisle do, but, \nunfortunately, some in the minority do not. For political reasons, they \nwill not acknowledge the reality.\n  So we may expect to see they will continue to play the war on terror \nas a political game. This is not the first time, for sure. They have \nlong argued for a cut-and-run strategy and have blocked our efforts \ntime and again to fight this war. The minority voiced opposition to the \nNSA surveillance program. They blocked reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct for months, with the minority leader proudly boasting, ``We killed \nthe PATRIOT Act.''\n  Sadly, the political games will continue at least until November. But \nthe war on terror against radical Islam will last for generations. The \nchoices we make today will shape the world we live in, the world our \nchildren live in.\n  Republicans have worked to make America safer. Action by the \nPresident and the Republican Congress, through the use of military \nintelligence and law enforcement resources, has led to the capture of \nmany of al-Qaida's top leaders and degraded the capabilities of a \nterror network.\n  More needs to be done, both here at home and abroad. Accomplishment \nwill take resolve and determination and a long-term commitment, not \nabandoning our efforts at the first sign of hardship.\n  As I said at the beginning, the passengers of United Flight 93 banded \ntogether, fought back, and died to save countless lives in a simple, \nselfless act of determination. It is that kind of determination that \nwill serve us well as we confront the challenges ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Iraqi Ambassador Samir \nSumaidaie be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            What Iraq Needs\n\n                          (By Samir Sumaidaie)\n\n       August 28, 2006.--As the debate on Iraq rages on, more and \n     more American voices call for throwing in the towel and \n     leaving the mess to the Iraqis to sort out.\n       The controversy over the decision by the United States to \n     remove the Saddam Hussein regime should not prevent an honest \n     assessment of the situation in Iraq today. That the post-\n     Hussein period was not well managed is now widely \n     acknowledged. But we are where we are, and there is a future \n     for all our children to secure. Plan B--abandoning the region \n     to religious fanatics and Baathist terrorists--is nothing but \n     a declaration of defeat dressed up to look like a vision for \n     the future.\n       Our enemies' strategy has never changed: creating mayhem \n     and making Iraq ungovernable, thereby driving the Americans \n     and their allies out, and installing a Saddam Hussein look-\n     alike to ``make peace.'' In pursuing this strategy, they have \n     forged many alliances and changed course and tactics many \n     times.\n       Just as they have kept to their strategy and adapted, we \n     should do the same. In this context, staying the course must \n     mean adapting our approach while still standing firm for \n     democracy and for a new vision for the country and the \n     region. If we abandon our effort, our enemies win by default.\n       Those in the new government and leaders of civil society in \n     Iraq are putting their lives on the line every day to advance \n     a democratic society. And it is this that our enemies are \n     most afraid of--not U.S. forces but a real democracy in the \n     Middle East that would showcase human rights, women in \n     politics and the rule of law. And they fear that this worst-\n     case scenario could prove to be contagious.\n       What has made the last three years hugely more difficult \n     and complicated is the fact that we all underestimated the \n     determination of our opponents--and some of our neighbors--to \n     undermine this new project. In the context of a global \n     confrontation, this has pitched our fledgling democracy onto \n     the front line of a monumental struggle. It is these outside \n     forces, allied with Saddamists, other terrorists and regular \n     criminals, that threaten to overwhelm us.\n       A retreat on Iraq would encourage all the enemies of the \n     United States--and they are many--to be bolder and readier to \n     challenge its interests everywhere. A radicalized, \n     totalitarian, fragmented Iraq, sitting on a lake of oil, \n     would become the center of a new and dangerous bloc \n     threatening the United States and world peace.\n       Some argue that the very presence of the foreign forces is \n     a source of tension and that their departure would remove a \n     prime source of violence. This claim is without merit. \n     Consider precisely who is ready to fight to drive foreign \n     forces out: It is only the Saddamists and the religious \n     extremists (al Qaeda and the like). If U.S. forces are in \n     fact withdrawn, these people will consider it a victory and \n     go on fighting even harder to achieve control over the \n     country.\n       The majority of Iraqis may be irritated by the presence of \n     foreign forces, but most realize that a premature withdrawal \n     would create hideous problems for the country. This majority \n     includes Sunnis as well as Shiites and Kurds.\n       The real question is: What to do now in the face of the \n     combined onslaught of insurgents, terrorists, criminal gangs \n     and sectarian militias.\n       A policy for success should include:\n       * Developing, with the Iraqi government, workable measures \n     for reforming the security forces and making available the \n     necessary resources to implement them.\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\n       * Supporting the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-\n     Maliki in its efforts to disarm the militias. What is needed \n     is a detailed, multifaceted approach that encompasses \n     political, economic and public-information considerations as \n     well as conventional force.\n       * Applying maximum pressure on regional powers to stop \n     undermining security in Iraq and start helping to stabilize \n     it.\n       * Mobilizing the Iraqi people to oppose the extremists in \n     their midst.\n       Those who say that Iraqis are at each other's throats and \n     should be left to fight it out are wrong. A minority of \n     sectarian extremists and Saddamists is causing and promoting \n     sectarian violence. These resisters have been successful in \n     intimidating the rest of the population, which abhors them. \n     When they are challenged, as they should be, the great \n     majority of Iraqi men and women will be very supportive.\n       * Taking the initiative from our enemies by acting boldly \n     and aggressively. Our posture should not be defensive. That \n     is a recipe for defeat.\n       * Working out a bipartisan U.S. domestic consensus in favor \n     of winning this war for America, Iraq and democracy. (This \n     item is for American leaders to achieve; the others are \n     collaborative U.S.-Iraqi endeavors.)\n       All this is achievable. Iraqis are resilient. They thirst \n     for normality and a chance to build a future in freedom and \n     dignity. They are fighting and dying for it every day. \n     Witness the numbers enlisting in the security forces despite \n     horrific losses. Witness the support Iraqi women are \n     providing for the political process and the potential of \n     their emancipation.\n       The United States cannot escape responsibility for the \n     current situation in Iraq. Not only would abandoning Iraq to \n     its fate now be irresponsible, it would almost certainly lead \n     to disintegration and dictatorship, with a high risk of a \n     wide regional conflict--a catastrophe for not just Iraq but \n     also for the United States and for world peace and stability \n     for decades to come. On the other hand, winning this war \n     would be one of the best gifts the United States could make \n     to the world and to its own people.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with passage of the Department of Defense \nappropriations yesterday, we took another major step forward making \nAmerica safer and more secure. We hit a few bumps and distractions \nalong the way, but the end result was passing the Defense \nappropriations bill. Under the tremendous leadership of the President \npro tempore, who is occupying the chair, we passed a bill that makes \nAmerica, and continues to make America, safer and more secure. We \nhelped to bring to our troops the cutting-edge technologies and \nresources that they need and will continue to need in fighting the war \nagainst terror.\n  It is important to share with our colleagues and the American people \nthat in these appropriations bills, pending bills that are coming to \nthe Senate, we are addressing a lot of issues that are not the \nprincipal focus of the bill but are very important issues to address, \nissues of concern and focus of the American people. I refer to an \nelement of border security.\n  Most Members, as we traveled around the country and through our \nStates over the last several weeks and during August, heard again and \nagain that the American people expect us to focus on security at our \nperimeter, at our border, and at our ports. We are on the port security \nbill today.\n  In addition, it is important to note, for border security interests, \nover the past 2 years we have made huge progress in funding initiatives \nalong our border, as reflected in the bills, the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill and the bill we passed yesterday, the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill. If we examine the last 2 years, we see how \nmuch progress, indeed, has been made for the border. We have added \n3,736 new Border Patrol agents, for a total of 14,555. We have added in \nthese bills 9,150 new detention beds, for a total of 27,500.\n  We have added, in these bills, 370 miles of border security fencing \nand added 461 miles of vehicle barriers along that Southwest border. We \nhave added $682 million for border tactical infrastructure and \nfacilities construction.\n  As for detention personnel, we have added 1,373 detention personnel, \nfor a total of over 5,500. People ask about Customs and Border \nProtection officers. Indeed, we have added 460 new Customs and Border \nProtection officers for seaport inspections, for a total of 18,321 \nofficers at ports of entry.\n  For the Coast Guard, in these bills, we have added $7.5 billion for \nthe Coast Guard maritime border security, including $4 billion for \nCoast Guard port security and $2.1 billion for deepwater assets.\n  I mention these figures and this data because that is what we have \ndone over the last 2 years in the supplemental bill, the Homeland \nSecurity bill, and the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  In fact, spending on border and immigration enforcement has increased \nfrom less than $4 billion prior to 9/11 to over $16 billion today--a \nfourfold increase. Catch and release has been ended. Apprehensions are \nup along the border by 45 percent. We are acting. We are funding. We \nare controlling the borders. We have a long way to go, but we are \ndelivering on border security.\n  Security and safety are not static states. They are dynamic, which \nmeans we must constantly take steps, which we are doing on the floor to \nbolster them.\n  Earlier this year, I took a trip to the west coast and toured the \nLong Beach Port in southern California. It was amazing. I took an \naerial tour, talked to all of the people there from security to the \npeople handling the containers. Over 13,000--13,000--containers come \nthrough that one port every day. It is the largest port in the country. \nIt is the third largest in the world.\n  It is not far from Los Angeles or LAX where 62 million passengers \npass through annually. To say the least, this part of the country is a \nmajor front on the battle to protect our ports from terrorist attacks.\n  I am delighted we did turn to the port security bill last night. We \nhave much to do over the next several days--with opening statements \nmade last night and over the course of the day.\n  The bill before us now will provide the structure and resources \nnecessary to strengthen our seaport vulnerabilities and better protect \nthe American people from attack that might occur through those ports. \nIt addresses security throughout the international cargo supply chain--\nfrom factory gate in a foreign country to screening in the U.S. port of \nfinal destination.\n  The U.S. maritime system includes more than 300 sea and river ports, \nwith more than 3,700 cargo and passenger terminals. More than 95 \npercent of all U.S. overseas trade, excluding trade with Mexico and \nCanada, arrives by ship. The top 50 ports in the United States account \nfor about 90 percent of all cargo tonnage, and 25 U.S. ports account \nfor 98 percent of all container shipments.\n  Most of the 60,000 U.S. port calls made each year are foreign owned \nand crewed. Less than 3 percent of U.S. overseas trade is carried on \nU.S.-flagged vessels.\n  What all this means is that ports are a significant choke point for \nan enormous amount of economic activity for this country. In and of \nthemselves, they, therefore, represent an attractive target for \nterrorists.\n  Equally significant is that ports clearly facilitate the \ntransportation of something from one place to another. Goods arrive at \nand depart through these ports--by ship, by rail, by truck--so it is \nnot inconceivable that terrorists could use ports as a conduit to \nsmuggle into this country.\n  Just imagine the damage if a terrorist smuggled a dirty bomb in a \ncargo container off a ship calling on a U.S. port. Once unloaded, it \ncould be transferred to a waiting tractor-trailer or train and from \nthere target anywhere in this country.\n  Just imagine if terrorists seized control of a large commercial cargo \nship and used it as a collision weapon for destroying a bridge or \nrefinery on the waterfront.\n  Imagine the damage if terrorists sank a large commercial cargo ship \nin a major shipping channel, thereby blocking all traffic to and from \nthat port.\n  These are not pipedreams. They are legitimate threats. Remember when \nthe USS Cole was attacked by a bomb-laden boat during a refueling stop \nin Yemen? Had that occurred in a U.S. port, not only would the port of \ncalling be shut down but very likely officials would halt the entire \nU.S. maritime transportation system, as they did in the days \nimmediately following 9/11.\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\nStudies suggest that such a disruption in trade would reverberate \nthroughout the country, costing billions of dollars.\n  The 9/11 Commission--if we look back at their recommendations--\nconcluded that ``opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, in \nmaritime and surface transportation'' as in commercial aviation. That \nis why we have elected to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. \nThat is why the bill before us is so very important. It provides the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with the additional authorities and \nvital tools necessary to improve maritime security and to foil plots to \ninjure or destroy our ports, to the detriment of our people and to the \ndetriment of our economy.\n  Effective port security is a critical component of national security. \nAnd the bill before us now is a critical component of effective port \nsecurity.\n  I look forward to a thoughtful and engaging debate over the next \nseveral days and do hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nvery important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9230-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9230-S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SECURITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EVERY PORT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4954, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4954) to improve maritime and cargo security \n     through enhanced layered defenses, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nthought I would describe how we are going to be proceeding today. \nShortly, the President pro tempore, who is the comanager of the bill, \nwill be making his opening statement. It is my understanding he will \nthen move to lay down an amendment offered by Senator DeMint and a \nsubstitute amendment offered by Senator Inouye relating to the WARN \nAct, which is a Commerce Committee bill. We will not be voting on that \namendment today, it is my understanding, under the agreement that has \nbeen previously reached.\n  We are open for business on other amendments for Members who may come \nto the floor or Members who wish to speak on this bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as we all know, Monday marks the fifth \nanniversary of September 11 and the terrorist attacks against this \ncountry. Shortly after those attacks, during the 107th Congress, the \nPresident signed into law the Maritime Transportation Security Act of \n2002, which was developed by our Commerce Committee to enhance our \ncountry's maritime security. Since then, our Commerce Committee has \nworked as hard as possible to pass and implement a number of \ninitiatives which have made our ports and borders more secure.\n  Today we take up the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006. This bill \nmarks the first time three Senate committees have merged their \ncollective expertise and crafted a truly comprehensive approach to port \nsecurity. A bipartisan group of members from the Commerce Committee, \nthe Finance Committee, and the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee have worked together for several months on this bill.\n  As I know the Senate will realize, these three committees each have \ntremendous knowledge about our ports and programs which protect and \nsecure our international supply chain. I believe it is a credit to the \nSenate that each committee agreed to pool their resources, put aside \njurisdictional issues, and reach a consensus on this bill.\n  When enacted, this bill will strengthen our land and sea ports, \nimprove our maritime transportation security strategy, and enhance \ncommunication between the Department of Homeland Security and \ntransportation security stakeholders.\n  It includes a plan to get our trade activities up and running again \nin the event of a transportation security incident. And it creates a \npilot program which will study the feasibility of scanning each of the \ncontainers--100 percent of the containers--entering our ports.\n  Mr. President, I spent considerable time in the last couple of years \nexamining our ports, and particularly the west coast, which is really \nsort of the domain I know best. When I was a boy, the Port of Los \nAngeles was three separate Ports of San Pedro, Long Beach, and Los \nAngeles. The Port of Los Angeles is now an enormous area. Forty percent \nof the seaborne trade of the U.S. comes through the Port of Los \nAngeles, the Port of San Francisco, and of course, the Port of Seattle, \nwhich is the home of our colleague, Senator Murray, but also is sort of \nthe stepping stone into my State of Alaska. It is a dynamic port and \none that has been experimenting to a great extent on how to bring about \ncontainer inspection, container scanning.\n  I personally went through each of the ports to see what was being \ndone. There are still a great many problems. I must say that the people \noperating the ports, including those who are really the working people, \nhave gone out of their way to try to make certain that those ports are \nsafe and secure and that the containers are, in fact, scanned to the \nbest extent possible now. But we want to do this pilot program to see \nif it is possible to tell our people that 100 percent of the containers \ncoming into the country are scanned.\n  This legislation will enhance the collection and analysis of \ninformation about cargo destined for our ports. Those in the shipping \nindustry are our eyes and ears with respect to security, and this bill \naims to increase awareness of the operations at domestic and foreign \nports. Once those in industry share important information about cargo \nin the international supply chain, we must analyze it quickly. This \nlegislation expedites that process and ensures it begins earlier in the \nsupply chain--before containers even reach our shores. This act \nrequires information about cargo be provided and analyzed before the \ncargo is loaded on a vessel in a foreign port and shipped here. That \nwill be a significant change.\n  This bill also expands several initiatives with a proven track record \nof success. There are currently five interagency operations centers up \nand running throughout our country. These centers bring together \nFederal, state, and local security enforcement officials to ensure \ncommunication among them. This act expands this effort to each of the \nmajor seaports, and places the Coast Guard in charge of these centers.\n  This act also builds upon the Department of Homeland Security's past \ncooperation with foreign governments. The Container Security \nInitiative, CSI, contained within this bill enables the department, \nworking in partnership with host government customs services, to \nexamine high-risk containerized cargo at foreign seaports before it is \nloaded on vessels destined for the United States.\n  The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, C-TPAT, a voluntary \npublic-private partnership, is also strengthened in this bill. The \nCommissioner of Customs and Border Protection will now be able to \ncertify that a business's supply chain is secure from the point of \nmanufacture to the product's final U.S. destination. Under this \nlegislation, whether cargo crosses our border at Laredo or arrives on a \nship from Hong Kong, participating companies' supply chains will \nundergo a thorough security check. This will add another layer of \nsecurity to the C-TPAT initiative. Since this is a voluntary system, we \nhave also included provisions which encourage those in industry to go \nabove and beyond the security requirements already in place. These new \nincentives include expedited clearance of cargo.\n  Mr. President, while I was disappointed earlier this year by the \nnegative public reaction to foreign investment in our Nation's port \nterminals, we learned a great deal from hearings held by the Commerce \nCommittee on this matter. As a result of those hearings, this bill \nrequires DHS to conduct\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\nbackground checks on all port personnel. Current law only requires the \nTransportation Security Administration to perform checks on those \nworkers directly tied to transportation at the port, or involved in its \nsecurity. From the Commerce Committee hearings, it was evident that a \nmore stringent requirement was needed, and it is in the bill.\n  The events of September 11, 2001, forever altered the course of our \nNation. Senator Inouye and I traveled to ground zero shortly after the \nattacks. It was a sad and terrible sight. It was also a stark reminder \nthat we must do everything possible to prevent those who wish to harm \nAmericans from carrying out their missions.\n  To prevent future attacks, we must secure our ports, and this bill is \na major step forward in this effort. Senator Inouye, my co-chairman on \nthe Commerce Committee, and I thank Senators Grassley, Baucus, Coleman, \nCollins and Lieberman for their leadership in drafting this bill. I \nwould also like to thank the staff members on each of the committees; \nthey have worked tirelessly on this bill.\n  Each of the committees involved in this bill has jurisdiction over an \narea vital to the safety of our ports. The Commerce Committee oversees \nissues related to the shipping industry, transportation security, and \nthe Coast Guard. The Finance Committee oversees international trade and \ncustoms. And greater security of our ports and borders is central to \nthe Homeland Security Committee's mission. Working together, our three \ncommittees have developed a comprehensive bill which will help shield \nour Nation from future terrorist attacks. It is my hope our colleagues \nwill support this act and move quickly to pass this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following my \nstatement a summary of the bill prepared by Ken Nahigian, who sits next \nto me and is counsel for our Commerce Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Summary of Bill: Port Security Improvement Act of 2006\n\n\n              title I: Security of United States Seaports\n\n     Subtitle A: General Provisions\n       Section 101: Area maritime transportation security plan to \n     include salvage response plan.

Stipulates that DHS must \n     report on the progress of C-TPAT certifications, validations \n     and revalidations in conjunction with the President's annual \n     budget submission.\n     Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Provisions\n       Section 231: Pilot integrated scanning system. Develops a \n     pilot program in three foreign seaports, each with unique \n     features and varying levels of trade volume to test \n     integrated scanning systems using nonintrusive inspection and \n     radiation detection equipment. Requires full-scale pilot \n     implementation within one year after enactment. An evaluation \n     report would be required to be submitted to Congress 120 days \n     after full implementation of the pilot.\n       Section 232: International cooperation and coordination. \n     Allows DHS to provide assistance, equipment and training to \n     facilitate the implementation of supply chain security \n     measures at CSI designated ports. Requires DHS to identify \n     foreign assistance programs to encourage implementation of \n     port security antiterrorism measures at foreign ports, with \n     particular emphasis on foreign ports in the Caribbean Basin. \n     Requires GAO to submit a report on the security of Caribbean \n     ports within 180 days.\n\n\n                       Title III: Administration\n\n       Section 301: Office of Cargo Security Policy. Establishes \n     an office within DHS to coordinate all cargo security policy \n     within the Department, coordinate DHS cargo security policies \n     with policies of other executive agencies, consult with \n     stakeholders, establish standards, and promote best \n     practices.\n       Section 302: Reauthorization of Homeland Security Science \n     and Technology Advisory Committee.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of \nthe Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 prepared by my staff be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006--Summary\n\n       This legislation will provide the structure and the \n     resources needed to better protect the American people from \n     attack through our seaports that are both vulnerable points \n     of entry and vital centers of economic activity. Each year, \n     more than 11 million containers pass through the ports and \n     53,000 foreign-flagged vessels call at U.S. ports. This bill \n     is a comprehensive approach that addresses all major aspects \n     of maritime cargo security. The bill reflects not only \n     bipartisan consultation and support, but coordination among \n     the Senate Homeland Security, Commerce, and Finance \n     Committees.\n\n\n  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Must Establish Strategies and \n                               Standards\n\n       Strategic Plan. The Secretary of Homeland Security must \n     develop a strategic plan to enhance international supply \n     chain security for all modes of transportation by which \n     containers arrive in, depart from or move through seaports of \n     the United States. The Secretary must clarify roles, \n     responsibilities, and authorities of all government agencies \n     at all levels and private sector stakeholders. The plan must \n     provide measurable goals for furthering the security of \n     commercial operations from point of origin to point of \n     destination, build on available resources and consider costs \n     and benefits; and identify response and recovery methods.\n       Container Security Standards. Because container security \n     standards have languished at the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS), the legislation requires the Secretary to \n     establish minimum standards for the movement and storage of \n     containers within 180 days of the enactment of the bill. It \n     can base these regulations on its experience with the cargo \n     security programs that it currently operates. In addition, \n     the Secretary is directed to seek to establish international \n     standards through multilateral agreements or international \n     bodies.\n       Resumption of Operations at Seaports. The Secretary shall \n     develop protocols for the resumption of trade in the event of \n     a security incident or a disruption to trade at seaports. To \n     handle the immediate response to an incident, the Secretary \n     must establish protocols that make clear who is the initial \n     incident commander and the lead agency that will execute and \n     coordinate the response so that there will be no confusion. \n     In reestablishing the flow of trade through U.S. ports, \n     preference shall be given to vessels with a valid security \n     plan that are manned with individuals who have undergone \n     background checks and are operated by validated C-TPAT \n     participants. Preference should be given to cargo that is \n     entering a U.S. port from a CSI port and handled by a \n     validated participant in C-TPAT.\n\n\n                        Cargo Security Programs\n\n       Improved Automated Targeting System. A critical component \n     of the targeting of cargo for inspection is the Automated \n     Targeting System. This computer-based system helps DHS to \n     determine which cargo presents a high security risk. The \n     legislation requires the Secretary to identify and seek the \n     submission of data related to the importation of cargo in \n     order to improve the targeting of high-risk cargo. It also \n     requires the Secretary to establish an independent review of \n     the system.\n       Container Security Initiative (CSI). The bill establishes \n     CSI to identify and examine maritime containers that pose a \n     risk for terrorism at foreign ports in order to keep \n     potential threats far from America's shores. In CSI, U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel work closely \n     with foreign government officials to target and inspect \n     cargo headed to the U.S. at foreign ports. Before the \n     Secretary may designate a foreign port under CSI, the \n     Secretary must conduct a full assessment of the risk of \n     terrorists compromising containers; the capabilities and \n     level of cooperation of the intended host country; and the \n     potential for validation of security practices by the \n     Department.\n       Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). This \n     legislation establishes the C-TPAT program to strengthen and \n     improve the overall security of the international supply \n     chain. This voluntary program encourages participants to take \n     steps to ensure that their supply chains are secure. Based on \n     a participant's efforts in the program, they are placed on \n     one of three tiers. The legislation requires the Secretary to \n     validate the supply chain security practices of each \n     participant and offer benefits to participants based on their \n     levels of certification and validation.\n       C-TPAT Top Tier. The top tier (Tier 3) or GreenLane status \n     for C-TPAT participants provides the highest level of \n     benefits, which may include the following: reduced \n     examinations, priority examinations and searches, and the \n     expedited release of cargo during all threat levels.\n       Uniform Data for Government-Wide Usage. To simplify the \n     filing of documentation needed to import cargo and facilitate \n     the compilation of data, the Secretary of Treasury shall \n     complete the implementation of the International Trade Data \n     System, a single, uniform data system for the electronic \n     collection, dissemination, and sharing of import and export \n     information.\n       Radiation Detection and Radiation Safety. Radiation \n     detection equipment is critical to ensuring that no \n     radiological device leaves a U.S. port. The bill directs the \n     Secretary of DHS to install radiation portal monitors at the \n     22 largest U.S. ports by the end of 2007. This will cover 98 \n     percent of incoming container traffic.\n       100 Percent Scanning Pilot Program. The Secretary shall \n     establish a pilot program at three foreign ports to test the \n     practicality and effectiveness of systems designed to scan \n     100 percent of cargo. The scanning systems must couple non-\n     intrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment.\n       In-Bond Cargo. Cargo that travels in-bond through the U.S. \n     from the ports is a major vulnerability because the final \n     destination of the cargo is not known. The bill requires a \n     report on in-bond cargo that would include whether additional \n     information should be required for in-bond cargo, a plan for \n     tracking in-bond cargo in the to-be-developed ACE system, and \n     an assessment of how to ensure 100 percent reconciliation \n     between the port of arrival and destination.\n\n\n              Resources and Coordination for Port Security\n\n       Port Security Grants and Training. The bill establishes \n     risk-based grants, training, and exercises for port security. \n     The legislation authorizes $400 million in appropriations for \n     port security grants.\n       Office of Cargo Security Policy. This legislation \n     establishes within the Department of Homeland Security an \n     Office of Cargo Security Policy to coordinate department-wide \n     efforts regarding cargo security policies and programs.\n       Interagency Operations Centers. The bill directs the \n     Secretary to establish Interagency Operation Centers for \n     Maritime and Cargo Security at all high-priority ports to \n     enhance information sharing and facilitate day-to-day \n     operational coordination, and incident management and \n     response between agencies. The agencies at the operations \n     centers include the Coast Guard, CBP, the FBI, Department of \n     Defense, state and local law enforcement or port security \n     personnel, and private sector stakeholders, as the Secretary \n     determines is appropriate.\n       Research. Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT). The \n     Secretary must direct RDT efforts in furtherance of \n     maritime and cargo security, encourage the ingenuity of the \n     private sector in developing and testing such technologies, \n     and evaiuate such technologies. The Secretary shall ensure \n     all Department RDT efforts are coordinated to avoid \n     duplicative efforts and share results.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, one of the issues that will undoubtedly \ncome up during the debate on the port security bill has to do with the \nscanning of containers. Some people have asked: Why don't we scan 100 \npercent of the 11 million containers coming into this country? And the \nanswer is simply that it is not practical with the current technology. \nThe bill that is before us authorizes three pilot projects in three \nforeign ports where we would take a look at the feasibility and \npracticality and the implications of 100 percent scanning.\n  There is 100 percent screening. There is a difference between \nscreening a container, which means gathering information on each and \nevery container and doing a sophisticated computer analysis to \ndetermine which are of higher risk, versus scanning each container with \nan x-ray-type machine or some other method or a physical inspection.\n  The problem of trying to scan 100 percent of all containers is best \nsummed up by a letter that we recently received from the Supply Chain \nSecurity Coalition. This is a coalition of some of the largest and most \nknowledgeable stakeholders in the supply chain's system, including the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association.\n  The letter says:\n\n       One hundred percent scanning proposals and amendments \n     advocating such a proposal could potentially actually \n     decrease security by forcing containers to sit for extended \n     periods of time, putting them at greater risk of tampering, \n     and would divert resources away from the current risk \n     assessment approach. In addition--\n\nAnd this is the key point--\n\n     such a mandate has the potential to significantly impede the \n     flow of commerce and damage the U.S. and global economy.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Retail Industry \n     Leaders Association, I am\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\n     writing to urge you to support strong and carefully crafted \n     port security legislation that builds on the current \n     multilayered, risk assessment approach that has effectively \n     protected our nation's seaports over the last several years. \n     I also urge you, in the strongest terms possible, to oppose \n     any legislation that would require all U.S. bound cargo \n     containers to be ``scanned'' for radiation and density, so \n     called 100% scanning legislation. While we strongly support \n     improving the security of our nation's seaports, 100% \n     scanning proposals have the potential to do more harm than \n     good.\n       The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) is the trade \n     association of the largest and fastest growing companies in \n     the retail industry. Its members include retailers, product \n     manufacturers, and service suppliers, which together account \n     for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales. RILA members \n     operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing facilities \n     and distribution centers, have facilities in all 50 states, \n     and provide millions of jobs domestically and worldwide.\n       We understand that key committees in the Senate has come to \n     an agreement on a port security bill that may be taken up as \n     soon as tomorrow, September 8th, 2006, and that the \n     legislation is based on provisions from earlier bills drafted \n     in the Homeland Security & Government Affairs Committee, the \n     Commerce, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the \n     Finance Committee. Each of those bills contain important \n     provisions that will help improve our nation's port security \n     laws by building upon and recognizing the effectiveness of \n     the well-established security measures our government \n     currently has in place. RILA supports legislation that builds \n     upon this proven approach, which is why we worked to help \n     pass port security legislation in the House, H.R. 4954, The \n     SAFE Ports Act. It is our hope that the Senate bill will \n     closely mirror the House legislation, which received \n     overwhelming bipartisan support.\n       However, I also strongly urge you to oppose any legislation \n     that would require that all U.S. bound cargo containers be \n     scanned for radiation and density, so called ``100% \n     scanning'' amendments. Such proposals may at first glance \n     appear to improve security, but in reality, they would impose \n     immense costs on our economy and foreign relations without \n     improving the security of our international trading systems.\n       First, a 100% scanning mandate is unrealistic since the \n     technology does not yet exist to do this efficiently and with \n     a high degree of accuracy. We are not aware of any credible \n     technology to actually analyze the millions of density images \n     that would be taken of outbound cargo containers, meaning \n     such images would have to be reviewed one by one by a port \n     official or Customs officer. Second, this mandate could \n     actually decrease security by forcing containers to sit for \n     extended periods of time, putting them at greater risk of \n     tampering.\n       In addition, forcing all containers to be scanned--\n     including the vast majority of those that pose no risk--would \n     divert scarce security resources away from the successful \n     risk assessment approach currently utilized by the \n     government. This approach uses sophisticated risk-analysis \n     tools to determine which containers pose a risk and ensures \n     those containers are handled appropriately. It is important \n     for Senators to remember that the Department of Homeland \n     Security currently uses a risk-based targeting approach to \n     inspect inbound cargo. All cargo manifests are submitted at \n     least 24 hours prior to loading on a vessel and the Automated \n     Targeting System (ATS) uses complex, rule-based formulas to \n     assign a numerical score and identify at-risk containers. CBP \n     then inspects 100% of all containers deemed high-risk.\n       Finally, a 100% scanning mandate has the potential to \n     significantly impede the flow of commerce and do damage to \n     the economy. According a June 2006 study conducted by the \n     RAND Corporation, 100% scanning would delay the movement \n     cargo containers by 5.5 hours per container. With 11 to 12 \n     million containers entering the U.S. every year, it is \n     obvious that of 100% scanning mandate would bring global \n     commerce and the flow goods to a virtual standstill. This \n     would severely damage the U.S. economy, not only by denying \n     consumers access to thousands of products they need, but also \n     by preventing the delivery of material and other inputs that \n     U.S. manufactures need.\n       Rather than mandating 100% scanning, port security \n     legislation should authorize additional testing and \n     evaluation of scanning technology. Several of the relevant \n     port security bills address this issue by calling for pilot \n     projects and other evaluations to test the effectiveness and \n     operational capability to conduct increased container \n     scanning, including the ``GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security \n     Act'' passed by the Senate Homeland Security Committee and \n     the House SAFE Ports Act. These provisions represent the best \n     way to address this issue and answer important operational \n     and economic questions critical to understanding how to \n     effectively implement container scanning.\n       Retail companies are among the largest and most \n     knowledgeable stakeholders in the supply chain system and \n     administer the most extensive and efficient logistics \n     operations in the world. The industry has worked hand-in-hand \n     with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and \n     specifically with the Coast Guard and Customs and Border \n     Protection to ensure that our customers, employees, and the \n     nation's seaports remain safe and that the nation's economy \n     remains strong. We take a back seat to no industry in our \n     support for strong and carefully crafted port security \n     legislation, and we urge the Senate to move quickly to pass \n     such a bill as soon as possible.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. We look \n     forward to working with you on this critically important \n     issue. Should you have any questions, please contact Paul T. \n     Kelly, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs or Allen \n     Thompson, Vice President for Global Supply Chain Policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sandy Kennedy,\n\n                                                        President.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, what we have tried to do with this bill \nis very carefully balance the need for effective, improved security \nwith the need to ensure that we are not crippling our international \ntrading system. We now have 11 million shipping containers coming into \nthis country each year. This is a number that has grown substantially \nin recent years. We know each one has the potential to be the Trojan \nhorse of the 21st century, to include not consumer goods but perhaps \nterrorists themselves, the makings of a dirty bomb, a chemical, \nbiological, or even nuclear weapon.\n  That is why the legislation that we have authored proposes a strong, \neffective, layered system of security. It focuses on the ports of \norigin. It focuses on each container to make sure that it is \neffectively evaluated, and it has a system for securing the entire \nsupply chain that is called the C-TPAT system.\n  The highest system of C-TPAT would be the GreenLane system, of which \nSenator Murray is the author.\n  At that level, shippers would take steps to completely certify the \nsecurity of their supply chain from the factory where the good is \nmanufactured, all the way to the delivery to the retail store. Each \nstep of the supply chain would be certified as secure. In return, those \nshippers or retailers that reach that highest level, the GreenLane, \nwould be given certain benefits. Their cargo would be expedited. Their \ncargo would be subjected to fewer inspections. Their cargo would be \nreleased more quickly in the event of an attack on our ports.\n  Our proposal addresses the people who work at our ports. It addresses \nthe shipping containers. It addresses the ports themselves and other \nfacilities. It takes the layered approach to security that is \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n  So I hope those of our colleagues who may be tempted to think that \nthe answer to port security is to do an x-ray of each and every \nshipping container will take a closer look at the systems and the \nsecurity that would be provided by our legislation and would consider \nthe points that have been raised by the experts who point out the \ndangers in delaying the transit of shipping containers. It might \nactually decrease security rather than enhance it. And, also, that we \nhave to strike that right balance so we do not significantly impede the \nflow of commerce and damage the U.S. and global economy.\n\n  Just think how many farmers rely on our ports to ship their crops \noverseas. Think of how many factories and stores in our country rely on \njust-in-time inventory. If you are reliant on just-in-time inventory \nand your containers are delayed just 3 days, it can make a big \ndifference to your operations. So we need to make sure that we strike \nthe right balance.\n  I think the bill before us, which has been carefully worked out by \nthree committees, which has been in progress for years, does strike the \nright balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4922\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I call up amendment No. 4922 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4922.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nof the committee for the outstanding work that she and the ranking \nmember, Senator Lieberman, have done in bringing forth this very \nimportant legislation. I believe the work that is done by these two \nMembers of the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, in order to better \nsecure the safety of our citizens, is laudable and important. I \ncongratulate them on this legislation that we are considering today.\n  This amendment would ensure that in addition to our efforts to \nimprove port security, we also address another critical transportation \nmode--rail transportation. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators DeWine, Snowe, and Biden.\n  Again, I want to say I am pleased the Senate has chosen to take up \nthe Port Security Act of 2006 to protect our Nation's ports and \nwaterways. I just listened carefully to the statement by the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the committee, outlining both the threat \nand the way that this legislation will address these very important \naspects of our Nation's security at our ports.\n  I would also like to point out that the bill implements several \nrecommendations from the 9/11 Commission's final report, including \nallocating security grants based on risk and comprehensive cargo \nscreening. Additionally, the bill would establish an office within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to coordinate all cargo security \npolicy, develop a strategy for deployment of radiation detection \ncapabilities in all ports, and establish a process to facilitate the \nmovement of secure cargo from international ports to our ports without \ninterrupting the international supply chain and delaying goods to \nconsumers in the United States.\n  Securing our ports is a crucial part of our efforts to protect \nAmericans at home. The amendment I am offering today would complement \nthe underlying legislation by providing essential funding and \nadditional tools to strengthen our Nation's rail system.\n  Two years ago the Senate passed by unanimous consent the Rail \nSecurity Act of 2004, legislation that was almost identical to the \namendment I am offering today. Unfortunately, that bill died in the \nHouse of Representatives. Last year I reintroduced the legislation \nshortly after the London bombings of July 7 and language that is \nsimilar to the provisions of the Rail Security Act is in a title of the \nTransportation Security Bill that was reported by the Commerce \nCommittee in February. I sincerely hope that we will once again pass \nthis important legislation. Rail security must be made a top priority \nof this Congress.\n  Look at the recent threats of attacks. We were all deeply saddened by \nthe tragic loss of lives caused by the 2004 terrorist attacks in \nMadrid, the 2005 London attacks, and the terrorist attacks on commuter \ntrains in Mumbai this summer. Those incidents are a painful reminder of \nthe cruel nature of our enemies in our global war on terror and what we \nmust do to fight and win against those who wish to eradicate our way of \nlife. On many occasions we have said we cannot play just defense in \nthis war; that, instead, we must take the fight to the enemy. Still, we \nmust do what is possible and prudent to protect Americans at home.\n  The numerous attacks on rail systems abroad demonstrate all too \nvividly the continuing need for this legislation.\n  There is little doubt that we have increased dramatically our \nsecurity capabilities over the past 5 years. However, there is just as \nlittle doubt that we have much more to do. Since the attacks of 9/11, \nonly relatively modest resources have been dedicated to rail security. \nIn fact, I would be very curious if the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee knows the relative amounts of money that we have spent on \nrail security as compared with airport security. I think you will find \nit is minuscule.\n  Our Nation's transit system, Amtrak, and the freight railroads, I am \nsad to say, remain vulnerable to terrorist threats. This lack of \nfunding exists despite the fact that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has identified as potential terrorist targets the freight and \npassenger rail networks which are critical to the Nation's \ntransportation system and national defense.\n  The 9/11 Commission, too, in its report on the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the 9/11 attacks called for improved security \nin all modes of transportation, noting that `` . . . terrorists may \nturn their attention to other modes.''\n  This amendment would authorize a total of almost $1.2 billion for \nrail security. More than half of this funding would be authorized to \ncomplete tunnel safety and security improvements at New York's \nPennsylvania station, which is used by over 500,000 transit, commuter, \nand intercity passengers each workday.\n  I want to repeat that fact. Penn Station in New York City is used by \nover 500,000 transit, commuter, and intercity passengers each workday. \nLook at the amount of money we have spent to try to protect that \nvulnerable target as opposed to literally every major airport in \nAmerica. This funding is all the more urgent given this summer's arrest \nby the FBI of eight suspects tied to al-Qaida who were plotting attacks \non train tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey.\n  The legislation would also establish a grant program authorized at \n$350 million to help increase security by the freight railroads, \nAmtrak, shippers of hazardous materials, and local governments with \nsecurity responsibility for passenger stations not owned by Amtrak. \nFurther, DHS would be required to complete a vulnerability assessment \nof the rail network to terrorist attack and make recommendations to \nCongress for addressing security weaknesses. Importantly, to protect \nthe taxpayers' interests, all Amtrak authorizations would be managed by \nthe Department of Transportation through formal grant agreements.\n  We all know that we face a dedicated, focused, and intelligent foe in \nthe war on terrorism. This enemy will probe to find our weaknesses and \nmove against them. We have seen the vulnerabilities of rail to \nterrorism in other countries and the devastating consequences of such \nan attack. It is essential that we move expeditiously to protect all \nthe modes of transportation from potential attack.\n  I also note that this amendment is cosponsored by Senators DeWine, \nSnowe, and Biden. I thank the Senators for their cosponsorship of this \ncritical measure.\n  I trust the Senate will once again pass this essential legislation. \nWe owe at least that much to the American people as we continue our \nstruggle against an enemy that wants nothing less than to destroy \neverything we stand for and believe in.\n  I would like to mention to the distinguished manager of the bill that \nI don't think this is probably the best away to address this issue. \nObviously, the bill should have stood on its own and been addressed \nseparately with amendments to the bill. But I think there is a \ncompelling case that can be made that, if port security is vital and \nmust be acted on, so must rail security. I do not diminish the \nimportance of this legislation. But, again, I would like to point out \nrailway stations all over America have received very little attention \nand very little funding. Are we going to wait until there is an attack, \nsuch as where we arrested eight subjects this summer who were planning \nattacks on rail connections between New York and New Jersey or are we \ngoing to get ahead of this?\n  I come from a State where very few of our passengers use rail. But I \nthink it is very important to point out that in places in the Northeast \nthis is a primary form of transportation. Just a couple of blocks from \nhere, if you did a rough assessment, you would find at Union Station \nthere are significant vulnerabilities.\n  By the way, I would like to mention that Senator Stevens has played a \nkey role in this effort on this legislation. We have worked together. \nHis leadership has been vital. I know his efforts have been very \nimportant, and I want to express my appreciation.\n  Again, I say to the distinguished managers of the bill, if changes \nneed to be made to this legislation in conference we would certainly \nwelcome improvements. But I hope we can include this as part of this \nlegislation so we can begin making serious efforts to ensure rail \nsafety in America.\n  My thanks to the managers and my thanks to the distinguished chairman\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\nof the Commerce Committee for all of his efforts on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments. I \nmight say on the visit that I made to Los Angeles Harbor, it is very \nclear that rail is essential for the 40 percent of the cargo that comes \ninto the United States. The majority moves out of the Los Angeles \nHarbor by rail, and currently that is very sensitive because there is \nonly one rail coming out of there and there should be multiple rails.\n  Senator McCain has offered S. 1052, which our committee reported in \nNovember of 2005. That bill contained sections of aviation, rail, \ntrucking, and port security.\n  In addition, Senator McCain's bill passed the Senate in 2004. It is \nnot controversial. I will urge the Senate to let us pass it again \nwithout amendment so we can take it to conference, and I do believe it \nwill become law.\n  It is very clear it is as essential as the port security section, and \nI thank him for bringing it to the floor. I intend to support it \ncompletely because I hope we can get back to both the aviation and \ntrucking portions of S. 1052 sometime. I don't think it will be in this \nCongress, however, because it has become too controversial. But we \nintend to take them up again, I believe, early next year whether there \nis change of management or not in terms of the Commerce Committee. I do \nhope we can realize the aviation and trucking areas need to change, as \nfar as security considerations are concerned, in terms of their basic \nlaw. But I am here to urge the Senate very favorably to approve this, \nand I am certainly urging the Senate to adopt the McCain amendment when \nwe start voting on this bill next Tuesday.\n  Is there anyone else who wishes to comment at this time?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4922, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if I may just make one additional comment, \nI ask unanimous consent the amendment be modified with the changes at \nthe desk. They add the Homeland Security Committee as recipient of the \nreporting requirements in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from Arizona \nfor bringing this measure to the Senate floor. As Senator Stevens has \npointed out, it is directly relevant to port security because many of \nthe containers that come into our ports by ship are then deployed \nthroughout the country by rail. So I would argue this is directly \nrelevant to the goal of the legislation before us.\n  This is a Commerce Committee matter that Senator McCain has brought\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\nup, but I did just want to let my colleagues know that it is very \nrelevant to our goal of securing our ports. I strongly support the \namendment and commend the Senator for his initiative.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment before the Senate that's been offered as a complete \nsubstitute to H.R. 4954. This legislation could not be more timely. The \nanniversary of September 11 is imminent, a stark reminder that our \nNation must remain vigilant in the global war on terror.\n  This amendment, the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006, is \ncritically important legislation. It strengthens port security \noperations, both in the United States and abroad so we can prevent \nthreats from reaching our shores in the first place.\n  This legislation improves existing programs for targeting and \ninspecting cargo containers so that a dangerous shipment doesn't enter \nor threaten the Nation. It provides direction for further strengthening \nof these programs as technological advances permit. And, it calls for \ngreater coordination and cooperation among Federal agencies in \ncontingency planning in the event there is a security breach.\n  This legislation represents a thoughtful reevaluation of how best to \nmeet the Nation's security interests at United States seaports. We have \ntaken a look at what has been done since 9/11. This legislation builds \nupon that. Terrorists have proven that they will change their ways to \nexploit perceived weaknesses in our defenses. We need to stay ahead of \nthem. This legislation empowers our personnel in the Department of \nHomeland Security and United States Border and Customs Protection to do \njust that.\n  At the same time, this legislation includes provisions to strengthen \nthe economic security of our Nation. It's important to remember that in \naddition to killing innocent Americans, the 9/11 attacks were intended \nto wreak economic havoc and injury upon our Nation. This legislation \nincludes provisions that realign resources to ensure better efficiency \nin the administration of customs laws within the United States Customs \nand Border Protection. It authorizes the International Trade Data \nSystem, a forward-looking program to better utilize technology in order \nto increase efficiency and facilitate trade. And, it provides for added \nresources to better meet all of our economic and trade security \ninterests that are overseen by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n  In sum, this legislation is the culmination of months of hard and \nthoughtful work. I thank my ranking member on the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye, and my colleagues on the Homeland Security \nCommittee, Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman, with whom I have \nworked so closely to bring this legislation to the floor. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to join me in advancing this essential legislation \nthrough the Senate in a timely manner.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to comment on the tremendous \nefforts of the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, \nSenator Lieberman, and the chairmen and ranking members of the Commerce \nand Finance Committees, Senators Stevens, Inouye, Grassley and Baucus. \nThey along with their committee staffs have worked together for months \nto develop the bill that is before us today.\n  Each of the committees has its own jurisdictional interests in this \nbill. The Homeland Security Committee has jurisdiction over the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with its primary mission of preventing \nterrorist attacks against the United States and reducing \nvulnerabilities to such attacks. Many of the programs in this bill, \nincluding the Automated Targeting System, the Container Security \nInitiative, and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, serve \nthe purpose of reducing vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks and are \noperated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--squarely within the Homeland Security \nCommittee's jurisdiction. Moreover, it was the committee's \njurisdictional authority to study the effectiveness of government \nagency programs that began the evaluation of the DHS' cargo security \ninitiatives that are improved by this bill.\n  The Commerce and Finance Committees also have significant \njurisdictional interests. The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over \nshipping and the Coast Guard. And the Finance Committee has \njurisdiction over the assessment of customs duties and compliance with \ncustoms laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is no \none else who wishes to speak on the bill or the McCain amendment at \nthis time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9240-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a new vision for \nAmerican independence, a mission that is vital for Americans and for \nAmerica's homeland and national security.\n  We Americans have always been freedom seekers. We have been risk \ntakers for liberty, daring to cross oceans and blaze trails across our \ncontinent, and at the same time we are reaching skyward to charter our \nown course into the future. We are always trying to provide a beacon to \nlight the way for others around the world. Now is the time for us to be \nbold and chart our own course once again.\n  In this time of expanding promise and unparalleled danger in the \nworld, we are called to come together with a clear vision and a unity \nof purpose worthy of a great people and a great nation.\n  We declared our independence from colonial masters more than two \ncenturies ago. We declared our independence from fascism, from imperial \ncommunism, and from every other form of totalitarian oppression and \nbrutality in the 20th century. And America belatedly strode forward to \nbecome a more perfect union with justice and opportunity for all.\n  In each of these challenges to our self-determination and our \nfreedom, we not only declared our independence, we also mustered the \nresolve and the resources to achieve it. It is time for America to \ndeclare its independence again.\n  Nearly 5 years ago, on September 11, 2001, we awoke on a bright, \nblue-sky morning to the dark realization that a great evil still stalks \nour world. Out of the shocking smoke and devastation of September 11 \ncame the realization that we are at war--at war with an extraordinarily \nviolent ideology that seeks to pervert a great religion and murder \nthousands of innocent people to satisfy its thirst for power in a new \ncaliphate from Europe to Indonesia.\n  Today, we find ourselves engaged in a global war against vile, \nmaniacal terrorists--a war against many foes--including Hezbollah, al-\nQaida, the Islamic Jihad, and others, but with its primary theaters \nbeing the breeding ground of radicalism and terrorism in the Middle \nEast.\n  My colleagues, in this war we have our differences over the means and \nmethods, tactics and timetables. We do not have the same conviction \nabout the importance of every theater or every engagement. We do not \nall see the same causes and effects, nor do we all give credit or cast \nblame in the same direction.\n  But there comes a time where we have to set aside such differences \nand act not as Republicans or Democrats determined to win an election \nbut as Americans determined to win a war, and in so doing preserve our \nfreedom, our values, and our way of life.\n  Rather than petty political bickering and partisan posturing, let all \nof us stand together--those of us who understand the reality of the \nmortal danger that our irreconcilable, fanatical\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\nenemy and its hateful ideology represent. Let's stand apart from those \nwho would still deny or diminish the magnitude of the danger that we \nface, even as we mourn our thousands dead and foil new plots to kill \nthousands more.\n  Let those of us who want to fight this war to win stand together, and \nlet's stand against those who counsel appeasement at the point of a \ngun, negotiations as missiles rain dawn, and retreat in the face of \nadversity.\n  My colleagues, if that is the new dividing line, I am convinced that \nthe majority in the Senate and in this Congress, and most importantly, \nall Americans, regardless of political persuasion, are capable of \ncoming together behind a new declaration of independence to secure \nAmerica's future.\n  Today, as we combat the powerful forces of terrorism and their state \nsponsors, we and our allies find ourselves continually dependent on and \ncompromised by Middle Eastern and other hostile sources of foreign oil.\n  This war is unlike other great wars. In the past, the financial \nsacrifice of free citizens fueled the engines of industry and military \noutput. But today, many of our gasoline dollars now go to finance the \nwar effort of our enemies, and, if those dollars do not go directly to \nour enemies now, then they go into bank accounts of some friendly but \nfragile states--bank accounts that are the envy and object of radical \nideologues.\n  When a nation like Iran has an advanced program to develop nuclear \nweapons--and when that nation is committed to the destruction of Israel \nand others--when that nation uses oil as blackmail to keep the \ninternational community from confronting its nuclear threat, as the \nleaders of Iran have done, then we know this: Our peace, freedom, and \nnational security depend on making that oil weapon irrelevant.\n  Because we rely so heavily on Middle Eastern oil in our economies, \nour foreign policy options are limited for addressing the terrorism, \ntyranny, and related geopolitical issues. For America to be free and \nindependent--for Americans to remain the masters of our own destiny--we \nmust declare our independence from Middle Eastern and other hostile \nsources of oil. We must commit every effort and resource to the \nachievement of this national purpose.\n  I strongly believe that a comprehensive, enduring, sustained, and \nstrategic plan for independence from Middle Eastern and other hostile \nsources of foreign oil must include five essential elements.\n  They are, first, the strategic use of our global economic power and \ninternational relationships to remove oil-based leverage that hostile \nstates currently enjoy; second, the accelerated exploration and \ndevelopment of American energy supplies, including American oil, \nAmerican natural gas, American clean coal, and American nuclear power; \nthird, the accelerated research, development, and deployment of every \neconomically viable alternative and renewable source of energy; fourth, \na bold new national commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship, \ninvesting in the next generation of leading-edge, creative scientists, \nresearchers, and engineers of advanced technology; and, fifth, an \nunequivocal declaration of our national security commitment to energy \nindependence.\n  Let me highlight some of these key initiatives that I believe are \nneeded in each of those five areas.\n  First, we must use our global economic power and international \nrelationships strategically to undercut the oil-based leverage that \nhostile nations enjoy now and in the future.\n  We all recognize that America's dependence on Middle Eastern and \nother hostile sources of foreign oil leaves America and our allies, \nmainly in Europe and Asia, vulnerable to blackmail from radicals in the \nMiddle East, and even in our own hemisphere, such as the avowed \nMarxist, Hugo Chavez.\n  Meanwhile, China is aggressively making oil alliances with Sudan, \nCuba, Venezuela, and Indonesia to reduce its dependence on Middle \nEastern oil. It is not in the interest of the United States to let \nAfrica and Latin America become dominated by oil trade with China.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I will be introducing \na bill for the establishment of America's Energy Security Initiative.\n  The plan will require the President to establish a permanent energy \nsecurity working group consisting of representatives of the Department \nof State, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of \nDefense, and intelligence agencies. Our allies will be asked to join us \nin developing this plan.\n  We will develop an inventory of all energy reserves worldwide so we \ncan prioritize potential alliances and recognize when strategically \nimportant countries come under the influence of others. And we will \nestablish a strategic plan for identifying and forming energy \nalliances, including bilateral and multilateral arrangements.\n  The second essential element in our comprehensive plan for achieving \nindependence from the Middle East and other hostile sources of foreign \noil is accelerated exploration and development of American energy \nsupplies. We need to adopt a flexible, diverse portfolio of energy \noptions. First and foremost, that must include increased domestic \nenergy production from American oil, more American natural gas, more \nAmerican clean coal, and more American advanced nuclear energy.\n  The bottom line is we need more energy explored, produced, grown, and \nmanufactured in America so that hundreds of billions of energy dollars \nstay here in America and are reinvested in America's economy for \nAmerican jobs, American competitiveness, and American national security \nrather than having to worry about the whims of some dictator in a \nhostile part of the world.\n  Last month, the Senate passed a Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, a \ngood action by the Senate, and a good first step toward reducing \nnatural gas prices at home and making America less dependent on foreign \nsources of energy.\n  This was commonsense, bipartisan legislation that would permit \ndeepwater exploration for oil and natural gas in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico. This bill will free up enough natural gas to heat the homes of \n6 million American families for 15 years. And there is more oil and \nnatural gas even further into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We also need to allow Virginia and other Atlantic coast States to \nmove toward deepwater oil and/or natural gas exploration far off their \ncoasts. According to the Department of Interior, there are roughly 86 \nbillion unexplored barrels of oil and 420 trillion unutilized cubic \nfeet of natural gas under deep water on our Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The fact is, we have the resources in America and the deep water of \nour coasts--and also in shale on our land--to reduce the leverage that \nhostile dictators now enjoy.\n  We also need to explore for oil and natural gas on the North Slope of \nAlaska. Critics will say it will hurt the pristine environment. I have \nbeen up there. It is a flat, barren, treeless plain. In the summer it \nis filled with mosquitos, and in the winter it is like the dark side of \nthe Moon.\n  According to our Department of Energy, the estimated daily oil in \nANWR 1.37 million barrels--would be roughly the equivalent of current \ndaily oil imports from Saudi Arabia--1.52 million barrels. That is a \nlot of oil.\n  When it comes to natural gas, natural gas is a wonderful, clean-\nburning fuel. It is needed for heating our homes, and it is also vital \nfor manufacturing, particularly in plastics, chemicals, and \nfertilizers. We need to make sure that price is reduced at home so \nthose manufacturing jobs stay in America. A lot of the new electric \npowerplants in this country which have been permitted in recent decades \nhave to use natural gas.\n  Using natural gas to generate electricity would be like using bottled \nwater to wash your dishes. It will do the job, but why would you want \nto use a resource as good as that for generating electricity when there \nare alternatives for generating electricity such as coal?\n  In fact, the United States is the Saudi Arabia of the world in coal, \nwith 500 billion tons of coal, which is the equivalent of 750,000 \nbillion barrels of oil. We have 27 percent of the world's supply of \ncoal. This is why we should be using clean coal technology for \nelectricity generation.\n  I recently visited a clean coal facility in King George County, VA, \nwhere the smokestacks run so clean you can't even see the emissions \nfrom it. If you\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\ndidn't hear the whirling, you would think it was closed.\n  We ought to be using innovative technology to gasify or use coal as a \nfuel.\n  Today, I am announcing my strong support for a comprehensive bill \ndirected at advancing domestic coal-to-liquids technologies. Senator \nBunning is the lead sponsor of this Coal-to-Liquids Promotion Act of \n2006, authorizing the Department of Energy to administer loan \nguarantees to the first coal-to-liquids plants and promulgating rules \nto allow BRAC sites and military bases to be considered as sites for \ncommercial coal-to-liquids plants.\n  This bill also expands 20 percent tax credits for coal-to-liquids \nplants and provides a similar provision for expensing these \ninvestments, and it also extends the fuel tax credit for coal-to-\nliquids products from 2009 to the year 2020.\n  Our comprehensive plan for energy independence must also include \nusing American advanced nuclear power for electricity generation. The \nEnergy Policy Act that we passed last year was a significant step in \nrekindling the domestic nuclear industry in the United States which has \nnot seen a new nuclear reactor built in the last 20 years. It provides \nmeaningful incentives and protections and it strengthens security for \nnuclear facilities.\n  Going forward, as far as nuclear power is concerned, the big \nimpediment for nuclear power is the disposal of spent fuel. This is why \nwe need a comprehensive solution such as the Global Nuclear Energy \nPartnership that develops a viable long-term solution to the problem of \nnuclear spent fuel through chemical separation and reprocessing, which \nis much more efficient and much less dangerous than our current methods \nof using nuclear power and dealing with spent fuel.\n  We also need to increase our Nation's refinery capacity. There hasn't \nbeen a new oil refinery built in the United States in almost 30 years. \nIn response, I have introduced a bill called The Bolster Our Energy \nSecurity for Tomorrow Act, which directs the President to designate \nthree BRAC sites for possible refinery development, with at least one \nof these refineries producing biofuels, and to appoint a Federal \nrefinery coordinator to negotiate with willing States to streamline the \npermitting process without changing existing environmental laws.\n  I have also joined with my colleague and friend from North Carolina, \nSenator Burr, in introducing the Affordable and Reliable Gas Act. This \nlegislation will help increase refinery capacity and prevent these \ndramatic spikes in gas prices that we see in this country, usually in \nthe spring, as they shift from a winter blend to a summer blend.\n  We have 104 ``boutique'' fuels that strain our refinery capacity, as \nwell as pipeline capacity. Our measure would reduce the number of \nboutique fuels from 104 to 1 clean-burning diesel fuel and 4 clean-\nburning gasoline fuel blends by the end of 2008. That will help reduce \ngas prices.\n  We also need, as Americans, to conserve. We need to conserve. We need \nto look at ways of being less wasteful, more efficient and smart in the \nuse of our energy, particularly in energy used by large computer \nservers. It is not widely known, but one large computer data center can \nuse as much electricity in 1 day as it takes to power a city the size \nof Petersburg, VA, with its approximately 34,000 residents. That is so \nmuch energy that I want to make sure the Federal Government and \ncompanies that use such mega computer servers and data centers are \ndoing so wisely and efficiently.\n  I have introduced legislation that directs the Environmental \nProtection Agency, through its Energy Star Program, to study the rapid \ngrowth in energy consumption of computer data centers by both the \nFederal Government and the private sector, analyze how effectively the \ncomputer industry is migrating to more energy efficient microchips and \nservers, reduce the costs associated with building and operating large-\nscale data centers, and make recommendations for positive incentives to \nadvance adoption of energy-efficient data centers.\n  The third essential element of our comprehensive plan for achieving \nindependence from Middle Eastern and hostile sources of foreign oil is \nthe accelerated research, development, and deployment of every \neconomically viable alternative source of energy. We need to adopt a \nflexible, diverse portfolio of energy options. Diversity of supply is \nsecurity of supply. We ought to be using alternative fuels, such as \nbiofuels, including soy diesel and ethanol, cellulose fuels, and \ninnovative ideas, whether it's hybrids, hydrogen, solar power, or \nnanotech-enabled lithium ion batteries.\n  We must take further action to create an economic climate that \nencourages investment in new energy and alternative fuels. That is why \nI am reviewing, and I urge my colleagues to consider, legislation that \nallows 100 percent first-year expensing for all plant and equipment \ninvestments to help spur development of domestic and alternative \nsources of energy.\n  Expensing is a high-performance tax reform of vital national \nimportance from an energy-specific perspective. According to economists \nsuch as Gary Robbins with Fiscal Associates, 100 percent expensing \nwould reduce the capital costs in key segments of the energy industry \nby up to approximately 10 percent. It would also be important to \nenvironmentally friendly ``green'' technologies, where first-year \nexpensing for the green technologies can often tip the balance between \nfeasible and unfeasible.\n  In fact, many financial and industry experts believe that expensing \nis the cheapest, most effective and most growth-oriented tax change \nthat the Congress can actually make. It has been estimated that \nreplacing the old-fashioned tax depreciation with immediate first-year \nexpensing would add more than $200 billion to our GDP and upwards of \n750,000 new jobs.\n  The fourth major area in which we must act for energy independence is \none that is often overlooked in the usual discussions of national \nenergy policy. We need a bold new national commitment to innovation and \nentrepreneurship, investing in the next generation of leading-edge \nscientists, researchers, and engineers.\n  We should all want America to be the world capital of innovation. To \nachieve that mission we need scientists, we need engineers, we need \ntechnologists. They will be the ones who will be designing and \ndeveloping the new inventions, the new innovations, and the new \nintellectual property of the future.\n  However, America's education system is not graduating sufficient \ntalent in science, technology, and engineering.\n  Last year, the United States matriculated approximately 70,000 \nengineers compared to 300,000 engineers in India and 500,000 in China.\n  In America, we must do a much better job in motivating, inspiring, \nand incenting our young people to study science, engineering, \ntechnology, and medicine at a much earlier age. That is why I have \nworked, as many have worked, in a bipartisan fashion, with Senators \nLieberman, Ensign, Alexander, Domenici, Bingaman, and others on the \nNational Innovation Act, which implements the recommendations of the \nNational Innovation Initiative Report and provides tangible action \nitems, including scholarships, to increase America's science and \ntechnology talent.\n  I am also a strong supporter of the Protecting America's Competitive \nEdge through Energy Act of 2006, which would boost science and math \neducation programs in the United States by providing early career \nresearch grants that support young, promising scientists and engineers \nat the beginning of their careers.\n  I have led with a good partner, Senator Ron Wyden, on the other side \nof the aisle, on our Nanotech Initiative. Nanotechnology is the next \ntransformative economic development for our country and the world. \nNanotechnology is a very diverse field. It is going to have a positive \nimpact on life and health sciences. It will have a major impact on \nmicroelectronics and materials engineering. Nanotechnology will allow \nus to build wider and stronger materials that will need less energy for \npropulsion. There is a company called NanoChemonics, in southwest \nVirginia, that is teaming up with coal companies to get the impurities \nout of coal, to make it into a fuel, as is Sasol in South Africa. \nNanotechnology will be helpful in environmental cleanups.\n  All together, the Nanotechnology Initiative, the National Innovation\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nAct, and the PACE Energy Act will go a long way toward meeting \nAmerica's rising demand for highly skilled men and women in all fields \nof innovation, and it will strengthen America's security through energy \nindependence.\n  Fifth, and finally, I conclude where we must begin, with a clear, \nunequivocal expression of national commitment, a new Declaration of \nIndependence, if you will, matched with the discipline to keep us on \ntrack, according to an agreed-upon timetable. For those who say we \ncannot come together for such a national purpose, I say you \nunderestimate the character and the resolve of the American people and \nthe power of the American idea.\n  Look at what we have done in the past when confronted with great \nchallenges to our freedom and our way of life. Half a century ago, the \nSoviet Union launched the space satellite Sputnik. Our scientific edge \nin missile technology and the space race was in serious doubt. Our \nnational security was at great risk of falling behind. But America's \ningenuity was dramatically and urgently mobilized by President \nEisenhower, who passed the National Defense Education Act, providing \nmassive investment in science, technology, and engineering.\n  We need that same kind of commitment and leadership to keep America \nthe world capital of innovation now and in the future.\n  September 11 awakened our Nation to a monumental new challenge: \nfighting and winning this global war against hate-filled terrorists. \nThis war on terror, similar to all wars, will require clarity of vision \nand unity of purpose. America's long-term national security depends on \nsecuring our independence from the Middle East and other hostile \nsources of oil. We have the resources to do it, the resources \nunderneath our land and water, and the best resource of all, the \ningenuity of our free, creative minds. Now we just need the willpower \nto use it.\n  Mr. President, 230 years ago our forebears pledged their lives, their \nfortune, and their sacred honor to the cause of independence. We are \nmore fortunate. We need only do what we have already sworn to do--set \naside our differences and act in the public interest. This Congress \nmust adopt a clear ``Declaration of Independence'' from the Middle East \nand other hostile sources of oil, and it must act urgently, decisively, \nand with a unity that rises above partisan differences to make that \nDeclaration of Independence a reality.\n  Let us begin right now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for about 20 or 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9243-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9243-S9246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE PHASE II REPORT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence has released to the public two of the five sections of our \nlong-promised report on how intelligence was used by policymakers in \nthe lead-up to the war in Iraq. This phase II report builds on the \ncommittee's July 2003 phase I report on the intelligence community's \nvery substantial mistakes regarding weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq. Fundamentally, these reports are about accountability. They are \nabout identifying the mistakes that led us to war and making sure those \nmistakes never happen again, so far as we can do so.\n  Let me share some important excerpts from the report which reflect \nboth my own views and the views of all of my Democratic colleagues on \nthe committee.\n  The committee's investigation into prewar intelligence on Iraq has \nrevealed that the Bush administration's case for war in Iraq was \nfundamentally misleading.\n  Prior to the war, administration officials repeatedly characterized \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction programs in more conclusive and \nthreatening terms than were substantiated by the underlying \nintelligence assessments. Analytical assessments of the intelligence \ncommunity that were not in line with the more strident administration \nview on alleged Iraqi links to al-Qaida and the 9/11 plot were ignored \nand were denigrated by senior policymakers. Most disturbingly, the \nadministration, in its zeal to promote public opinion in the United \nStates before toppling Saddam Hussein, pursued a deceptive strategy \nprior to the war of using intelligence reporting that the intelligence \ncommunity warned was uncorroborated, unreliable, and, in critical \ninstances, fabricated.\n  The committee has uncovered information in its investigation which \nshows that the administration ignored warnings prior to the war about \nthe veracity of the intelligence trumpeted publicly to support its case \nthat Iraq was an imminent threat to the security of the United States.\n  Some of the false information used to support the invasion of Iraq \nwas provided by the Iraqi National Congress, the INC, an organization \nwhich our intelligence agencies had cautioned repeatedly was penetrated \nby hostile intelligence services and would use its relationship with \nthe United States to promote its own agenda to overthrow Saddam \nHussein. The committee's investigation concluded that the INC attempted \nto influence U.S. policy on Iraq by providing false information through \nIraqi defectors directed at convincing the United States that Iraq \npossessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorists.\n  The committee also found the July 2002 decision by the National \nSecurity Council directing that the renewed funding of the INC \ncontract--the Iraqi National Congress, the Chalabi operation--be put \nunder Pentagon management was ill advised given the counterintelligence \nconcerns of the CIA and warnings of financial mismanagement from the \nState Department.\n  Repeated prewar statements by administration officials sought to \nconnect Iraq and al-Qaida in ways the underlying intelligence simply \ndid not support.\n  The administration's--this is key--the administration's repeated \nallegations of the past, present, and future relationship between al-\nQaida and Iraq exploited the deep sense of insecurity among Americans \nin the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, leading a large \nmajority of Americans to believe, contrary to the intelligence \nassessments at the time, that Iraq had a role in the 9/11 terrorist \nattacks.\n  The administration sought and succeeded in creating the impression \nthat al-Qaida and Iraq worked in concert and presented a single unified \nthreat to the United States of America. The committee's investigation \nrevealed something completely different.\n  The committee found that there was no credible information that Iraq \nwas complicit or had foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks or any \nother al-Qaida strike anywhere. The committee also found that Iraq did \nnot provide chemical or biological weapons training or any material or \noperational support to al-Qaida prior to the war.\n  Furthermore, no evidence was found of any meeting between al-Qaida \nand the Iraq regime before the war, other than a single meeting that \ntook place years earlier in 1995, in fact, in the Sudan. That meeting \nwas at a fairly low level, and that meeting did not lead to any \noperational cooperation at all. Osama was there, but the Iraqi \nrepresentative was at a low level.\n  Key pieces of evidence used by the administration asserting links \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida were a report of a meeting in Prague between \n9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer and a \nclaim that Iraq provided chemical and biological weapons training to \nal-Qaida in the late 1990s. The committee report demonstrates that the \nprewar statements of the Vice President of the United States that the \nPrague meeting had been ``pretty well confirmed'' and that the 9/11 \nhijacker Mohamed Atta--again the Vice President's words--``in fact'' \nmet with Iraqi intelligence services in 2001 were not substantiated by \nthe intelligence assessment at the time the statements were made by the \nVice President. Likewise, the statement by National Security Adviser \nRice that\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\n``there are a lot of tantalizing meetings'' between Iraq and ``people \nwho were involved in 9/11'' was clearly false based upon what was known \nprior to the war.\n\n  The committee's investigation revealed no postwar information \nindicating that Iraq considered using al-Qaida or any other terrorist \ngroup to attack the United States. The committee investigation \nconcluded that, in fact, Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaida and \nviewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime and to him \npersonally, refusing all requests from al-Qaida to provide material or \nany kind of operational support. Postwar findings indicate that Saddam \nHussein refused all al-Qaida overtures for material or operational \nsupport and, in fact, issued a general order that Iraq should not deal \nwith al-Qaida. In addition, Saddam viewed al-Zarqawi, who was present \nin Baghdad only from May to November of 2002, as an outlaw. Saddam \nregarded Zarqawi as an outlaw and attempted unsuccessfully to locate \nhim and capture him. Again, he failed.\n  During the buildup to war, the intelligence community was placed \nunder pressure to support the administration's position that there was \na link between Iraq and al-Qaida. This is particularly distressing. \nThis pressure took the form of policymakers repetitively tasking \nanalysts to review, to reconsider, to revise their analytical \njudgments, or simply asking the same question again and again.\n  Many participants involved with the preparation of prewar \nintelligence felt at the time that the decision had been made to go to \nwar by the administration early on--in fact, many months before \nCongress was asked to authorize the use of force. The committee \ninvestigation revealed evidence that this prewar pressure to conform to \nadministration policy demands may have led to the co-option of the \nintelligence community.\n  The committee's two-phased investigation has been significantly \nlimited, I must say, by the majority's refusal to examine issues and \ndocuments relative to our inquiry when the issues and documents came \nclose to the White House.\n  While a quarter of the committee's INC report is devoted to a lengthy \nexamination of the CIA's relationship with the INC in the early and \nmid-1990s, the committee majority voted down requests by the minority \nto investigate the flow of intelligence information from the INC that \ncircumvented the intelligence community and went directly to the White \nHouse and to Pentagon policy officials in the lead-up to the war.\n  Finally, the committee's inquiry has been hampered by the decision to \ndeal with five phase II tasks as separate inquiries, which they are \nnot, and complete the report on a piecemeal basis rather than a unified \nwhole. This has been distressing to those of us in the minority.\n  The chairman suspended the committee investigation into the Pentagon \npolicy office--we associate the name Doug Fife with that--over 2 years \nago, rejected any investigation, oversight--whatever you will--into the \nPentagon policy office despite evidence presented in the committee's \nphase I report that the office attempted to shape the CIA's terrorism \nanalysis, and when it failed, prepared an alternative intelligence \nanalysis for policy officials designed to denigrate the CIA's analysis \nfor not embracing a link between Iraq and al-Qaida and the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks. It is my belief that the committee can complete its \nremaining work on phase II of its Iraq inquiry in a manner that is \ncomplete, objective, and expeditious. It should not have taken nearly 3 \nyears to reach the point where we are now.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed as in morning business for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand it is for 10 minutes unless we get unanimous \nconsent for more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 25 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nWest Virginia for the leadership he has shown on this matter and so \nmany other matters--on every matter he has touched on, in fact, on \nintelligence and in his other work in this body.\n  Today the Senate Intelligence Committee is releasing two of five \nparts of phase II of the committee's inquiry into prewar intelligence. \nOne of the two reports released today looks at what we learned after \nthe attack on Iraq about the accuracy of prewar intelligence regarding \nlinks between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Today's report is a \ndevastating indictment of the Bush administration's unrelenting, \nmisleading, and deceptive attempts to convince the American people that \nSaddam Hussein was linked with al-Qaida, the perpetrators of the 9/11 \nattack.\n  The President said Wednesday, just this week, that:\n\n       One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to \n     the war on terror.\n\n  Well, that shouldn't surprise anybody. The President's decision to \nignore intelligence community assessments prior to the Iraq war and to \nmake repeated public statements that gave the misleading impression \nthat Saddam Hussein's regime was connected to the terrorists who \nattacked us on 9/11 cost him any credibility he may have had on this \nissue.\n  President Bush said Saddam and al-Qaida were allies--his words. And \nthat:\n\n       You can't distinguish between al-Qaida and Saddam when you \n     talk about the war on terror.\n\n  The bipartisan report released today directly contradicts that \nlinkage which the President has consistently made in his effort to \nbuild public support for his Iraq policy.\n  The bipartisan committee report finds that the prewar intelligence \nassessments were right when the intelligence community said Saddam and \nal-Qaida were independent actors who were far from being natural \npartners. The report finds that prewar intelligence assessments were \nright when they expressed consistent doubts that a meeting occurred \nbetween 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta and a senior Iraqi intelligence \nofficial in Prague prior to September 11. Our report finds that prewar \nintelligence assessments were right when they said there was no \ncredible reporting on al-Qaida operatives being trained in Iraq. Those \nwere the two principal arguments which were used prior to the war to \nsupport the alleged linkage between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein.\n  The accurate prewar intelligence assessments didn't stop the \nadministration from making many false and misleading statements trying \nto link Saddam Hussein with al-Qaida. In his September 5 presentation \nto the United Nations, Secretary Powell said:\n\n       Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu \n     Musab al-Zarqawi, an associate and collaborator of Osama bin \n     Laden, and his al-Qaida lieutenant.\n\n  After the war, in June of 2004, the President said that al-Zarqawi, \nthe terrorist leader recently killed in Iraq, was the best evidence of \na connection between Iraq and al-Qaida. And to this day--to this day--\nthese statements have not stopped.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the President said in a press conference that \nSaddam Hussein ``had relations with Zarqawi.'' Our Intelligence \nCommittee report demonstrates that statement made 2 weeks ago by the \nPresident was false. The committee report discloses, for the first \ntime, the CIA's October 2005 assessment that Saddam's regime:\n\n       Did not have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind eye \n     towards Zarqawi and his associates.\n\n  The President's statement made just 2 weeks ago is flatout false.\n  The drumbeat of misleading administration statements alleging \nSaddam's links to al-Qaida was unrelenting in the lead-up to the Iraq \nwar which began in March of 2003.\n  On September 25, 2002, the President said:\n\n       Al-Qaida hides. Saddam doesn't, but the danger is that they \n     work in concert. The danger is that al-Qaida becomes an \n     extension of Saddam's madness and his hatred and his capacity \n     to extend weapons of mass destruction around the world.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       You can't distinguish between al-Qaida and Saddam when you \n     talk about the war on terror.\n\n  The next day, in September of 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld said:\n\n       We have what we consider to be credible evidence that al-\n     Qaida's leaders have sought contacts in Iraq who would help \n     them acquire weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\n\n  On October 14, 2002, the President said:\n\n       This is a man--Saddam is a man that we know has had \n     connections with al-Qaida. This is a man who, in my judgment, \n     would like to use al-Qaida as a forward army.\n\n  On January 30, 2003, Vice President Cheney said:\n\n       Saddam's regime aids and protects terrorists, including \n     members of al-Qaida. He could decide secretly to provide \n     weapons of mass destruction to terrorists for use against us. \n     And as the President said on Tuesday it would just take one \n     vial, one canister, one crate to bring a day of horror to our \n     Nation unlike any we have ever known.\n\n  On February 6, 2003, Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz said:\n\n       And, worst of all, his connections with terrorists which go \n     back decades and which started some 10 years ago with al-\n     Qaida are growing every day.\n\n  What the administration and the President and other administration \nofficials did not say was what the intelligence community was saying \nabout this crucial issue because it would have undermined their march \nto war and it would have refuted their main argument for attacking \nIraq: that Iraq was linked to the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.\n  What was the CIA saying? What was the intelligence community saying \nbefore the war? In June of 2002, the CIA said that:\n\n       Our assessment of al-Qaida's ties to Iraq rests on a body \n     of fragmented, conflicting reporting from sources of varying \n     reliability.\n\n  That same report of the CIA said:\n\n       The ties between Saddam and bin Laden appear much like \n     those between rival intelligence services.\n\n  And the Defense Intelligence Agency stated in a July 2002 assessment, \nbeing declassified for this first time in this report:\n\n       Compelling evidence demonstrating direct cooperation \n     between the government of Iraq and al-Qaida has not been \n     established.\n\n  So these two then-classified assessments preceded the President's \nstatements that ``You can't distinguish between Iraq and al-Qaida'' and \nthat, in his view, Saddam would love to use al-Qaida as a ``forward \narmy.''\n  Then the CIA assessed in January 2003, still before the war, that \n``Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden are far from being natural \npartners'' and that Saddam has ``viewed Islamic extremists operating \ninside Iraq as a threat.''\n  The CIA assessed in January of 2003 that Saddam viewed al-Qaida with \n``deep suspicion'' and stated that:\n\n       The relationship between Saddam and bin Laden appears to \n     more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying \n     to exploit each other.\n\n  That 2003 classified report was issued 1 day before the Vice \nPresident stated to the American public that Saddam's regime:\n\n       Aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-\n     Qaida.\n\n  The misleading statements by administration officials didn't stop \nthere. The Intelligence Committee report recounts the story of the \nalleged meeting between Mohamed Atta and the Iraqi intelligence officer \nin Prague. In the fall of 2001, the Czech intelligence service provided \nthe CIA with reporting based on a single source who stated that Atta \nmet with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague in April of 2001.\n  On December 9, 2001, Vice President Cheney was asked about the report \non ``Meet the Press.'' The Vice President said:\n\n       It has been pretty well confirmed that he--\n\n  The 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta--\n\n     did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official with \n     the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April, \n     several months before the attack.\n\n  On March 24, 2002, the Vice President told ``Meet the Press'':\n\n       We discovered, and it has since been public, the allegation \n     that one of the lead hijackers, Mohammed Atta, had, in fact, \n     met with Iraqi intelligence in Prague.\n\n  But the Intelligence Committee report released today cites a June \n2002 CIA paper that said:\n\n       Reporting is contradictory on hijacker Mohammed Atta's \n     alleged trip to Prague and meeting with an Iraqi intelligence \n     officer and we have not verified his travels.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee report released today declassifies, for \nthe first time, a July 2002 Defense Intelligence Agency paper that \nsaid:\n\n       Mohammed Atta reportedly was identified by an asset, not an \n     officer, of a Czech service, only after Atta's picture was \n     widely circulated in the media after the attacks, \n     approximately five months after the alleged meeting occurred.\n\n  And that:\n\n       There is no photographic, immigration, or other documentary \n     evidence indicating that Atta was in the Czech Republic \n     during the time frame of the meeting.\n\n  Two months later, in September 2002, the CIA published its assessment \nthat ``evidence casts doubt'' on the possibility that the meeting had \noccurred and that:\n\n       The CIA and FBI have reviewed the reporting available so \n     far and they are unable to confirm that Atta met al-Ani in \n     Prague.\n\n  None of those assessments stopped the Vice President from continuing \nto suggest that the report of the meeting was evidence that Saddam's \nregime was linked to the 9/11 attack.\n  On September 8, 2002, in a ``Meet the Press'' interview, the Vice \nPresident said that the CIA considered the report of the meeting \ncredible, although again, that same month, the CIA said there was \nevidence that cast doubt on it having occurred.\n  In January 2003, the CIA published an assessment stating that:\n\n       A CIA and FBI review of intelligence and open-source \n     reporting leads us to question the information provided by \n     the Czech service source who claimed that Atta met al-Ani.\n\n  The January 2003 paper stated that the CIA was ``increasingly \nskeptical''--increasingly skeptical--``that Atta traveled to Prague in \n2001 or met with the IIS officer, al-Ani,'' and that ``the most \nreliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility.''\n  But the Vice President was undeterred by the CIA's skepticism. On \nSeptember 14, 2003, 8 months after the CIA said that the most reliable \nreporting cast doubt on the possibility of a meeting between Atta and \nthe Iraqi intelligence officer, Vice President Cheney was still citing \nas this having possibly occurred.\n  On January 14, 2004, a full year after the CIA expressed serious \ndoubts about the meeting and the fact that not a shred of evidence had \nbeen found to support the claim of a meeting, the Vice President told \nthe Rocky Mountain News that the Atta meeting was ``the one that \npossibly tied the two together to 9/11.''\n  Six months later, on June 17, 2004, the Vice President was asked \nwhether Iraq was involved in 9/11. The Vice President said, ``We don't \nknow. . . . We had one report, this was the famous report on the Czech \nintelligence service, and we've never been able to confirm it or knock \nit down. We just don't know.''\n  The Vice President may not have ``known,'' but the intelligence \ncommunity sure as heck did not believe, and did not believe for a long \ntime before the Vice President's statement, that the meeting took \nplace.\n  The intelligence assessments contained in the Intelligence \nCommittee's unclassified report are an indictment of the \nadministration's unrelenting and misleading attempts to link Saddam \nHussein to 9/11. But portions of the report which the intelligence \ncommunity leaders have determined to keep from public view provide some \nof the most damaging evidence of this administration's falsehoods and \ndistortions.\n  Among what remains classified, and therefore covered up, includes \ndeeply disturbing information. Much of the information redacted from \nthe public report does not jeopardize any intelligence source or method \nbut serves effectively to cover up certain highly offensive activities. \nEven the partially released picture is plenty bleak, about the \nadministration's use of falsehoods and distortions to build public \nsupport for the war. But the public is entitled to the full picture. \nUnless this report is further declassified, they won't get it. While \nthe battle is waged to declassify those covered-up portions of the \nreport--unless, of course, those portions truly disclose intelligence \nsources or methods, every Senator should read the classified version of \nthis report. It is available to every Senator, and I urge every Senator \nto read the classified version of this report and reach his own \nconclusion about what I and Senator Rockefeller have said about the \nportions of this report that remain classified and unavailable to the \npublic.\n  In addition to trying to create the impression that Iraq was \nconnected to the 9/11 attackers, the administration also claimed that \nIraq had provided al-\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\nQaida with training in poisons and gases. For instance, in a speech on \nOctober 2002, the President said, ``We've learned that Iraq has trained \nal-Qaida members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases.''\n  In February, 2003, the President said, ``Iraq has also provided al-\nQaida with chemical and biological weapons training.''\n  In March of 2003, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said \nthere was a ``very strong link to training al-Qaida in chemical and \nbiological weapons techniques, we know from a detainee that--the head \nof training for al-Qaida, that they sought help in developing chemical \nand biological weapons because they weren't doing very well on their \nown. They sought it in Iraq. They received the help.''\n  Those statements were based on representations of Ibn al Shaykh al-\nLibi, a detained senior al-Qaida operative. But what the administration \nhid was the fact that the Defense Intelligence Agency did not believe \nal-Libi's statement. In February 2002, a year before the President \nclaimed that Iraq ``provided al-Qaida with chemical and biological \nweapons training,'' the DIA assessed that al-Libi ``is more likely . . \n. intentionally misleading the debriefers.''\n  Nor did the administration disclose a second DIA assessment in \nFebruary of 2002 that said, ``Iraq is unlikely to have provided bin \nLadin any useful CB knowledge or assistance,'' or DIA's April 2000 \nassessment that there was no credible reporting on al-Qaida training \n``anywhere'' in Iraq.\n  The administration's statements also flew in the face of the CIA's \nJanuary 2003 assessment that al-Libi was not in a position to know \nwhether training had taken place.\n  So here is what we have. The President still says that Saddam had a \nrelationship with Zarqawi. The Senate Intelligence Committee found that \nthe intelligence community, in 2005, concluded that ``the regime did \nnot have a relationship with, harbor, or turn a blind eye towards \nZarqawi.''\n  The President said that Saddam and al Qaida were ``allies.'' The \nintelligence community found that intelligence shows that Saddam \nHussein ``viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime,'' and, \nindeed, as postwar intelligence shows, he, Saddam, ``refused all \nrequests from al-Qaida to provide material or operational support.''\n\n  The Vice President called the claim that lead hijacker Mohammed Atta \nmet with the Iraqi intelligence officer ``credible'' and ``pretty much \nconfirmed,'' but the Intelligence Committee report finds that the \nintelligence shows ``no such meeting occurred.''\n  The President said that Iraq provided training in poisons and gases \nto al-Qaida, but the Intelligence Committee finds that postwar \nintelligence supports prewar assessments that there was no credible \nreporting on al-Qaida training ``anywhere'' in Iraq and that the \nterrorist who made the claim of training was ``likely intentionally \nmisleading his debriefers'' when he said that Iraq had provided poisons \nand gases training.\n  But the administration's efforts to create the false impression that \nIraq and al-Qaida were linked didn't stop with just statements. One of \nthe most significant disclosures of the Intelligence Committee report \nis the account of the administration's successful efforts to obtain the \nsupport of CIA Director George Tenet to help them make that false case. \nThe events were of major significance. They go to the heart of the \nadministration's case for war on the eve of a congressional vote on \nwhether to authorize that war. Here is what happened.\n  On October 7, 2002, in a speech in Cincinnati, the President \nrepresented that linkage existed between Saddam and terrorist groups. \nHe said that ``Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a \nbiological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or an individual \nterrorist.''\n  But on that very day, October 7, 2002, in a letter to Intelligence \nCommittee Chairman Bob Graham, the CIA declassified at the request of \nthe committee the CIA assessment that it would be an ``extreme step'' \nfor Saddam Hussein to assist Islamic terrorists in conducting a \nweapons-of-mass-destruction attack against the United States and that \nthe likelihood of Saddam Hussein using weapons of mass destruction if \nhe did not feel threatened by an attack was ``low.''\n  When made public, the CIA assessment would have undercut the \nPresident's case. Something had to be done. So on October 8, 2002, the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, issued a statement that \n``there is no inconsistency between our view of Saddam's growing threat \nand the view expressed by the President in his speech.''\n  The Tenet statement was aimed at damage control and it undercut the \nCIA's own crucial assessment at a critical moment. The New York Times \nquoted Tenet prominently in a major story on October 9.\n  We called Tenet before the Intelligence Committee a month and a half \nago, on July 26, 2006. In his testimony, quoted in the Intelligence \nCommittee's report, Mr. Tenet admitted that perhaps there was an \ninconsistency between the President's statement and the CIA's \nassessment. Mr. Tenet said he issued his statement denying the \ninconsistency after policymakers expressed concern about the CIA's \nassessment, as expressed in the declassified October 7 letter. Again, \nthat letter saying that it would be an extreme step for Saddam to \nassist Islamic terrorists in conducting a weapons-of-mass destruction \nattack.\n  I ask for an additional 3 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Tenet admitted to the intelligence subcommittee that the \npolicymakers wanted him to ``say something about not being inconsistent \nwith what the President had said.'' Tenet complied.\n  Tenet acknowledged to the committee, in his July 26, 2006, testimony, \nthat issuing the statement was ``the wrong thing to do.''\n  It was much more than that. It was a shocking abdication of a CIA \nDirector's duty not to act as a shill for any administration or its \npolicies. Director Tenet issued that statement at the behest of the \nadministration on the eve of the Congress's debate on the resolution \nauthorizing the use of force in Iraq. The use of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence by the administration to contradict his own \nagency's assessment in order to support a policy goal of the \nadministration is reprehensible, and it seriously damaged the \ncredibility of the CIA.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for its indulgence and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at noon today, the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee released a report that proved evidence of two things: first, \nthe Bush administration's case for war in Iraq was fundamentally \nmisleading and deceptive and not supported by the underlying \nintelligence; second, the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence \nCommittee continues to put the political interests of the Bush White \nHouse ahead of the security of the American people.\n  According to today's report, the Bush administration desperately \nsought to prove a link between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden in \norder to shore up public assertions being made by the President, the \nVice President, the Secretary of Defense, and other senior \nadministration officials. But from this report which was made public \ntoday, at noon, we know these assertions directly contradicted the best \nassessments of our intelligence experts. In\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nshort, the facts were not there to show any connection between Osama \nbin Laden and Saddam Hussein.\n  It is clear: The administration knew or should have known it was \nmisleading America in its effort to make the case for a war in Iraq.\n  Just as significant, today's report shows America what you get with a \nRepublican-led Congress. What do you get? You get the White House \nrefusing to declassify information. And you find that in this report. \nYou find that the White House refuses to declassify information that \nwould embarrass them 2 months before a midterm election. And you get a \nRepublican-led committee that is perfectly willing to bow down to the \nWhite House and keep the American people in the dark about its mistakes \nand its distortions.\n  Nearly 4 years since the war started in Iraq, 2\\1/2\\ years after the \nRepublican chairman of the Intelligence Committee was pressured into \nstarting this investigation, and nearly a year after Democrats sent the \nSenate into closed session to discuss the Republicans' stonewalling, 60 \npercent of the Intelligence Committee's investigation still is \nunfinished, and questions as to how and why the administration \nexaggerated and cherry-picked intelligence to sell its case for war \nremain unanswered.\n  These are critically, crucially important questions for our troops \nand our security. Authorizing the use of force and placing our citizens \nin harm's way is the most significant vote a Member of Congress can \nmake, and it is essential we understand how this administration skewed \nthat decision in the runup to the war in Iraq so we can take the steps \nnecessary to ensure these abuses are never repeated. That is why you \nhave to complete the work of the Intelligence Committee.\n  With 140,000 American troops serving bravely in the middle of a civil \nwar in Iraq, bin Laden still at large, and a growing threat posed by \nNorth Korea and Iran, it is long past time this rubberstamping \nRepublican Congress stood up to the Bush administration and did its \njob, did its job of being a separate and equal branch of Government.\n  The problem during the 6 years of President Bush's administration is \nthat the Constitution has not been what it should be, not the checks \nand balances, not three separate, equal branches of Government. It is \nno mystery why there have been no vetoes--because the President has \ngotten everything he has wanted, with the exception of stem cell. Other \nthan that, the Republican Congress has given him everything he has \nwanted.\n  We have had no congressional oversight. We have had committees not \ndoing their work, as indicated by the Intelligence Committee today.\n  I do extend my congratulations to the entire committee. They do very \nvaluable work for this country in dealing with the most sensitive \nissues America has to deal with; that is, intelligence operations of \nthis country. I am glad we have gotten 40 percent of the work that has \nbeen so long overdue. I look forward, in the weeks ahead, to getting \nthe remaining 60 percent. I doubt it will happen before the elections, \nbut it should.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9247-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9247-S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Specialist Stephen P. Downing II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nfather, son, uncle, and brother from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who \nwas lost in the line of duty as a member of America's Armed Forces. I \nask the Senate to pause today in memory of SPC Stephen P. Downing II of \nBurkesville, KY. He was 30 years old.\n  On October 28, 2004, Specialist Downing and his squad were on patrol \nsecuring one of the busiest intersections in Ramadi, Iraq. As a key \nroute for vital U.S. convoys, this crossroads had become a focal point \nof terrorist attacks. The threat to vulnerable U.S. vehicles meant \nsoldiers like Stephen Downing were needed to stand guard against would-\nbe bombers.\n  As his squad waited to be relieved at noon, Stephen, whose duty was \nsimply to drive the armored humvee, volunteered to give his gunner a \nbreak from the intense heat. He climbed out of the relative safety of \nthe driver's seat to man the .50 caliber machinegun mounted on top of \nthe roof. Then, just a few minutes before his squad was to be replaced, \nhe was fatally wounded by a lone sniper's bullet.\n  For his actions as a soldier, Specialist Downing earned numerous \nmedals and awards, including the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple \nHeart.\n  Stephen Downing was a man of action, with a keen sense of right and \nwrong. He was more comfortable working on an engine or being outdoors \nthan sitting inside. He was quick-witted, with a knack for pulling \npractical jokes. This quality endeared him to his family, friends, and \nfellow soldiers.\n  Stephen loved his family. As SPC Robert Gonzales, who served with \nStephen Downing in both Korea and Iraq, recalls--using Stephen's \nnickname with the unit--\n\n       Stevey D. was very proud of his kids. He always talked \n     about how proud they made him. . . . I can't remember how \n     many times he showed me a picture of his son and his daughter \n     swimming in a pool, wearing floaties. He kept it with him all \n     the time.\n\n  Stephen's fatherly tenderness extended beyond his daughter, Taylor, \nand his son, Stephen, to include his niece, Chelsea. As Stephen's \nsister, Danica, says:\n\n       Stephen was like a father to my daughter . . . and Chelsea \n     always looked up to Stephen.\n\n  When Stephen himself was a child, his appetite for adventure could \nnot be satisfied. His sister recalls that her brother loved to go \ndiving, swimming, skiing--if it was to be done outside, Stephen was \neager to pursue the challenge.\n  When he was not taking things apart, he was putting them back \ntogether. Stephen loved modifying his BMX bikes, even if his \nmodifications did not always turn out to be an improvement.\n  According to his stepfather, Jim Maynard, Stephen seemed blessed with \na constant smile on his face.\n  And nothing could make Stephen smile more than pulling a prank on his \nsister. As the older sibling by almost 2 years, Danica was a constant \npresence for her brother growing up, helping him if older bullies tried \nto pick on him. But this didn't stop Stephen from having a good-natured \nlaugh at her expense.\n  One morning, Stephen rushed out to catch the schoolbus and told the \ndriver to go ahead because his sister was not going to school that day. \nAbout 3 miles down the road, the bus driver and everyone else on the \nbus learned the truth when Stephen's mother flagged down the schoolbus \nand Danica jumped on.\n  Another time, Danica was babysitting for a neighbor, and she and a \ngirlfriend decided to take the baby for an evening stroll. Along their \npath they passed an abandoned old farm house, an infamously spooky \nlocal attraction.\n  As you might have guessed, Mr. President, what better way to scare \nyour sister than to hide in the weeds by a house such as this and at \nthe right time, jump out yelling. As Danica recounts, ``Stephen scared \n[us] half to death . . . we both were so scared, we just took off \nscreaming. It took us a minute to realize neither of us had brought the \nstroller.''\n  Stephen enlisted in the Army in 1992. He joined the National Guard in \n1994, and left the service in 2000. In 2002, however, Stephen felt \ncompelled to reenlist in the Army. He was sent to Korea, where he was \nstationed with the Second Infantry Division.\n  After a year-long stint, his unit was ordered to prepare for \ndeployment to Iraq. Given the choice between staying with the unit or \nbeing transferred to Fort Carson, CO, Stephen elected to go to war with \nthe men he had come to know and depend on.\n  Shortly before Stephen deployed to Iraq with the 2nd I.D., he \nreturned home for 2 weeks to be with his family. During that time, his \nmother, Stella Maynard, fixed all of Stephen's favorite foods, \nincluding her famous cherry delight cake. Each family member let \nStephen know how proud they were of\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nhim, while also quietly airing their greatest fears.\n  Stephen told his daughter, who pleaded with him not to go, that he \nwas needed in Iraq. Putting her on his knee, Stephen told her that he \nwas going to Iraq to help the children there--to keep them safe, so \nthat they could have a chance at a better life.\n  Danica also pulled her brother aside and told him to be careful. ``I \ntold him to keep his head down,'' she says. ``Not to be a hero, not to \ndo more than what he had to do to get by.'' Stephen understood his \nsister's motivations, but as his actions would demonstrate, and as his \nfellow soldiers would later recall, Stephen did anything but the bare \nminimum.\n  SP Phillip Pilcher, who was on patrol with Stephen that fateful day, \nrecalls ``Stephen was one of the hardest working guys over there; he \nwould work two to three hours later than everyone else just to make \nsure that everything was where it needed to be.''\n  Specialist Gonzales, who credits Stephen with being instrumental in \nmaking him a better soldier, strikes a similar chord. ``Stephen was the \nheart and soul of our squad and our regiment,'' he says. ``Even though \nhe didn't have the stripes on his arm, he was still a great leader.''\n  Many of the friends Stephen made over his 30 years came to say \ngoodbye when he was laid to rest. BG Dan Bolger, who helped command the \nSecond Infantry Division in Korea and asked to be the survivor-\nassistance officer for Stephen's family, was astounded by what he saw \nthat day: For a 22-mile stretch along the path of the funeral \nprocession, people, some holding signs, others flags, stood in silent \ntribute to their fallen hero.\n  A few months before his death, Stephen wrote a letter to his mother, \nto be sent in the event he did not return. He wrote, ``Different people \nwill remember me for different reasons, but I would hope that everyone \nwould think that I was over here for them.''\n  The devotion to honor and sacrifice expressed in those words tells us \nhow Specialist Downing was able to touch so many people, and why so \nmany people paid their final respects to his memory. As his mother \nrecalls, ``Stephen didn't have friends--he had family.''\n  I thank Stephen's mother, Stella Maynard, and his niece, Chelsea \nDowning, who have traveled to our Nation's capital to--meet with me \ntoday, for sharing Stephen's story. His children, Taylor and Stephen, \nhis sister, Danica, his step-father, Jim Maynard, and other beloved \nfamily members are in our thoughts today as well.\n  We can never repay Specialist Downing's family for their loss. But we \ncan, and we must, honor the sacrifice of their beloved father, son, \nuncle and brother, and recognize that without his courage and the \ncourage of the men and women of our Armed Forces, America could not \nlead the world in the defense of freedom.\n  Mr. President, Stephen's mother, Stella, put it just right, and we \nare all blessed to have had SP Stephen Downing in our family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9248-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the recent \nsuccesses of the Missile Defense Agency. Last Friday, a week ago from \ntoday, the Missile Defense Agency conducted a test of the ground-based \nmidcourse system and scored an intercept. This exercise was designed to \nevaluate the performance of several elements of the ballistic missile \ndefense system, and it appears that all elements worked remarkably \nwell. Although it was not a primary objective for the data collection \nflight test, an intercept of the target warhead was achieved.\n  The test marked the first time an operational interceptor was \nlaunched from Vandenberg Air Force Base while the target flew from \nAlaska. It was conducted by crews who were manning operational fire \ncontrol systems in Colorado Springs. It also marked the first use of \nthe early warning radar at Beale Air Force Base in California.\n  I congratulate the head of the Missile Defense Agency, General \nObering, and especially all the dedicated men and women of the MDA who \nhelped make this test a success.\n  General Obering stated that the test is about as close as we can come \nto an end-to-end test of our long-range missile defense system. This \nsuccess only builds upon a long record of missile defense intercepts \nand, more importantly, it is the fourth intercept in the last 90 days \nthat used hit-to-kill technology.\n  In June, we launched a sea-based AEGIS interceptor that was \nsuccessful in intercepting a separating warhead. In July, we launched a \nland-based terminal-phase interceptor, Terminal High Altitude Air \nDefense--or the THAAD--interceptor, successfully intercepting the \ntarget. Very recently, we had a successful Patriot-3 intercept that was \nconducted by the U.S. Army in collaboration with the Missile Defense \nAgency.\n  There have been many naysayers and doubters on missile defense, but I \nam proud to have supported the Missile Defense Agency over the past \nseveral years as it has grappled in an intensive effort to track down \nand eliminate or minimize risks that have contributed to setbacks in \nthe past. There is an emphasis on quality that is paying off, as \nwitnessed by our most recent tests. We learn from our mistakes, and we \nnow see the fruit of the combined efforts of a wide range of dedicated \nmilitary, civilian, and contractor personnel.\n  Testing will continue. We will encounter difficulties, but the \nprogram will move forward. We are succeeding in building an integrated \nand layered ballistic missile defense system. Our defenses will \ncontinue to improve, and our citizens will be increasingly protected \nand grateful.\n  While I am pleased that we have a limited missile defense capability, \nI believe our missile defense system needs to be challenged even \nfurther. We need more testing so that we can better understand the task \nat hand and discover the errors that must be corrected. I am confident \nthat the Missile Defense Agency is on the right path. I look forward to \nsupporting the Agency testing plan in the future. I do not expect \nperfection. In fact, I expect some failures. But in the context of \nseveral missile defense intercept tests per year, one or two failures \nonly means that we are pushing to find out the real capabilities of the \nsystem.\n  We all know hit-to-kill technology works. We now need to further \ndevelop the midcourse system and introduce greater capability to that \nsystem. I look forward to assisting the Missile Defense Agency in its \nfuture programs so our Nation can rest assured that we are protected \nfrom rogue nations that wish to do us harm.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Predator, which comes in armed and unarmed modes and has \nadvanced sensors and cameras, is one of the most important systems we \nhave to monitor terrorist activity in hostile environments. The \nPredator also is a critical intelligence gathering platform in fighting \ninsurgents in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan. According to Defense \nNews, the Predator was central to the detection and killing of Abu \nMusab al-Zarqawi in Iraq this past June.\n  I have been pleased to fight for putting more Predators in the hands \nof our Special Operations Command ever since U.S. Special Operations \nCommand Deputy Commander Eric Olson responded to my question about \nwhether he had all the tools he needs to win the war on terror in an \nApril 6, 2006, hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee's \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. Admiral Olson said his \ncommand did not have enough Predators, and was not slated to have \nadequate numbers of Predators for several years. This is unacceptable, \nand I expressed my concern to Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin \nin an April 27, 2006, letter urging committee action on this \nshortcoming.\n  I was equally pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee \nadopted my amendment calling for full funding of the Predators for the \nSpecial Operations Command during mark-up of the fiscal year 2007 \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Unfortunately, defense appropriators cut back funding for Predators \nin its mark-up of the fiscal year 2007 Defense appropriations bill. My \namendment restores full funding for a second squad of Predators for our \nSpecial Operations Forces' war-fighters and intelligence collectors by \n2010. Giving our military and our intelligence personnel the best \ntools, as quickly as possible, to win the war on terror is something we \nmust do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9249-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMBATING GUN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have long supported law enforcement's \nefforts to combat gun trafficking. Earlier this summer, 11 people were \ncharged with purchasing firearms in gun shops in Virginia and illegally \ndumping them on the streets of New York City between 2004 and 2005. \nThese arrests bring attention to the need to vigorously enforce our gun \nlaws in order to stem the flow of guns to the black market.\n  These individuals have been charged with making straw purchases of \nhandguns at various gun shops in Norfolk and Portsmouth, VA, and \ntransporting them to New York City, where they were allegedly sold on \nthe streets at a significant markup. Straw purchases are transactions \nthat violate Federal law in which one individual submits to the \nrequired Federal background check for a gun that is clearly intended \nfor use by someone else. Such purchasers play a crucial role in the \nillegal trafficking of guns by purchasing with the intention of \nreselling them to prohibited buyers. The alleged conspiracy, which took \nplace from September 2004 through June 2005, was first uncovered in \n2004 when New York City police officers began making undercover \npurchases of firearms from this organization on the streets. The guns \nwere traced back to gun shops in Virginia where the original straw \npurchases are said to have taken place. More than 50 guns were \ninvolved.\n  Gun trafficking has also been a problem in my home State of Michigan. \nAccording to an Americans for Gun Safety analysis of ATF trace data \nfrom 1996--1999, over 40 percent of the guns traced to crimes committed \nin Michigan in 1998 and 1999 originated in other States, a much higher \nrate than the national average. The largest number of out of State \nsuppliers of guns to Michigan during that period were in Ohio, \nKentucky, Georgia, and Alabama.\n  These statistics demonstrate the length to which criminals are \nwilling to go to circumvent our gun laws. This kind of activity can be \nstopped by vigorously enforcing our gun laws, providing law enforcement \nwith stronger tools to crack down on gun trafficking, on corrupt gun \ndealers and other armed criminals, and by passing sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n  I commend the hard work of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives and other Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers. Vigorous law enforcement is an integral part of reducing gun \nviolence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9249-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORIAM OF CONGRESSMAN BOB MATHIAS\n\n  Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of \nCongressman Robert ``Bob'' Mathias Olympian, Congressman, and San \nJoaquin Valley son. Congressman Bob Mathias passed away on September 2, \n2006.\n  Bob Mathias was born in Tulare, CA, on November 17, 1930. Mr. Mathias \nattended and graduated from Tulare Union High School in 1948. In 1953, \nhe graduated with his bachelor of arts degree from Stanford University, \nand in 1954 he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, where he rose to the \nrank of second lieutenant. In 1966, he was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives for the 18th Congressional District that also included \nhis hometown of Tulare, and continued his service until 1974.\n  By all accounts such impressive accomplishments would be considered \naspects of a fruitful life. However, Mr. Mathias was also a gifted \nathlete. Mr. Mathias' athletic career was laden with accomplishments, \nincluding consecutive gold medals in the Olympic decathlons, four \nnational Amateur Athletic Union--AAU--championships, and three world \nrecords in the decathlon. Seventeen-year-old Bob Mathias first competed \nin the 1948 London Summer Olympics, only months after picking up the \nsport. He became the youngest Olympic gold medalist, winning the \ndecathlon. His meteoritic rise in 1948 led to his depiction on the \ncover of LIFE magazine and the Sullivan Award for Athlete of the Year \nfrom the AAU. At the 1952 Helsinki games, Mr. Mathias again won the \ngold medal in the decathlon, and continued to make history as the first \nperson to ever win consecutive Olympic decathlons. That same year Bob \nMathias was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year \nrecognition of his feats on the track and on the football field. Mr. \nMathias was also a member of the 1952 Stanford football team, playing \nan integral part of that team that went on to the 1952 Rose Bowl.\n  His athleticism and accomplishments earned him a place in the U.S. \nOlympic Hall of Fame, as well as the National Track and Field Hall of \nFame. He also went on to guide younger generations of athletes as the \nDirector of the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, the \nNational Fitness Foundation, and the American Kids Sports Association.\n  Throughout his life, Congressman Mathias remained a humble man, true \nto his roots, dedicated to his family and his country, unfazed by fame. \nAs a young child, Mr. Mathias battled anemia and other illnesses. His \nperseverance in athletics and academics despite these problems no doubt \nprepared him for his work later in life. After his athletic career and \nservice in the Marine Corps, Bob Mathias served as a goodwill \nambassador for youth programs on behalf of the U.S. Department of \nState. His service to his country continued in his dedication to the \nconstituents of the 18th Congressional District.\n  Congressman Mathias is survived by his wife Gwen; his 4 daughters, \nRomel, Megan, Marissa, and Alyse; his son Reiner; his 10 grandchildren; \nhis sister Patricia; and his two brothers, Jim and Eugene. I extend my \ndeepest sympathies to his family.\n  Congressman Mathias will be missed by his family, his friends, his \nfans and all those whose lives he touched. May his kindness, humility \nand hard work remain an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9249-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9249-S9250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FASD AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, tomorrow is the ninth day of the ninth \nmonth, a day designated as International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum \nAwareness Day. I rise today to state\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\nthat it is imperative that we continue to spread the word that no \namount of alcohol is safe to consume during the 9 months of pregnancy. \nBy continuing to raise awareness, we can hopefully minimize the harm \nthat drinking during pregnancy causes our most vulnerable population--\nour children.\n  In February of 1999, a small group of parents, raising children \nafflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, set out to change the \nworld. That small group started a support group which quickly became a \nworldwide grassroots movement to observe September 9 as International \nFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day. This year, for the \neighth consecutive year, events are occurring in cities and towns not \njust across the country but around the world.\n  In my State of Alaska, I am proud that events are occurring in \nJuneau, Anchorage, and Fairbanks. Citizens from my State are raising \nawareness about the dangers of drinking during pregnancy though a \nvariety of events, such as passing out brochures with preventative \nmessages to physicians' offices, delivering cocktail napkins to area \nbars with a message stamped on them that reminds pregnant women to not \ndrink, and conducting high school assemblies which teach students about \nthe dangers of alcohol on the developing fetus.\n  As we all know, FASD is 100 percent preventable, yet it remains a \nleading cause of nonhereditary mental retardation in the United States. \nMany children affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy have \nirreversible conditions--including severe brain damage--that cause \npermanent, lifelong disability.\n  Every year in America, an estimated 1 in every 100 babies is born \nwith FASD--that is 40,000 infants. FASD affects more children than Down \nsyndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida and muscular dystrophy combined.\n  In Alaska, we sadly continue to have the highest rate of FASD in the \nNation. Approximately 163 Alaskan babies are born each year affected by \nmaternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Among our Native communities, \nthe rate of FASD can be 15 times higher than non-Native areas in the \nState.\n  Despite these troubling figures, FASD is still widely under \ndiagnosed, misdiagnosed, or not diagnosed at all. Diagnosis is critical \nbecause many persons with FASD can overcome learning and behavioral \nproblems and succeed but only with appropriate health, social, and \neducational resources.\n  The cost of FASD is high--more than $3 billion each year in direct \nhealth care costs. The indirect financial and social costs are also \ngreat--including the cost of specialized health care, education, job \ntraining, and general support services.\n  That is why prevention is so imperative. Prevention of FASD is seven \ntimes more cost effective than treating the disorder. But more \nimportantly, abstaining from alcohol during pregnancy will save a \nfamily a lifetime of heartache and will prevent the greatest loss of \nall that of human potential.\n  Senator Tim Johnson and I have introduced the Advancing FASD \nResearch, Prevention, and Services Act. Our bill will develop targeted \nState and community-based outreach programs and will improve current \nsupport services for families who are living with FASD. It will also \nimprove coordination among Federal agencies involved in FASD treatment \nand research by establishing stronger communication with these \nprograms. Lastly, it will strengthen educational outreach efforts to \ndoctors, teachers, judges, and others whose work puts them in contact \nwith people with FASD. I ask my colleagues to support the Advancing \nFASD, Research, Prevention and Services Act.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, on Fetal Alcohol Awareness Day, let us pause \nto remember the innocent babies inflicted with this disorder and then \nlet us imagine the potential that these babies could have attained but \nfor the damage done by alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9250-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9250-S9251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRESS MUST STRENGTHEN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as a conferee to the fiscal year 2007 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, I urge my fellow conferees to \nretain the Senate's strong whistleblower protections for federal \nemployees. The Senate bill includes an amendment I offered with Senator \nCollins that mirrors our bipartisan measure, S. 494, the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act. S. 494 and the amendment have \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. In the House, Representatives \nTom Davis and Henry Waxman, the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Government Reform Committee, and Representative Todd Platts, the \nsponsor of companion legislation to S. 494, have asked Representative \nDuncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to \ninclude strong whistleblower protections in the final defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The Senate action was a significant step forward for Federal \nwhistleblowers and the American taxpayer. Congress must assert its \noriginal intent of the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, which \nprotects Federal employees who disclose any waste, fraud, and abuse. \nCongress encourages such disclosures, which save lives and taxpayer \ndollars, and has repeatedly said that the courts should not erect \nbarriers to disclosures which limit the flow of information from \nFederal employees who may have knowledge of government wrongdoing.\n  We have all heard of the brave men and women who have come forward at \ngreat personal risk to report cases of waste and threats to public \nsafety. Examples include: Mr. Richard Foster, Medicare's chief actuary, \nwho disclosed to Congress that the actual cost of the Medicare reform \nbill was $156 billion more than what the Bush administration told us. \nHe was prohibited by his supervisors from alerting Congress to this \nhuge discrepancy prior to the bill's enactment and was threatened with \nfiring if he did so; U.S. Border Patrol Agents Mark Hall and Bob \nLindemann, who disclosed security lapses along our northern border, \nincluding a lack of staff, equipment, and detention facilities. As a \nresult, their supervisors proposed 90-day suspensions and demotions for \n1 year; and Mr. Donald Van Winkle, an air-monitoring technician at the \nBluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky, who revealed serious operational \nfailures with monitors used to detect leaks of chemical warfare agents. \nAs a result of this disclosure, Mr. Van Winkle lost his security \nclearance, thus denying him the ability to continue his job. \nUnfortunately, current law does not provide any independent review for \nthis type of retaliation.\n  This spring, the Supreme Court ruled that the first amendment does \nnot protect public sector employees, including Federal workers, from \nretaliation when disclosing government wrongdoing as a part of their \nofficial duties. Instead, the Court held that protection is left to \nState and Federal whistleblower laws. Unfortunately, Federal \nwhistleblower protections have been watered-down by repeated decisions \nby the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals which ignore clear \ncongressional intent that disclosures are protected without restriction \nto time, place, form, motive, or context, including disclosures made \nduring the ordinary course of an employee's job.\n  As a result of various court decisions, honest employees have been \ndenied protection from retaliatory practices. In fact, only one federal \nwhistleblower has won on the merits of their claim before the Federal \nCircuit in the past 12 years. This egregious lack of employee \nprotection has a serious chilling effect on good faith whistleblowing. \nAlthough President Bush issued a memo in 2001 requiring Federal \nemployees to disclose waste, fraud, and abuse, the decisions of the \nSupreme Court and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals have eroded \nprotections for disclosures and placed Federal workers in a no-win \nsituation. Congress must take action now to restore the protections \ngranted by the WPA.\n  My amendment will: clarify congressional intent that Federal \nemployees are protected for any disclosure of waste, fraud, or abuse--\nincluding those made as part of an employee's job duties; provide an \nindependent determination as to whether the loss or denial of a \nsecurity clearance is retaliation against a whistleblower; and suspend \nthe Federal Circuit's sole jurisdiction over Federal employee \nwhistleblower cases for 5 years.\n  Congress has the responsibility to guarantee strong and meaningful \nprotections for Federal whistleblowers.\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\nFederal employees must know they will not face retaliation when \ndisclosing information that protects our national security, safeguards \nthe health of our children, or saves taxpayer dollars.\n  If Congress is serious about eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, and \nensuring that the government for the people and by the people actually \nis working in the best interests of the people, then we must protect \nthose who wish to disclose illegal or unethical activities. \nWhistleblowers should not be restrained because they fear retaliation \nfor doing what is right.\n  Again, I thank my Senate colleagues for supporting this important \nmeasure, and I urge our House counterparts to join with us in \nstrengthening whistleblower protections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9251-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HONORING POLICE CHIEF GARY MARTIN\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to retired Lake \nCounty Sheriff's Department police chief Gary Martin for his decades of \ndedicated service to the people of northwest Indiana and his \nextraordinary kindness toward the families of fallen Hoosier police \nofficers. It is with a heavy heart and a deep sense of gratitude that I \nhonor the life of Chief Martin, who was killed on August 22 on Indiana \n63 when he was struck by an automobile while participating in a charity \nbike ride to benefit the families of fellow officers who have died in \nthe line of duty. Gary's dedication to the families of our State kept \nhim involved in public service up until his death, doing his part to \ncomfort and support Hoosiers as they confront the loss of a loved one. \nI know that he will be greatly missed.\n  Gary was a good and decent man who dedicated his life to serving \nothers. From his work with the sheriff's department to his involvement \nin the community, his career and retirement were filled with acts of \nconscientious service on behalf of friends, family members, and \nHoosiers across Indiana. The contributions he made touched countless \nlives, and he will be sorely missed.\n  Gary was a 25-year veteran of the Gary Police Department, where he \nattained the rank of assistant chief. He was appointed chief of the \nLake County Sheriff's Department in 2002. And for the past three \ndecades, Gary taught criminal justice at Indiana University Northwest. \nHe devoted all of his energy to protecting and serving his community \nand to caring for his colleagues and their families in their time of \nneed. He is survived by his wife Olga and two children, Greg and \nJennifer.\n  Like all of his colleagues in law enforcement, Chief Martin made \ndaily sacrifices to ensure the safety of our streets, our \nneighborhoods, and our families. In an increasingly dangerous world, we \ndepend on our brave men and women like Gary to protect us from violence \nand other threats to our communities.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, he was also involved in numerous other public \nsafety projects, including working to create a pilot program with Gary \nschools that sought to assure parents that their children would get to \nschool, attend school, and return home safely. Lake County sheriff \nRogelio ``Roy'' Domiguez recalled Martin's leadership and warmth, \nsaying ``Gary was a friend and a mentor to everyone in law enforcement \nand our entire community.

Mr. President, I today pay tribute to Indiana State Police \nLieutenant Gary Dudley for his decades of dedicated service to the \npeople of Indiana and his extraordinary kindness toward the families of \nfallen Hoosier police officers. It is with a heavy heart and a deep \nsense of gratitude that I honor the life of Lieutenant Dudley, who was \nkilled on August 22 when he was struck by an automobile while \nparticipating in a charity bike ride to benefit the families of his \nfellow officers who have died in the line of duty. Gary's dedication to \nthe families of our State kept him involved in public service up until \nhis death, doing his part to comfort and support Hoosiers as they \nconfront the loss of a loved one. I know he will be greatly missed.\n  Gary was a good and decent man who dedicated his life to serving \nothers. From his work at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy to his \ninvolvement in the community, his career was filled with acts of \nconscientious service on behalf of friends, family members, and \nHoosiers across Indiana. The contributions he made touched countless \nlives.\n  Lieutenant Dudley started his State police career as a trooper in \n1979 and was promoted to sergeant in 1991, when he transferred to the \ntraining division. He was appointed commander of the Indiana State \nPolice Recruit Academy in 1993. He devoted all of his energy to \nprotecting and serving his community and to caring for his colleagues \nand their families in their time of need. He is survived by his wife \nCarolyn, his father Orsel Dudley, and a brother, Danny Dudley.\n  Like all of his colleagues in law enforcement, Lieutenant Dudley made \ndaily sacrifices to ensure the safety of our streets, our \nneighborhoods, and our families. In an increasingly dangerous world, we \ndepend on brave men like Gary to protect us from violence and other \nthreats to our communities.\n  A lifelong Hoosier, he used his passion for cycling to help families \nof police officers who died in the line of duty. The COPS charity ride, \nwhich he started, was in its third year. Longtime friend Sergeant Dave \nBursten recalled Dudley's selfless commitment to friends and strangers \nalike, saying ``Gary was very unique, beyond the proverbial `give you \nthe shirt off his back.' He'd give you his pants, he'd give you his \nshoes, he'd give you his next to last dollar if you genuinely needed \nit. He was always there to help people.'' It is a rare man who can make \nsuch an impact on so many people over the course of one life. Hoosiers \nwill miss Gary as a friend, a community leader, and a tireless public \nservant.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Gary Dudley in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to the State of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9251-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9251-S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THIS 45TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate The \nHospitality and Information Service, THIS, of Washington, DC, on its \n45th anniversary. Since 1961 THIS volunteers have welcomed diplomats \nand their families to Washington, providing friendship, assistance and \nan understanding of Washington and the United States.\n  THIS is a nonprofit organization that was established in 1961 at the \nsuggestion of Angie Biddle, then Chief of Protocol, to help the \nhundreds of newly arrived diplomats and their families adjust to \nWashington. In 1961 there were 101 Embassies with 1,200 diplomatic \nfamilies. Today embassies total more than 170 with 4,000 diplomats and \nfamilies in Washington. THIS' 400 volunteers provide a variety of \nservices and programs to help diplomats and their families learn about \nWashington through English and seven foreign language conversation \ngroups and a book club. Programs include forums for discussion of \nissues that are world-wide in scope, such as health, human rights and \neducation. They also conduct programs on government affairs, performing \narts, architecture and American history.\n  THIS plays an important role in welcoming foreign diplomats to \nWashington and has made a difference in the lives of diplomats from \nmany countries. As just a few have said:\n  ``I would like to thank THIS for the wonderful work that you do and \nfor your warm and friendly attention.'' Miriam Barak--Israel\n  ``I express both my pleasure and my gratitude to the THIS \norganization as a whole. THIS is a wonderful vehicle by which the best \nof America is portrayed. Such an organization can only be an \ninfluential force for good.'' Ann Robinson--Great Britain\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\n  ``THIS is a fantastic organization. It makes me feel very welcomed \nand comfortable . . . THIS has given me better understanding of the \nU.S. life and society and also given me some new good American \nfriends.'' Ingela Beiming--Sweden\n  ``THIS is a window that opens Washington for us and lets us \nexperience and know it. It opens opportunities to meet different \npeople.'' Marilia Bulhoes--Brazil\n  Congratulations to THIS and its volunteers on 45 years of service to \nthe diplomatic community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9252-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS OF NORTHEAST INDIANA\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nremarkable achievement of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeast \nIndiana, which was named ``National 2006 Agency of the Year'' by Big \nBrothers Big Sisters of America this summer.\n  This honor was achieved through the hard work and persistence of the \nentire staff, board of directors, Bigs, Littles, donors and other \nstakeholders. Headquartered in Fort Wayne, IN, the agency was \nestablished in August 1972 and continues to assist young adolescents \nwho lack guidance and support by creating positive and enduring \nrelationships between youth and adults and by supporting those \nrelationships with appropriate screening, training and supervision. \nPresently, more than 1,100 area youth participate in Big Brothers Big \nSisters programs in 10 Indiana counties and 2 Michigan counties.\n  Several factors contributed to the agency receiving this year's \naward. During the past 5 years, it has grown exponentially in many \nareas, from expanding the region it helps to increasing the length of \nthe matches it provides, which grew by almost 120 percent between 2001 \nand 2005. The number of participating adult volunteers has increased by \n90 percent since 2003, and the time taken to enroll those volunteers \nhas been decreased by 60 days over the course of last 2 years, allowing \nmore Bigs to be matched with more Littles, thereby fulfilling the Big \nBrothers Big Sisters mission of helping children to reach their \npotential through professionally supported one-to-one relationships \nwith measurable impact.\n  In addition to being recognized as the National 2006 Agency of the \nYear, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana was also a finalist \nin the categories of Board of the Year and Chief Executive Officer of \nthe Year--the only agency to achieve this distinction. It should also \nbe noted that all of these nominations were in the ``Large'' category, \nyet the Fort Wayne agency was considered mid-sized only a few years \nago. Since that time, the organization's growth in programs and quality \nhave bolstered it to the top among BBBS agencies in large metropolitan \nmarkets.\n  I have supported Federal funding for agency programs like the Amachi \nprogram, which pairs faith-based mentors in one-to-one matches with \nchildren of incarcerated parents, as well as its Lunch Buddies program, \nwhich pairs elementary school students with caring adult mentors for \nweekly lunch visits at the children's schools.\n  Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeast Indiana makes a visible impact \nin the lives of Hoosier youths, and it is deserving of the recognition \nthat it has received. I offer my sincere congratulations today and look \nforward to continuing to support to this exemplary organization in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9252-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9252-S9253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Brandon, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n  H.R. 503.

A bill to provide the Department of Justice the necessary \nauthority to apprehend, prosecute, and convict individuals committing \nanimal enterprise terror; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today along with Senator Inhofe, I am \npleased to introduce the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. This \nlegislation is crucial to respond to the expanded scope of terrorist \nactivity that has threatened to impede important medical research and \nscientific innovation.\n  The legislation we introduce today would: clarify that it is a crime \nto damage or interfere with an ``animal enterprise''--which includes \nlegitimate companies and non-profit organizations that use animals for \neducation, research or testing; expand Federal law to also make it \nillegal to harm or cause property loss to anyone connected with an \nanimal enterprise;\n  Criminalize threats, harassment, and other illegal activity that uses \ninterstate commerce to intentionally cause fear of death or injury to \nanyone connected with an animal enterprise;\n  Establish graded penalties of up to 20 years depending on the \nfinancial damage or level of bodily injury caused by such illegal \nconduct, and up to life imprisonment if death results; establish that a \nconvicted animal enterprise terrorist can also be ordered as \nrestitution to pay the animal enterprise's cost of repeating \nexperiments and other losses resulting from the criminal conduct; and \nclarify that all legitimate protest activities protected by the First \nAmendment are exempted out from any prosecution under the bill.\n  The need for this bill is obvious.\n  On June 30 of this year, extremist activists, acting in the name of \nanimal rights, attempted to firebomb a Los Angeles home thought to \nbelong to a prominent UCLA primate researcher.\n  The home actually belonged to a 70-year-old woman, and thankfully, \nthe device did not ignite. But the desired impact was nonetheless \nachieved.\n  Just weeks later, a colleague of the targeted researcher announced \nthat he will discontinue his important research at UCLA. He had two \nwords for the terrorists who orchestrated the failed bombing: ``You \nwin.''\n  While I recognize that reasonable people might disagree about animal \nresearch, and believe in the right to legitimate protest, it is \noutrageous that violent acts, threats and extortion have ended a \nlegitimate medical research career.\n  Unfortunately, similar incidents have occurred throughout the State \nof California for several years, including the two bombs placed at the \nEmeryville offices of Chiron Corporation, a pharmaceutical company in \nthe Bay area, that employs 4400 employees as our Nation's 2nd largest \nmanufacturer of flu vaccines.\n  Agents believe the second bomb was timed to go off as first-\nresponders arrived.\n  Yet extremist organizations, such as the Animal Liberation Front, \ndefend these actions around the country as morally justifiable, and \nshamelessly take credit for these heinous acts.\n  Their tactics have evolved in the face of our current laws, and \nconsequently, the scope of their terror is widening.\n  In recent years, animal rights extremists have expanded their \ncampaigns to include secondary and tertiary targets, such that \nbusinesses and associates who maintain even highly-attenuated \nrelationships with animal research facilities have found themselves the \ntargets of terror and harassment.\n  These targets include banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers, \ncustomers, construction services, food services, Internet service \nproviders, telecom companies, and even janitorial services.\n  No matter how remote the relationship, anyone who does business with \nan organization engaged in animal research is at risk.\n  But these indirect attacks are outside the scope of our current laws, \nand threaten to slow the progress of one of our Nation's largest and \nmost valuable industries.\n  We must recognize that scientific research is not only a legitimate \ncareer, but also an invaluable facet of medical advancement, conducted \nby respectable professionals deserving of our support.\n  The deplorable actions of these terrorists threaten to impede \nimportant medical progress toward lifesaving cures and medical \ninnovation.\n  They threaten to dishearten noble researchers, and to discourage \npromising young scientists and graduate students from ever entering \nthese important fields of research.\n  It is in light of these dangerous threats that Senator Inhofe and I \ntoday introduce the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.\n  This legislation addresses the changing tactics of these terrorists, \nand provides law enforcement officials with the tools necessary to \nprotect our Nation's researchers more effectively.\n  This new legislation will expressly outlaw the targeting of secondary \nand tertiary targets, by including within the scope of prosecution \nterrorists who act against any ``person or entity having a connection \nto, relationship with, or transactions with an animal enterprise.''\n  This is an important step toward combating the modern tactics of \nanimal rights extremists and eco-terrorists, and toward protecting \nvital business relationships that foster and support the research \nindustry.\n  At the same time, however, this legislation confronts these terrorist \nthreats in manner that gives due protections under the First Amendment.\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\n  I fully recognize that peaceful picketing and public demonstrations \nagainst animal testing should be recognized as part of our valuable and \nsacred right to free expression.\n  For this reason, all conduct protected by the First Amendment is \nexpressly excluded from the scope of this legislation. This law \neffectively protects the actions of the law-abiding protestor while \ncarefully distinguishing the criminal activity of extremists.\n  The bill is also mindful and respectful of State efforts to address \nthese problems. For this reason, the bill makes clear that it does not \npreempt State or local laws that address such conduct.\n  We are keenly aware of our responsibility to protect legitimate \nbusinesses and educational institutions from the damaging effects of \nthis new breed of domestic terrorism. It is with this goal in mind that \nwe introduce this bill today.\n  Biomedical research is a multi-billion dollar industry, but more \nimportantly, it is a lifesaving industry. With the passage of this \nlegislation, we can help to ensure both the productivity of this \nimportant field, and the protection of our scientists and their \nassociates.\n  I would like to express my thanks to Senator Inhofe for his hard work \nand support on this important issue. I would also like to thank Senator \nHatch for his early initiative and continued support for this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9255-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9255-S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 562--PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND WAITSTILL SHARP \n  AND MARTHA SHARP FOR THEIR RECOGNITION BY THE YAD VASHEM HOLOCAUST \n   MARTYRS' AND HEROES' REMEMBRANCE AUTHORITY AS RIGHTEOUS AMONG THE \n     NATIONS FOR THEIR HEROIC EFFORTS TO SAVE JEWS DURING HOLOCAUST\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 562\n\n       Whereas on June 13, 2006, the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' \n     and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, an organization \n     dedicated to preserving the memory of Holocaust victims, \n     honored the Reverend Waitstill Sharp, and his wife, Martha \n     Sharp, posthumously as ``Righteous Among the Nations'' for \n     risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust;\n       Whereas the Sharps had to leave their 2-year-old daughter \n     and 6-year-old son in the care of family and congregants in \n     Wellesley, Massachusetts to answer a call from leaders of the \n     American Unitarian Association to go to Czechoslovakia in \n     February 1939 to provide humanitarian assistance for the tens \n     of thousands of refugees crowding into Prague;\n       Whereas Martha Sharp was a social worker trained at the \n     Jane Addams Hull House, a community service organization in \n     Chicago, Illinois, and the Reverend Waitstill Sharp was a \n     Harvard-educated lawyer and a Sunday school teacher who was \n     inspired to become a Unitarian minister;\n       Whereas after their arrival in Czechoslovakia the Sharps \n     immediately grasped that they needed not only to help feed \n     refugees, but also to assist Jews and opponents of the Nazi \n     regime escape to safety elsewhere in Europe;\n       Whereas the Sharps refused to leave Prague when, in March \n     1939, a month after the Sharps' arrival, the Nazis occupied \n     Czechoslovakia, making the Sharps' work more urgent, more \n     complicated, and more dangerous;\n       Whereas the Sharps insisted on continuing their life-saving \n     mission by working out of private residences even after April \n     1939, when the Nazis ransacked the office of the Unitarian \n     mission in Prague and threw the furniture into the street;\n       Whereas the Sharps repeatedly risked their own safety to \n     exit and re-enter Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, crisscrossed \n     Europe to obtain the travel documents necessary to help Jews \n     and opponents of the Nazi regime escape Czechoslovakia, and \n     even escorted some refugees by train through Germany to the \n     United Kingdom;\n       Whereas the Sharps were determined to complete their 6-\n     month mission, even after warnings that the Gestapo was \n     searching for them;\n       Whereas the Sharps stayed in Czechoslovakia until August \n     30, 1939, 1 day before Gestapo agents came to arrest Martha \n     Sharp, who had become known for her boldness at evading Nazi \n     rules restricting travel;\n       Whereas upon the Sharps' return in 1940 to their family and \n     the Wellesley Hills Unitarian Church in Massachusetts, their \n     report to the American Unitarian Association about the \n     imminent danger posed by the Nazis to refugees across Europe \n     led to the Sharps being asked to establish a similar \n     operation in France under the newly founded Unitarian Service \n     Committee;\n       Whereas the Sharps returned to Europe in 1940 fully aware \n     of the Nazi terror they would face;\n       Whereas the Sharps had a special interest in saving refugee \n     children, as well as artists, intellectuals, and political \n     dissidents, and the Sharps and the Unitarian colleagues who \n     followed in their footsteps set up systems and escape routes \n     that functioned throughout World War II to assist \n     approximately 2,000 men, women, and children to gain freedom;\n       Whereas the famous Jewish novelist, Lion Feuchtwanger, who \n     was one of the first Germans to have his citizenship revoked \n     after Hitler came to power and whose name topped the \n     Gestapo's ``Surrender on Demand'' list, was one of the first \n     people the Sharps helped in a dramatic and dangerous escape \n     from France;\n       Whereas Eva Rosemarie Feigl, who was 14 in December 1940 \n     when Martha Sharp helped her and 28 other children reach \n     safety in the United States, provided eye-witness testimony \n     that enabled the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' \n     Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, Israel, to honor the \n     Sharps as Righteous Among the Nations;\n       Whereas when the Sharps' plans to set up the first office \n     of the newly formed Unitarian Service Committee in Paris, \n     France failed as a result of the Nazi occupation of France, \n     the Sharps instead established an operation in neutral \n     Portugal, where throughout World War II Lisbon remained the \n     last hope for refugees seeking safe passage out of Nazi-\n     occupied territory;\n       Whereas the Sharps recognized that they were dependent upon \n     a much larger circle of friends and colleagues who made their \n     heroism possible, such as the people who cared for the \n     Sharps' children, the members of the congregation in \n     Wellesley, Massachusetts who maintained the Wellesley Hills \n     Unitarian Church in the Sharps' absence, ordinary Unitarians \n     who financed their cause, ministers across the United States \n     who urged their congregations to become sponsors for \n     refugees, and secretaries who volunteered in Europe and the \n     United States to maintain thousands of case files for \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the Sharps' efforts resulted not only in the rescue \n     of thousands of people, but in the creation of what is now \n     known as the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, an \n     institution that multiplied the number of rescues a thousand-\n     fold in the years that followed;\n       Whereas at the Yad Vashem ceremony that honored the Sharps \n     as Righteous Among the Nations on June 13, 2006, in Israel, \n     officials specifically recognized the Sharps' courage in \n     going into the heart of Europe when World War II was \n     unfolding and many people were fleeing;\n       Whereas Martha Sharp was the first American woman to be \n     named Righteous Among the Nations, and the Reverend Waitstill \n     Sharp and Martha Sharp were only the second and third \n     individuals named Righteous Among the Nations who were United \n     States citizens at the time they performed the deeds for \n     which they were honored;\n       Whereas the Sharps' daughter, Martha Sharp Joukowsky, \n     accepted the Yad Vashem honor on behalf of her parents and \n     remarked that they were ``modest and ordinary people, who \n     responded to the suffering and needs around them . . . as \n     they would have expected everyone to do in a similar \n     situation'';\n       Whereas Martha Sharp Joukowsky added that the honor given \n     to her parents is also about ``the unseen efforts of a much \n     wider circle of people who made their work possible'' and \n     that it ``is the kind of network that is needed again today \n     to stop the slow genocide in Darfur'';\n       Whereas Martha Sharp Joukowsky concluded her remarks by \n     saying, ``Let this celebration about my parents stand as a \n     call to action'';\n       Whereas September 9, 2006, marks the second anniversary of \n     the United States Government declaring the violence in \n     Darfur, Sudan to be genocide; and\n       Whereas the Sharps deserve honor for their example and for \n     helping to found an institution, the Unitarian Universalist \n     Service Committee, that today carries on their work in \n     distant corners of the world and asks for the Righteous Among \n     the Nations to help save Darfur now: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha \n     Sharp as genuine American heroes;\n       (2) pays tribute to the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha \n     Sharp as their names are added to the Wall of Rescuers in the \n     permanent exhibition of the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum on September 14, 2006;\n       (3) commends the organization founded to support the \n     Sharps' work, the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, \n     for its efforts to rescue Jews and opponents of the Nazi \n     regime in Europe from 1939 to 1945 and for carrying on the \n     Sharps' legacy by working to save the lives of the people of \n     Darfur, Sudan and to protect human rights worldwide; and\n       (4) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Joukowsky family of \n     Providence, Rhode Island, the direct descendants of the \n     Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp,\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\n     and to the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee of \n

Res. 563\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects 2,200,000 people in the \n     United States, including 1 in 133 healthy people;\n       Whereas celiac disease is an intolerance to gluten, a \n     protein found in wheat, rye, oats, and barley, as well as \n     some medicines and vitamins;\n       Whereas exposure to gluten damages the villi of the small \n     intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients in \n     food;\n       Whereas celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a \n     malabsorption disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a genetic disease, with 1 in 22 \n     people having a first-degree relative with celiac disease;\n       Whereas the average length of time it takes for a \n     symptomatic person to be diagnosed with celiac disease is 11 \n     years;\n       Whereas celiac disease is often misdiagnosed and \n     underdiagnosed due to the fact that symptoms can be \n     attributed to other conditions and many doctors are not very \n     knowledgeable about the disease;\n       Whereas, according to a study, 60 percent of children and \n     41 percent of adults diagnosed with celiac disease were \n     asymptomatic;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed through tests measuring \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease is treated by following a gluten-\n     free diet;\n       Whereas damage to the small intestine leads to an increased \n     risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, \n     osteoporosis, miscarriage and congenital malformation, and \n     short stature;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who was born on \n     September 13, 1839;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2006, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, the Celiac Disease \n     Foundation, the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, \n     and the Oklahoma Celiac Support Group.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9256-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 564--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 10 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 16, \n  2006, AS ``NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK'' AND \n   SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL POLYCYSTICK KIDNEY \n DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF \n    THE IMPACT POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE HAS ON PATIENTS AND FUTURE \n                     GENERATIONS OF THEIR FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Kohl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 564\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is the \n     most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease in the United \n     States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease that has a \n     devastating impact, in both human and economic terms, on \n     people of all ages, and affects equally people of all races, \n     sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and income \n     levels;\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents called polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     cure, is 1 of the 4 leading causes of kidney failure in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease \n     causes many patients to live in denial and forego regular \n     visits to their physicians or to avoid following good health \n     management which would help avoid more severe complications \n     when kidney failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression (7 times the national average) and its resultant \n     consequences due to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and \n     premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health and from such initiatives as \n     the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the third week of September and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Week: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 10 through September 16, 2006, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease (known as \n     ``PKD'');\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9256-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4922.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 562) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 562\n\n       Whereas on June 13, 2006, the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' \n     and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Israel, an organization \n     dedicated to preserving the memory of Holocaust victims, \n     honored the Reverend Waitstill Sharp, and his wife, Martha \n     Sharp, posthumously as ``Righteous Among the Nations'' for \n     risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust;\n       Whereas the Sharps had to leave their 2-year-old daughter \n     and 6-year-old son in the care of family and congregants in \n     Wellesley, Massachusetts to answer a call from leaders of the \n     American Unitarian Association to go to Czechoslovakia in \n     February 1939 to provide humanitarian assistance for the tens \n     of thousands of refugees crowding into Prague;\n       Whereas Martha Sharp was a social worker trained at the \n     Jane Addams Hull House, a community service organization in \n     Chicago, Illinois, and the Reverend Waitstill Sharp was a \n     Harvard-educated lawyer and a Sunday school teacher who was \n     inspired to become a Unitarian minister;\n       Whereas after their arrival in Czechoslovakia the Sharps \n     immediately grasped that they needed not only to help feed \n     refugees, but also to assist Jews and opponents of the Nazi \n     regime escape to safety elsewhere in Europe;\n       Whereas the Sharps refused to leave Prague when, in March \n     1939, a month after the Sharps' arrival, the Nazis occupied \n     Czechoslovakia, making the Sharps' work more urgent, more \n     complicated, and more dangerous;\n       Whereas the Sharps insisted on continuing their life-saving \n     mission by working out of private residences even after April \n     1939, when the Nazis ransacked the office of the Unitarian \n     mission in Prague and threw the furniture into the street;\n       Whereas the Sharps repeatedly risked their own safety to \n     exit and re-enter Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, crisscrossed \n     Europe to obtain the travel documents necessary to help Jews \n     and opponents of the Nazi regime escape Czechoslovakia, and \n     even escorted some refugees by train through Germany to the \n     United Kingdom;\n       Whereas the Sharps were determined to complete their 6-\n     month mission, even after warnings that the Gestapo was \n     searching for them;\n       Whereas the Sharps stayed in Czechoslovakia until August \n     30, 1939, 1 day before Gestapo agents came to arrest Martha \n     Sharp, who had become known for her boldness at evading Nazi \n     rules restricting travel;\n       Whereas upon the Sharps' return in 1940 to their family and \n     the Wellesley Hills Unitarian Church in Massachusetts, their \n     report to the American Unitarian Association about the \n     imminent danger posed by the Nazis to refugees across Europe \n     led to the Sharps being asked to establish a similar \n     operation in France under the newly founded Unitarian Service \n     Committee;\n       Whereas the Sharps returned to Europe in 1940 fully aware \n     of the Nazi terror they would face;\n       Whereas the Sharps had a special interest in saving refugee \n     children, as well as artists, intellectuals, and political \n     dissidents, and the Sharps and the Unitarian colleagues who \n     followed in their footsteps set up systems and escape routes \n     that functioned throughout World War II to assist \n     approximately 2,000 men, women, and children to gain freedom;\n       Whereas the famous Jewish novelist, Lion Feuchtwanger, who \n     was one of the first Germans to have his citizenship revoked \n     after Hitler came to power and whose name topped the \n     Gestapo's ``Surrender on Demand'' list, was one of the first \n     people the Sharps helped in a dramatic and dangerous escape \n     from France;\n       Whereas Eva Rosemarie Feigl, who was 14 in December 1940 \n     when Martha Sharp helped her and 28 other children reach \n     safety in the United States, provided eye-witness testimony \n     that enabled the Yad Vashem Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' \n     Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, Israel, to honor the \n     Sharps as Righteous Among the Nations;\n       Whereas when the Sharps' plans to set up the first office \n     of the newly formed Unitarian Service Committee in Paris, \n     France failed as a result of the Nazi occupation of France, \n     the Sharps instead established an operation in neutral \n     Portugal, where throughout World War II Lisbon remained the \n     last hope for refugees seeking safe passage out of Nazi-\n     occupied territory;\n       Whereas the Sharps recognized that they were dependent upon \n     a much larger circle of friends and colleagues who made their \n     heroism possible, such as the people who cared for the \n     Sharps' children, the members of the congregation in \n     Wellesley, Massachusetts who maintained the Wellesley Hills \n     Unitarian Church in the Sharps' absence, ordinary Unitarians \n     who financed their cause, ministers across the United States \n     who urged their congregations to become sponsors for \n     refugees, and secretaries who volunteered in Europe and the \n     United States to maintain thousands of case files for \n     refugees;\n       Whereas the Sharps' efforts resulted not only in the rescue \n     of thousands of people, but in the creation of what is now \n     known as the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, an \n     institution that multiplied the number of rescues a thousand-\n     fold in the years that followed;\n       Whereas at the Yad Vashem ceremony that honored the Sharps \n     as Righteous Among the Nations on June 13, 2006, in Israel, \n     officials specifically recognized the Sharps' courage in \n     going into the heart of Europe when World War II was \n     unfolding and many people were fleeing;\n       Whereas Martha Sharp was the first American woman to be \n     named Righteous Among the Nations, and the Reverend Waitstill\n\n[[Page S9279]]\n\n     Sharp and Martha Sharp were only the second and third \n     individuals named Righteous Among the Nations who were United \n     States citizens at the time they performed the deeds for \n     which they were honored;\n       Whereas the Sharps' daughter, Martha Sharp Joukowsky, \n     accepted the Yad Vashem honor on behalf of her parents and \n     remarked that they were ``modest and ordinary people, who \n     responded to the suffering and needs around them . . . as \n     they would have expected everyone to do in a similar \n     situation'';\n       Whereas Martha Sharp Joukowsky added that the honor given \n     to her parents is also about ``the unseen efforts of a much \n     wider circle of people who made their work possible'' and \n     that it ``is the kind of network that is needed again today \n     to stop the slow genocide in Darfur'';\n       Whereas Martha Sharp Joukowsky concluded her remarks by \n     saying, ``Let this celebration about my parents stand as a \n     call to action'';\n       Whereas September 9, 2006, marks the second anniversary of \n     the United States Government declaring the violence in \n     Darfur, Sudan to be genocide; and\n       Whereas the Sharps deserve honor for their example and for \n     helping to found an institution, the Unitarian Universalist \n     Service Committee, that today carries on their work in \n     distant corners of the world and asks for the Righteous Among \n     the Nations to help save Darfur now: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha \n     Sharp as genuine American heroes;\n       (2) pays tribute to the Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha \n     Sharp as their names are added to the Wall of Rescuers in the \n     permanent exhibition of the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum on September 14, 2006;\n       (3) commends the organization founded to support the \n     Sharps' work, the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, \n     for its efforts to rescue Jews and opponents of the Nazi \n     regime in Europe from 1939 to 1945 and for carrying on the \n     Sharps' legacy by working to save the lives of the people of \n     Darfur, Sudan and to protect human rights worldwide; and\n       (4) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Joukowsky family of \n     Providence, Rhode Island, the direct descendants of the \n     Reverend Waitstill Sharp and Martha Sharp, and to the \n     Unitarian Universalist Service Committee of Cambridge, \n     Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 563, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 563) designating September 13, 2006, \n     as ``National Celiac Disease Awareness Day''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague, Ben \nNelson, to urge support for resolution designating September 13, 2006, \nas National Celiac Disease Awareness Day. We come before the Senate \ntoday to seek your help in raising awareness of celiac disease. Celiac \ndisease hits very close to home for me as I have a staffer with the \ndisease and an Oklahoma Celiac Support Group working to promote \nawareness in my great State. There are many groups and organizations \nworking to promote celiac disease, and we applaud all their efforts. We \nwould like to give special thanks to Heather Cline, President, with the \nOklahoma Celiac Support Group, and Tom Sullivan, President, and Mary \nSchluckebier, Executive Director, with the Celiac Sprue Association, \nlocated in Nebraska, for their help with this resolution and great work \npromoting awareness.\n  Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a malabsorption disease \nthat affects an estimated 2.2 million Americans which could mean as \nmany as 22,000 in the State of Oklahoma. Celiac disease is, \nessentially, intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, oats \nand barley, as well as some medicines and vitamins. When exposed to \ngluten, the villi of the small intestine are damaged, interfering with \nthe absorption of nutrients. Other problems can occur as a result of \ndamage to the small intestine, including malnutrition, anemia, \nlymphoma, and adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage and congenital \nmalformation, and short stature. Celiac disease is also linked other \nautoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, systemic lupus \nerythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen vascular \ndisease, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome.\n  Celiac disease has been widely underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed until \nrecently thanks to an increase in research regarding the disease. It is \neasily detectable through tests measuring the blood for abnormally high \nlevels of the antibodies of immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue \ntransglutaminase and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies. Of the 2.2 million \nAmericans who have celiac disease, 97 percent are currently \nundiagnosed, according to the University of Chicago Celiac Disease \nProgram. Often the symptoms are attributed to other conditions as many \ndoctors lack sufficient knowledge about the disease. In a study \npublished by the American Journal of Gastroenterology, the average \nlength of time for a symptomatic person to be diagnosed with celiac \ndisease is eleven years, dramatically increasing an individual's risk \nof developing more serious conditions. To compound the situation, \naccording to a study by Dr. Allesio Fasano, published in the Archives \nof Internal Medicine, sixty percent of children and forty-one percent \nof adults diagnosed with celiac disease are asymptomatic, showing no \nsymptoms of the disease.\n  Treatment for celiac disease involves following a gluten-free diet. \nThe good news is that the treatment for celiac disease is highly \neffective. In most sufferers, the small intestines heal completely. \nHowever, failure to properly diagnose celiac disease could lead to some \nof the issues mentioned earlier, and most often malnutrition.\n  Awareness can go a long way toward diagnosing and treating the \nmillions of suffers of celiac disease both in my home state of Oklahoma \nand across the nation. Therefore, we ask you to join us in this effort \nto raise awareness of celiac disease.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 563) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 563\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects 2,200,000 people in the \n     United States, including 1 in 133 healthy people;\n       Whereas celiac disease is an intolerance to gluten, a \n     protein found in wheat, rye, oats, and barley, as well as \n     some medicines and vitamins;\n       Whereas exposure to gluten damages the villi of the small \n     intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients in \n     food;\n       Whereas celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder and a \n     malabsorption disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a genetic disease, with 1 in 22 \n     people having a first-degree relative with celiac disease;\n       Whereas the average length of time it takes for a \n     symptomatic person to be diagnosed with celiac disease is 11 \n     years;\n       Whereas celiac disease is often misdiagnosed and \n     underdiagnosed due to the fact that symptoms can be \n     attributed to other conditions and many doctors are not very \n     knowledgeable about the disease;\n       Whereas, according to a study, 60 percent of children and \n     41 percent of adults diagnosed with celiac disease were \n     asymptomatic;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed through tests measuring \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease is treated by following a gluten-\n     free diet;\n       Whereas damage to the small intestine leads to an increased \n     risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, \n     osteoporosis, miscarriage and congenital malformation, and \n     short stature;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who was born on \n     September 13, 1839;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2006, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n\n[[Page S9280]]\n\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the date with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, the Celiac Disease \n     Foundation, the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America, \n     and the Oklahoma Celiac Support Group.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9280-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 564) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 564\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is the \n     most prevalent life-threatening genetic disease in the United \n     States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease that has a \n     devastating impact, in both human and economic terms, on \n     people of all ages, and affects equally people of all races, \n     sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and income \n     levels;\n       Whereas, based on prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health, it is estimated that about 600,000 \n     patients in the United States have a genetic inheritance from \n     1 or both parents called polycystic kidney disease, and that \n     countless additional friends, loved ones, spouses, and \n     caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     cure, is 1 of the 4 leading causes of kidney failure in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease \n     causes many patients to live in denial and forego regular \n     visits to their physicians or to avoid following good health \n     management which would help avoid more severe complications \n     when kidney failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression (7 times the national average) and its resultant \n     consequences due to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and \n     premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health and from such initiatives as \n     the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the third week of September and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Week: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 10 through September 16, 2006, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease (known as \n     ``PKD'');\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9280-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9280-S9281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SUPPORTING AND COMMENDING THE NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT HOTLINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 537\n\n       Whereas it is estimated that a sexual assault occurs every \n     2.5 minutes in the United States and more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States each year are victims of sexual assault;\n       Whereas 1 of every 6 women and 1 of every 33 men in the \n     United States have been victims of rape or attempted rape, \n     according to the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas the Uniform Crime Reports of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation rank rape second only to murder in the \n     hierarchy of violent crimes;\n       Whereas research suggests that sexual assault victims who \n     receive counseling are more likely to report the assault to \n     the police and to participate in the prosecution of the \n     offender;\n       Whereas, in June 2006, the National Sexual Assault Hotline \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``Hotline'') helped its \n     1,000,000th caller;\n       Whereas the Hotline operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per \n     year, offering important, free, and confidential crisis \n     intervention, support, information, and referrals for victims \n     of sexual assault and their friends and families;\n       Whereas the Hotline was created by the Rape, Abuse & Incest \n     National Network (referred to in this preamble as ``RAINN''), \n     a non-profit corporation, the headquarters of which are \n     located in Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas the Hotline answered its first call on July 27, \n     1994, and operated solely with private funds for the first 10 \n     years the Hotline was in existence;\n       Whereas RAINN continues to operate the Hotline today, in \n     partnership with 1,100 local\n\n[[Page S9281]]\n\n     rape crisis centers in the 50 States and the District of \n     Columbia and with over 10,000 trained volunteers and staff, \n     and in collaboration with coalitions against sexual assault \n     in each of the 50 States;\n       Whereas the Hotline helps an average of 11,000 people each \n     month and in 2005 helped 137,039 women, men, and children \n     across the Nation;\n       Whereas the public education and outreach undertaken by \n     RAINN and local rape crisis centers have increased public \n     awareness of sexual violence and contributed to a 58-percent \n     decline in crimes of sexual violence since 1993;\n       Whereas the Hotline has experienced a significant increase \n     in call volume as public awareness of sexual violence has \n     grown, with calls to the Hotline increasing by 43 percent \n     since 2003;\n       Whereas millions of Americans have learned of the services \n     available through the Hotline, thanks to the public service \n     promotion contributed by every national broadcast television \n     network, a dozen cable networks, and more than 1,000 radio \n     stations, newspapers, and magazines; and\n       Whereas the Hotline serves as an outstanding example of a \n     successful partnership between the Federal Government, the \n     private sector, and individuals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the National Sexual Assault Hotline; and\n       (2) commends the National Sexual Assault Hotline for \n     counseling and supporting more than 1,000,000 callers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/08/senate-section/article/S9281-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ABRAHAM LINCOLN COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
