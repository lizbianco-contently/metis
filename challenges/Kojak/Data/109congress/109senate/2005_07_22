Madam President, this morning, we will resume debate \non the Defense authorization bill. Chairman Warner is here, and Senator \nLevin just walked into the Chamber. He is here as well. They will be \nhere to manage the bill this morning. Senators are expected to come \nover and offer several amendments. Although no rollcalls will occur \ntoday, the managers will be able to accept amendments which have been \ncleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  We will file a cloture motion today, which will be ready for a vote \non Tuesday. This will allow us to finish the bill next week. If we \ninvoke cloture, Senators will still be able to offer their amendments, \nand we would still be ensured we could proceed to passage sometime \nbefore the August recess.\n  As the majority leader has repeated, we have a number of items to \nconsider over these last days prior to our departure for the month of \nAugust. I will say more on next week's schedule at closing, but \nSenators should be ready for a long week next week. I do not believe \nanyone should be preparing for any early departures, and that includes \nnext Friday.\n  I remind our colleagues we will be voting Monday evening. We have not \nyet set any votes at that time. However, we do expect a vote or votes \nto occur on Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8715-8", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it is a pleasure for me to be here this \nmorning to recognize Dr. Percell Church. As has been indicated by the \nChair, he is the leader of the Zion United Methodist Church in Las \nVegas.\n  When he came to Las Vegas a short time ago, in relative terms, he had \nsome very big shoes to fill. The Zion United Methodist Church had been \noperated, pastored, by one of Nevada's very famous residents, Marion \nBennett, who had served with great distinction\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nin the Nevada State legislature and led this very large church.\n  So when Dr. Church came to run the church, we were all anticipating \nthe tremendously large shoes he had to fill. And it is easy for me to \nsay that he has done it with distinction, honor, and class.\n  Dr. Church is a native of New Orleans, LA, where he earned a bachelor \nof science degree from Southern University. He later earned his master \nof divinity from Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta, GA, and \nreceived his doctor of ministry from Oxford University.\n  Serving in the ministry for more than 20 years, this young man, Dr. \nChurch, has been a guest speaker at countless churches around the \nworld. He has ministered in India, Nigeria, the Bahamas.\n  He is leading the revival and growth of the Zion United Methodist \nChurch. He hosts a daycare center servicing working parents in the Las \nVegas area. He has established a remarkable youth ministry, the purpose \nof which is to get young adults involved in the church and the \ncommunity. That has been successful.\n  He is also a loving husband to his wife Angela, and a loving father \nto his three sons, Daniel, Ephraim, and Immanuel. They are with us \ntoday.\n  I commend Dr. Church for his leadership and wish him well in his \nministry and his continued service to humanity. What a great addition \nto the State of Nevada has been Dr. Percell Church. I am proud to be \nable to say he is my friend, and I look forward to his continued \nspiritual guidance to the people of Zion United Methodist Church and \nthe people of the State of Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8716-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8716-S8717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, changing direction here a little bit, I \nsay to Dr. Church, and others, I want to take up where we left off last \nnight. I have thought about what status we are in here today. It is so \ndisheartening to me. We took up this bill, this very important Defense \nauthorization bill, Wednesday, very late in the day. Statements were \ngiven by the two managers.\n  We came to do our work yesterday, and we worked hard, and we were \nsuddenly struck with the suggestion--we thought it was just some of the \nrumors that happen around here in the Senate that could not be valid. I \ncalled the majority leader: You are not going to file cloture on the \nDefense authorization bill after 1 day of debate, are you? And he said: \nYes. I said: Well, Bill, I am going to go to the floor and complain \nabout that because that is wrong.\n  Now, let me say, Madam President, on this issue I do not agree with a \nnumber of my Senators, but the thing he wants to take up next is an NRA \nbill, a bill dealing with gun liability. Fine. But at the expense of \nthe defense of this country? What are we coming to around here? What \nare we coming to here? After 1 day of debate we are getting off to do \ngun liability? We can do that in September when we come back here, or \nfinish this bill.\n  I want the American public to know what is happening. My dear friend, \nthe senior Senator from Virginia, got up yesterday and, in his \ngentlemanly way, said: Well, it is my fault. It is not his fault. Let's \nbe realistic about it. He does not determine when cloture motions are \nfiled. It is done by the Republican leadership in this Senate. To think \nwe are moving off of this bill after 1 full day of debate, and cloture \nis filed, should be an embarrassment to this leadership that is leading \nthis Senate.\n  I attended a funeral on the Saturday I came back here a couple weeks \nago in Boulder City, NV. A 21-year-old man was killed in service to our \ncountry. He was a Navy SEAL named Shane Patton. The SEALs are a very \nsmall, elite group. His commander there at that funeral cried because \nhe had lost one of his men. I think we owe more to Shane and his \nfamily--his father was also a frogman, as they are called, Jim Patton.\n  The distinguished ranking member will today go over how much time we \nhave spent on these Defense bills in years past. I guarantee you, it \nhas been more than 1 day of full debate. People are going to say: Well, \nwe are here on Friday.\n  We don't dispose of anything here today. We will offer some \namendments. We will have no votes. We will vote late Monday, a few \nhours before cloture will be voted on.\n  Madam President, I don't know if I can deliver, but I am going to \ntry. I am going to try to deliver my Democratic Senators to oppose \ncloture. See, I have been around here a little bit. I understand the \ngames that are being played. The Republican leader wants to blame us \nfor not having the Defense bill go forward. Well, I want the record to \nbe spread, it is not us. It is them. I am going to do everything within \nmy power to stop cloture from being invoked on this bill. We deserve \nbetter than this. Shane Patton deserves more than this. In his memory, \nwe deserve more than 1 day of debate--a 21-year-old man, dead.\n  We have had one recorded vote on this bill. We could have had more, \nbut we had to stop voting yesterday early. We have offered four \namendments on this side. If cloture is invoked, Members of this body \nwill be denied the opportunity to debate and vote on major issues.\n  What kind of major issues? Well, such as ensuring that our troops, \nactive and retired, get the pay and benefits they have earned. No time \nto debate our course in Iraq. I don't know if I am being a little too \npolitical here, but let's think about this a little bit. We are \nspending about $2 billion a week in Iraq--$2 billion a week in Iraq. I \nwonder, as to just that alone, should we spend more than 1 day here in \nthe Senate on this bill? Two billion dollars a week.\n  I wonder if there should be a little debate here on a Defense \nauthorization bill about what is going on in Iraq.\n  What about the fact that we need to spend a little time talking about \nthe spread of weapons of mass destruction? A report was issued on \nTuesday, led by former Defense Secretary Perry, that we have a lot of \nloose nukes, that the real problem we have in this country, as far as \nour security goes, is what to do about these loose nukes. I think that \ndeserves a little bit of time. Should we spend a little bit of time \naddressing the detainee abuse scandal? I think that would be a good \nidea. We can't do this unless we have time to debate issues and have \nsome votes. The Defense authorization bill in years past hasn't taken \ndays; it has taken weeks to complete. No one is trying to slow up \nthings. I support gun manufacturers liability legislation. Jack Reed \nwho doesn't like it, but I have kept him advised every step of the way. \nI support that legislation, but not at the expense of Shane Patton.\n  If cloture is not invoked, does that mean the leader, who has the \nright to pull this bill off the floor, will pull it off and go to gun \nliability and forget the promise he made to the Hawaiian Senators, a \npromise that he made that we would do native Hawaiian legislation?\n  The move that is taking place in the Senate regarding the defense of \nour country is unprecedented. The Armed Services Committee keeps \nrecords back to 1987. These records are thorough and highly accurate. \nDuring that period, approximately the last 18 years, no majority leader \nhas filed cloture on the Defense authorization bill after so little \ntime and so little action. Doing so now during a time of war, when more \nthan 200,000 of our troops are in harm's way looking for our support, \nwould be as disturbing as it is unprecedented.\n  As it stands now, if the majority leader proceeds with this motion, \nit is entirely possible that the Senate will vote to cut off debate on \nthis legislation before we will have a single vote on a Democratic \namendment--a single vote. Let me repeat, it is possible we will have \nvoted to cut off debate before we have voted on a single Democratic \namendment. We can go back before 1987. I can't believe anything like \nthat has ever happened.\n  If this cloture motion is successful, those who support it are \nsending one message--they do not believe the Senate should debate the \nimportant national security issues that are very much on the minds of \nour troops, their families, and the American people. At the same time, \nthe majority leader has apparently concluded we should cut off debate \non this critical legislation after less than 3 days, only one of which \nis a real day--around here we don't do anything on Fridays and Mondays. \nWe travel. We go around raising money. We don't have votes. We are down \nto a\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n2\\1/2\\-day workweek here. But we could spend more than a month, more \nthan 30 days on five judges, every one of which had a job. A third of \nour time in the Senate has been spent on five people, all of whom had \njobs.\n  The majority leader's decision raises an important question. Why \nwould we prematurely cut off debate on critical national security \nlegislation? Why would we want to prevent the Senate from doing \neverything we can to help our men and women in uniform? The Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from Virginia are role models for how to \nwork together on legislation. He has some ideas that he wants to try to \nimprove this bill. There are other Members who have amendments that are \nwaiting. The Senator from Massachusetts has some ideas on how he wants \nto try to improve this legislation. But unfortunately, the answer to \nthese questions is very familiar. Rather than address the concerns on \nthe minds of the American people, our Republican colleagues are once \nagain insisting the Senate focus its time on less important business. \nEarlier this year, we put judges ahead of health care, retirement \nsecurity, education. Now they are apparently willing to put gun \nliability--and I have heard now estate tax--ahead of the needs of our \ntroops.\n  Frankly, this action is not in keeping with the spirit in which this \nbill came to the Senate floor. To this point the process has been \ncompletely bipartisan. I should say nonpartisan. As I have already \nsaid, the chairman and ranking member, as well as the other Republicans \nand Democrats on the Armed Services Committee, worked together to see \nthat our security needs were addressed. Republicans and Democrats even \non the committee, after reporting the bill out, said: We have a few \nthings we would like to a try to address to the whole Senate to see if \nwe can make the whole bill better.\n  The chairman welcomed input from Members on both sides of the aisle, \nas did the ranking member. He made no attempt to prevent Members from \naddressing critical issues or cut off debate, and he should be lauded \nfor the course he chose. The majority leader should follow his example.\n  We want to pass this bill. We want to pass it before we go home for \nthe August recess. That is why, for the past 2 months, I have been on \nthis floor urging us to move to this bill. But, no, we couldn't because \nwe were tied up with judges, the nuclear option. We were happy when he \nfinally brought it to the floor 2 days ago. But little did we know it \nwas apparently just an effort to get another thing off the shelf. We \nare here, ready to debate the numerous important issues raised by the \nlegislation. We won't be able to do that.\n  I hope the Republican leadership will reconsider this action. Let us \nget back to work on this important bill. I repeat: We are going to \noppose cloture, and that is the only thing we can do, in my mind, to \nmake sure that Shane Patton and the other approximately 2,000 men and \nwomen who have been killed in Iraq and the scores who have been killed \nin Afghanistan will have at least the attention of the Senate for a few \ndays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I listened carefully to my good \nfriend from Nevada, the Democratic leader. I don't want to unduly \nprolong the discussion because Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin \nare here to do business on the bill. The more the Democratic leader and \nmyself talk, the less able they are to offer amendments and move \nforward with the bill.\n  I would say this, however. I don't know that it is written on some \ntablet somewhere that we need to spend multiple weeks on a DOD \nauthorization bill, particularly in a time of war. We turned to this \nbill last Wednesday night. That is Wednesday night, Thursday, Friday, \nMonday, and Tuesday before the cloture vote would ripen. During all of \nthat time, Senators could offer nongermane amendments. And then if \ncloture is invoked, there are 30 additional hours for amendments to be \noffered that are germane to the Defense bill. I don't think there is \nany particular reason why the Senate ought not to, particularly in a \ntime of war, do this bill in a more expeditious manner and allow us to \nalso complete other matters before the Senate, one of which the \nDemocratic leader just pointed out he is in favor of, before we leave \nnext week. We are open for business this morning. Chairman Warner and \nSenator Levin are here. Others are here who want to offer amendments. \nWe encourage that. That is why we are in session today.\n  My suggestion to all of us is that we move forward with the business \nthat is before the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I don't need to get the last word, but I \nhave to get make sure the facts are spread across this Senate. Let's \nnot be misled. Wednesday, opening statements; Thursday, one amendment \nvoted on; Friday, nothing voted on; Monday, nothing voted on. I guess \nwe will vote Monday night sometime. Tuesday, please help me on that, we \nought to vote this Tuesday morning. And then to talk about 30 hours \nafterwards, that is one of the biggest farces we have around here. If \nyou are lucky, you can have a vote or two during the 30 hours, but \nremember, there is no necessity to have a vote on anything. It is all \nup to the majority what they let us vote on.\n  In a time of war, does that mean we speed through this? I would think \nthat we should take an inordinate amount of time, lots of time, when we \nare in a state of war. And we are in a state of war. Just ask the \npeople of Great Britain.\n  I am glad we are here to do business today. The managers are here. \nSenator Kennedy is here to offer an amendment. But especially in a time \nof war, let's at least do the average amount of debate on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I don't want to prolong it any \nfurther because we are taking up time for the offering of amendments \nwhich we encourage. We are anxious to have amendments. We are willing \nto have votes. We are not trying to deny anybody the opportunity to \noffer their amendment or to have votes. That is why the chairman and \nranking member are here today. I see Senator Warner is ready to do \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8717-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8717-S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The \nRepublican leader, Senator Frist, entrusted me with the management of \nthis bill. It was my decision with regard to the votes. It was my \ndecision that we file a cloture motion. I accept full responsibility \nfor those decisions. I am proud of the way we operate on this side, \nwhere our leadership reposes in their managers those responsibilities; \nI accept them. If, in due course, it proves to be in error, I accept \nthat responsibility. But I do believe, based on some 27 years of \nexperience managing this bill, that we can achieve the opportunity for \nall Senators to have their amendments heard and voted upon in a timely \nmanner.\n  The matter of cloture, as it ripens on Tuesday, can be addressed by \nthe leadership, in consultation with the managers, and a determination \nmade as to whether it should or should not be invoked. I think that \ndecision, in large measure, would be dependent on what we can achieve \nbetween now and Tuesday.\n  I look upon this in a very positive way. I have confidence in this \ninstitution, confidence in the managers of this bill to see that it is \ndone in a fair and proper manner and done in the best interests \ncertainly of the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield. For about 1 minute, I \nwill go back to the history, and I will not go through it all. Last \nyear, we spent 7 days on this bill. The 1st filing of cloture was on \nthe 11th day of debate, after considering 42 amendments. The 2nd filing \nof cloture was on the 15th day of debate. I think it is totally \ninappropriate to file cloture today.\n  I have no better friend in this body than the Senator from Virginia. \nI was glad to hear what he basically just said, which is that he is \ngoing to take a close look at where we are before this vote takes \nplace. He has always been openminded. I hope he will reconsider this \ncloture motion. We are going to make progress today, even though there \nare no votes.\n  It is difficult for Senators. Senator Kennedy is going to be offering \na very important amendment in a few moments, but the vote on that is \nnot going to take place until probably after the cloture because we \nhave so many amendments that are stacked up here. He deserves better \nand, more importantly, the subject matter of the amendment deserves \nbetter than to be debated on a Friday and then laid aside and not voted \non until many days later. Traditionally, we try to vote on amendments \nafter they are debated--shortly after, not days and days after they are \ndebated.\n  We are going to accommodate the demands of the schedule by trying to \noffer a lot of amendments today and on Monday in order to see if we can \nshow enough progress here so that the motion for cloture will be \nvitiated. That is our hope. I hope the Senator from Virginia will do \nwhat he always does so magnificently, which is maintain an open mind, \nkeep options open, and see what kind of progress can be made to avoid a \ndivisive vote. It is inappropriate to have a cloture vote this soon \nafter the debate begins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just to finish, I have a practice of not \nbringing up personal situations, and I am still going to refrain. If \ncontinued to be pushed on this issue, I will recount several things \nthat occurred yesterday where I tried to accommodate interests on that \nside of the aisle, and when it is said that not a Democratic vote was \ntaken, I know of one vote where I pleaded that it be made, found the \ntime, but the sponsors decided--and it was a joint amendment with a \nRepublican and a Democrat--not to do that.\n  I am not going to get involved in personal situations, but there is a \nlimit to the patience of the Senator from Virginia. On this matter by \nMr. Kennedy, I respect my good friend. Our friendship goes back as long \nas any two Members in this Chamber. This amendment is an important \namendment, there is no question about it. But I ask the Senator from \nMichigan, was not the same amendment voted on by the Senate 3 weeks \nago?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We will have to wait and see the precise nature of the \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is very similar, if not identical.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I commend my friend from Virginia for his temperament, his \nability to withhold any suggestion of personal comment. He is to be \ncommended. He is literally a role model for that. The Senator from \nVirginia is correct. He showed great care for the Members of this body \nyesterday, gave great consideration to the Members, and I commend him \nfor that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1415\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin, in paying tribute to the Armed \nServices Committee. I have been lucky enough to be on that committee \nnow for 24 years. I must say that all of us have the highest regard and \nrespect for the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the committee. \nThere has never been a time that he has not been courteous and diligent \nand thoughtful and considerate for those who have differing views that \ncome up before the committee.\n  I understand the remarks by the Senator from Michigan and also our \nleader, Senator Reid; and although our friend takes the responsibility, \nwe have been around here long enough to know that the overall schedule \nand timetable is made by the majority leader, with all due respect. He \nhas the responsibility, obviously, for the Senate and the Senate \nagenda.\n  The part which is of concern is this, and I will mention this \nbriefly. When we have cloture, we find out that many amendments that \nare related and are enormously important in terms of the subject \nmatter, which is the Defense authorization bill, are effectively \neliminated.\n  I took a quick look at some of the amendments that have been filed to \ndate. We have a Stabenow amendment to fully fund health care for \nveterans. Nobody could watch the news last night and not understand the \nchallenge our veterans are having in getting coverage and being treated \nwell. That is true in my State, and the Nation was alerted again. We \nhave had some debate on that issue. It is an issue of enormous \nimportance. We make a commitment to those young men and women who \nvolunteer and fight in our wars that they are going to have their needs \nattended to when they come back. They are not being attended to.\n\n  The Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, has an amendment that \nprobably would not be eligible after cloture. It is on pay equity for \nreservists who are being deployed. We have so many being deployed over \nin Iraq, and it is an important amendment to make sure they are to be \ncompensated. It is very important in terms of morale and, most of all, \nin terms of fairness for the reservists.\n  Then there is reform of the Pentagon procurement, with all of the \nkinds of challenges we have seen on the purchasing of the humvee. We \nreviewed that last night once again. An article that was written in the \nNew York Times and the purchase conflict between the services, the lack \nof priority that was given really as a result of a failure of our \nprocurement policies, we can do something about that, but we are not \ngoing to do something about it if we have cloture. Then there is the \nlimitation of profits on defense contractors. We don't have to take a \nlot of time on that issue, but I think the American taxpayer, when they \nsee hundreds of millions in windfall profits going to so many defense \ncontractors, would have to say that spending a few moments on that to \nmake sure, for example, the allegations that our troops are going to \nget the food they deserve and need on time and not be given second-\nlevel food is something that ought to be debated.\n  My amendment with Senator Feinstein and Senator Kerry on bunker \nbusters relates to the whole issue of nuclear proliferation and \nstability. We probably would not be eligible to bring that up. There \nhave been important issues on funding for the cooperative threat \nreduction, which is so important in terms of the nuclear proliferation, \nwith the very important and impressive study released this last week.\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\n  Those give you a little bit of a flavor, and they are related to \nnational security and defense. We are told we don't have time for that. \nI have been here when we spent 2 full weeks debating bankruptcy and for \nthe credit card companies. The result of the bankruptcy bill we passed \nhere means the profits for the credit card companies are going up $5.6 \nbillion this next year. We spent 2 weeks on that issue that will \nbenefit special interests. We spent more than a week on class action, \nwhich will benefit very special interests. We spent more than a week on \nhighways. If you can spend more than a week on highways and you can \nlook after the credit card companies and you can look after the major \nfinancial interests in class action, surely we can debate these issues \nthat are related to the security and well-being of the troops of this \ncountry.\n  That is the point. I believe it is irrefutable myself. We were told \nlast night, well, we had heard that Senator Levin, Senator Reid, and \nothers might propose a commission to look into the whole question of \nthe torture policies that have taken place at Abu Ghraib. We had 12 \ndifferent studies done by the Armed Services Committee, and we still \ndon't have anybody in the civilian areas that has been held \naccountable, even though they were the architects of the torture \npolicy. This has given us a black eye all over the world. It has been \nan incentive, and it is inflaming al-Qaida. It has been a recruiting \ntool used in order to gather more recruits for al-Qaida.\n  It had been suggested that we have an independent commission review \nthat. And then guess what happened. Within a matter of hours, the White \nHouse says, If that amendment is accepted, I will veto the bill that is \ndeveloping with Defense authorization. Imagine that. The President will \nveto the bill if that amendment is accepted. He will veto the bill that \nprovides the resources for our fighting men and women if we are going \nto have an independent kind of review about how we got into all of this \ntrouble in terms of torture and inflaming al-Qaida because of those \nactivities. They are going to veto the bill. Therefore, we are going to \nhave cloture.\n  We don't have to be around here for a number of years to understand \nwhat is happening. That is just plain wrong, Mr. President. It is just \nplain wrong. It is not the way this body ought to be doing business. \nThese issues are too important. People are ready to debate them.\n  We had the amendment that I have here, which is very similar to the \namendment Senator Feinstein and I offered earlier on another \nappropriations bill. It is a matter of enormous importance in terms of \nthe issue of nuclear proliferation.\n  There is an excellent study this last week about the worst weapons in \nthe worst hands. The National Security Advisory Group is chaired by \nWillian Perry, former Secretary of Defense, and is made up of an \nextraordinary group of men and women who have spent their lives in \nterms of national security and defense and talking about the dangers of \nincreased nuclear weapons. Well, we have now in this bill the design \nfor new nuclear weapons. They will say: No, we don't, it is only $4.5 \nmillion. Look at the Department of Energy's congressional budget, right \nhere on page 63, where cumulatively they are planning to spend a half \nbillion dollars on it. New nuclear weapon? We are looking at a new \nnuclear weapon in the Defense authorization bill.\n\n  Look at the front page here of the New York Times, right up on the \ntop: ``New York Starts to Inspect Bags on the Subways.'' What is the \ngreatest threat to our homeland security, a new nuclear weapon or--here \nit is--``New York Starts to Inspect Bags on the Subways.'' The second \nstory: Bombs set in London at four sites, failed to explode, no one \nhurt. And we are going out and building another nuclear weapon.\n  We welcome the opportunity to address the Senate now on Friday, but \nthis is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. We are told \nthese issues are not as important as freeing the gun industry from \nliability, a special interest. So we have an NRA check. I know where \nthe votes are on that. We are going to get another special interest \ncheck. We have a special interest check for credit cards, a special \ninterest check because of class actions, and we are going to get \nanother one now from the NRA.\n  We are not going to have the chance for these Senators to be able to \ndebate pay equity for the reserves? Health care for veterans? No. We \ndon't have the time. What is more important to us? I have plans at the \nend of next week along with everybody else, but what is more important \nthan continuing and finishing this legislation? That is what we are \nsupposed to do as Senators.\n  Mr. President, when you look over where we spend the time and how we \nhave spent the time, surely these issues that are of such fundamental \nimportance to our national security and to the security of the American \npeople deserve the kind of time our leader and Senator Levin have \nsuggested.\n  For the past 60 years, one of the principal tenets of the American \nnational security policy has been to limit the number of nuclear \nweapons in the world and to limit the number of countries that possess \nthem.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy warned that if action weren't taken at \nthat time, there would be 20 nuclear weapon nations by the end of the \n1970s. That is what he said in 1962. Because of initiatives he and \nsuccessive Presidents--Republican and Democrat--took to prevent that, \ntoday there are only eight nuclear armed states.\n  Through careful negotiations, we arrived at the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the foundation of all current global nuclear arms \ncontrol. The nonproliferation treaty, signed in 1968, has long stood \nfor the fundamental principle that the world will be safer if nuclear \nproliferation doesn't extend to other countries.\n  I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of myself, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and my colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1415.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To transfer funds authorized to be appropriated to the \n Department of Energy for the National Nuclear Security Administration \n   for weapons activities and available for the Robust Nuclear Earth \n    Penetrator to the Army National Guard, Washington, District of \n                           Columbia, chapter)\n\n       On page 378, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3114. TRANSFER OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR ROBUST NUCLEAR \n                   EARTH PENETRATOR TO THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD OF \n                   THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\n\n       (a) Reduction in Funds Available for Robust Nuclear Earth \n     Penetrator.--The amount authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Department of Energy for the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration for weapons activities by section 3101(a)(1) \n     is hereby reduced by $4,000,000, which reduction shall be \n     allocated to amounts available for the Robust Nuclear Earth \n     Penetrator.\n       (b) Increase in Funds Available to Army National Guard, \n     Washington, District of Columbia, Chapter.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 301(10) for \n     operation and maintenance for the Army National Guard is \n     hereby increased by $4,000,000, with the amount of such \n     increase to be available for the Army National Guard of the \n     District of Columbia, as follows:\n       (1) $2,500,000 shall be made available for urban terrorist \n     attack response training.\n       (2) $1,500,000 shall be made available for the procurement \n     of communications equipment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in that compact of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the foundation of all global nuclear arms \ncontrol, 184 nations have voluntarily rejected nuclear weapons. These \ninclude 40 states, such as Japan, Germany, Sweden, and Singapore, that \nhave the technical infrastructure to build nuclear arsenals if they \nchose to do so.\n  In addition, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, South Africa, Argentina, \nBrazil, Taiwan, South Korea, and others have turned away from nuclear \nweapons because of the NPT and our leadership.\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\n  America led the way to a safer world by example. By adhering to these \ncarefully crafted agreements, we were able to discourage the spread of \ndangerous nuclear weapons that would threaten our security.\n  However, the Bush administration has abandoned that course. Not only \nhas this White House expressed disdain for decades of nuclear arms \ncontrol, but it now threatens to launch a new nuclear arms race. As we \nare discouraging North Korea and Iran from producing nuclear arms--and \nas we are trying to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of \nterrorists--the Bush administration recklessly proposes for the United \nStates to produce a new breed of nuclear weapon. President Bush and \nSecretary Rumsfeld want to develop a new tactical nuclear weapon that \ncan burrow deep into the earth and destroy bunkers and weapon caches. \nThe new weapon they propose has the chilling title of robust nuclear \nearth penetrator. They hold the dangerous and misguided belief that our \nNation's interests are served by developing what they consider a more \neasily usable nuclear bomb--more easily usable nuclear bomb. That is \njust what we need more of today.\n  Most Americans believe that is wrong. Therefore, the amendment that \nSenator Feinstein and I offer today will halt this dangerous new policy \nand redirect the $4 million in funds from the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator research program to the National Guard for the more urgent \ntask of preventing another terrorist attack on our Nation's capital.\n  This action is especially warranted in light of the bombings in the \nLondon subway. Instead of developing new nukes, we should address the \nreal-world challenges of terrorism that we face right here, right now.\n  In the end, the administration would like us to buy something we \ndon't need, that endangers us by its mere existence, and that makes our \nimportant diplomatic goals much more difficult to achieve.\n  Our challenge in addressing nuclear nonproliferation issues is not \nthat there are too few nuclear weapons in the world, but that there are \ntoo many; not that they are too difficult to use but too easy.\n  North Korea has recently acquired nuclear weapons and does not \nhesitate to rattle them. Iran is widely thought to be moving forward on \nthe development of nuclear weapons capability. The increased \navailability of nuclear technology to other nations is an ominous \ndevelopment, especially when it is difficult to accept at face value \ntheir statements that the technology is intended only for peaceful \npurposes.\n  What moral authority do we have to ask other nations to give up their \ndesire for nuclear weapons of their own when we are developing a new \ngeneration of such weapons of our own? How can we tell other nations \nnot to sell their nuclear technology to others when we are exporting \nour own technology?\n  For the past 2 years, Congress has raised major doubts about the \nbunker-buster program and significantly cut back on its funding. But \nthe administration still presses forward for their development. For \nfiscal year 2004, they requested $15 million for it, and Congress \nreluctantly provided half that amount. For 2005, they requested another \n$27 million and submitted a 5-year request for nearly $500 million, and \nCongress denied their request.\n  This year, nothing has changed. The fiscal year 2006 budget request \nfrom the President includes $4 million for the Department of Energy to \nstudy the bunker buster, and $4.5 million for the Department of Defense \nfor the same purpose. Thankfully, our colleagues in the House were \nwiser and eliminated the funds.\n  The administration obviously is still committed to this reckless \napproach. Secretary Rumsfeld made his position clear in January, when \nhe wrote to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham:\n\n       I think we should request funds in 06 and 07 to complete \n     the study . . . You can count on my support for your efforts \n     to revitalize the nuclear weapons infrastructure and to \n     complete the RNEP study.\n\n  The fiscal year 2006 budget requests funds only to complete the \nfeasibility study for these nuclear weapons, but we already know what \nthe next step is. In the budget sent to us last year, the \nadministration stated in plain language that they intend to develop it. \nAmbassador Linton Brooks, the head of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, claims the future budget projection was merely a \nplaceholder ``in the event the President decides to proceed with the \ndevelopment and Congress approves.'' But their fiscal year 2005 budget \nclearly shows the administration's unmistakable intention to develop \nand ultimately produce this weapon.\n  They would like us to believe this is a clean, surgical nuclear \nweapon. They say it will burrow into underground targets, destroy them \nwith no adverse consequence for the environment. But science says such \nclaims are false.\n  A National Academy of Sciences April 2005 study confirms exactly what \nmost of us thought: that these nuclear weapons, like other nuclear \nbombs, result in catastrophic nuclear fallout. They can poison tens of \nmillions of people and create radioactive lands for many years to come.\n  The study goes on to say:\n\n       Current experience and empirical predictions indicate that \n     the earth-penetrator weapons cannot penetrate to depths \n     required for total containment of the effects of a nuclear \n     explosion. To be fully contained, a 300 kiloton weapon would \n     have to be detonated at the bottom of a carefully stemmed \n     emplacement hole about 800 meters deep. Because the practical \n     penetrating depth of an earth penetrating weapon is only a \n     few meters--a small fraction of the depth for the full \n     containment--there will be blast, thermal, initial nuclear \n     radiation, and fallout effects--\n\n  From the use of the weapon.\n  Even if we were willing to accept the catastrophic damage a nuclear \nexplosion would cause, the bunker buster would still not be able to \ndestroy all the buried bunkers the intelligence community has \nidentified.\n  This chart, based on the data from the National Academy of Sciences, \ndepicts the simulated maximum effect of a 1-megaton earth-penetrating \nweapon. This massively destructive weapon cannot reach more than 400 \nmeters. All an adversary has to do is bury its bunker below that depth.\n  Bunker busters also require pinpoint accuracy to hit deeply buried \nbunkers. But such accuracy requires precise intelligence about the \nlocation of the target. As the study emphasized, an attack by a nuclear \nweapon can be effective in destroying weapons or weapons materials, \nincluding nuclear materials and chemical or biological agents, but only \nif it is detonated in the actual chamber where the weapons or materials \nare located. Even more disturbing, if the bomb is only slightly off \ntarget, the detonation may cause the spread of deadly chemical and \ngerms, in addition to the radioactive fallout.\n  If it were clear that this weapon were needed to protect our troops, \nthen Congress would probably support it. But that is not the case. At \nthe House Armed Services Committee hearing in March, program chief \nLinton Brooks once again was asked if there was a military requirement \nfor the bunker buster, and he categorically said:\n\n       No, there is not.\n\n  This chart shows how important it is that the bunker buster be \nprecise, in terms of targeting, or otherwise it is not going to destroy \nthe target, and the dangers of chemical and nuclear material \nproliferation are dramatic.\n  Our military has no need for a nuclear bunker buster. Existing \nconventional weapons have the ability to neutralize this threat. These \ncharts from the National Academy of Sciences show the types of deeply \nburied, hardened bunkers the nuclear bunker buster is intended to \ndestroy. All bunkers must have air intakes, energy sources, and \nentrances. If we can destroy them by conventional means, we have \naccomplished our purpose.\n  The administration's effort to build a new class of nuclear weapon is \nonly further evidence of their reckless nuclear policy.\n  We have studied this issue long enough. It is ridiculous for the \nadministration to try to keep this program going, and it could be \nsuicidal for the Nation and for our troops. While the administration \nstudies a weapon that will never work and may never be used, it has \ntaken its eye off the true danger: terrorists with weapons of mass \ndestruction here at home in our subways and our train stations.\n  Protecting our Nation should be the administration's No. 1 priority \nand, sadly, they have not learned that lesson from 9/11. The alarm bell \nthat went\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\noff on September 11, 2001, is still ringing loudly. It rang in London \nearlier this month and again yesterday. It rang in Madrid last year. \nAnd it has been ringing in Turkey, Indonesia, Morocco, Kenya, and \nelsewhere around the world in the nearly 4 years since the tragedy of \n9/11.\n  In our Nation's Capital, the alarm bell continues to sound, but the \nadministration has been inexcusably slow in heeding its warning.\n  Our amendment will better protect our Nation's Capital from a \nterrorist attack. It provides urgently needed funds to the Washington, \nDC, National Guard to make up for the shortfalls they face in equipment \nand training.\n  U.S. officials plainly state that al-Qaida and other terrorist groups \nare determined to strike the United States again. And we all know that \nour Nation's Capital is a prime target.\n  On July 10, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said that \n``the desire and the capability'' are there for another terrorist \nattack in America.\n  The former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, ADM James Loy, told \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee on February 16:\n\n       We believe that attacking the homeland remains at the top \n     of al-Qaida's operational priority list . . . We believe that \n     their intent remains strong for attempting another major \n     operation here.\n\n  He says:\n\n       The probability of an attack is assessed to be high. . . .\n\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller told the Intelligence Committee on \nFebruary 16:\n\n       The threat posed by international terrorism, and in \n     particular from al-Qaida and related groups, continues to be \n     the gravest we face . . .\n\n  Despite these serious and terrifying threats, the DC National Guard, \nwhich provides an indispensable role in responding to terrorist \nattacks, has long received inadequate funding.\n  In a terrorist attack, the DC National Guard will be mobilized to \nassist in evacuation efforts, provide security at the attack site, and \nassist in mass casualty care. Mayor Williams and the city council \nrealize the vulnerability to such attacks and the potentially \ncatastrophic consequences if terrorists attack a train carrying \nhazardous material.\n  According to a RAND analysis on terrorism and railroad security, 40 \npercent of freight being carried from city to city across the country, \nincluding half of the Nation's hazardous material, is moved by rail. In \n2003 alone, 11,000 railroad cars containing hazardous material passed \nthrough Washington, DC.\n  We believe the administration's position in supporting the \ndevelopment of a new nuclear weapon system is misguided. It is not \nbased on sound science. And there is a recognition that they do not \nhave their priorities straight. We have learned the lesson of this past \nweek, that what we have to do is expand our attention in terms of the \nhomeland security issue. That has to be our focus, and we learned that \nagain this morning in London.\n  Why the administration insists that they think our national security \nis going to be enhanced and expanded by building a new system makes no \nsense at all.\n  A final point. There are those who will say this is just a study; we \nought to be able to study; we ought to be able to study what progress \ncan be developed in terms of the shape of our warheads and the building \nmaterials that are necessary to make it more effective; we live in a \ndangerous world. All of which is true, we ought to be able to have a \nstudy, but that is not what this is about.\n  As I have mentioned, the opposition, by and large, will say this is \njust a study. Then we will have to come back to Congress and get the \napproval.\n  See what the intention of this administration is. ``Department of \nEnergy, 2005 Congressional Budget Request, National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, Office of the Administrator, Weapons Activities.'' Open \nthis to page 63. There it is.\n  They talk about what is going to be the request over the period of \nthese next 5 years, and it is $484 million. That is not a study. That \nis the development of a weapons system. Those resources could be more \neffectively used providing security at home, working through homeland \nsecurity, than developing a new weapons system which will make it more \ncomplicated and more difficult for the United States to be the leader \nin the world, which we have been under Republican and Democratic \nPresidents since 1962, in reducing the number of countries that have \ndangerous nuclear weapons. We should stay the course. That has been a \nwise judgment and decision by Republican and Democratic Presidents. We \nshould not be about the business of developing new nuclear weapons, \nwhich is going to upset that whole movement and make this country less \nsecure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to pick up on my \ndistinguished colleague's last point with regard to the projected \nbudget cycle as it relates to this program. In fairness, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts should point out that while \nthat document outlines a proposal for a program, Congress carefully has \nenacted the checks and balances such that every step of the way that \nprogram has to be reviewed by the Congress, authorized, and \nappropriated. Those are the types of checks and balances that should be \naccorded a program of this significance.\n  I point out, and I read from the conference report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, the requirement for \nspecific authorization of Congress for commencement of engineering \ndevelopment phase and subsequent phase of the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator, section 3117 of the law, the Senate amendment contained in \nprovision 3135 that would require the Secretary of Energy to obtain \nspecific authorization from Congress to commence development \nengineering phase of the nuclear weapons development process or any \nsubsequent phase of a robust nuclear earth penetrator weapon.\n  So I assure my colleagues, I assure the American public, Congress is \ncarefully monitoring each step of this proposed program.\n  My good friend from Massachusetts pointed out about the military \nrequirements. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in appearing \nbefore Congress, established the military requirement. Senators on the \nother side of this debate have argued there is no military requirement, \nas did my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts. Congress should \nnot be funding, he has argued. This is a case of getting so involved in \ntechnology that we lose sight of the purpose behind the words.\n  I think it is extremely important that the record of this debate \nreflect the following: In an appearance before the House Armed Services \nCommittee in February of this calendar year, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, General Myers, addressed the following question:\n\n       Is there a military requirement for RNEP?\n\n  General Myers answered the question as follows:\n\n       Our combatant commander that is charged by this nation to \n     worry about countering the kind of targets, deeply buried \n     targets, certainly thinks there's a need for this study. And \n     General Cartwright has said such. I think that. I think the \n     Joint Chiefs think that. And so, the study is just that. It's \n     not a commitment to go forward with a system; it's just to \n     see if it's feasible.\n\n  It is just to see whether the technology of the United States can \ntake an existing warhead. There was some inference that we are \nincreasing the stockpile. It is very important to recognize we are \nsimply performing tests and evaluation on existing warheads to \ndetermine whether they can be reconfigured to achieve the mission of \npenetrating the earth to certain depths, depending on the consistency \nof the soil and the above earth, and render less effective, if not \ndestroy, a potential situation beneath the earth, which definitely \nchallenges the security of this Nation and the world. It is as simple \nas that.\n  So this whole debate is about whether a modest sum of money can be \ncontinued to be applied to a program to determine a feasibility study. \nDepending on the outcome, the Congress comes back in and then \nestablishes whether the facts justify, as well as the threat situation, \nas well as the military needs, the next step of a program that would \ntake some several years to evolve and produce a weapon.\n  General Myers continued:\n\n       So we can argue over the definition of a ``military \n     requirement'' and when a ``military requirement'' is \n     established. We can\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n     argue over when in the study of a concept--which is what we \n     are talking about here--when should the requirement be \n     established.\n       We can argue over definitions or we can listen to the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Commander of Strategic \n     Command, who advise the Congress that it is in the interest \n     of the United States to complete the feasibility study.\n\n  Somewhat regrettably, over the past 24 hours we have had a lot of \nback and forth about time consumed on this, that and one of the other \nthings. I tend to be very indulging in the fact that the Senate is an \nunusual body and there is the right to discuss whatever a Senator \nwishes. But just 3 weeks ago we had this exact amendment before this \nbody, except for one change. Senator Feinstein had put the funds which \nwould be resulting from a cancellation towards the public debt, a \nlaudable purpose. It has nothing to do with the military requirements, \nnothing to do with anything about the weapon. Senator Kennedy made one \nsmall change: Let us take it from the public debt and give it to the DC \nNational Guard.\n  Well, I can understand how the DC National Guard is brought into a \nclear focus in its responsibilities given the worldwide events of \nrecent times. I am not unmindful of those situations. But if there is a \nneed for funding for the D.C. National Guard, let it be brought forth \nindependently. It should not be a predicate or a basis for making a \nmajor decision as to whether to go forward on this important research \nprogram and study.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, if there is a problem with the D.C. \nNational Guard, bring it to the attention of the managers. We will be \non this bill for a few days. We have time. We will take a look at it.\n  I am mindful of what occurred here last night and what occurred here \nagain this morning about how we are just grinding our wheels and not \nbeing productive. This same identical amendment was rejected by the \nSenate 3 weeks ago in a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment \ndealing with the robust nuclear earth penetrator, or RNEP. This issue \nhas been discussed and debated at length many times. In fact, my \nimpression was that we had come at least legislatively to a conclusion. \nThe conclusion was that this was not a weapons system that would \nmaterially aid our ability to advance national security purposes of the \nUnited States.\n  In the fiscal year 2003 budget request, the Department of Energy \nsought $15 million to fund the first year of what was to be a 3-year, \n$45 million study to determine the feasibility of using one of two \nexisting large nuclear weapons as a robust nuclear earth penetrator.\n  They couched it in terms of a study. There is some discussion about \nrequirements and studies. My impression is that a requirement is a \nformal decision made by the Department of Defense through elaborate \nprocedures. With respect to the particular nuclear penetrator to attack \ndeeply buried targets, I do not believe there is a formal requirement. \nThere is a general requirement to hold at risk hard, deeply buried \ntargets, but there are many different variations that could be applied \nto that, and I do not believe the Department of Defense has yet come to \na conclusion, a requirement, that this mission can only be undertaken \nby a robust nuclear penetrator.\n  Nevertheless, early on, several years ago the Department of Energy's \nbudget called for studies. Congress authorized and appropriated the $15 \nmillion for the first phase of this study by the Department of Energy, \nbut DOE was not to begin this work until it submitted a report setting \nforth requirements for an RNEP and the target types that RNEP was \ndesigned to hold at risk. DOE proposed their response in April of 2003, \nand the funds were released to begin again this study. Once again, DOE \ninsisted that this was just a study. There was no decision to begin the \nprocess of development and production that would lead to a weapon.\n  The following fiscal year 2004, DOE again sought $15 million for the \nRNEP, but now Congress had become, I think rightfully, a little \nskeptical of the technology, of the efficacy of this proposed weapon, \nto do what it was intended to do, and as a result, only $7.5 million \nwas appropriated. DOE took the reduced funding and said: Still, this is \njust a study. We just want to look at this concept. We study lots of \nconcepts. We certainly cannot inhibit the intellectual inquiry when it \ncomes to an issue of so much importance to our national security.\n  Now, in the 2005 budget request, after 2 years of various requests, \nthe true nature of the RNEP proposal is becoming much clearer. It does \nnot appear today to be just a study. DOE sought $27.5 million for RNEP \nin the 2005 budget request. In addition, DOE included the RNEP in its \n5-year budget report demonstrating that the real plan was to continue \nwith the RNEP project through the next 5 years through the development \nstage and just up to the point at which production would begin.\n  Now it is no longer just a study. In fact, DOE is talking about \nalmost $500 million over the next several years to get ready to build \nan RNEP. The cost of the feasibility study has also increased \ndramatically from the initial $45 million--$15 million a year for 3 \nyears--to now $145 million. If the study is increasing from $45 million \nto $145 million, if that same progression is applied to development, \nthen right now we are talking about almost a billion dollars to get to \nthe point of development and production for this RNEP.\n  Finally, though, I think Congress had its fill with the study that \nturned out to be a stalking horse for a production program, and in the \nfiscal year 2005 budget cycle denied funding. I applaud particularly \nour colleagues in the other body who were very much involved in this \ndecision on a bipartisan basis and decided that this program was not \nworth the investment; that it was not a study; that if it was a true \nstudy it could have been concluded and the results could have been \nprovided to decisionmakers for a more thoughtful review of this aspect \nof national security.\n  The administration just did not get the message. So in 2006, this \nbudget request, DOE requested $4 million to start the RNEP feasibility \nstudy again, and $14 million will be needed in fiscal year 2007 to \nfinish the study.\n  It should be apparent right now, this is not about a study. This is \nabout developing a weapons system to hold hard and deeply buried \ntargets at risk. The National Academy of Sciences conducted their own \nstudy to look at the feasibility of doing this and the usefulness of \nthis type of weapons system, at the request of the Armed Services \nCommittee. Their study sheds a great deal of light on the practical \nimplications of this weapons system.\n  DOE says the RNEP project is to look at the feasibility of using a \nbomb with a small nuclear yield to target hard and deeply buried \ntargets with minimal collateral damage on the surface and minimal \nfallout. That would be a very important development, if it were \nfeasible. But the Academy points out in their study, and makes it \nclear, that to really hold hard and deeply buried targets at risk the \nRNEP would have to be very large and would not be contained. This is \nabout physics, I think, more than it is about wishful thinking. The \nphysics of the problem suggests if you really want to destroy that \ntarget you can't use a small nuclear charge. You would have to use a \nrather considerable one.\n  Therefore, the DOE is considering modifying an existing large-yield \nnuclear weapon, the B-83, to be a nuclear penetrator. The B-83 nuclear \nbomb has a 1-megaton yield. That is explosive power equivalent to 1 \nmillion tons of TNT, hardly a small, discrete weapon. The full megaton \nyield of the B-83 would be needed to hold at risk a target buried 900 \nfeet below the surface--because of engineering progress, you \neffectively can burrow that far down and put facilities or intelligence \ncenters or other critical military installations at that depth. But not \nonly would the fallout not be contained after the detonation of this \nlarge a weapon, the resulting radioactive debris that the B-83 would \nput in the atmosphere would make the fallout worse. You would be \nsending a charge down into the earth, exploding the earth, blowing it \nup into the atmosphere and spreading the fallout. There would be \nsubstantial casualties if it were used, and the fallout would spread \nfor hundreds of miles.\n  The National Academy of Sciences study makes it clear that in a \npopulated area, millions of people would be killed and injured.\n  Let me give sort of a rough comparison of the effects of the B-83 \nsystem. It\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\nhas yields ranging up to 1 megaton; that is 1 million tons of TNT. The \nbomb we dropped on Hiroshima was 14 kilotons. It resulted in the death \nof 140,000 people. The Nagasaki bomb was 21 kilotons; 73,000 people \ndied. The yield of the B-83 bomb is 71 times larger than that used at \nHiroshima and 47 times larger than Nagasaki. That would cause \nincredible damage and casualties.\n  In a practical sense, if you are striking a critical installation, \nmost likely that installation is close enough to either an urban area \nor close enough to other key terrain that a military commander would \nhave to think twice about dropping a nuclear bomb on such a target. The \nreality is we could not operate in that area for years, because of \nfallout, because of damage. If your goal were to ultimately destroy and \noccupy an opposing foe, why would you essentially create a situation \nwhere you could not even operate in the area?\n  The other thing about this whole approach to the RNEP is it fails to \nrecognize that we have precision conventional weapons that may not be \nable to reach down 900 feet, but certainly these weapons can be used to \ndeal devastating blows to the communication networks that serve these \nfacilities and to the entrances. Eventually there has to be someplace \nwhere you go into these tunnels. Those facilities, if they can be \nidentified, can be shut off by conventional munitions. The goal is to \nneutralize the target, and that can be done, I think, more readily by \nconventional weapons, particularly conventional precision weapons. So \nthe need for this system on a practical basis is not at all compelling \nto me, and I do not believe it is compelling to the more thoughtful \npeople in the military, those who are thinking about these types of \nsituations.\n  There is another factor, too. Again, the presumption is that we are \ngoing to have a nuclear device that we are going to use to take out a \ndeeply buried target, which could be in a circumstance where we would \nbe contemplating the first use of a nuclear weapon against one of these \ntargets. We have to be very sure that we have the kind of intelligence \nthat will support such extraordinary use of military power. If we \nreflect back on Operation Iraqi Freedom, we thought there were nuclear \nweapons--some people did. We thought there were chemical weapons and \nthought there were biological weapons. Secretary Powell was before the \nUnited Nations talking about these mobile biological vans.\n  The reality is our intelligence was very poor; certainly not \nsufficient, in my view, to justify the use of a nuclear weapon like \nthis. So there is a further complication about ever using one of these \nweapons; and that is, would we have the intelligence to support, \nparticularly, the first use of a nuclear weapon to take out a target \nlike this?\n  We do not need to spend $1 billion to develop to the point of \nproduction an RNEP. I think our colleagues in the House, on a \nbipartisan basis, figured this out last year. We should be equally \nastute and adroit. We have conventional precision weapons that can deal \nlethal blows to these types of installations. I think we should not \ncontemplate using nuclear weapons, such weapons as the B-83, which \nwould yield vast areas of a particular country literally uninhabitable \nfor months if not years. Also, by the way--which we found from our \nadversaries, particularly from our adversaries in Iraq--they are fairly \nastute about trying to counteract our weapons with their tactics. If \nyou were someone who was afraid that the United States might have such \na weapon like an RNEP and use it against you, I think there would be a \nstrong temptation to put that deeply buried target underneath a city, \nunderneath a historic or religious site, so that our choices would be \nfurther complicated by the fact that we would be delivering a nuclear \ndevice in an area where there could be significant population or \nsignificant reasons to avoid the detonation of a nuclear bomb.\n  I think this funding is not appropriate. I join Senator Kennedy in \nurging that we move to drop it. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nKennedy amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. We \nwould disagree on this, but he is a skilled person in the defense of \nour country, and I respect his comments.\n  Three weeks ago, this Senate voted 53 to 43 on this amendment. I am \nglad we are having this debate. Some have said there is not enough time \nto have a debate on these issues, to bring up and highlight points that \nthe other side may want to raise. But we just voted on it 3 weeks ago. \nWe voted on this twice last year. This amendment to strike this \nlanguage was defeated; the language was kept in the bill. \nOverwhelmingly, the Senate has maintained its view that a study of this \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator is valid and needed and the Defense \nDepartment and the Energy Department have certified to that and we \nought to go forward with it. But it is perfectly legitimate that we \ntalk about it.\n  I would just say this for emphasis, to follow up on Chairman Warner's \ncomments: The way this language is placed in this legislation, it \nmandates explicitly that the Department of Energy or Department of \nDefense cannot go forward to commence development engineering without \nthe specific approval of Congress.\n  This robust nuclear earth penetrator issue began being discussed by \nthe military in 1985, and when the need was recognized, it was \nsupported by the Clinton administration Defense and Energy Departments. \nSecretary O'Leary specifically supported this. There were no \nlimitations of the kind I just mentioned in the language that came \nforward during the Clinton administration to decide to conduct this \nstudy. But now we are putting that in there to allay the concerns that \nany might have, that somehow authorizing a study would result in \ndevelopment and deployment of a weapons system. We know that cannot \nhappen without Congress's approval, but this really clamps it down to \nsay there would have to be an affirmative legislative act by Congress \nbefore the Energy Department could go forward with developing any such \nweapon as this.\n  I think that ought to allay the concerns. I will suggest that is why \nthere has been so much support for it on a bipartisan basis.\n  A couple of years ago, Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote Chairman \nWarner in support of the RNEP. He asked us to fund a feasibility and \ncost study of it, and noted that:\n\n       I do not believe that these legislative steps will \n     complicate our ongoing efforts with North Korea, inasmuch as \n     the work was funded and authorized in last year's Defense \n     bill. I believe that North Korea has already factored RNEP \n     into its calculations. It is important for you to work on \n     these issues and please do not hesitate to call on me. . . .\n\n  Secretary Powell supported it and said it basically furthered our \nforeign policy. So, again, this would be a multiyear feasibility study, \nand we are talking about $4 million being spent on it. In the scheme of \nour huge budget, I would say that is not excessive.\n  Suggestions have been made that somehow this indicates that we are \nindifferent to nuclear weapons, the powers that they contain, the \ndanger that they represent, and that somehow this administration is not \nsensitive to the need to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons in the \nworld. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Let me mention a few things about what this Nation is doing with \nregard to its nuclear arsenal. We have already done more than any other \nnation in the world to reduce our nuclear arsenal. We are committed to \nhuge reductions in our nuclear weapons. In the last 15 years, the \nnumber of U.S. deployed strategic warheads has declined from 10,000 to \nless than 6,000. Under the treaty we signed, the Moscow Treaty, we will \nreduce our strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by \n2012--from over 10,000. That is a huge reduction. In fact, we have \nalready dismantled more than 13,000 nuclear weapons since 1988 and \neliminated nearly 90 percent of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n  (Mr. Allard assumed the Chair.)\n  We have not produced high enriched uranium for weapons since 1964, \nnor plutonium for weapons since 1988. In fact, we are the only nuclear \npower in the world that has no capability at this moment to produce \nnuclear weapons. We are simply relying on our old stockpile, and that \nis a matter that a number of people are concerned about, but it is \ntrue.\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\n  As Senator Allard, now I see is the Presiding Officer, who last year \nchaired the strategic subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee that \ndeals with these issues, and I now chair that strategic subcommittee--\nhas gone on to bigger and better things--but it is an important \nsubcommittee and it deals with the strategic defense of America. We are \nmoving to incredible reductions in our nuclear weapons, but we are \ngoing to keep something like 2,000. How does it threaten the world in \npeace and make us a warmonger, if we can design and make a few of those \nweapons capable of being effective against hardened targets?\n  Let's be realistic. People say, ``This is a new weapon. This is a new \nweapon,'' even when we get to the bottom, 2,000 or more nuclear \nweapons. What is wrong if we have figured out a way to use a targeted \nnuclear weapon to deal with a hardened site? It makes a lot of sense. \nIt certainly does not indicate we are in a warmongering mode.\n  I have a number of other things I would say on this subject. I see \nthe Senator from California is here. I am pleased to yield the floor. I \nassume the Senator from California is talking on Armed Services issues?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I also thank the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  I wish to speak on the bill. There is probably no one in the Senate I \nhave greater respect for than the chairman of the Committee on Armed \nServices. He certainly does know his material. He certainly has put in \nthe years. He certainly has done the work.\n  I very profoundly disagree with what he has said with respect to the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator. We have heard this is only a study, \nthat it is minor in scope, that we have debated this before. It is \ncertainly true, we have debated this before. We debated it before \nbecause we feel strongly about this issue. We have debated it before \nbecause the Congress eliminated the money last year. We have debated it \nbefore because we have a strong passion and belief that this is the \nwrong way for our Nation to go. The fact that we have debated this \nissue before--Senator Kennedy, Senator Reed, Senator Levin, myself--\ndoes not in any way, shape, or form downgrade or demean our arguments.\n  Let me discuss this program which is only ``a study.'' Let me discuss \nfor a moment the way this program started out.\n  It started with appropriations for the study of a robust nuclear \nearth penetrator with a 5-year budget projection of $486 million. That \nis how it started.\n  It also coincided with a program called ``advanced concepts \ninitiatives'' which is not in this authorization but which last year \nenvisioned the development of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons of \nunder 5 kilotons, or battlefield nuclear weapons. That is about a third \nthe force that was used at Hiroshima, a 15-kiloton weapon. That is not, \nas I say, in this bill.\n  It started out with a plan to build a Modern Pit Facility which could \nproduce up to 450 new plutonium pits--the pit being the trigger that \ndetonates a nuclear weapon. If you take a good look, you know you do \nnot need up to 450 plutonium pits for replenishment of the existing \nnuclear arsenal. You may need 40 to 60. So if you put forward up to 450 \nplutonium pits, to me it is an indicator that there is a broader \nprogram afoot.\n  Part of this is also an increase of the time to test readiness from 3 \nyears to 18 months. What that says is: Beware, something is going on. \nWe want to be able to resume testing and we do not want to resume \ntesting within the normal 3-year delay, we want to move that up to 18 \nmonths. So, something is cooking.\n  The fact is, no one should doubt this authorization enables the \nreopening of the nuclear door to the creation of a new generation of \nnuclear weapons, in this case, a robust nuclear earth penetrator of 1 \nmegaton. This is a major effort.\n  It is true, we fenced it, as the Senator from Alabama pointed out. \nBefore it goes beyond the engineering stage, it must come back to this \nSenate for approval. But that does not signify that there is not a new \ngeneration of nuclear weapons being studied, researched, advanced, and \nauthorized in this bill, specifically the $4 million for the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator.\n  Our intention is being signaled to the rest of the world. The \nDepartment has been clever in not revealing its hand. No longer does it \nprovide the 5-year cost of this study as it did last year. No longer \ndoes it mention this effort in its statement of administration policy. \nThe statement of administration policies on the House Defense \nAuthorization and House Energy and Water Appropriations bills do not \nmention a robust nuclear earth penetrator. Rather, the attempt was to \ncloak the study in some kind of obfuscation, to divide it between two \nbudgets--Energy and Defense--half, $4 million here, the other $4.5 \nmillion in the other budget, with the hope that if one fails, the other \nwill get through.\n  But nonetheless, this is not minor in scope. The Modern Pit Facility \nwhich could produce up to 450 new plutonium pits is not even being \ndiscussed. There is supposed to be a study that will come back and \nindicate how many pits are necessary to replenish the present nuclear \narsenal. That is not before the Senate. That is in this bill. There is \nno study to indicate we need 450 pits today to refresh the existing \narsenal, particularly when that arsenal is being diminished in size.\n  The intention is clear. Obviously, the way you begin a new nuclear \nweapon program is with a study, research, and engineering. So it is \ntrue we are trying to catch it at the beginning. That is not a bad \nthing. That is a very good thing.\n  The money, as was stated accurately, would go to the DC National \nGuard to enable it to prepare for possible terrorist attacks in the \nNation's Capital. Many think this is a much more realistic use of this \nmoney than a robust nuclear earth penetrator, especially when the laws \nof physics say it is impossible to drive a missile deep enough in the \nEarth to prevent the spewing of hundreds of millions of cubic yards of \nradioactive waste and cause the death of hundreds of thousands, if not \nmillions of people.\n  It is true, we had this debate 3 weeks ago on the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. That was the other half of this request. We were \nnot successful with that vote. We said we would be back to debate this \nissue. And we will be back again and again and again until we are able \nto defeat this effort. It is morally wrong and I believe it jeopardizes \nthe national security of our country.\n  The House has had the good sense to decisively eliminate funding for \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator, first under the leadership of \nRepresentative David Hobson, the chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee. That bill eliminated the $4 million for \nthe Department of Energy portion of the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator. Second, the House fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations \nbill limits research for a bunker buster to a conventional program. \nFinally, during its mark of the 2006 Defense authorization bill--that \nis the companion to the bill we are talking about this morning--the \nHouse Armed Services Committee eliminated all of the Department of \nEnergy funding for the robust nuclear earth penetrator and transferred \nthe $4 million to the Air Force budget for work on a conventional \nnonnuclear version. So there is a growing body of thought in three \nspecific efforts successfully concluded by the House of Representatives \nthat says we should not proceed with this program.\n  Let me recap: The House Energy and Water appropriations bill \neliminates $4 million. The House 2006 Defense appropriations bill \nlimits research to a conventional program. And finally, the House Armed \nServices Committee eliminated all of the Department of Energy funding \nfor the nuclear earth penetrator and transferred it to work on a \nconventional nonnuclear version.\n  It will be a very hot conference committee on these items. But the \nHouse has taken the action in three ways rather completely.\n  We are not out on a limb. This is not some whim of a small faction of \nMembers of the Senate. We represent a majority of the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives. I believe we represent a majority of thinking \nof the American people. Polls have been done which\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nclearly show a bulk of the American people are, in fact, not in support \nof commencing this research, of doing this study.\n  Let me give a fact sheet of a 2004 poll brought to my attention by \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists. It found most Americans do not \nsupport the development of new nuclear weapons by the United States. A \nsubstantial majority of Americans would oppose funding for the nuclear \nbunker buster. Sixty-five percent of Americans say there is no need for \nthe United States to develop new types of nuclear weapons. They know \nwhat the Senator from Rhode Island pointed out, that there are \nconventional bunker busters that should be developed. They know the key \nto this is good intelligence as to vent holes, ingress, egress areas, \nintelligence which can lead us to ferret out a nuclear bunker buster. \nSixty-three percent found convincing the argument that the United \nStates would be setting a bad example by starting to develop new types \nof nuclear weapons, and a large majority opposes using nuclear weapons \nfor anything other than a deterrent to prevent other countries from \nusing nuclear weapons. Eighty-one percent oppose the Bush \nadministration's revelation that they would countenance a first use of \nnuclear weapons. Eighty-four percent oppose the United States using \nthreats of nuclear retaliation to attempt a deterrent attack on the \nUnited States with chemical or biological weapons. And 57 percent \nsupport the United States reaffirming a commitment to not use nuclear \nweapons against countries that do not have nuclear weapons as a way of \nencouraging those countries not to acquire or build nuclear weapons.\n  Americans have a clear preference for a much smaller nuclear arsenal. \nBased on this poll, a substantial majority of Americans opposes the \nstudy into the nuclear bunker buster. These findings also show \nsubstantial distaste for nuclear weapons in general, with a clear \npreference for a small nuclear arsenal designed only as a deterrent to \nprevent other countries from using nuclear weapons.\n  I ask unanimous consent this fact sheet from the Union of Concerned \nScientists be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSupport Amendments to the Energy & Water Appropriations Bill To Prevent \n                          New Nuclear Weapons\n\n       The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) is a proposed \n     new nuclear weapon intended to burrow a few meters into rock \n     or concrete before exploding, thus generating a powerful \n     underground shock wave. Its intended targets are deeply \n     buried command bunkers or underground storage sites \n     containing chemical or biological agents.\n       Technical realities:\n       According to several recent scientific studies, RNEP would \n     have limited effectiveness at destroying underground targets \n     and would have substantial drawbacks. Specifically. . .\n       RNEP would produce tremendous radioactive fallout\n       RNEP could kill millions of people\n       RNEP would not be effective at destroying chemical or \n     biological agents\n       RNEP would not be effective at destroying deep or widely \n     separated bunkers.\n\n                  The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator\n\n       The Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP): RNEP is a \n     nuclear weapon that would burrow a few meters into the ground \n     before exploding and thus generate a powerful underground \n     shock wave. Its hypothetical targets are deeply buried \n     command bunkers or underground storage sites containing \n     chemical or biological agents.\n       The RNEP design: Weapons designers at Lawrence Livermore \n     National Laboratory intend to use an existing high-yield \n     nuclear warhead--the 1.2-megaton B83 nuclear bomb--in a \n     longer, stronger and heavier bomb casing. The B83 is the \n     largest nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal, and nearly 100 \n     times more powerful than the nuclear bomb used on Hiroshima.\n       Technicai realities: According to several recent scientific \n     studies, RNEP would not be effective at destroying many \n     underground targets, and its use could result in the death of \n     millions of people.\n       RNEP would produce tremendous radioactive fallout: A \n     nuclear earth penetrator cannot penetrate deep enough to \n     contain the nuclear fallout. Even the strongest casing will \n     crush itself by the time it penetrates 10-30 feet into rock \n     or concrete. For comparison, even a one-kiloton nuclear \n     warhead (less than 1/10th as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb) \n     must be buried at least 200-300 feet to contain its \n     radioactive fallout. The high yield RNEP will produce \n     tremendous fallout that will drift for more than a thousand \n     miles downwind. As, Linton Brooks, the head of the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration told Congress in April, the \n     laws of physics will [never allow a bomb to penetrate] far \n     enough to trap all fallout. This is a nuclear weapon that is \n     going to be hugely destructive over a large area.''\n       RNEP could kill millions of people: A simulation of RNEP \n     used against the Esfahan nuclear facility in Iran, using the \n     software developed for the Pentagon, showed that 3 million \n     people would be killed by radiation within 2 weeks of the \n     explosion, and 35 million people in Afghanistan, Pakistan and \n     India would be exposed to increased levels of cancer-causing \n     radiation.\n       RNEP would not be effective at destroying chemical or \n     biological agents: Unless the weapon detonates nearly in the \n     same room with the agents, it will not destroy them. Because \n     the United States is unlikely to know the precise location, \n     size and geometry of underground bunkers, a nuclear attack on \n     a storage bunker containing chemical or biological agents \n     would more likely spread those agents into the environment, \n     along with the radioactive fallout.\n       RNEP would not be effective against the deepest or widely \n     separated bunkers. The seismic shock produced by the RNEP \n     could only destroy bunkers to a depth of about a thousand \n     feet. Modern bunkers can be deeper than that, with a widely \n     separated complex of connected rooms and tunnels.\n       There are more effective conventional alternatives to RNEP: \n     Current precision-guided conventional weapons can be used to \n     cut off a bunker's communications, power, and air, \n     effectively keeping the enemy weapons underground and \n     unusable until U.S. forces secure them. Sealing chemical or \n     biological agents underground is far more sensible than \n     trying to blow them up.\n       The RNEP budget: RNEP is not just a feasibility study: \n     DOE's 2005 budget included a five-year projection--totaling \n     $484.7 million--to produce a completed warhead design and \n     begin production engineering by 2009. The FY06 budget request \n     includes $4 million for RNEP and $4.5 million to modify the \n     B-2 bomber to carry RNEP. Last year, David Hobson, Republican \n     chair of the House Appropriations Energy and Water \n     Development Subcommittee, zeroed out FY05 funding for the \n     program, stating, ``we cannot advocate for nuclear \n     nonproliferation around the globe, while pursuing more usable \n     nuclear weapons options here at home.''\n\n                  Americans Oppose New Nuclear Weapons\n\n       A 2004 poll found that most Americans do not support the \n     development of new nuclear weapons by the United States and \n     strongly oppose the idea of the United States ever using a \n     nuclear weapon first. As Congress debates funding for the \n     Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP), these results are \n     particularly relevant. Findings from the poll, which was \n     conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes \n     (PIPA), include:\n       A substantial majority of Americans would oppose funding \n     for the RNEP, or ``bunker buster.''\n       65% of Americans say there is no need for the United States \n     to develop new types of nuclear weapons.\n       63% found convincing the argument that the United States \n     would be setting a bad example by starting to develop new \n     types of nuclear weapons.\n       A large majority opposes using nuclear weapons for anything \n     other than a deterrent to prevent other countries from using \n     nuclear weapons.\n       81% oppose the United States ever using nuclear weapons \n     first.\n       84% oppose the United States using threats of nuclear \n     retaliation to attempt to deter an attack on the United \n     States with chemical or biological weapons.\n       57% percent support the United States reaffirming a \n     commitment to not use nuclear weapons against countries that \n     do not have nuclear weapons, as a way of encouraging those \n     countries not to acquire or build nuclear weapons.\n       Americans have a clear preference for a much smaller U.S. \n     nuclear arsenal.\n       100--The median answer for the number of nuclear weapons \n     Americans believe are needed to provide deterrence.\n       6,000--The approximate number of U.S. nuclear weapons, with \n     roughly 2,000 of these maintained on high alert status, ready \n     to be launched in a matter of minutes.\n       Based on this poll, a substantial majority of Americans \n     would oppose research into the RNEP, a new nuclear ``bunker \n     buster'' supported by the Bush administration. These findings \n     also show the U.S. public's distaste for nuclear weapons in \n     general, with a clear preference for a small nuclear arsenal \n     designed only as a deterrent to prevent other countries from \n     using nuclear weapons.\n       These poll results are from ``Public Believes Many \n     Countries Still Secretly Pursuing WMD,'' a media release \n     published by Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) \n     and Knowledge Networks. The poll was conducted with a \n     nationwide sample of 1,311 respondents from March 16-22, \n     2004. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.8%-4.5%, \n     depending on whether the question was administered to all or \n     part of the sample. The release can be found at: http://\nwww.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/WMDpress__04__ 15__04.pdf \n     and the full poll at: http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/WMD/\nWMDreport__04__ 15__04.pdf.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me point out, House Armed Services Committee \nmember Sylvester Raiz stated that the\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nHouse committee took the ``N'' or nuclear out of the robust nuclear \nearth penetrator program.\n  Remember, last year, in this strong statement I have just told you \nabout--in the deletion of funding of the $27.5 million for the earth \npenetrator and the $9 million for advanced concepts that at the time \nincluded a study for the development of the low-yield nuclear weapons--\nRepublicans and Democrats, authorizers and appropriators alike, joined \ntogether to send a clear signal to the administration that the House \nand Senate would not support moving forward with the development of a \nnew generation of nuclear weapons. If you consider this, along with the \nfacts I have just revealed, based on a polling of the American people, \nyou have to wonder why the administration comes back with a new request \nthis year.\n  In April of this year, a group of experts of the National Academies \nof Sciences confirmed what we have long argued--that according to the \nlaws of physics, it is simply not possible for a missile casing on a \nnuclear warhead to survive a thrust into the earth deep enough to take \nout a hard and deeply buried military target without spewing millions \nof tons of radiation into the atmosphere.\n  That is where we are--funding a study that the law of physics says \nwill not work. It is folly to me. And the repercussions are enormous. \nThe National Academies of Sciences study, commissioned by Congress to \nstudy the anticipated health and environmental effects of the nuclear \nearth penetrator, found the following: that current experience and \nempirical predictions indicate that earth-penetrator weapons cannot \npenetrate to depths required for total containment of the effects of a \nnuclear explosion. It also found that in order to destroy hard and \ndeeply buried targets at 200 meters, or 656 feet, you would need a 300-\nkiloton weapon. And in order to destroy a hard and deeply buried target \nat 300 meters--that is 984 feet--you would need a 1-megaton weapon.\n  The point is, the deeper the bunker, the larger the nuclear blast \nmust be, and the greater the amount of nuclear fallout will be.\n  The number of casualties, they find, from an earth-penetrator weapon \ndetonated at a few meters' depth, which is all that can be achieved for \nall practical purposes, is equal to that of a surface burst of the same \nnuclear weapon. Do you know what we are contemplating here, what that \nsurface burst would be? It would be the largest spewing of \nradioactivity in the history of the world. Enormous. If it were used in \nNorth Korea, it would spread to South Korea and Japan. It is \nunthinkable.\n  For attacks near or in densely populated areas using nuclear earth-\npenetrator weapons on hard and deeply buried targets, the number of \ncasualties would range from thousands to more than a million, depending \nprimarily on weapon yield.\n  So once again, the bottom line is that a bunker buster cannot \npenetrate into the earth deep enough to avoid massive casualties, and \nthere would be the spewing of millions of cubic feet of radioactive \nmaterials into the atmosphere. This would result in the deaths of up to \na million people or more if used in densely populated areas.\n  So why are we doing this? What kind of Machiavellian thinking is \nbehind this reopening of the nuclear door?\n  Ambassador Linton Brooks of the National Security Administration \nagrees with these findings. Earlier, in a congressional hearing, \nCongresswoman Ellen Tauscher asked him how deep he thought a bunker \nbuster could go. Here is his answer from the transcript of the House \nhearing. I quote:\n\n     . . . a couple of tens of meters maybe. I mean certainly--I \n     really must apologize for my lack of precision if we in the \n     administration have suggested that it was possible to have a \n     bomb that penetrated far enough to trap all fallout. I don't \n     believe that--I don't believe the laws of physics will ever \n     let that be true.\n\n  And remember, we are talking about a 1-megaton bomb, 71 times the \nsize of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima--71 times bigger than the 15-\nkiloton bomb. The devastation from using such a weapon will be \ncatastrophic.\n  The National Academies of Sciences study is the strongest evidence to \ndate that we should not move forward with this study and that we should \nput a stop to it once and for all. Again, the Senate should listen to \nthe experts and follow the House's lead.\n  So what is the main argument from opponents of this amendment, such \nas Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld? Their argument is: This is \njust a study. Nothing is going to happen. Nobody is going to get the \nidea: Oh, my goodness, the United States is moving in this direction; \nwe better move. North Korea: They are coming after us; we better get \nthere first. India, worried about Pakistan: Let's begin to develop it. \nPakistan, worried about India: Let's do the same thing.\n  I do not believe for a second this is just a study. This is the \nbeginning of a major effort to develop a new generation of nuclear \nweapons, and nobody should think it is anything else but that.\n  This year, the request is $8.5 million. In fiscal year 2007, the \nrequest will increase to $17.5 million, including $14 million for the \nDepartment of Energy and $3.5 million for the Pentagon. And while the \nadministration is silent this year on how much it plans to spend on the \nprogram in future years, we should not forget that last year's budget \nrequest called for spending $486 million on the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator over 5 years. So that part of the plan was revealed. This 5-\nyear figure was omitted this year, and that is deceiving, I believe. \nBut even if you accept the argument that this is just a study, that \ndoes not justify moving forward with this program.\n  First, a study on the development of new nuclear weapons will still \ngreatly undermine our nuclear nonproliferation efforts by telling the \nrest of the world that when it comes to nuclear weapons, do as we say \nand not as we do. That is hypocrisy, pure and simple. How does that \nmake us safer from the prospect of nuclear terror? Answer: It does not.\n\n  In a letter to committee members of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, the Reverend John H. Ricard, bishop of Pensacola-Tallahassee \nand chairman of the Committee on International Policy of the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, stated:\n\n       Nations that see the U.S. expanding and diversifying our \n     nuclear arsenal are encouraged to seek or maintain nuclear \n     deterrents of their own and ignore nonproliferation \n     obligations.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  How will a study of new nuclear weapons help compel North Korea to \nabandon its nuclear program? It will not. It will do exactly the \nopposite. How will a study of new nuclear weapons help convince the \nIranians to respond and give up their own nuclear weapons? Answer: It \nwill not. Just as calling these nations part of the ``axis of evil'' \nhas done nothing but instill in them the desire to develop their own \nnuclear weapons programs. That, in fact, has been exactly the case.\n  In both cases, a study to develop new nuclear weapons, especially \nwhen we already have a robust nuclear arsenal, only makes those weapons \nmore important to those who do not yet have them, such as Iran, or who \nrefuse to give them up, such as North Korea. And the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons only increases the chances of them falling into the \nhands of terrorists who will not be deterred by a nuclear bunker \nbuster.\n  Secondly, a study will not change the conclusions of the National \nAcademies of Sciences report: It is not possible to develop a nuclear \nbunker buster that can burrow deep enough into the earth to contain \nmassive amounts of radioactivity fallout. The inevitable result will be \nthe deaths of up to a million people.\n  So why do we do it? Physics says it cannot be done, and somebody in \nthe Pentagon who does not know word one about physics says it can be. \nWho do I trust? I do not trust the Pentagon, I do trust the Academies \nof Sciences, on this point. This study will not change that simple \nfact. And as Ivan Oelrich of the Federation of American Scientists \npoints out:\n\n       Any nation that can dig under a hundred meters of hard rock \n     can dig under a kilometer of hard rock.\n\n  Our adversaries will only have to build a bunker deeper than 400 \nmeters to avoid the effects of a 1-megaton bomb that is 71 times bigger \nthan Hiroshima. It makes no sense.\n  Finally, a study will not change the fact that we need to improve our \nintelligence capabilities in relation to underground targets. Why \naren't we putting that money into intelligence on\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\nunderground targets, where the vent shafts are, where the aromas come \nup, where ingress, egress, and access is, to pinpoint locations? What \nuse is a nuclear bunker buster if we cannot locate and identify an \nunderground target which, ladies and gentlemen, is today the case?\n  What would have been the consequences if we had used a nuclear bunker \nbuster in Iraq to take out bunkers filled with chemical and biological \nweapons--that did not exist? The fact is, we can improve our \nintelligence capabilities and locate and identify targets. We can use \nconventional weapons with specialized delivery systems to seal off \ntheir vulnerable points, such as air ducts and entrances for personnel \nand equipment.\n  We can also look at conventional bunker busters. Last month, I was \nbriefed by Northrop Grumman on a program they are working on with \nBoeing to develop a conventional bunker buster--the Massive Ordnance \nPenetrator--which is designed to go deeper than any nuclear bunker \nbuster and take out 25 percent of the underground and deeply buried \ntargets. This is a 30,000-pound weapon, 20 feet in length, with 6,000 \npounds of high explosives. It will be delivered in a B-2 or B-52 \nbomber. It can burrow 60 meters in the ground through 5,000 PSI--pounds \nper square inch--of reinforced concrete. It will burrow 8 meters into \nthe ground through 10,000 PSI reinforced concrete.\n  We have already spent $6 million on this program, and design and \nground testing are scheduled to be completed next year. Why are we \ndoing this nuclear bunker buster that cannot be done according to the \nlaw of physics? We should focus on practical programs such as the \nNorthrop Grumman-Boeing program that will put these underground targets \nat risk without reopening the nuclear door.\n  Let me look once again at the policies underlying this request.\n  The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review, which is a white paper put out by \nthe administration--singularly overlooked by this body but read widely \nby the rest of the world--places nuclear weapons as part of the \nstrategic triad, therefore blurring the distinction between the \nconventional and nuclear use. Why do this? One reason: It makes them \neasier to use. It also discussed, for the first time, seven countries \nthat could be targets of U.S. nuclear weapons: Russia, China, Iraq, \nIran, North Korea, Libya, Syria.\n  I did not write this. This is in the Nuclear Posture Review. Other \nnations have seen this. This is foolish.\n  Secondly, National Security Directive-17, which came a few months \nlater, indicates that the United States will engage in a first use of \nnuclear weapons--a historic statement in itself. We have never said we \nwould not engage in a first use. We have never said we would engage in \na first use. And here we say we would engage in a first use to respond \nto a chemical or biological attack.\n  We could have done that in Iraq. What would have happened had we done \nthis? Would a nuclear bunker buster have been used in Iraq? I wonder. \nFortunately, we will never know.\n  My point is, these policies encourage other nations to develop \nsimilar weapons, thereby putting American lives at risk and our \nnational security interests at risk. This isn't the example we should \nset for the rest of the world. Indeed, I believe the United States can \ntake several actions to make better use of our resources and \ndemonstrate our commitment to keeping the world's most dangerous \nweapons out of the world's most dangerous hands.\n  First, we should work to strengthen the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. \nSenator Hagel and I have introduced a sense of the Senate amendment to \nthis bill that calls on parties to the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty to \ninsist on strict compliance with the nonproliferation obligations of \nthe treaty and to undertake effective enforcement actions against \nstates that are in violation of their obligations; to agree to \nestablish more effective controls on sensitive technologies that can be \nused to produce materials for nuclear weapons; to accelerate programs \nto safeguard and eliminate nuclear weapons usable material to the \nhighest standards to prevent access by terrorists or other states; to \nagree that no state may withdraw from the treaty and escape \nresponsibility for prior violations of the treaty or retain access to \ncontrolled materials and equipment acquired for peaceful purposes; and \nto accelerate implementation of the NPT-related disarmament obligations \nand commitments that would, in particular, reduce the world's \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade material.\n  I urge my colleagues and the managers of this bill to support our \namendment.\n  Second, we should expand and accelerate Nunn-Lugar threat reduction \nprograms and provide the necessary resources to improve security and \ntake the rest of the Soviet era nuclear, chemical, and biological \nweapons arsenals and infrastructure out of circulation.\n  Third, we should strengthen and expand the ability of the Department \nof Energy's Global Threat Reduction Initiative to secure and remove \nnuclear weapons-usable materials from vulnerable sites around the \nworld.\n  Last year, Senator Domenici and I sponsored an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act that authorized the \nSecretary of Energy to lead an accelerated, comprehensive, worldwide \neffort to secure, remove, and eliminate the threat by these materials.\n  Finally, as I noted previously, we should improve our intelligence \ncapabilities to locate and identify underground targets. There is a lot \nof improvement needed.\n  In August, we will commemorate the 60th anniversaries of the two uses \nof nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Hiroshima, 140,000 \npeople died. In Nagasaki, 100,000 people lost their lives. Two bombs, \n240,000 people dead. The 1-megaton bomb of the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator study is 71 times bigger than the bomb at Hiroshima. That is \nwhat we are looking at. For shame.\n  What message do we send to the survivors of those attacks and to the \nfriends and families of the victims by moving forward with a study to \ndevelop a nuclear bunker buster of 1 megaton? Let us acknowledge these \nanniversaries and pay tribute to the victims by putting a stop to this \nprogram once and for all. Let us work together on commonsense programs \nthat will make our country safer without reopening the nuclear door.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow the House lead, support this amendment \nand kill this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have talked to the chairman about this. I ask unanimous \nconsent, with the concurrence of the chairman, after Senator Allard has \ncompleted, that the Chair then recognize Senator Salazar, and following \nSenator Salazar, that then Senator Dorgan be recognized. It is a little \nbit out of order because we have been going back and forth, but in \nterms of time, I think it may be a fair apportionment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I would like to amend it \nto enable the distinguished Senator from Alabama, whose subcommittee \nhas jurisdiction over at least one of the amendments of Senator Allard, \nbe permitted to use such time as he desires in the colloquy between the \nthree Senators.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would ask Senator Sessions if he could give us an idea \nas to about how long he would be so Senator Dorgan could plan his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It would be no more than 5 minutes--less than that, \nprobably.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could we then amend the unanimous consent request to \ninclude Senator Sessions immediately following Senator Salazar, then it \nwould go to Senator Dorgan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to strike the \n$4 million appropriation for the robust nuclear earth penetrator \ncommonly known as RNEP. There are some comments made in the debate \ntoday to which I would like to add my perspective because they were \nbasically incorrect.\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\n  We have been debating this amendment for the past 3 years. And we \nhave been passing this provision in the Senate, defeating any \namendments to take it out of legislation. In all the testimony I have \nhad over the past 3 years as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, \nwhich my distinguished colleague from Alabama now chairs, never once \nhas anybody, in testifying before that committee, said that there will \nnot be any nuclear fallout. Not once have they indicated that they felt \nthis was going to lead us into an arms race.\n  Here is what we have done. This is what they have talked about, \ntaking some of the nuclear warheads that we now have in our nuclear \narsenal and redesigning those in a way in which they might be more \neffective, if we happen to have a deep bunker that is posing a threat \nto Americans, whether American soldiers or American citizens.\n  We need to have a study. That is what this provision is all about. \nWhat we are talking about is reducing the amount of collateral damage. \nThat means reducing the amount of, perhaps, nuclear fallout or perhaps \nreducing the blast range because you take all that energy and you drive \nit down into the ground instead of driving it in a horizontal \ndirection, which obviously means for collateral damage. They are \ntalking about focusing the study on the B-83 warhead which is part of \nour arsenal today. That is all we are talking about, a study. We are \ngoing to be looking at the current arsenal makeup of weapons that we \nhave to modify them to reduce collateral damage. I think that is a \ncommendable goal. I think it warrants the support of the Members of the \nSenate.\n  This bill includes funding of $4 million to continue the Air Force-\nled feasibility study. This is a study on the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator. This is not a new issue for Congress to consider. In both \nthe defense authorization and the Energy and Water appropriations \nbills, amendments have been offered to cut all funding for the robust \nnuclear earth penetrator. These amendments have been defeated on \nmultiple occasions.\n  The purpose of the RNEP feasibility study is to determine if an \nexisting nuclear weapon can be modified to penetrate into hard rock in \norder to destroy a deeply buried target that could be hiding weapons of \nmass destruction or command and control assets. The Department of \nEnergy has modified nuclear weapons in the past to modernize their \nsafety and security and reliability aspects. We have also modified \nexisting nuclear weapons to meet our new military requirements. Under \nthe Clinton administration, we modified the B-61 so it could penetrate \nfrozen soils. The RNEP feasibility study is narrowly focused to \ndetermine whether the B-83 warhead can be modified to penetrate hard \nrock or reinforced underground facilities.\n  Funding research on options, both nuclear and conventional, for \nattacking such targets is a responsible step for our country to take. \nAs many as 70 nations are developing or have built hardened and deeply \nburied targets to protect command and communications and weapons of \nmass destruction production and storage assets. Of that number, a \nnumber of nations have facilities that are sufficiently hard and deep \nenough that we cannot destroy most of them with our conventional \nweapons. Some of them are so sophisticated that they are beyond the \ncurrent U.S. nuclear weapons capability.\n  I believe it is prudent and imperative that we fund this study. I \nemphasize again, this is a study on the potential capabilities to \naddress this growing category of threat.\n  Should the Department of Energy determine, through this study, that \nthe robust nuclear earth penetrator can meet the requirements to hold a \nhard and deeply buried target at risk, the Department still could not \nproceed to full-scale weapon development, production or deployment \nwithout an authorization and appropriation from Congress. Let me repeat \nthat. The Department of Energy cannot go ahead, beyond this study, \nwithout the express authorization or appropriation from Congress.\n  Frankly, we should allow our weapons experts to determine if the \nrobust nuclear earth penetrator could destroy hardened and deeply \nburied targets. That is the purpose of the study.

Madam President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 1419 and \nthe incredible achievements of the workers at the Department of \nEnergy's Rocky Flats environmental technology site and to offer an \namendment on behalf of these workers. Rocky Flats is located a few \nmiles northwest of Denver, CO. For four decades, this facility was the \nDepartment of Energy's dedicated site for manufacturing plutonium pits \nfor the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.\n  This highly classified production facility was run by over 8,000 \nColoradans who worked day and night for most of the Cold War and used \nsome of the most dangerous substances known to man, including \nplutonium, beryllium, and uranium. The workers at Rocky Flats were \ndevoted to their jobs and believed in their mission. They risked their \nlives on a daily basis and did so with the knowledge that their efforts \nwere contributing to the security of our Nation. They are heroes of the \nCold War and have earned our respect, admiration, and our appreciation.\n  When plutonium pit production ended in 1991, it was unclear what role \nthese workers would play in the cleanup of Rocky Flats. They could have \nwalked away from the job. They had performed their duty with excellence \nfor nearly 40 years. No one could ask them to do more. Yet the workers \nat Rocky Flats were not ready to quit. They saw a new challenge in \nfront of them--a challenge they could not walk away from. They knew the \ncleanup would be difficult and very dangerous, but they were not \ndeterred.\n  These workers stayed and, over the next decade, they performed \nmagnificently. Their task was anything but simple. Five large plutonium \nprocessing facilities encompassing over a million square feet were \nhighly contaminated with dangerous radioactive material. The \ncontamination was so severe that these buildings were ranked among the \ntop 10 contaminated facilities in the DOE nuclear weapons complex. \nBuilding No. 771, in particular, was even singled out by the national \nmedia as ``the most dangerous building in America.''\n  The cleaning and eventual demolishing of these buildings was just the \nbeginning. Hundreds of vials of contaminated process piping interlaced \nthe complex. More than a dozen infinity rooms were so contaminated that \nthey had been sealed and abandoned--some for as long as 30 years. \nHundreds of tons of plutonium compound, uranium byproducts, and other \nradioactive and toxic residues remained at Rocky Flats.\n  Yet the workers at Rocky Flats were not deterred. They had built \ncomponents using some of the most dangerous substances the world has \never known. Now they were ready to tackle one of the most dangerous \ncleanup projects ever contemplated.\n  In 1992, Rocky Flats was transferred to the DOE's environmental \nmanagement program for the purpose of cleaning up the contamination and \nwaste. Few knew where to begin. The unprecedented size and magnitude of \nthe project was simply daunting. It took years to just figure out the \nbest approach to the project. The expected cost was also staggering. In \n1995, the cleanup was predicted to cost upward of $35 billion and to \ntake 70 years to complete.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1996, the cleanup of Rocky Flats had \nbeen dragging out for nearly 4 years with little progress. Tons of \nweapons-grade plutonium remained and most buildings at Rocky Flats had \nnot been touched. More than 2 million 55-gallon drums of waste needed \nto be removed.\n  I found this lack of progress simply unacceptable. The safety of the \npeople of Colorado was at risk and the American taxpayer could ill \nafford to allow this project to drag on indefinitely. At my urging, the \nDOE, in 2000, finally put the resources into accelerating the cleanup \nof Rocky Flats. Under the leadership of then-Under Secretary Bob Card, \nand then-Assistant Secretary Jesse Roberson, the DOE took the \nunprecedented step of rethinking its approach to the cleanup. These \ncreative leaders challenged the lead contractor, CH2M HILL, and the \nworkers at Rocky Flats to move much more aggressively. They were given \nthe seemingly impossible mission of completing the cleanup of the \nmassive contamination at Rocky Flats by 2007, at a cost of less than $7 \nbillion.\n\n  Most scoffed at this approach. They believed there would be \nconsiderable cost overruns and schedule delays. They didn't think CH2M \nHILL could effectively execute this kind of contract. Most of all, they \ndoubted the commitment of the workers at Rocky Flats. They could not \nfathom why these workers would work themselves out of a job. Even the \nGAO doubted the ability of the workers at Rocky Flats to ship massive \nquantities of waste required to achieve closure by 2006.\n  I, however, had faith in the workers at Rocky Flats. I am pleased to \nstate today that Kaiser-Hill and the workers at Rocky Flats have not \ndisappointed me. In fact, it appears that Kaiser-Hill and the workers \nat Rocky Flats are far exceeding their cleanup commitments.\n  I cannot express the full extent of how proud I am of their \nachievement. Listen to some of their accomplishments: All weapons grade \nplutonium was removed in 2003.\n  More than 1,400 contaminated glove boxes and hundreds of process \ntanks have been removed.\n  More than 400,000 cubic meters of low-level radioactive waste has \nbeen removed.\n  Six hundred and fifty of the eight hundred and two facilities have \nbeen demolished.\n  All four uranium production facilities have been demolished.\n  All five plutonium production facilities have been demolished or will \nbe within the next 3 months.\n  Three hundred and ten of three hundred and sixty sites of soil \ncontamination have been remediated.\n  The last shipment of transuranic waste was shipped this past April.\n  It now appears that the cleanup of Rocky Flats will be completed--\ncompleted--as early as this October, a full year ahead of schedule, and \nsave the American taxpayers not thousands, not millions, but billions \nupon billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, you can only appreciate the magnitude of this \naccomplishment when you realize that within 6 years, Rocky Flats will \nhave been transformed from one of the dangerous places on Earth to a \nbeautiful and safe natural wildlife refuge.\n  I applaud the leadership provided by CH2M HILL. The management expert \nprovided by this company was critical to this effort. Kaiser-Hill took \nthe challenge head on despite the tough schedule and limited funding. \nThe company can be proud of its accomplishments and its contribution to \nthe safety of the people of Colorado.\n  Yet CH2M HILL could not have achieved the demanding goals established \nby the Department of Energy without the hard work and determination of \nthe Rocky Flats workers. Most of these workers had to literally develop \nan entire new skill set. They went from manufacturing plutonium pits to \ndismantling glove boxes. They cleaned up rooms that were so \ncontaminated that they were forced to use the highest level of \nrespiratory protection available.\n  Perhaps more important, these workers were extraordinarily productive \neven though they knew they were essentially working themselves out of a \njob. With the completion of the cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats, \nthey knew they would have to find employment elsewhere. There was no \nguarantee that the next job would pay as much or provide the same level \nof benefits.\n  Despite knowing they were going to lose their jobs, the workers at \nRocky Flats remained highly motivated and totally committed to their \ncleanup\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nmission. They believed in what they were doing and worked hard to clean \nup the facility as quickly and as safely as possible. They achieved \nmore in less time and with less money than anyone dreamed possible. I \nam proud of the workers at Rocky Flats. I believe they have once again \nearned our Nation's sincere appreciation and respect.\n  Given the sacrifice and dedication demonstrated by these workers, you \nwould think the Department of Energy would do everything it could to \nensure that these workers received the compensation and benefits they \nhave earned.\n  You would think assisting those workers who lose their retirement \nbenefits because of the early completion of the cleanup would be a top \npriority of the Department. After all, these workers saved the \nDepartment billions upon billions in cleanup costs.\n  Last year, it became clear to the DOE and to me that the cleanup at \nRocky Flats could be completed much earlier than anyone expected. The \nworkers were supportive of early closure but were concerned that some \nof their colleagues would lose retirement benefits because of early \nclosure.\n  I share their concern and requested in last year's Defense \nauthorization bill that the DOE provide Congress with a report on the \nnumber of workers who would not receive retirement benefits and the \ncost of providing these benefits. After a lengthy delay, the DOE \nreported that about 29 workers would not receive pension and/or \nlifetime medical benefits because of early closure. The cost of \nproviding benefits to these workers is estimated to be just over $12 \nmillion.\n\n  To my dismay, I discovered the DOE's report was woefully incomplete. \nI was subsequently informed that at least another 50 workers would have \nqualified for retirement benefits had the DOE bothered to include those \nworkers who had already been laid off because of the accelerated \nclosure schedule.\n  Mr. President, this means as many as 75 workers at Rocky Flats will \nlose their pensions, medical benefits, or, in some cases, both because \nthey worked faster, less expensively, and achieved more than they were \nsupposed to. They not only worked themselves out of a job but also out \nof retirement benefits and medical care.\n  I find the Department of Energy's refusal to pay these benefits to be \noutrageous.\n  Many of the workers at Rocky Flats served our Nation for over two \ndecades. They have risked their lives day in and day out, first by \nbuilding nuclear weapon components, and then by cleaning up some of the \nmost contaminated buildings in the world. All they have asked for in \nreturn is to be treated with fairness and honesty.\n  To my disappointment, and to the disappointment of the workers at \nRocky Flats, the DOE cannot seem to keep its end of the bargain.\n  These workers would have received retirement benefits had the cleanup \ncontinued to 2035, as originally predicted. The workers would have \nreceived their retirement benefits had the cleanup continued to \nDecember 15, 2006, as the site contract specified. But by accelerating \nthe cleanup by over a year and saving the taxpayers hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, these workers are left without the retirement \nbenefits they deserve and, I feel, have justly earned.\n  Mr. President, the Department's refusal to provide these benefits has \nramifications far beyond Rocky Flats. Because Rocky Flats is the first \nmajor DOE cleanup site, workers at other sites around the country are \nwatching to see how the DOE treats the workers at Rocky Flats. \nUnfortunately, they have seen how the DOE has failed to step up and \nprovide retirement benefits to those who have earned it.\n  The workers at other sites now have no incentive to accelerate \ncleanup. Why should they? The Department of Energy hasn't lifted a \nfinger to help the workers at Rocky Flats. It would be foolish for \nworkers at other sites to think the DOE would act fairly with them if \nthey accelerated cleanup.\n  To me, the Department's decision is penny-wise and pound-foolish. By \nrefusing to provide these benefits, the Department saves money in the \nshort term. Yet by discouraging the workers from supporting \nacceleration, the Department is going to cost the American taxpayers \nhundreds of millions in additional funding in the long run.\n  I believe Congress needs to correct the Department's mistake before \nit is too late.\n  Today, I offer an amendment that will provide some of the benefits to \nthose workers who have lost them because of early closure. I am pleased \nthat my colleague from Colorado, Senator Salazar, has agreed to \ncosponsor this important amendment. I support his bipartisan effort. \nThe amendment is narrowly focused on providing health, medical, and \nlife insurance benefits to those workers affected.\n  This amendment is limited in the funding it provides. It is solely \nfocused on providing these benefits to those workers who would have \nreceived health, medical, and life insurance benefits had the site \nremained open until December 15, 2005, the date of the site cleanup \ncontract.\n  To be clear, these benefits are not an additional bonus for a job \nwell done, nor is it a going away present for those two decades of \nservice. The health, medical, and life insurance benefits are what \nthese workers have already earned--nothing more, nothing less.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. These workers have \nearned these benefits, and it is up to this body to see they receive \nit.\n  Let's not let the bureaucrats in the Department of Energy tarnish the \ncredibility of the Federal Government. It is time for this body to \ncorrect this mistake before the Department's foolishness costs the \nAmerican taxpayers even more money in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I think under the UC, I was given a \nfew minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Allard for his \nleadership in the Senate and for his leadership on nuclear issues. \nThere is no one who understands the issue more. No one has been more \ncommitted to effectively and efficiently eliminating the difficulties \nat Rocky Flats than he has, and the Nation is in his debt. That I say \nwith certainty.\n  At one time in my life, I was a U.S. attorney and am aware that \nFederal officials are limited in certain of their powers. Somebody \nmight say they have earned something, but maybe they have not legally \nearned it. And if they have not legally earned it, they cannot be paid \nfor it.\n  I don't know where we will come out with this amendment the Senator \nhas offered. I know how committed Senator Allard and Senator Salazar \nare to helping these employees, but I note that as I understand it, \nthese are not governmental employees but employees of a private \ncontractor. That complicates matters, to say the least.\n  We are talking about providing benefits to employees of a private \ncontractor over and above the collective bargaining agreement they had. \nSince this program has been scheduled to be completed, they did have \nbenefits in the agreement for them for early termination and early \ngenerous payments when this contract ended.\n  I say to my friend how much I respect him. I am telling you, Madam \nPresident, he is working. He has almost shut down the Senate over this \nissue, but I am not sure we can ask the Department of Energy and I am \nnot sure this Congress can take this step. We are closing BRAC sites \naround the country. We have a chemical weapons facility in my State \ndestroying poison gases. I hope it finishes early. I am not sure we can \ngive every private contractor employee a bonus. Presumably the company \nhad that in their contract.\n  Those are the problems with which we are dealing. It is not a lack of \nconcern. It is real difficulties that exist. I salute both Senators \nfrom Colorado for their interest in these employees. I share those \nconcerns.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Alabama yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield. I have just a minute, as I \nknow the Presiding Officer is committed to leaving and I am supposed to \nreplace her.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I appreciate the fine work of the \nSenator from Alabama, a good friend of mine. There are a couple points \nI would like to make.\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\n  The workers at Rocky Flats were paid by Federal dollars. They were \nnot technically employed by the Federal Government. Their benefits were \npaid by the Federal Government. There is a commitment there, in my \nview. This amendment tries to correct any legal problems we may have \nthere.\n  Again, I appreciate the concern and interest the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Strategic Affairs has toward this issue. I hope somehow \nwe can resolve this in all fairness, not only to the taxpayers but also \nto the workers.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, before my colleagues depart--I have been \nengaged in a wide variety of activities here--can the Senator advise \nme, through the Chair, are these to be pending amendments to be voted \non? Is there to be a further period of debate? We want to accommodate \nthe Senator's desire if he could give us a clarification of the \nprocedures he hopes to have.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, we may very well have to vote on these \npending amendments. I would like to have them available for that \npurpose. I would like to continue to talk with the staff of the \nDepartment of Energy and the chairman and his staff. But if necessary, \nI would like to have an opportunity to have a vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator consider seeking the votes now so they \nare in that category? Does the Senator wish to have a rollcall vote, \nMadam President?\n  Mr. ALLARD. The proper request is, I ask for their consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendments are pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is sufficient clarification.\n  Mr. ALLARD. We would like to have a vote on the amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. At the appropriate time, we can arrange that.\n  I thank the distinguished Senators from Colorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise in strong support of amendment \nNo. 1419 offered by Senator Allard, my good friend from Colorado. I \nfully support it. I think it demonstrates the bipartisan nature of this \nparticular amendment.\n  Let me make two points with respect to Rocky Flats. First and \nforemost, I think this Nation should be very grateful to the workers of \nRocky Flats for having done what they did during almost five decades to \nmake sure we did everything within our power to bring about an end to \nthe Cold War. The men and women who worked at Rocky Flats were \nprincipally responsible for creating the nuclear arsenal we had in our \nNation that allowed us to be strong during the Cold War, that allowed \nus to then bring the Cold War to an end.\n  At the same time, it is important for us to recognize that within the \nDepartment of Energy complex today, there are numerous sites that are \nundergoing very difficult, very complex, and very expensive cleanups. \nThe men and women of Rocky Flats, who have been working there for \ndecades, have been the ones who have taught the United States of \nAmerica, including the Department of Energy, what it is we have to do \nto make sure we can move forward with an efficient, effective cleanup \nthat will cost less money.\n  Indeed, the contract for the cleanup of Rocky Flats had called for \nthat contract to be completed at the end of this year, 2005. But \nbecause of the good work of the men and women at Rocky Flats, that \nschedule has been expedited.\n\n  Indeed, when one looks back at the history of Rocky Flats over the \nlast several years, there was a time when it was thought Rocky Flats \nwould not be cleaned up and ready for closure until 2010. Later it was \n2007, and moved back to 2006. Yet employees working with CH2M HILL at \nRocky Flats have brought the conclusion of Rocky Flats to probably \nOctober of this year, which is only a few months away.\n  For the employees who worked at Rocky Flats during this timeframe, \nthey had an expectation that the contract would be in place through the \nend of December 31, 2005. The amendment which has been authored by \nSenator Allard and by myself and offered to our colleagues to consider \nsimply recognizes the contribution of these employees so they are, in \nfact, made whole.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Alabama, I have to say these \nemployees were Federal employees and were brought in to continue the \nwork that had to be done there at Rocky Flats with respect to the \ncleanup.\n  The amount of money we are asking for in this amendment is a small \namount relative to the billions and billions of dollars that have been \nspent in the Department of Energy complex and cleanups that have not \nbeen as successful as the one at Rocky Flats.\n  I join my colleague Senator Allard in urging bipartisan support for \nthis amendment because it recognizes, first, the men and women who \nhelped us bring about the end of the Cold War and, second, the men and \nwomen who helped us demonstrate to this country how it is you take a \nfacility contaminated with plutonium and how it is you clean it up in \nrecord time, and which will serve as a model for America as we move \nforward in the cleanup of DOE facilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1415\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to offer a couple \nof amendments. First I will say a few words about the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from California. \nSenator Feinstein was speaking on it when I came to the Chamber today. \nThat is the question of money that is designated to begin research on \nthe construction, hopefully, according to those who want it, of an \nearth penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapon.\n  There is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear \nweapons on this Earth. Mr. President, 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons \nexist on this Earth. And now we have people talking about building new \nnuclear weapons in this country, building designer nuclear weapons, \ncreating a new category of nuclear weapons, beginning to test nuclear \nweapons once again. That strikes me as pretty foolhardy because our \nresponsibility as the world's superpower is to lead in a direction that \ntries to prevent nuclear weapons from ever entering into the hands of \nterrorists or rogue nations or adversaries. Our leadership \nresponsibility is to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, to \nconvince others not to build nuclear weapons.\n  Let me read from Time magazine, March 11, 2002.\n\n       For a few harrowing weeks last fall, a group of U.S. \n     officials believed that the worst nightmare of their lives--\n     something even more horrific than 9/11--was about to come \n     true. In October, an intelligence alert went out to a small \n     number of Government agencies, including the Energy \n     Department's top secret Nuclear Emergency Search Team based \n     in Nevada. The report said terrorists were thought to have \n     obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal \n     and planned to smuggle it into New York City.\n       The source of the report was an agent code name Dragonfire \n     who intelligence officials believed was of ``undetermined'' \n     reliability. But Dragonfire's claim tracked with a report \n     from a Russian general who believed his forces were missing a \n     10-kiloton nuclear weapon.\n       Since the mid-'90s, proliferation experts have suspected \n     that several portable nuclear devices might be missing from \n     the Russian stockpile. That made this Dragonfire report \n     alarming. So did this: Detonated in lower Manhattan, a 10-\n     kiloton bomb would kill some 100,000 civilians. . . . And \n     counterterrorist investigators there went on their highest \n     state of alert.\n\n  That was from Time magazine, March of 2002. Many of us heard reports \nof this before. It said following 9/11 in October of that year, there \nwas a rumor that intelligence officials took seriously that terrorists \nhad acquired a nuclear weapon and were intending to smuggle that \nnuclear weapon into a major American city and detonate it.\n  Interestingly, no one believed it was impossible for someone to have \nobtained a nuclear weapon. There are 25,000 to 30,000 nuclear weapons \non this Earth. We hear the stories about the then-Russian nuclear \nstockpile of thousands of weapons without adequate control and \nmaintenance, some reports about the command and control of those \nweapons being dealt with with pencil notations and notebook paper. So \nit was not beyond the pale that someone could have stolen a nuclear\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nweapon. Neither did intelligence officials doubt that having stolen a \nnuclear weapon, terrorists would be able to find a way to detonate a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Why do I mention this? Because with the thousands of nuclear weapons \nthat exist in this world, the acquisition of one nuclear bomb by a \nterrorist group detonated in a major city in this country or in other \ncountries will cause a catastrophe unlike any we have ever known.\n  (Mr. LUGAR assumed the Chair.)\n  That ought to persuade us that our responsibility is to do everything \nhumanly possible, as the world's most powerful nation, to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, to prevent terrorists in rogue nations from \never acquiring nuclear weapons, and to begin reducing the number of \nnuclear weapons. That is our leadership responsibility. That \nresponsibility falls to our country and yet we have people who say, \nwell, not to worry about that; in fact, let us talk about building new \nnuclear weapons; let us design different nuclear weapons. There is even \ntalk about potentially using a nuclear weapon. There is discussion \nabout beginning testing nuclear weapons. I think that sort of thing is \nreckless because it sends a signal to the rest of the world that we are \nnot really serious about trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons \nin this world.\n  We should be serious about it. It ought to be the highest priority \nfor this country to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, halt the \nability of terrorists to ever acquire a nuclear weapon with which they \nwould threaten thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of \npeople.\n  This Defense authorization bill is spending a great deal of money on \nan antiballistic missile defense system, kind of a catcher's mitt, in \ncase a terrorist organization or rogue nation would launch an \nintercontinental ballistic missile against our country with a nuclear \nwarhead. This antiballistic missile program is kind of a catcher's mitt \nto go up and catch a speeding bullet and hit it with another speeding \nbullet. Frankly, it is the least likely threat to this country. The \nthreat that a terrorist organization or a rogue nation would acquire an \nintercontinental ballistic missile armed with a nuclear warhead and \nthen shoot it at our country, that is one of the least likely \nscenarios.\n  The most likely scenario would be a terrorist or rogue nation \nacquiring a nuclear weapon through theft or some other device and then \ndeciding to put it in the trunk of a rusty car sitting in a dock in New \nYork City or putting it in one of the many containers that show up at \nan American port on a container ship. After all, there are 5.7 million \ncontainers that show up at our ports. Only a very small percentage are \never inspected. That is a much greater, much more likely threat to this \ncountry.\n  I have great concern about those who talk so easily about our country \nbuilding new nuclear weapons, perhaps even using a nuclear weapon. We \nhave heard that language in recent years, talking about the need to \ncreate designer nuclear weapons. Our responsibility is far greater than \nthat. I believe our responsibility as a world leader is to lead in the \ndirection of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons; to do everything \nhumanly possible to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons; to do \neverything humanly possible to control the nuclear weapons that now \nexist and safeguard those nuclear weapons that now exist.\n  Since the Presiding Officer is from the State of Ohio, I will show \nsomething I have shown many times that is in my desk. I ask unanimous \nconsent to show my colleagues two pieces of information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This happens to be from a wing strut of a backfire bomber \nthat the Soviets used to fly when we were in the Cold War. My \nassumption perhaps is that this bomber carried nuclear weapons. In the \nCold War, the nuclear weapons on top of missiles were aimed at our \ncountry. The nuclear weapons carried in the bomb bay of a backfire \nbomber did not mean good things for our country.\n  How did I acquire a piece of an airplane that was part of a Soviet \nbomber? This happens to be sawed off the wing of that airplane. It was \nsawed off the wing of an airplane at American taxpayer expense, one of \nthe most successful things we have ever done. The reason I mention it \nnow is the Presiding Officer's name is on that legislation, and through \na program advanced by Senators Lugar and Nunn, we have had remarkable \nsuccess in reducing the weapons delivery systems.\n  This is from a bomber. This is the ground-up copper wire of a \nsubmarine that used to stealthily move under the waters of our oceans, \nagain with nuclear weapons, with warheads prepared to aim at American \ncities. How did I acquire copper wire from a submarine that belonged to \nthe Soviet Union? That submarine was taken apart, dismantled, as a \nresult of arms control agreements that dismantled weapons delivery \nsystems that at one point threatened America.\n  It is now in this form, a piece of a bomber and copper wire from a \nsubmarine, which I hold in my hand on the Senate floor because programs \nlike the Nunn-Lugar program, things like arms control agreements, do \nwork and can work to reduce the threat in this country. I have had this \nin my desk for some while and have used it only to demonstrate that our \nresponsibility as a world leader is to lead in the direction of doing \neverything humanly possible to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on \nthis Earth, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to rogue nations, \nterrorists, and other countries that desperately wish to acquire them, \nand to safeguard the nuclear weapons that already exist in our arsenal \nto make certain that they are not acquired by other interests.\n  That is a diversion from the point I was making but an important one, \nI think. I came here to say that I support the amendment that has been \noffered today. I do not support the spending of money for the \ndevelopment of a designer nuclear weapon, bunker busters, whatever it \nmight be called. It seems to me that is moving in exactly the wrong \ndirection.\n  Since I think the most likely threat is a stolen nuclear weapon put \nin the trunk of a rusty car at an American dock or an American city, I \nwould hope that we would begin to spend as much time and resources \ndealing with the most likely threats as we do dealing with the most \nunlikely threat, and that is the spending of billions and billions of \ndollars to create an electronic catcher's mitt, an antiballistic \nmissile system, in the belief that a rogue nation or a terrorist would \nacquire an ICBM and then arm it with a nuclear warhead.\n  Could that conceivably happen? Perhaps, but it is the least likely \nthreat we face from terrorists. The most likely threat is the theft of \na nuclear weapon and the placement of that in the trunk of a car or in \na container on a ship, and I hope we will spend as much time worrying \nabout that and dealing with that as we do the other.\n  Again, that is sort of a long way of saying I support the amendment \nthat has been offered to strip the funding for the robust nuclear earth \npenetrator bunker buster.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1426\n\n  I send an amendment to the desk, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1426.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the declassification \n  and release to the public of certain portions of the Report of the \nJoint Inquiry into the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, and to \nurge the President to release information regarding sources of foreign \n    support for the hijackers involved in the terrorist attacks of \n                          September 11, 2001)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1073. SENSE OF SENATE ON DECLASSIFICATION OF PORTIONS OF \n                   THE JOINT INQUIRY INTO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF \n                   SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n       (1) The Administration has prevented the release to the \n     American public of 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry into \n     Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the \n     Terrorist Attacks of September 2001.\n       (2) The contents of the redacted pages discuss sources of \n     foreign support for some of the hijackers involved in the \n     September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks while they were in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The Administration's decision to classify this \n     information prevents the American people from having access \n     to information about the involvement of certain foreign \n     governments in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n       (4) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested that the \n     President release the 28 pages.\n       (5) The Senate respects the need to keep information \n     regarding intelligence sources and methods classified, but \n     the Senate also recognizes that such purposes can be \n     accomplished through careful selective redaction of specific \n     words and passages, rather than effacing content entirely.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should declassify the 28-page section of \n     the Joint Inquiry into The Terrorist Attacks of September 11, \n     2001, that deals with foreign sources of support for the \n     hijackers involved in the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks; and\n       (2) only those portions of the report that would directly \n     compromise ongoing investigations or reveal intelligence \n     sources and methods should remain classified.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This amendment that I have offered is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment and it deals with this booklet. It is, as published, \nDecember 2002, ``A Joint Inquiry Into the Intelligence Community \nActivities Before and After The Terrorist Attacks of September 11, \n2001,'' a report of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nand the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, dated \nDecember 2, 2002.\n  It was the first evaluation of intelligence related to the attack \nagainst this country on September 11, 2001.\n  On page 395, and I will read a portion of it, it begins a discussion \nabout something that is very sensitive and then it turns to 396 and \nsubsequent pages. As we can see, those pages are blank. There are 28 \npages in the middle of this book that are blank. They are blank because \nthey are classified at the moment as top secret. Members of Congress \ncan, under certain conditions, go and read this top secret material. I \nand a good number of my colleagues have. Previously, I and other \ncolleagues have as well brought to the attention of the Senate the need \nfor this information to be declassified.\n  The amendment that I offer is very simple. It says that the President \nshould declassify the 28-page section of the joint inquiry into the \nterrorist attacks of September 11 that deals with foreign sources of \nsupport for the hijackers involved in the September 11, 2001, attack.\n  The American people have been prevented from seeing this. I will, in \na moment, quote from Senator Shelby and Senator Graham, then-chairman \nand vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, both of \nwhom felt that this information should be made available to the \nAmerican people. But it has never been made available to the American \npeople.\n  Let me read the page prior to the 28 pages that have been redacted. \nPage 395:\n\n       Finding: Through its investigation, the Joint Inquiry \n     developed information suggesting specific sources of foreign \n     support for some of the September 11 hijackers while they \n     were in the United States.\n\n  Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were citizens of Saudi Arabia. The \nfinding says they developed information suggesting specific sources of \nforeign support for some of the September 11 hijackers while they were \nin the United States. The joint inquiry's review confirmed that the \nintelligence community also has information, much of which has yet to \nbe independently verified, concerning these potential sources of \nsupport.\n\n       Instead, the Joint Inquiry referred a detailed compilation \n     of information it had uncovered in documents and interviews \n     to the FBI and CIA for further investigation by the \n     Intelligence Community and, if appropriate, law enforcement \n     agencies.\n\n  It talks then at the end of this page about the joint inquiry, which \nstates:\n\n       It was not the task of this Joint Inquiry to conduct the \n     kind of extensive investigation that would be required to \n     determine the true significance of such alleged support to \n     the hijackers. On the one hand, it is possible that these \n     kinds of connections could suggest, as indicated in a CIA \n     memorandum, ``incontrovertible evidence that there is support \n     for these terrorists,'' blank, blank, blank.\n\n  At that point, it is redacted.\n  This was classified at the White House. These documents went to the \nWhite House, then to be published publicly, and prior to publication 28 \npages were classified top secret. That is why in the middle of this \nbooklet we see 28 pages with no information.\n  There was a call to declassify it because a substantial amount of \ninformation in the press and elsewhere raised questions about this \nissue.\n  I will read from The Washington Post at this point in time, December \n12, 2002:\n\n       Leaders of the congressional panel ending an investigation \n     of the September 11, 2001, terrorism attacks yesterday \n     accused the administration of refusing to declassify \n     information about possible Saudi Arabian financial links to \n     U.S.-based terrorists because the material would be \n     embarrassing and would heighten political tensions with the \n     desert kingdom.\n\n  Continuing from The Washington Post:\n\n       In releasing the panel's final report on the intelligence \n     agencies' performance before the attacks, Sen. Bob Graham (D-\n     Fla.), chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and \n     Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the vice chairman, said the \n     information on Saudi Arabia should be made public to inform \n     the public about a continued source of support for anti-\n     American terrorism groups. Doing so also would put more \n     pressure on the U.S. government to force the Saudis to sever \n     their financial links to charities and individuals who \n     support terrorism, they said.\n\n  In other comments, Senator Shelby said that he believed 90 to 95 \npercent of this should be made available to the American people and \nwould not compromise any intelligence sources.\n  The President was asked about this issue. He was asked actually in a \nRose Garden appearance back at that point before a meeting with King \nSaud, where the President said he had no qualms at all about rebuffing \nthe request to release this information publicly because he said there \nis an ongoing investigation into the 9/11 attacks, and we do not want \nto compromise the investigation.\n  Well, even the Ambassador from Saudi Arabia to the United States \ncalled for the release of this information because there was \nsubstantial speculation about what it said. I cannot say what it said \non the Senate floor because it is top secret. I can read what Senator \nShelby has said and what Senator Graham said on the Senate floor. I can \nshow that in this report there are 28 pages which the American people \nare not allowed to see. I can say that there are published reports--and \nI have read them into the record now from The Washington Post and \nothers and I will read into the record, if it is necessary, the \ncomments from my two colleagues who were the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee, that references Saudi Arabia. The \npoint is even the Government of Saudi Arabia suggested and said \npublicly that this material should be declassified and made public.\n  Senator Shelby, the vice chairman of the congressional inquiry at \nthat point, reiterated his view that 90 to 95 percent of the classified \npages could be released without jeopardizing national security.\n  My point is this. I have reviewed the top secret material. I am sure \nmany of my colleagues have. They all should. It contains information \nthat the American people have a right to see.\n  Let me again read the lead to the 28 redacted pages. Again, I am \nreading from the Joint Intelligence Committee Report:\n\n       Through its investigation, the joint inquiry developed \n     information suggesting specific sources of foreign support \n     for some of the September 11 hijackers while they were in the \n     United States.\n\n  Every Member of the Senate should read that top secret material. But \nevery American citizen should have access, to understand what it says, \nbecause it should not be classified. It is unfair. It is unfair to the \nAmerican people, and I submit it is unfair to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi \nArabian Government has said it ought to be unclassified.\n  I have on a previous occasion offered this amendment to the Senate. \nThere was an objection, so I offer the same amendment again today. It \nis now 4 years from the date of that attack. It is now long past the \ntime when investigation is ongoing. The President said he would not \ndeclassify this because\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nthere is an ongoing investigation into 9/11, and we don't want to \ncompromise it. That investigation by the 9/11 Commission, authorized by \nthe Congress--that investigation is over. So this excuse is no longer \nan excuse.\n  I submit the American people have a right to know if there were those \nwho provided support to the 9/11 terrorists who were in this country \nand preparing to launch the attack on 9/11. If there were those foreign \ngovernments, foreign interests, or as the report indicated simply, \n``foreign sources of support,'' then the American people have a right \nto know.\n  My amendment is a very simple amendment, painfully simple. Once \nagain, I offer it to say it is the sense of the Senate that this \ninformation shall be declassified. We ask the President to declassify \nthis information and see that it is made available to the American \npeople.\n  I was intending to read this. I think I shall not--perhaps just a \nparagraph or two of it.\n  My colleague, Senator Graham from Florida, who in fact stood at this \ndesk and made this statement, he was then-chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Senator Shelby, who I described as chairman, was chairman at \none point, and then Senator Graham as the ranking member, and then it \nswitched and Senator Graham was chairman. During this particular time, \nSenator Graham, as chairman, and Senator Shelby, as vice chairman, both \nagreed that the bulk of this ought to be made available to the American \npeople. Let me just quote the statement made on the floor of the Senate \nby our colleague, Senator Graham, the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. He is describing this.\n\n       This report makes a very compelling case, based on the \n     information submitted by the agencies themselves, that there \n     was a foreign government which was complicitous in the \n     actions leading up to September 11, at least as it relates to \n     some of the terrorists who were present in the United States.\n       There are two big questions yet to be answered. Why would \n     this government have provide the level of assistance--\n     financial, logistical, housing, support service--to some of \n     the terrorists and not to all of the terrorists? We asked \n     that question. There has been no response.\n       My own hypothesis--and I will describe it as that--\n\n  I am continuing to quote Senator Graham--\n\n       is that in fact similar assistance was being provided to \n     all or at least most of the terrorists. The difference is \n     that we happened, because of a set of circumstances which are \n     contained in these 28 censored pages, to have an unusual \n     window on a few of the terrorists. We did not have a similar \n     window on others. Therefore, it will take more effort to \n     determine if they were, in fact, receiving that assistance.\n\n  I continue to quote Senator Graham of Florida.\n\n       An even more serious question is what would lead us to \n     believe that if there was this infrastructure of a foreign \n     government supporting some of the 19 terrorists, that as soon \n     as September 11 concluded, as soon as the last flames were \n     put out at the Pentagon, the World Trade Center and on the \n     field in Pennsylvania, all that infrastructure was \n     immediately taken down? Again, this is my hypothesis: I don't \n     believe it was taken down. I believe that infrastructure is \n     likely to still be in place assisting the next generation of \n     terrorists who are in the United States.\n\n  Those are very fundamental questions, and if the public had access to \nthese 28 pages, they would be demanding answers.\n  That is a response from the chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, not some partisan, with sentiments echoed largely by the \nvice chairman of the committee, about the top secret classification of \nthose 28 pages.\n  My amendment, once again, simply says I believe the American people \nhave the right to know what is on these pages. These 28 pages are \nblank. I know what is there. Some of my colleagues know what is there \nbecause we are able to see top secret material. The American people \ndon't know what is there, and they should.\n  Having read it, I simply say they ought to have the right to see it \nas well, and my amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that would \nask the President to make available, to declassify this material, so \nthere are no longer questions about what it says.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, and I \nassure him, in consultation with the chairman and indeed the ranking \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee, his amendment will be \ngiven every careful consideration.\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I know there is another Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not finished. I thought you were \nasking me to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I wasn't quite certain. I thought there was a brief \ntime in which you were going to address the Senate. I am trying to \naccommodate one of your colleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have one additional amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Can the Senator advise the Chair and the Senate the time \nyou would require?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I indicated to my colleague I would be speaking about 20 \nminutes, but I have one additional amendment that probably will take \nabout 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Very well, Mr. President. We will all wait that period of \ntime. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from North Dakota, if it is not already locked in, then the \nSenator from Colorado be recognized to introduce three amendments which \nwill take a total of--about how long?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, approximately 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Approximately 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding was we had ample time \nthis afternoon. I will truncate my remarks. I had intended to speak \nlonger than 10 minutes, but I don't want to disadvantage my colleague \non the floor or disadvantage those managing the bill. I will come back \non Monday and speak at greater length about the amendment I will offer \nnow and keep my comments short at this moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would very much appreciate it if the Senator will \naccommodate the Senate in that way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1429\n\n(Purpose: To establish a special committee of the Senate to investigate \n  the awarding and carrying out of contracts to conduct activities in \n        Afghanistan and Iraq and to fight the war on terrorism)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment for myself, Senator \nDurbin, and Senator Lautenberg. I send the amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1429.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with a \nsubject I have previously brought to the floor of the Senate, so far \nunsuccessfully, but my hope is this time perhaps I will have better \nluck. It deals with the question of dramatic waste, fraud, and abuse in \ncontracting, particularly with respect to the war effort in Iraq.\n  In the early 1940s, 1941 to be exact, Harry Truman, a Democrat from \nthe State of Missouri, serving here in the Senate when a Democratic \nPresident was in the White House, decided that he wanted to have an \ninvestigation of what he considered substantial waste, fraud, and abuse \nin Pentagon spending and spending by contractors. I am sure it was \nuncomfortable for a Democrat in the White House to have a member of his \nown party in the Senate pushing, but he did. He kept pushing as only \nHarry Truman could, and created finally a Truman committee, a special \ncommittee. They held hearings all around the country. They were \nrelentless. They found massive amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse in \nspending--yes, even during the war effort. It was, perhaps, \nuncomfortable for everybody that this was going on, that this kind of \ninquiry existed. But Harry Truman was not about to take a ``no'' answer\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\nfrom anybody, so he pushed and pushed.\n  Finally, it came on the radar screen in the Senate that when you \nspend money, particularly when you are at war, you can't have people \nprofiteering. It has to be spent effectively in support of this \ncountry's interests in support of our troops.\n  We have a war in Iraq. We have soldiers in harm's way in Afghanistan. \nWe are moving massive quantities of money out the door in the \nCongress--$81 billion here, $45 billion there, $55 billion there. It \nis, in many cases, going to contractors--some substantial amounts to \nreplenish Defense Department accounts, but a substantial amount to \ncontractors.\n  We hear substantial waste, fraud, and abuse. It almost makes you \nsick. This is a picture of $2 million wrapped in Saran wrap. In fact, \nthe guy standing right here said they were playing football, playing \ncatch with bundles of hundred-dollar bills. What were they doing with \nthis? They were actually giving money to contractors in Iraq. \nContractors were told: Bring a bag, we pay in cash. Bring a bag because \nwe pay in cash over here.\n  This picture shows what was going on. The guy who did this testified \nbefore a committee at a hearing that I held. I don't need to go through \na lot of charts, but ``Uncle Sam Looks Into Meal Bills, Halliburton \nRefunds $27 Million.''\n  We had one example: Halliburton corporation charging the American \ntaxpayer. They were feeding 42,000 a day--at least that is what they \nwere charging for, 42,000 meals a day. Guess what. They were only \nserving 14,000 meals a day.\n  I came from a small town that had a really small restaurant. I can \nunderstand them missing a cheeseburger or two, but a corporation that \novercharges the Federal Government for feeding soldiers by 28,000 meals \na day?\n  Then we had another hearing. We had one of the food service \nsupervisors in Iraq who works for a subsidiary of Halliburton. He said \nwe were feeding food that was outdated and expired, expired stamps on \nit by as much as a year.\n  I see the Washington Times had a little blurb today. They mentioned \nthat. People were writing in and saying: That is nothing, we used to \neat old K rations. Does anybody believe it is right that when we send \nour soldiers to Iraq and we have food hauled over by a contractor and \nwe pay for good food to be fed to our troops, and then they end up with \nfood that is expired for a year, they say that is OK, serve it to the \ntroops; and if a convoy comes through and is subject to attack the \nsupervisor says, you grab that food out, pull the shells out and \nshrapnel out, and feed it to the troops. I put that testimony in the \nRecord.\n  Let me tell you, a top civilian official at the Corps of Engineers, \ninvolved in awarding sole-source contracts to companies like \nHalliburton--and there are more involved--the top civilian official is \na wonderful woman with a wonderful record who has worked for years for \nthis country. Here is what she said. And by the way, she is paying for \nit with her career because whistleblowing is not looked upon with favor \nby the old boys network. Here is what she said, Bunny Greenhouse:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to K.B.R. Halliburton represents the most \n     blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during \n     the course of my professional career. She is paying for this \n     bit of honesty with her career because the good old boys \n     don't like to hear that.\n\n  The question is, for all the things that are being done--payment to \nhave a room air conditioned, have the contractor come pick up a bag of \ncash, and it goes to a subcontractor--pretty soon the American \ntaxpayers' payment to have room air conditioning, turns out the room \nhas a little fan in it and we paid for air conditioners.\n  It is unbelievable what is going on. There are 85,000 brand new \ntrucks left on the roadside because they had a flat tire, to be trashed \nand torched. Plugged fuel pumps? Dump the truck.\n  It is unbelievable what is going on in waste, fraud, and abuse. I \nhave held five hearings in the policy committee on this. We had \nwhistleblowers who have the courage to show up and talk about what is \ngoing on. There are 50,000 tons of nails laying in the sands of Saudi \nArabia because they ordered the wrong size, so they dump them on the \nsands. The American taxpayer will pay for that. Need some towels for \ntroops? The Halliburton subsidiary orders towels for troops and they \nnearly doubled the cost of the towels so they could put their logo on \nthe towels.\n  Yes, it is going on all the time. It is unbelievable. And nobody does \na thing about it. Nothing. Do you think this Congress is holding \naggressive oversight hearing? None. Nobody is interested. Why? Because \nit would embarrass somebody. Meanwhile the American taxpayer is taking \na bath and the troops are being poorly served, in my judgment, with \nthis sort of nonsense.\n  My amendment is simple. I will speak at some length on Monday. I want \nto truncate this for the sake of the time problems my colleagues have. \nMy amendment is very simple. My amendment calls for the establishment \nof a Truman-type committee again that would do the oversight that is \nnot being done by this Congress. It will be bipartisan. It seems to me \nwe have an obligation to the American people and we have an obligation \nto our troops. I offer the amendment and I will come back and speak \nlater.\n  In the interest of time problems, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. The Senator brings \nto the Senate a very serious proposal. It will be given serious \nconsideration.\n  At this time, the Senator from Colorado desires to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the distinguished Senator addresses the Senate, I \nsee our distinguished colleague from Connecticut. If I could inquire as \nto the Senator's wishes. We are trying to arrange a schedule.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. Five \nminutes is the maximum I require.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might I make one comment, I defamed my friend, the \nPresiding Officer. I suggested some while ago he was from Ohio. He, in \nfact, is from Indiana. I have known that all along, and those in the \nNorthern Great Plains see everything out there as east. But my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Lugar, to whom I refer, is from \nIndiana. I talked about Nunn-Lugar and the wonderful work done. I want \nto make sure I identify it correctly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We, the defamed people from Michigan, are really from \nOhio.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might ask that the Senator from Connecticut be \nrecognized following the remarks by the Senator from Ohio--the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. It is, indeed, fortunate to be a Senator from the State \nof Colorado.\n  I start my comments by giving my appreciation to the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, and to the Senator from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, for their great leadership in putting together what is a very \ngood bill.\n  I also thank their staffs because at the end of the day I know how \nmuch of the work goes into these major pieces of legislation put \ntogether by our great staffs. Judy Ainslee and Rick DeBobes have done a \nfantastic job on behalf of the United States, on behalf of the Senate. \nI thank them for their efforts.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 1421, 1422, and 1423, en bloc\n\n  I ask that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments at the \ndesk, Nos. 1421, 1422, and 1423. I ask they be called up en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1421, 1422, and 1423, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendments be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1421\n\n(Purpose: To rename the death gratuity payable for deaths of members of \n             the Armed Forces as fallen hero compensation)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\n     SEC. 642.

Mr. President, before discussing these amendments, I \nunderscore the great importance of this legislation. This legislation \nsends an important message to our troops and to their families, to the \nimportant work it funds, and the important signal it sends to the world \nfrom the United States of America.\n  Today, more than 15,000 people from my State are serving overseas in \nsupport of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan. Many of these soldiers, air men and women, reservists, and \nNational Guard men and women are preparing for their second tour of \nduty away from their families.\n  The 4,000 soldiers of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment are in Iraq \nfor their second tour of duty, and 1,800 soldiers from the 43rd Area \nSupport Group and 130 from the 571st Medical Company are also overseas, \nwhile the 947th Engineering Company and the second of the 135th \nAviation Battalion are preparing to leave for Iraq in the fall.\n  I give a sincere welcome home to all 3,762 soldiers from the 2nd \nBrigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry, who are returning to their families \nin Colorado Springs as I stand in the Senate today.\n  The most moving thing I have done since coming to the Senate some 6 \nmonths ago was a bipartisan trip which I took to Iraq led by Senator \nHarry Reid from Nevada. On that trip I saw many moving things, though \nnothing more impressive than our troops and their dedication to the \nmission and to their units.\n  Shortly after returning to the United States from Iraq, I dropped a \nline to Lieutenant Colonel ``Mac'' from Colorado whom I had met on the \ntrip. I inquired how he was doing, and in responding he wrote:\n\n       Our troops' spirits remain high. Some more than others, as \n     I've worked and received permission to allow about 40 of our \n     troops to redeploy early, as the pace of our support has \n     decreased and will remain steady but not too hectic over the \n     next six months of our deployment. Having worked the plan \n     from start to final approval, I am personally happy knowing \n     that they will be able to spend more quality time with their \n     loved ones. I know my place is here, and will remain until we \n     all leave in early Autumn.\n\n  That one response from one lieutenant colonel underscored our troops' \ndedication to the cause we are engaged in. This young man with his own \nfamily back in Colorado Springs was celebrating that members of his \nunit--not he--were returning home to their families. Thousands of \ntroops are making that same selfless sacrifice every day. We owe each \nof them the best possible equipment and training. They and their \nfamilies also should expect that we will ensure their quality of life.\n  The $441 billion bill in the amendments we have adopted in the last \nday will begin to do just that. That bill authorizes a total of $109 \nbillion in appropriations to the Department of Defense for military \npersonnel, and $236 million of that amount is more than the President's \nbudget requested.\n  In my State of Colorado, where more than 9,000 troops are currently \ndeployed overseas, I am especially mindful of the important quality-of-\nlife investments that have been included in this bill.\n  The bill would provide a 3.1-percent across-the-board pay raise for \nmilitary personnel. That is important to honor our men and women in \nuniform. It authorizes the payment of imminent danger pay to \nservicemembers hospitalized as a result of wounds they have incurred as \na result of hostile action for the duration of their hospitalization. \nThat is a move in the right direction. It would permanently increase \nthe fallen hero compensation for servicemembers killed in combat or \ncombat-related activities from $12,000 to $100,000. With the inclusion \nof Senator Levin's important amendment, it will ensure that the family \nof any active-duty soldier who was killed will qualify for this \nimportant assistance.\n  The legislation also permanently increases the maximum amount of \ncoverage for group life insurance from $250,000 to $400,000. That is \nthe right start. I am hopeful with the inclusion of Senator Nelson's \namendment we will eliminate the survivor benefit plan dependency \nindemnity compensation offset and fix serious inequities in how the \nmilitary treats the survivors of military retirees.\n  The bill also extends several bonuses relating to recruiting and \nretention, including the selected reserve reenlistment bonus, the ready \nreserve enlistment and reenlistment bonuses, the prior service \nenlistment bonus, the enlistment and reenlistment bonuses for active-\nduty members, and the retention bonus for servicemembers with critical \nmilitary skills.\n  I will cosponsor an amendment with my friends Senators Lieberman, \nClinton, and Nelson, to increase the size of our Active-Duty Army by \n80,000 troops. Increasing the size of our military will reduce the \nstrain placed on individual\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nsoldiers, improving the quality of their lives and their families' \nlives. It will allow our fighting men and women to spend more time at \nhome with their families between deployments. It will address what is \ntoday an overstretched American Army. Most importantly, adding 80,000 \ntroops will help to defend our Nation at home and abroad with the \nstrongest military in the world.\n\n  Our health care for our troops and their families also is addressed. \nThis bill would extend health care coverage under TRICARE Prime for the \nchildren of active-duty servicemembers who died while on active duty \nand who have been on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, so \nthe dependent child would be able to receive TRICARE until age 21.\n  After the inclusion on Thursday of the excellent bipartisan amendment \noffered by Senators Graham and Clinton, it will ensure access to \nTRICARE for Guard and Reserve and that care will continue.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress about the adverse health effects that may be associated with \nthe use of antimalaria drugs.\n  This is a good bill. The bill is vitally important for the work it \nalso funds. It funds $78.2 billion for procurement. It authorizes $127 \nbillion for operations and maintenance. It does a lot to support our \ninvestment in creating a strong defense for our Nation.\n  I am particularly pleased the committee included $6.4 million to \nconstruct a Space Warning Squadron Support Facility at the Greeley Air \nNational Guard Station. Our air guard provides a vital service at that \nstation, but the current facility is substandard by anyone's measure. \nWhen personnel leave that facility, they drape plastic over their \ncomputers today so they are not destroyed by the water that leaks \nthrough the roof.\n  I am also pleased with the inclusion of the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues from Kentucky, Senators McConnell and Bunning, and my good \nfriend from Colorado, Senator Allard, that we are prepared to take \nanother positive step forward in meeting our responsibility to destroy \nthe chemical weapons at the Pueblo Chemical Army Depot. I am also \nhopeful with the efforts of my good friend Senator Allard and efforts I \nhave undertaken with him, we will be able to wrap up the cleanup of \nRocky Flats in a successful manner.\n  This bill is important because it sends a message to the world. There \nis no more comprehensive statement of our dedication to defend this \ncountry and to maintain our position in the world. Our enemies should \nnever take comfort in any sense that America is disengaging from the \nworld. This bill sends a very clear message on two vitally important \nthreats.\n  On Wednesday, a group of leading defense and foreign policy experts, \nled by former Defense Secretary Perry, concluded:\n\n     . . . the gravest threat facing America today is a terrorist \n     detonating a nuclear bomb in one of our cities. The National \n     Security Advisory Group judges that the Bush Administration \n     is taking insufficient actions to counter this threat.\n\n  We must do better. Knowing that such a horrendous act is even \npossible, we must take every step possible now to ensure it does not \ncome about.\n  This bill authorizes $415 million for DOD's Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program, taking an important first step in locking down, \nperhaps, the most ready source of nuclear materials for terrorists.\n  With the inclusion of the Lugar amendment, of which I was proud to be \na cosponsor, I hope we will begin to cut through the red tape that has \nhindered our efforts at locking down this threat for far too long. I \ncommend my colleague from Indiana for his leadership over the decades \non this effort.\n  Authorizing a total of $50 billion in supplemental appropriations for \nthis next fiscal year for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand the global war on terror, the bill also tells the world we are not \ndeterred by the hateful attacks on buses and trains in London or on \ncars in Baghdad.\n  We are prepared, once again, to fulfill our obligations to fund the \neffort in Iraq. I repeat my plea to the President that he frankly \ndiscuss his plan for success in Iraq with the American people while he \ncandidly informs Americans about how we will pay for it.\n  I am also hopeful that as this bill moves forward to its final form, \nthe amendments I have called up for consideration will also be \nincluded.\n  Amendment No. 1421 would simply change the name of the ``death \ngratuity'' to ``fallen hero compensation.'' This amendment was approved \nby the Senate in the supplemental appropriations bill but was dropped \nin conference.\n  ``Death gratuity'' is the name for the assistance that taxpayers make \navailable to military survivors. The term ``gratuity'' means gift. Not \none of the widows, widowers, or children left behind think of that \nmoney as a gift. This is a simple change. There should be no opposition \nfrom Members of this body to include that name change. It more properly \nreflects the sacrifices military survivors have made and more properly \nexpresses the gratitude and dignity we as a nation owe these families.\n  Amendment No. 1423, the Paralympic amendment, would allow the \nPentagon's Office of Special Events to provide support to national and \ninternational Paralympic competitions hosted in the United States with \na million-dollar limit on support in any one year. The Office of \nSpecial Events today supports the regular Olympics and other \ninternational sporting events. All this amendment does is to say we \nwill treat our disabled athletes with the same support and respect.\n  The amendment would also allow support of a new USOC program that has \nbeen developed to assist with the rehabilitation of disabled veterans \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a simple amendment that \naddresses a very important issue, especially to the disabled veterans \nwho are returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Amendment No. 1422 is another amendment that improves upon this bill. \nIt will restore badly needed educational impact aid funding to the El \nPaso School District, which educates the children of more than 60 \npercent of the military personnel serving our Nation at the Fort Carson \nmilitary base in Colorado.\n  For the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the El Paso School District submitted \nits application for impact aid to the Department of Education on time, \nbut due to inadvertence and, perhaps, bureaucratic misdirection and \nmistake, it was deemed to be untimely because they failed to submit the \napplication in electronic format. As a result, the school district that \nserves mostly military families was assessed a 10-percent penalty. This \namendment will deem the school district's application as timely. The \nmoney is already in the Department of Education's budget. Thus, this \namendment does not take money away from another source or another \nState.\n  One may ask, What connection does this have to our service personnel? \nAnd why is it so critical to the support of our military personnel?\n  First of all, 60 percent of the 5,500 El Paso School District \nstudents belong to military families stationed at Fort Carson, and they \nwill be impacted by the cut in the amount of money available for their \neducation.\n  Many of the loved ones of the students and staff of the El Paso \nSchool District have been deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. In fact, over 11,000 soldiers from Fort Carson are currently \ndeployed in Iraq today. That is over one-half of the fort's total \nforces. Many units from Fort Carson are now starting their second and \nthird tours of duty in Iraq. Sadly, over 50 service personnel from Fort \nCarson have died in active duty in Iraq over the last several years.\n  Without the funds we are requesting, the school district will be \nforced to lay off teachers and cut educational programs that educate \nthe families of service personnel. Our military personnel sacrifice a \ngreat deal for our freedom. We owe it to them to restore the \neducational funding for their children.\n  In closing, I am reminded once again of the thousands of Macs--just \nlike the valiant lieutenant colonel I met in Kuwait--who are standing \nguard each and every day to protect our Nation. I am mindful of their \nfamilies--in my own State, in Colorado Springs, in Denver,\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nin Grand Junction; in small, rural communities, and in every State and \ncommunity throughout our Nation--awaiting their return or dreading \ntheir departure. We owe them, as the Senate, our best work.\n  This bill is very good work. As I started my comments today, I \ncommended the leadership of my friends from Michigan and Virginia and \ntheir staffs for their great work. I hope our Democrats and Republicans \nwill join together, as we move forward, to bring this legislation to \nsuccessful conclusion because it is important for a strong defense for \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to assure our distinguished \ncolleague from Colorado that we will give very careful consideration to \nhis amendments.\n  Have they been sent to the desk, I ask the Presiding Officer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that they be set \naside, such that the Senator from Connecticut is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, let me thank the \nSenator from Colorado for his extremely thoughtful and sensitive \nstatement about what this bill is all about. I thank him for his kind \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Let me first thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and the ranking \nmember, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, for the extraordinary \nwork they have done in bringing this bill forward. I am honored to be a \nmember of the committee and proudly support its work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1389\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak specifically about amendment No. \n1389 offered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune. I am one of \nmany cosponsors of this amendment. Its intention is to delay the \nimplementation of the current round of base realignment and closures, \nthe so-called BRAC, until we are better able to assess our defense \nneeds.\n  The news from London in the last few days reminds us in the most \nstark and stunning ways of the fact that we are at war. It may not feel \nlike that to most of us. It is a different kind of war. But there is an \nenemy out there worldwide who is committed to achieving some kind of \nvictory over us and our allies and establishing a regime in a \nsignificant part of the world that would be fanatical, hateful, and, to \nsay the least, undermine our national security and our national \nprinciples.\n  In the midst of such a war, it seems to me the reduction of our base \nstructure has to be done with real care. The point of Senator Thune's \namendment, to delay this process, is this: One, we are in a war. As \nSenator Salazar said with great effect and poignancy, we have tens of \nthousands of American soldiers coming and going from Iraq, using bases \nin a way we may not have foreseen when this particular base realignment \nand closure process began.\n  We also are being asked and the Commission is being asked to make \nfinal judgments about some very important military installations in our \ncountry but before our final facts are before the Commission, the \nCongress, and the Pentagon. That is the intention of the Thune \nlegislation, which, as I say, I am a cosponsor of--to put the brakes \non, to say, let's not rush to judgment. Because in some cases of bases \nthe Pentagon has recommended be closed, we may look back and say: This \nrush to judgment has really been a dash to disaster, that we have \nclosed some military facilities we will urgently need in the years \nahead.\n  Of course, I support cutting excess and unneeded defense spending and \nsupport saving money where we can. That is why I earlier voted for the \nBRAC round. But I think Senator Thune and I, and so many others, when \nwe saw the recommendations come out--now, in the middle of a war, based \non information that is incomplete--we said to ourselves: Let's just \nstep back a bit and get the facts we need before we make these final \njudgments.\n  Let me state it clearly. I have a local interest in this. The \nPentagon has recommended, as all my colleagues know, the closing of \nSubmarine Base New London, an extraordinary, in my opinion, national \nasset. But the point I want to make is if you close, God forbid, \nSubmarine Base New London or some of these other bases that are \nrecommended for closure, that is it. This is not like turning off the \nwater in your house when you go away for a summer vacation, and when \nyou come back and turn it back on, there is the water. If you close a \nbase like Submarine Base New London, it is never going to be opened \nagain. Therefore, you have to be able to reach a conclusion that not \nonly is it not of military value today and in the near future, but it \nnever will be; that is, in decades ahead, in an uncertain world. In \nthis case of this submarine base--and I fear in some of the others--the \nfacts that were used as a basis for the judgment do not stand up.\n  Too often, monetary savings have been confused with military value, \nand military value has been based on judgments that are incomplete. And \nhere I come to one of our larger points: The Pentagon is now in the \nmidst of its Quadrennial Defense Review, the most significant \noverarching review of America's military needs and goals for the \nfuture. That review is due next year. But we are being asked through \nBRAC and eventually in Congress to make final judgments on these bases \nbefore the final information is in, in the midst of a war.\n  I can tell you about Submarine Base New London, which I know best. \nThe recommendation to close seems to be based on an estimate of the \nsize of our submarine force, our attack submarine force, in the years \nahead, which is the lowest anyone has ever seen and lower than every \nother study that has been done. I suppose if the base is closed, it \nwill prejudge the fact. But I fear we will look back and say in the \nyears ahead, as we face rising pure competitors: Why did we ever do \nthat? I have enough confidence in this particular Base Realignment and \nClosure Commission and the independence and strength with which they \nare going at their responsibilities, at every turn making it clear they \nare not just going to be a rubberstamp for the Pentagon, that they are \nnot going to allow Submarine Base New London to be closed. But I worry \nthere are bases across this Nation that are recommended for closing on \ninsubstantial, incomplete information that we will regret having \nclosed. This amendment No. 1389 says: Let's just step back for a while. \nLet's wait until the Quadrennial Defense Review is in. Let's wait until \nwe see the return of some more of our troops from Iraq so we know what \nour base needs are here at home. Let us not rush to judgment.\n  We are talking about our national security in a time of war, in an \nuncertain world, with rising new superpowers, but much more menacing \nthan that: rogue states and nonstate actors gaining access to weapons \nof mass destruction. We have to get this right. I believe Senator \nThune's amendment would help us do that.\n  Mr. President, I will just say one final word about the news from \nLondon. I am sure the distinguished occupant of the chair, like myself, \nhas been following these developments closely. They remind us that \nthere is an insidious group out there, a fanatical group that will \nstrike at civilians and try to strike panic in the hearts of average \ncitizens to gain their political goals.\n  What has been as stirring as the attacks in London have been \nrevolting has been the reaction of the British people. It really does \nremind us of their strength and determination during the Second World \nWar. It is an inspiration. Most of all, I hope it will send a message \nto these terrorists that they may strike, but we are stronger than they \nare. Our principles are superior to theirs. They will never defeat us. \nI thank our friends from Britain, the average citizens, whose actions \nand words speak so loudly to us of their faith in the future, for \ngiving us that model and that inspiration. We stand with them today as \nthey have stood with us on so many previous days.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 1343, 1430 through 1432, En Bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if my distinguished ranking member is \nprepared, we are about to send a series of amendments to the desk which \nhave been cleared on both sides.

Lugar.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the live \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of our colleagues, this vote will \noccur on Tuesday.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to join with \nmy colleagues, Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa, and Senators Boxer and \nHarkin in support of an amendment to the FY06 National Defense \nAuthorization Act that would transfer one of our Nation's greatest \nbattleships, the USS Iowa to the State of California for permanent \ndonation status.\n  I understand the affection that many Iowans have for this important \nship and that a model of the USS Iowa can be viewed in the Rotunda of \nthe Iowa State Capitol. Therefore, I truly appreciate the support of \nSenators Grassley and Harkin for helping to ensure that the USS Iowa \nwill have a permanent home in California.\n  I was privileged to have the opportunity to introduce legislation in \n1998 and 1999 to assist in transporting the USS Iowa from Newport, RI, \nto Suisun Bay in San Francisco, where it now sits as part of the Navy's \nReserve Fleet. Through its transfer from reserve to donation status, \nany port community in California will have the opportunity to \ncompetitively bid for the battleship.\n  While I am sure a number of communities in California will be \ninterested, I understand that the Port of Stockton has already begun \nmaking preparations and raising money to bid on this project.\n  Having the USS Iowa as a permanent floating museum in California will \nbe an honor for my State and a tremendous memorial to the thousands of \nsailors who served aboard this battleship over the past 6 decades.\n  The USS Iowa, nicknamed the ``big stick,'' was first launched in \nAugust 1942 and commissioned in February 1943 under the command of \nCapt. John L. McCrea. In August 1943 it was mobilized for the first \ntime along the Atlantic coast to protect against the threat of German \nbattleships believed to be operating in Norwegian waters.\n  In one of the more memorable moments of the battleship's history, the \nUSS Iowa carried President. Franklin D. Roosevelt to Casablanca on his \nway to the Teheran Conference in November 1943, and afterwards provided \nthe President transportation back to the United States. The USS Iowa \nengaged in combat for the first time after it was deployed to the \nPacific theater as the flagship of Battleship Division 7.\n  During the early months of 1943, as part of the battle for the \nMarshall Islands, the USS Iowa supported U.S. aircraft carrier strikes \nand helped support numerous air strikes near Micronesia and neighboring \nislands. It was next deployed to assist U.S. forces in combat in the \nSouth Pacific near New Guinea and joined the Marianas campaign in June \n1943.\n  During the Battle of the Philippines, the Iowa ably drove back and \nneutralized a series of air raids attempted by the Japanese middle \nfleet. Throughout the winter of 1944, the USS Iowa continued to engage \nin action off the Philippine coast until it was directed to return to \nthe U.S. for maintenance in January 1945.\n  From January 1945 through March 1945, the Battleship Iowa received a \nfull overhaul in the Port of San Francisco before steaming off for \nOkinawa to take part in combat operations near Japan. Arriving in \nApril, the Iowa supported U.S. air strikes against Japan and the \nsurrounding islands until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.\n\n  The ship was honored to be one of the few American battleships to \nsail into Tokyo Bay with the occupation forces and take part in the \nsurrender ceremonies. After returning to the West Coast following the \nwar, the USS Iowa operated in reserve status until it was \ndecommissioned for the first time in March 1949.\n  In August 1951, after hostilities broke out in Korea, the USS Iowa \nwas recommissioned and mobilized to that region. In March 1952, the \nbattleship was deployed to the war zone as the flagship of VADM Robert \nBriscoe, the Commander of the 7th Fleet. For the next 7 months, the \nIowa was fully engaged in support of the U.N. troops, bombarding \nstrategic targets throughout North Korea.\n  Following the cessation of combat, the USS Iowa was sent to Norfolk, \nVA, to receive an overhaul in October 1952. For the next 5 years, the \nIowa was engaged in training maneuvers in Northern Europe, including \nNATO exercises, and in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1958, it was \ndecommissioned for the second time and made part of the Atlantic \nReserve Fleet based at Philadelphia.\n  Despite being decommissioned twice, the USS Iowa was renovated and \nupgraded in April 1984, and was recommissioned for the third time as \npart of President Reagan's plan to expand the Navy to 600 ships. \nThroughout the 1980s, the battleship spent the majority of its \ndeployment in the waters off the European coast while also taking tours \nof the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea.\n  Despite surviving two wars and numerous combat engagements over its \nlong history, the USS Iowa suffered its worst catastrophe in April 1989 \nwhen one of its 16-inch gun turrets blew up, causing the death of 47 \nsailors. The source of the explosion was never conclusively identified, \nin spite of a thorough investigation of the incident by the Navy. Even \nwith its damaged turret, the Iowa went on to further assignments in the \nAtlantic and Mediterranean Sea until it was decommissioned for the \nfinal time at Norfolk, VA, on October 26, 1990.\n  In early 1998, I was contacted by city officials in San Francisco \nrequesting help with bringing the USS Iowa out to the west coast. \nTogether with Senator Boxer, we introduced legislation in October 1998, \nas part of the FY99 Defense Authorization Act, to provide for the \ntransfer of the USS Iowa to San Francisco.\n  The next year I worked with colleagues in the California \ncongressional delegation to secure $3 million to pay for the transport \nof the battleship from Rhode Island to California. On April 20, 2001, \nthe USS Iowa finally arrived in San Francisco and has been berthed at \nSuisun Bay since that time.\n  This amendment ensures that this amazing battleship, which earned \nnine battle stars for its World War II service and two battle stars in \nthe Korean war, will be memorialized permanently as a floating museum \nin California.\n  Once again, I thank Senators Grassley, Boxer, and Harkin for their \nsupport on this important provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be placed in the Record \nnext to the relevant amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8740-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8740-S8741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROTECTION OF LAWFUL COMMERCE IN ARMS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Health, Eduation, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, I would like to take the opportunity to comment \non a very important piece of legislation the Senate passed this week--a \nmanagers' substitute for S. 544, the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act of 2005, offered by myself, Senators Jeffords, Gregg, \nKennedy, Frist, Murray, and Bingaman.\n  More than 5 years in the making, this legislation is an important \nstep toward building a culture of safety and quality in our health care \nsystem.\n  The language of this bill reflects a carefully negotiated bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement between the chairmen and ranking members of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee. I want to thank my colleagues Senator \nKennedy, Chairman Barton, and Representative Dingell for their hard \nwork in bringing this agreement to fruition.\n  Tremendous credit also goes to the HELP Committee's previous \nChairman, Senator Gregg, whose tireless work on this issue was \ninvaluable in bringing us to where we are today, and to Senator \nJeffords, sponsor of the original legislation upon which this agreement \nbuilds.\n  The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act will create a \nframework through which hospitals, doctors, and other health care \nproviders can work to improve health care quality in a protected legal \nenvironment.\n  More specifically, the bill will extend crucial legal privilege and \nconfidentiality protections to health care providers to allow them to \nreport health care errors and ``near misses'' to specially designated \npatient safety organizations. In turn, these patient safety \norganizations, some of which exist in limited form today, will be able \nto collect and analyze patient safety data in a confidential manner.\n  After conducting this analysis, patient safety organizations will \nreport back to providers on trends in health care errors and will offer \nguidance to them on how to eliminate or minimize these errors. Some of \nthis takes place today, but much more information could be collected \nand analyzed if providers felt confident that reporting such errors \nwould not increase the likelihood that they could be sued.\n  It is not the intent of this legislation to establish a legal shield \nfor information that is already currently collected or maintained \nseparate from the new patient safety process, such as a patient's \nmedical record. That is, information which is currently available to \nplaintiffs' attorneys or others will remain available just as it is \ntoday. Rather, what this legislation does is create a new zone of \nprotection to assure that the assembly, deliberation, analysis, and \nreporting by providers to patient safety organizations of what we are \ncalling ``Patient Safety Work Product'' will be treated as confidential \nand will be legally privileged.\n  Errors in medical treatment take place far too often. Unfortunately, \nhowever, providers live in fear of our unpredictable medical litigation \nsystem. This fear, in turn, inhibits efforts to thoroughly analyze \nmedical errors and their causes. Without appropriate protections for \nthe collection and analysis of patient safety data, providers are \nunderstandably loath to participate in medical error reporting systems.\n  I am pleased that the negotiated final version of this bill reflects \nand upholds several of the key priorities of the bill the HELP \nCommittee marked up earlier this year, and which was also passed out of \nthe Senate last year.\n  For example, this agreement makes very clear that, in addition to \nstrong legal privilege provisions, patient safety work product will \nalso be subject to a clear and affirmative duty of confidentiality. \nThat is, not only will patient safety work product be subject to a \nprivilege in legal and related proceedings, but the bill will also \nimpose penalties of up to $10,000 per violation should such patient \nsafety work product be disclosed.\n  It was a key priority of the Senate bill that such information not \nonly be privileged in a legal proceeding, but also that serious \nconsequences will ensue if patient safety organizations, providers, or \nanyone else divulges it in ways not permitted under the bill. I am very \npleased that the compromise agreement we are passing this week upholds \nthis commitment to an affirmative duty of confidentiality.\n  Also, we believed very strongly that the definition of patient safety \nwork product--that is, exactly what kind of information is to be \nprotected--be drawn broadly enough to assure that providers will feel \nsafe and secure in participating in a patient safety system--and that \nthey not be chilled from participating by fear that their efforts to \nassemble, analyze, deliberate on, or report patient safety information \nto patient safety organizations would somehow fall outside of a too-\nnarrow statutory definition of patient safety work product.\n  With this in mind, we negotiated a definition in the agreement which \ntakes great care to make clear to providers that the assembly of data, \nits analysis, deliberations about it, and its reporting to a patient \nsafety organization will be firmly protected. We also clarified that \ninformation that is collected, maintained, or developed separately from \nthe patient safety system will continue to be treated the same as it is \nunder current law.\n  Before I close, I want to take just a minute to thank the many Senate \nstaff members who worked very hard to bring this legislation to where \nit is today. Among those who deserve special recognition and thanks are \nAndrew Patzman and Stephen Northrup of my HELP Committee professional \nstaff, David Bowen of Senator Kennedy's Committee staff, Peggy Binzer \nwith Senator Gregg, Dean Rosen of Senator Frist's Leadership staff, and \nSean Donohue with Senator Jeffords. Much credit also goes to the hard \nwork of the staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, as well \nas to the expert and very capable legislative staff at the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n         ``Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005''\n\n                     Managers Substitute Amendment\n\n                              [July 2005]\n\n\n                         Section 1.

SEVERABILITY\n\n       If any provision of this act is held to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of the act shall be \n     unaffected.\n       Authorization of Appropriations--for purposes of carrying \n     out this act, there are authorized such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2010.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I came to the floor today to commend our \ncolleagues and extend my appreciation to them because last night the \nSenate unanimously passed S. 544, the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act of 2005. I do not believe it is too great an \nexaggeration to say that this bill will be among the most significant \nhealthcare legislation the Senate will consider during this Congress. I \nsay that because I believe this legislation will contribute immensely \nto the current efforts that are underway to save lives and reduce the \ntragedy of needless medical errors.\n  This legislation starts with a simple premise. Let us set up a system \nthat helps our health care providers learn from each other. Let us set \nup a system that promotes the reporting and analysis of medical errors. \nLet us set up a system that engenders the trust of providers and the \npatients they serve.\n  The passage of this legislation represents the successful culmination \nof efforts, by many of our colleagues, that began with the publication \nof a small but significant report about medical errors.\n  With the publication of the Institute of Medicine, IOM, study, To Err \nis Human in 1999, we were all reminded\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\nthat Hippocrates' maxim to ``first, do no harm'' is as relevant to the \npractice of medicine today as it was in 400 B.C. That IOM report was \namong the first to galvanize national attention on the issue of patient \nsafety when it reported that medical errors contribute to approximately \n100,000 patient deaths a year. This startling and troubling statistic \nhas been verified in subsequent studies and cited in peer reviewed \narticles in the leading journals of biomedical research, including the \nJournal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, and the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine.\n  When I was Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions in 1999, I undertook several hearings--5 in all--to \nexamine this issue and discuss the recommendations of the To Err is \nHuman report. The preponderance of testimony overwhelmingly agreed with \nseveral of the original Institute of Medicine recommendations.\n  Perhaps the most important of these recommendations stresses that \nimproving patient safety requires a learning environment rather than a \npunitive environment; voluntary data gathering systems as opposed to \nmandatory systems; and appropriate legal protections--including \nconfidentiality and privilege from discovery--that allow for the review \nand analysis of medical error information.\n  In response to this attention to patient safety issues, a myriad of \npublic and private patient safety initiatives have begun. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has initiated several patient \nsafety projects, including project grants funded by the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ. The work of the Veterans' \nAdministration in developing and implementing innovative patient safety \nsystems--especially in the area of medication management--has drawn \nattention from throughout the country. In addition, the Quality \nInteragency Coordination Taskforce has recommended steps to improve \npatient safety that can be taken by each Federal agency involved in \nhealth care; and agency activities to implement these steps are \nongoing. Finally, efforts are well underway to bring the advanced \nelectronic technology of the information-age to bear on solving many of \nthe problems associated with medical errors.\n  Several non-governmental organizations and professional societies \nhave also ``stepped up to the plate'' on patient safety. The Joint \nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the U.S. \nPharmacopoeia, the American Medical Association, medical specialty \nsocieties and other health care providers including the American \nHospital Association and the American Federation of Hospitals have \nlaunched innovative efforts dedicated to improving patient safety.\n  Consumers of healthcare and academia are involved in reducing errors \nin patient care as well. Examples of these include: ``The Leapfrog \nGroup'' an initiative driven by organizations that buy health care that \nare working to initiate breakthrough improvements in the safety, \nquality and affordability of healthcare; and the Institute for \nHealthcare Improvement, led by an original IOM panel member, Dr. Don \nBerwick, which has provided seminal work advancing the goals of patient \nsafety. All of these efforts deserve our gratitude because without them \ndeaths and injuries stemming from medical errors would continue to \nincrease.\n  However, many of the organizations currently collecting patient \nsafety data have expressed the need for legal protections that will \nallow them to review protected information so that they may collaborate \nin the development and implementation of patient safety improvement \nstrategies.\n  The work of Lucien Leape, another member of the IOM panel and adjunct \nprofessor of health policy at Harvard University, has supported this \nview. Dr. Leape has argued persuasively that we, as a society, will \ncontinue to have difficulty reducing medical errors and improving \npatient safety because our institutions are ``still locked into a blame \nand punish approach to errors and a focus on individual culpability . . \n.'' in turn, ``the fear of malpractice litigation thus becomes a major \nbarrier to openly discussing and reporting errors.''\n  To respond to these needs, I and several of our colleagues have for \nmany years introduced legislation that would promote the open \ndiscussion of medical errors that is so needed to curb these needless \ndeaths and injuries. Last year, this legislation passed the Senate \nunanimously, but unfortunately, a conference with our House colleagues \nnever occurred.\n  This Congress, I reintroduced S. 544, the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act, with the bipartisan support of Senators Gregg, \nBingaman, Enzi, Frist, and Murray. Our group was soon joined in this \neffort by Senators Sessions, Landrieu and Collins. Early in this \nsession, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nunanimously passed S. 544. To Chairman Enzi's great credit, he \nrecognized the significance of this legislation early-on and, enlisting \nthe support of Senator Kennedy, led the way to resolving differences \nbetween S. 544 and language that was being considered by our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives. Together, these Members worked \nuntiringly to hone and improve this legislation, which resulted in its \nconsideration by, and the unanimous support of, our colleagues last \nnight.\n  The legislation raises expectations for higher standards for \ncontinuous patient safety improvement and it encourages a new and \nneeded culture of patient safety among health care providers and \nAmerican hospitals. The bill accomplishes these goals by establishing \nappropriate legal protections for patient safety information \nvoluntarily shared among patient safety organizations and providers. \nOur legislation reflects the belief that a culture of patient safety \ncan flourish best in an environment where information, data, processes, \nand recommendations enjoy legal protection and privilege.\n  Because it appropriately addresses an obvious need and concern, the \nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act has enjoyed widespread \nendorsement by hospital, patient, doctor, and consumer advocacy \norganizations. This degree of support underscores the broad appeal and \nessential nature of this proposed legislation.\n  In the time since the release of To Err is Human, the Congress has \nbeen unable to enact sensible legislation to reduce medical errors and \nincrease patient safety. In that time, assuming that the IOM data are \naccurate, approximately one-half million more individuals have died and \ncountless others have experienced significant injuries through medical \nerrors.\n  With the leadership of Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy we have met \nto work out differences with our colleagues in the House and it too \nwill soon consider legislation. I am encouraged that we have reconciled \ndisagreements that have previously stopped this legislation from moving \nforward and I hope the House will act favorably so that this \nlegislation can become law.\n  We need to apply Hippocrates' admonition to ``first, do no harm'' \nbeyond the medical community to the legislative community. We need to \npass legislation now that will help the health care community stop the \nneedless injury caused by unintentional medical errors.\n  Of course, we also live in a complex society--one in which medical \nerrors that may have harmed a patient might also be the basis for \nlitigation. It is a right under our laws to seek a remedy when harmed, \nand we need to preserve access to certain information for this redress \nof grievances.\n  However, an unfortunate consequence of living in a litigious society \nis that hospitals and providers often feel that it's not in their best \ninterests to share information openly and honestly. We know, in fact, \nthat their attorneys and risk managers often advise them not to do so. \nSo, in order for our system to work, it needs to balance these \nsometimes competing demands.\n  I believe the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act strikes this \nbalance. It calls for the creation of new entities we call Patient \nSafety Organizations that would collect voluntarily reported data in \nthe form of patient safety workproducts. This bill provides the \nprotections of confidentiality and privilege to that patient safety \ndata--but this bill also sets definite limitations on what can be \nconsidered confidential and privileged.\n  This legislation does nothing to reduce or affect other Federal, \nState or\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\nlocal legal requirements pertaining to health related information. Nor \ndoes this bill alter any existing rights or remedies available to \ninjured patients. The bottom line is that this legislation neither \nstrengthens nor weakens the existing system of tort and liability law.\n  Instead, the legislation before us creates a new, parallel system of \ninformation collection and analysis, designed to educate our doctors \nand protect patients' safety everywhere. This bill reflects difficult \nnegotiations and many compromises over almost 5 years of consideration. \nThrough the contributions of Members on both sides of the aisle, this \nlegislation has been greatly strengthened since I first introduced it \nback in the 106th Congress.\n  I offer my appreciation to the many contributions from several \ncolleagues who have worked to reach an agreement on this legislation. \nBut I believe Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy deserve special \nrecognition in their efforts to reach a consensus and so I commend them \nonce again. I also want to commend the work of Chairman Barton and that \nof the Dean of the House, Representative Dingell, for their work to \naddress our differences. It is my true hope that they can persuade \ntheir colleagues to favorably consider this bill.\n  When a significant bill makes its way through the many hoops of the \nlegislative process and is destined to be signed into law, as I believe \nthis one is, we have a custom in the Senate that we take a moment to \nacknowledge those whose work on that measure often has made difference \nbetween success and failure.\n  Chainnan Enzi's staff, Katherine McGuire, Steve Northrup, and \nespecially Andrew Patzman deserve many thanks for their contributions \nand for reflecting so well the leadership of the Chairman. From Senator \nKennedy's office Michael Myers' commitment to this effort over the many \nyears has often served to keep discussions going and David Bowen has \nonce again demonstrated his ability to find common ground on difficult \nissues. Vince Ventimiglia and Peggy Binzer of Senator Gregg's office \ndeserve special acknowledgement, not only for ``advancing the ball'' \nthroughout the last Congress, but also for the legal expertise and \ninsights they brought to the process.\n  The majority leader has been a partner in this effort from the very \nbeginning and Dean Rosen and Liz Hall have contributed both their \nsubject expertise and their legislative navigational skills. Bruce \nLesley of Senator Bingaman's office and Anne Grady with Senator Murray \nled the way with improvements to the bill that helped start its way \ndown the bipartisan path to success. Finally, I want to commend Sean \nDonohue, of my staff, for his contributions to the bill and also to his \ntenacious commitment over several years to get this legislation \nenacted.\n  We legislate on many issues in the Congress, but it is not often we \ncan say that what we do makes a difference as a matter of life and \ndeath. Patient safety, however, is one of those issues. When this \nlegislation is signed into law, everyone that has worked to improve it \ncan know that, in this instance, they have made that difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8744-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LONG-TERM CARE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Department of Veterans Affairs is to be \napplauded for facilitating a conference on the role of medical foster \nhomes. The conference is titled: ``Medical Foster Home: A New Choice \nfor Long-Term Care.'' The conference kicks of tomorrow in Little Rock, \nAR.\n  I also want to applaud the conference participants for taking time to \nattend the conference. We truly must be open to new ideas about how VA \ncan care for veterans in need of long-term care. In my view, medical \nfoster homes are an important part of the equation.\n  We know that today VA is facing tremendous demand for long-term care. \nIn the years ahead, demand will explode. Yet the President's budget \nincludes significant cuts to long-term care programs. The goal seems to \nreduce VA's workload and shift the burden elsewhere. But where are \nveterans to go?\n  Should VA be cutting back at a time when demand is growing? Should \nthese cuts target needed nursing home and state home beds? According to \nthe President's budget proposal, the answer is yes.\n  There is another side to this story: there are places on the VA \nlandscape where some truly wonderful things are happening to keep \nveterans well cared for and in the setting of their choice. Good \nprograms must be fostered.\n  Indeed, there are VA clinicians who, in grappling with the demand, \nhave not waited but have found some innovative solutions. I am always \ndeeply gratified by the level of dedication and innovation of VA \nemployees, and I salute those who have moved forward.\n  One such good program is the medical foster home program in Arkansas. \nIn 2002, Tom McClure testified before the Senate VA Committee about the \nfoster home program. I know that all the Members of the Committee were \namazed at the success of the program--despite some of the snags he has \nfaced along the way. Nearly 3 years later, it seems VA is finally ready \nto advance the concept.\n  For my part, I recently introduced legislation to develop a medical \nfoster home program on the Island of Oahu in Hawaii. While we have a \nwonderful VA nursing home--the Center on Aging, it only has 60 beds. \nUnfortunately, community nursing homes have few beds, as well. So, it \nis absolutely critical that Hawaii's veterans be provided with needed \nlong-term care.\n  More and more veterans are seeking alternatives to nursing homes. \nThey want to remain in the community. With the right kind of support \nand care from VA, they are able to do so--even with chronic and \ndebilitating conditions. I do want to say that for many veterans, \nhowever, non-institutional options will not work; and because of this \nCongress is on record stating that VA must have sufficient nursing home \ncapacity.\n  It is vital that VA's role as a model for long-term care be \nrecognized and rewarded, because we will have enormous problems with \ndemand for this care in the years ahead. The only entity of any scope, \nsize, or capacity that is dealing with how to meet the needs of an \nolder population is VA. This role of VA must be highlighted and \nsupported.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8744-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n\n                                 grants\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nCity of Chico as they celebrate the 100th Anniversary of Bidwell Park, \nwhich is a significant part of Chico's identity and its crown jewel.\n  Bidwell Park was established in July of 1905 when Annie Bidwell, wife \nof Chico's founding father, John Bidwell, gave the City 1,902 acres of \ntheir ranch, Rancho del Arroyo Chico. Since that time, the City has \npurchased additional land enlarging the park to its present day size of \n3,670 acres, making it the largest municipal park per capita in the \nUnited States.\n  Bidwell Park has a long history with the people of Chico and \nsurrounding areas in Northern California. Some of America's classic \nmovies such as the Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Errol Flynn, Gone \nwith the Wind and Red Badge of Courage were filmed in Bidwell Park \nusing the Park's natural setting and wild landscape as a backdrop.\n  Today, the City of Chico estimates that there are between 150,000 and \n200,000 visits to Bidwell Park every year. Citizens who visit the Park \ncan take advantage of wide-ranging recreational opportunities such as \ncooling off in one of the countless swimming holes or making the most \nof approximately 72 miles of trails for hiking, horseback riding and \nmountain biking.\n  Bidwell Park also serves as an ideal venue for numerous community \nevents such as Chico's 4th of July Community Celebration held at the \nOne-Mile Recreation Area and the Annual Shakespeare in the Park Series \nas well as the hundreds of family gatherings, weddings and company \npicnics.\n  I would like to especially recognize the work done by the Bidwell \nPark Centennial Committee and their Co-Chairs Tom Barrett and Chico \nCity Councilmember Ann Schwab for their tireless efforts organizing the \nscores of events commemorating Bidwell Park's 100th birthday.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the contributions of the \nBidwell Park Centennial Supporters and volunteers, especially the Chico \nCreek Nature Center, for all of their time and resources that \nillustrate the possibilities that can be realized when public and \nprivate interests come together for the benefit of the community.\n  Again let me say congratulations to the City of Chico and all of the \npeople participating in events celebrating Bidwell Park's centennial \nyear. You should feel proud of all that you are doing and I wish you \nthe very best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8745-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DO THE WRITE THING CHALLENGE 2005\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the ``Do the Write Thing Challenge'' \nis a national writing contest that gives middle school students the \nopportunity to express themselves about community problems including \nguns, gangs, drugs, and violence. The students are asked to identify \nactions they can take to help address such problems.\n  The Do the Write Thing Challenge, or DtWT, was created in 1994 and is \nsponsored by the National Campaign to Stop Violence. DtWT currently \noperates in 22 cities and counties, including Detroit, MI. In 2005, \nmore than 32,000 students nationwide participated in DtWT by written \nsubmissions and by pledging not to engage in violence. Since its \ncreation, more than 145,000 students have participated in the DtWT \nChallenge.\n  The national DtWT finalists from each participating jurisdiction \nrecently came to Washington, DC to talk to lawmakers about youth \nviolence and its impact on their lives. In addition, the finalists were \nhonored by the National Campaign to Stop Violence at a national \nrecognition ceremony. Among those honored were Samantha Medina and \nMichael Henderson of Detroit, MI.\n  Samantha and Michael both addressed the issue of gun violence in \ntheir writings. In her poem, Samantha wrote about the constant threat \nthat guns pose to her family and friends. Michael wrote a personal \nessay about two friends and an uncle who were murdered by criminals \nusing guns. Both students also chose to write about the importance of \nnonviolent solutions in resolving conflict and how the actions of \nindividuals impact the safety of their entire community.\n  I congratulate Samantha and Michael, and the other DtWT national \nfinalists as well as all of the participants across America for their \nachievements and efforts to eliminate violence from the areas where \nthey live. I believe Congress can do more to support their efforts. \nSeveral pieces of legislation which would increase the number of police \nofficers on our streets, increase resources for school and community \nviolence prevention programs, and make it more difficult for criminals \nto obtain powerful weapons are currently awaiting further consideration \nin the Senate. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass these bills to \nmake our families and communities more safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8745-3", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8745-4", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8745-5", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on July 21, 2005, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following concurrent \nresolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to strengthen programs relating to ocean, coastal, \nand Great Lakes science training by providing coordination of efforts, \ngreater interagency cooperation, and the strengthening and expansion of \nrelated programs administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, and to diversify the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \nscience community by attracting underrepresented groups; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nenhance science education for kids of all ages--including my age.\n  This bill capitalizes upon the natural allure of our oceans and \ncoastlines to spark an interest in science. This will improve the \ngeneral science literacy of Americans, which is a key to remaining \ncompetitive in today's global economy.\n  The bill will also foster a deeper appreciation of our oceans and \nfragile coastal environment. As the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, \nOcean Commission, pointed out in a report last year, our oceans and \ntheir resources are in trouble. Fishery stocks are declining . . . \ndevelopment is changing our coastal environments . . . and water \nquality has become a problem in many areas.\n  We won't solve these challenges overnight. The future of our oceans \nand coastal regions rests with young people--so we must nurture their \ninterest in ocean and coastal science.\n  The Ocean Commission also pointed out that the level of science \nknowledge among graduating high school seniors is well below other \nnations. We must bridge this science gap. And one of the best ways to \nget kids excited about science is by drawing on their own experiences \nof our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. Kids are captivated by marine \nscience. Their eyes light up when you show them an octopus squirting \nink, a porpoise leaping out of the water, or an ocean wave pounding the \nshore.\n  The bill we are introducing today, Ocean and Coastal Literacy in \nUrban and other Environments--or Ocean CLUE--will ensure that our \nstudents have an opportunity to learn about the ocean.\n  Agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA), the National Science Foundation and NASA already have wonderful \nocean education programs. Ocean CLUE will provide a Task Force to \ncoordinate these activities and help shape a national ocean and coastal \neducation strategy.\n  Our bill will also create a program within NOAA that will complement \nexisting programs and satisfy an area of need identified by the Ocean \nCommission: minority representation in ocean and coastal careers.\n  Our new K-12 program will also focus on urban areas. Though many \ncoastal problems can be traced far up watersheds to suburban and rural \nwatersheds, problems are often most acute in population centers. This \nnew urban focus will complement existing ocean and coastal science \nprograms. My hope is that any science teacher nationwide will be able, \nwith the click of a mouse, to easily find an ocean and coastal \neducation program that perfectly suits their needs.\n  Our oceans are one of the greatest legacies we will bequeath to our \nchildren and grandchildren. We must also bequeath to them the knowledge \nand training to manage this crucial resource. This bill will do that.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who are co-sponsoring this legislation: \nSenators Inouye, Boxer, Levin, and Sarbanes.\n  I ask Unanimous Consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1465\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The coastal regions and ocean waters of the United \n     States are vital to the Nation's public safety, homeland \n     security, transportation, trade, energy production, \n     recreation and tourism, food production, scientific research \n     and education, environmental and human health, and historical \n     and cultural heritage.\n       (2) Development, resource extraction, and other human \n     activities throughout watersheds, coupled with an expanding \n     coastal population, are contributing to processes of \n     environmental change that may significantly threaten the \n     long-term health and sustainability of ocean, coastal, and \n     Great Lakes ecosystems.\n       (3) The United States Commission on Ocean Policy reports \n     that United States high school graduates' scientific literacy \n     is below the international average and finds that exciting \n     ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes sciences and education has \n     the potential to stem the tide of science illiteracy in the \n     Nation.\n       (4) Development and implementation of ocean, coastal, and \n     Great Lakes literacy programs are essential to ensure a \n     public that is fully knowledgeable about, fully informed \n     about, and fully capable of decisions contributing to ocean, \n     coastal, and Great Lakes issues.\n       (5) Development and implementation of education and \n     training programs are essential to build a national \n     scientific, technological, and engineering workforce fully \n     representative of the Nation's citizens that meets the needs \n     of growing ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes economies and \n     better prepares the Nation for competition in the global \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\n       (6) Those involved in ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n     policy and sciences are not fully representative of the \n     Nation's citizens, with only 10 percent of United States \n     graduate students in marine sciences from underrepresented \n     groups.\n       (7) A coordinated program of ocean and coastal science \n     education would assist the Nation and the world in furthering \n     knowledge of the ocean and the global climate system, \n     ensuring homeland and national security, developing \n     innovative marine products, improving weather and climate \n     forecasts, improving human health, strengthening management \n     and sustainable use of ocean and coastal resources, \n     increasing the safety and efficiency of maritime operations, \n     and protecting the environment and mitigate man-made and \n     natural hazards.\n       (8) Seven of the 10 most populated urban centers in the \n     United States are located along our marine, estuarine, and \n     Great Lakes coasts, and a coordinated program of education \n     specifically focused on urban coastal issues, including urban \n     stakeholders, would focus national attention on the unique \n     challenges faced by urban coastal communities.\n       (9) Increased Federal cooperation and investment are \n     essential to build on ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \n     research and education activities that are taking place \n     within numerous federal, state, and local agencies, academic \n     institutions and industries and to establish new partnerships \n     for sharing ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes science \n     resources, intellectual talent, and facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1992 to provide for the \nrestoration, protection, and enhancement of the environmental integrity \nand social and economic benefits of the Anacostia Watershed in the \nState of Maryland and the District of Columbia; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleagues Senators Mikulski, Landrieu, Warner and \nAllen to bolster efforts to restore the Anacostia River.\n  I spoke during the 108th Congress about the need for this legislation \nand I want to underscore the principal reasons today. The Anacostia \nRiver is a resource rich in history and with tremendous natural \nresource and recreational potential. It is home to 43 species of fish, \nsome 200 species of birds, as well as more than 800,000 people whose \nneighborhoods border the watershed. Flowing through Montgomery and \nPrince George's Counties in Maryland and emptying into the Potomac at \nthe District of Columbia, the watershed consists of a 176 square mile \ndrainage area. One of the most urbanized watersheds in the United \nStates, the Anacostia suffers a series of problems including trash, \ntoxic pollution from urban runoff, sewage pollution from leaking sewer \nlines and combined sewer overflows, sediment pollution from erosion, \nand loss of fish and wildlife and recreational resources. It is a \nresource that has long been abused and neglected, but one that, in my \nview, can and must be protected and restored.\n  Efforts to begin rejuvenating the Anacostia watershed began formally \nin 1987 when the State of Maryland, Montgomery and Prince George's \nCounties, and the District of Columbia signed an Anacostia Watershed \nRestoration Agreement. The Agreement authorized the Washington Area \nCouncil of Governments, COG, to manage the restoration program and the \nInterstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, ICPRB, to protect the \nresources and facilitate public participation. COG created an Anacostia \nWatershed Restoration Committee, AWRC, to coordinate and implement \nrestoration projects throughout the watershed. Since that time, local, \nState, and Federal Government agencies, as well as the Anacostia \nWatershed Society, the Anacostia Citizens Advisory Committee and other \nenvironmental organizations and dedicated private citizens have \ncontributed significant resources toward re-establishing the Anacostia \nwatershed ecosystem.\n  Thanks to this cooperative and coordinated Federal, State, local and \nprivate effort, we are beginning to make some progress in restoring the \nwatershed. A Six Point Action Plan was signed in 1991 setting ambitious \nand broad-reaching goals for the river's restoration. In 1993 we \ncelebrated the successful restoration of 32 acres of emergent tidal \nwetlands by the Army Corps of Engineers at Kenilworth marsh. The \nproject has shown significant results in improving tidal water flow \nthrough the marsh, and reducing the concentration of nitrogen and \nphosphorus in the area and demonstrates what can be achieved in urban \nriver restoration. There have been other success stories as well in \nurban stream restoration in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, \nremoving barriers to fish passage and reforestation efforts throughout \nthe watershed, to name only a few. In 1999, a new Anacostia Watershed \nAgreement was signed to strengthen the regional governmental commitment \nto Anacostia restoration. There are today more than 60 local, State and \nFederal agencies involved in Anacostia watershed restoration. And more \nthan $100 million has been spent cleaning up the river. There is \nclearly much for which we can all be proud. But the job of restoring \nthe Anacostia watershed is far from complete. The Anacostia is still \none of North America's most endangered and threatened rivers. It is \ndesignated one of three ``regions of concern'' for toxics in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed.\n  The legislation which we are introducing authorizes more than $200 \nmillion in Federal assistance over the next 10 years to restore the \nAnacostia. Of these funds, $170 million is authorized to address the \nbiggest pollution problems in the watershed--storm water runoff and \nfailing waste-water infrastructure. As the builder of much of\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nthe original infrastructure and a major user, the Federal Government \nhas an important responsibility to help stem the flow of this pollution \nand comply with the Clean Water Act. The remaining funds will allow the \nAdministrator of EPA, working together with an ``Anacostia Watershed \nCouncil'' of State and local officials, to develop a comprehensive \nenvironmental protection and resource management plan for the \nwatershed, for several Federal agencies to join in the implementation \nof the plan.\n  The Anacostia River suffers from centuries of impacts and changes. \nOnce a healthy, thriving river, it is today severely degraded. This \nlegislation is urgently needed if we are to achieve the goal of making \nthe Anacostia and its tributaries swimmable and fishable again. It is \nmy hope that provisions of this measure will be included in the \nreauthorization of the Water Resources Development Act and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1473. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na business credit against income for the purchase of fishing safety \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Commercial \nFishermen Safety Act of 2005, a bill to help fishermen purchase the \nlife-saving safety equipment they need to survive when disaster \nstrikes. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing this legislation. \nSenator Kennedy has been a leader in the effort to sustain our \nfisheries and to maintain the proud fishing tradition that exists in \nhis State and mine.\n  Recent portrayals of the commercial fishing industry in film and in \nliterature have provided the American public with glimpses of the \nchallenges and dangers associated with earning a living from the sea. \nThese stories and movies merely scratch the surface of what it is like \nto be a modern-day fisherman. Everyday, members of our fishing \ncommunities struggle to cope with the pressures of running a small \nbusiness, complying with burdensome regulations, and maintaining their \nvessels and equipment. Added to these challenges are the dangers \nassociated with fishing, where disaster can strike, often without \nnotice.\n  Year-in and year-out, commercial fishing ranks among the Nation's \nmost dangerous occupations, often as the most dangerous occupation. \nBetween the years of 1992, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began \ncompiling occupational safety statistics, and 2003, 756 commercial \nfishing-related fatalities have been documented. This profession is \nroughly 30 times more dangerous than the average occupation.\n  Too often, commercial fishing has proved tragic throughout our \ncoastal waters including the north Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and the \nnorth Atlantic. The New England fishing community is no stranger to \nheartbreak. The 2004-2005 winter proved no exception, with the December \n20, 2004 sinking of the Northern Edge. Five fishermen were lost during \nthis incident, which was the worst loss of life in the New England \nfishing community since 1991. One fisherman, Pedro Furtado, was saved \nwhen the Northern Edge went down. Pedro was able to locate a life raft, \nto which he clung for half an hour in high winds and freezing \ntemperatures before being rescued by the crew of a nearby scallop boat. \nThis incident could have been even more tragic, if vital lifesaving \nsafety equipment were not at hand.\n  Not all disasters at sea end with a loss of life. Fishermen also tell \nstories of dramatic rescues, stories that all have something in common: \nsafety equipment. On February 9, 2005, a 38-foot gillnet vessel, \nHollywood, sank 45 miles off of Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Aboard this \nboat were three fishermen, all of who survived. These men survived \ndespite 40 degree water temperatures. Two of the three crew members \nwere wearing survival suits, and they all were able to get into a life \nraft before the boat sank.\n\n  Tragedy has again visited the New England fishing community. This \nmonth alone, two New England vessels have sank, during a time of year \nthat is generally not as hazardous for the industry. On the evening of \nJuly 13, the Sirius sank 25 miles south of Matinicus Island, Maine. \nSadly, the captain of the Sirius was lost. Fortunately, the two \nremaining crew members were rescued by fellow fishermen. Just four, \nshort days later, another fishing vessel, Princess, sank off of \nChatham, Massachusetts. Fortunately, the entire crew of this vessel was \nrescued, due in no small part to their safety equipment.\n  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety \nequipment. The requirements vary depending on factors such as the size \nof the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the \nvessel travels from shore to fish.\n  Required equipment can include a life raft that automatically \ninflates and floats free, should the vessel sink; personal flotation \ndevices or immersion suits which help protect fishermen from exposure \nand increase buoyancy: EPIRBs, which relay a downed vessel's position \nto Coast Guard Search and Rescue Personnel; visual distress signals; \nand fire extinguishers.\n  When an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other \ntimes, the cost of purchasing or maintaining this equipment must \ncompete with other expenses such as loan payments, fuel, wages, \nmaintenance, and insurance. Meeting all of these obligations is made \nmore difficult by a regulatory framework that uses measures such as \ntrip limits, days at sea, and gear alterations to manage our marine \nresources.\n  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2005 lends a hand to fishermen \nattempting to prepare in case disaster strikes. My bill provides a tax \ncredit equal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to purchase \nor maintain required safety equipment. The tax credit is capped at \n$1500. Items such as EPIRBs and immersion suits cost hundreds of \ndollars, while life rafts can reach into the thousands. The tax credit \nwill make life-saving equipment more affordable for more fishermen, who \ncurrently face limited options under the federal tax code.\n  Safety equipment saves lives in an occupation that has suffered far \ntoo many tragedies. By extending a tax credit for the purchase of \nfederally required safety equipment, Congress can help ensure that \nfishermen have a better chance of returning home each and every time \nthey head out to sea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8752-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8752-S8753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 205--HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF CONSTANTINO \n BRUMIDI AND RECOGNIZING HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED STATES ON THE \n                     200TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Frist, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Reid) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 206\n\n       Whereas psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic, \n     immune-mediated diseases for which there is no cure;\n       Whereas more than 5,000,000 men, women, and children in the \n     United States have been diagnosed with either psoriasis or \n     psoriatic arthritis;\n       Whereas psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are painful and \n     disabling diseases that have a significant and adverse impact \n     on the quality of life of an individual diagnosed with either \n     of these diseases;\n       Whereas the National Institute of Mental Health funded a \n     study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical \n     and mental disability as other major diseases, including \n     cancer, arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n     depression;\n       Whereas psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n     depression and suicidal ideation;\n       Whereas each year the people of the United States spend \n     more than $4,000,000,000 to treat psoriasis;\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic \n     arthritis may help prevent irreversible joint damage; and\n       Whereas treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents \n     a challenge for patients and physicians because no 1 \n     treatment works for everyone, some treatments lose \n     effectiveness over time, many treatments are used in \n     combination with other treatments, and all treatments may \n     cause a unique set of side effects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates August 2005 as \n     ``Psoriasis Awareness Month''.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the junior Senator from Oregon in \nsubmitting a resolution designating August 2005 as Psoriasis Awareness \nMonth. This awareness month will increase public knowledge about \npsoriasis and aid in efforts in the medical community to diagnose, \ntreat, and eventually cure the disease.\n  Psoriasis is a non-contagious, immune-mediated, lifelong skin \ndisorder. The source of psoriasis is believed to have a genetic \ncomponent which triggers a faster growth cycle of skin cells that \nresults in buildup; however, the exact cause is unknown. The severity \nof psoriasis can vary from person to person. For most people, the \ndisease appears as raised, red patches or lesions covered with a \nsilvery white buildup of dead skin cells, called scale.\n  Psoriatic arthritis is a condition associated with psoriasis. This \ndisease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints and connective \ntissue, which causes stiffness, pain, swelling and tenderness of the \njoints and the tissue around them. Without treatment, psoriatic \narthritis can be potentially disabling and crippling. Approximately 10 \nto 30 percent of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis.\n  Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have been diagnosed in more than 5 \nmillion men, women and children in the United States. Each year, the \nUnited States spends $4 billion dollars to treat this lifelong disease. \nFurthermore, about 56 million hours of work are lost each year by \npeople who suffer from psoriasis, and the National Institute of Mental \nHealth has found that psoriasis can cause as much physical and mental \ndisability as other major diseases.\n  Researchers are still searching for a cure for psoriasis. In the \nmeantime, we must continue to support such efforts and raise public \nawareness of the symptoms and available treatments for psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis. I hope that my colleagues will join me in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8753-2", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 45--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n    NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE AWARENESS MONTH, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nVitter, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Johnson) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

This route is ideal for drug trafficking \n     because of its geographic expanse, numerous law enforcement \n     jurisdictions, and fragmented investigative efforts.\n       (3) The tethered aerostat system in Lajas, Puerto Rico \n     contributes to deterring and detecting smugglers moving \n     illicit drugs into Puerto Rico. The range and operational \n     capabilities of the aerostat system allow it to provide \n     surveillance coverage of the eastern Caribbean corridor and \n     the strategic waterway between Puerto Rico and the Dominican \n     Republic, known as the Mona Passage.\n       (4) Including maritime radar on the Lajas aerostat will \n     expand its ability to detect suspicious vessels in the \n     eastern Caribbean corridor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress and the Department of Defense should fully \n     fund the Counter-Drug Tethered Aerostat program; and\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\n       (2) Congress and the Department of Defense should install \n     maritime radar on the Lajas, Puerto Rico, aerostat system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1428.

Camporees at the United States \n     Military Academy for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts provide \n     similar training opportunities on a smaller scale.\n       (2) Support.--Section 2554 of title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall provide at least \n     the same level of support under this section for a national \n     or world Boy Scout Jamboree as was provided under this \n     section for the preceding national or world Boy Scout \n     Jamboree.\n       ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may waive paragraph (1), if \n     the Secretary--\n       ``(A) determines that providing the support subject to \n     paragraph (1) would be detrimental to the national security \n     of the United States; and\n       ``(B) reports such a determination to the Congress in a \n     timely manner, and before such support is not provided.''.\n       (d) Equal Access for Youth Organizations.--Section 109 of \n     the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     5309) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (b) by inserting \n     ``or (e)'' after ``subsection (a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Equal Access.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `youth \n     organization' means any organization described under part B \n     of subtitle II of title 36, United States Code, that is \n     intended to serve individuals under the age of 21 years.\n       ``(2) In general.--No State or unit of general local \n     government that has a designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum and that is a recipient of \n     assistance under this chapter shall deny equal access or a \n     fair opportunity to meet to, or discriminate against, any \n     youth organization, including the Boy Scouts of America or \n     any group officially affiliated with the Boy Scouts of \n     America, that wishes to conduct a meeting or otherwise \n     participate in that designated open forum, limited public \n     forum, or nonpublic forum.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/07/22/senate-section/article/S8765-1", "month": "07", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M., MONDAY, JULY 25, 2005\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
