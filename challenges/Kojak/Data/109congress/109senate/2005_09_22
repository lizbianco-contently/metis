Madam President, I would like to take a moment and \ncomment about an important program that I worked to include in the 2002 \nfarm bill. I wish to engage Chairman Bennett, manager of the fiscal \nyear 2006 Agriculture appropriations bill, in a colloquy regarding the \nFarmers Market Promotion Program.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed its Agriculture \nappropriations bill, which includes $1 million in funding for the \nFarmers Market Promotion Program. As the Senate wraps up its work on \nthe pending bill and looks ahead to conference, I would like to request \nthat the chairman do all he can in those negotiations to secure full \nfunding for this important program.\n  Authorized in section 10605 of the 2002 farm bill, the Farmers Market \nPromotion Program would provide critical Federal grant dollars to local \ngovernments, chambers of commerce, farmers market alliances, coops, and \neconomic development organizations to support the expansion, \ndevelopment and maintenance of farmers markets and other direct \nmarketing opportunities. An initial investment of $1 million will help \nto get this program up and running, bringing critical resources to \ncommunities nationwide.\n  I make this request of the chairman understanding the budget \npressures and competing interests within this bill. I would like to say \nat this time, however, this $1 million would be very well spent. \nConsumers are demanding locally grown farm raised agricultural products \nand producers want to meet this demand. In my State and across the \nNation exciting things are happening in the area of new markets for \nagricultural products, but many communities lack the needed seed money \nto get off of the ground.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Iowa and ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, as well as member of \nthe subcommittee of jurisdiction over this bill, raises some important \npoints about funding in the bill. I will work with Senator Harkin in \nconference to address this issue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am grateful to the Chair and thank him again for his \nskillful work at crafting a bill that can be supported by the full \nSenate.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I thank Chairman Cochran for taking the \ntime to have this very serious discussion with me about a life saving \nproposal that I believe needs to become part of this bill before it is \npassed into law.\n  The proposal, originally suggested by President Bush, would allow a \nsmall percentage of U.S. food aid dollars to be used to purchase food \nlocally in the country or region of a food aid crisis until U.S. food \naid can arrive. For example, if there is a food crisis in Ethiopia, the \nU.S. Government would be able to purchase food in neighboring \ncountries, or even in other areas of Ethiopia where food is available, \nand use it to save lives until food shipped from the United States \ncould arrive. On average, U.S. food aid takes over 4 months to arrive \nin countries in need, and during that gap period, people die--children \ndie.\n  There is also another consideration that makes this proposal even \nmore imperative. U.S. food aid is stored in Galveston, TX, and 60 \npercent of our food aid shipments exit through the Gulf of Mexico. Now, \nwith Rita raging off the coast of Texas, several hundreds of millions \nof dollars of food aid are in the direct path of the storm.\n  Even if the food stores are not destroyed by this storm, the vessels \nthat were intended to transport the food aid have been sent out to sea \nand rail companies are not picking up additional commodities. This \nmeans the U.S. food aid delivery system is in a state of arrest. If we \ndo not provide a limited authority to purchase food locally until U.S. \nfood aid can arrive in countries suffering from a food shortage crisis, \nkids will starve to death as they wait for help to arrive. We cannot in \ngood conscience let that happen.\n  This is one of those rare times when we, as elected officials, have \nthe opportunity to take a step that directly saves lives. Make no \nmistake about it--if we fail to give the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment the flexibility to purchase food from local sources, our \nlack of action will prevent us from saving lives. Failing to act will \ncost the lives of thousands of suffering men, women, and children. I \ntrust that such a failure is simply not acceptable to my fellow \nSenators. It certainly is not acceptable to me.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Ohio for bringing this issue to \nmy attention and note his desire to provide funding for this new \nproposal to provide cash for in-country commodity purchasing. I want \nthe Senator to know that I will work with him throughout the conference \nnegotiations on this bill to address this issue.\n\n\n                        food assistance programs\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I rise today to express my deep concern with the state of \nour Nation's food assistance programs. In recent weeks our Nation has \nseen first hand the critical importance of food assistance programs in \nhelping our fellow Americans in times of need. After Hurricane Katrina, \nwith Hurricane Rita bearing down on the Texas coast, and with rising \nfuel costs, our ability to provide the resources needed by Americans \nneed of food assistance is threatened. This is a critical problem one I \nhave seen in the gulf States but also seen in Montana where many of my \nfellow Montanans rely on food assistance.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I join my colleague from Montana in expressing concern \nover the condition of the Nation's food assistance programs. I too \nbelieve that participation in these nutrition programs may increase due \nto the recent hurricane. I look forward to working with the Senator to \nprovide adequate funding to meet the demand for food assistance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate Chairman Cochran's understanding and \nconcern. I have seen some of the devastation in the gulf and want to \nexpress my sympathy and pledge my support to help. Montanans have seen \nthe devastation and like me, they have opened their arms and hearts to \nGulf State evacuees. I hope that the chairman will join me in pledging \nhis support for taking immediate action to help alleviate the critical \nneeds faced by Americans in the gulf as well as citizens across the \ncountry regarding food assistance. The Senate should act, and act now \nto provide Americans relying on food assistance assurance that the \nresources they rely upon will be there when they need it.\n  Mr. KOHL. I join my distinguished colleagues from Mississippi and \nMontana. Providing emergency funds for the food assistance programs in \nthis country is desperately required. Americans in the gulf, as well as \nmy home State of Wisconsin, should be provided the food assistance that \nthey need. Congress must act to address the essential needs of these \nAmericans by ensuring that the Nation's food banks, emergency feeding \nand other food assistance organizations have the resources they \nrequire.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise to speak about the fiscal year \n2006 Agriculture appropriations bill. I want\n\n[[Page S10329]]\n\nto begin by thanking Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl for their \nhard work on this important bill. They were given a tough assignment--\nto meet the needs of our rural communities in the context of a very \ntough budget picture. They have done a good job.\n  I have several amendments to this bill, and I know we have reached an \nagreement on two of them. I thank my colleagues and their staffs, Galen \nFountain and Fitz Elder for their help. I will discuss those amendments \nshortly.\n  I have spoken in this Chamber before about the forgotten America and, \nonce again, I stand here today to speak about my concern that we are \nnot doing everything we can on behalf of those farmers, ranchers and \nagri-businesses which continue to play a vital role in our Nation's \nrural communities.\n  I am concerned about these communities. Too often, Washington leaves \nthose communities to wither on the vine.\n  The administration has proposed reductions in farm commodity \nprograms, crop insurance, food assistance, rural development and \nconservation.\n  Just yesterday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that \nHurricane Katrina caused an estimated $900 million in farm losses, \nhowever according to reports, this estimate did not include long-term \ninfrastructure losses such as damaged barns, machinery, and fuel \nshortages.\n  The bill before us takes steps to send a message to rural America \nthat we are not forgetting that vital part of our country.\n  It invests 3 percent more than the House-passed bill.\n  It adds back many of the important investments that the President \nproposed cutting in his budget earlier this year.\n  There are also important investments for Colorado. Specifically, \nColorado State University in Fort Collins will receive $1.9 million in \nimportant agriculture research programming.\n  Colorado will see nearly $32 million in agricultural research and \nconservation projects, including $15 million in investment to fight \nnoxious weeds and funding for resource conservation and development \ncouncils.\n  I think we can do more, and we must do more, because it is not just \nWashington that forgets rural America. Consider this. Earlier today, I \ngot on the World Wide Web and googled gas prices on Google News. Sixty-\nfour pages came back with stories on the gas prices that are hurting \nthis country.\n  But through tens of pages of stories, I did not see a single story on \nthe impact of high gas on farmers and ranchers. I did see stories on: \nrising gas prices hurting commuters; rising gas prices hurting SUV \ndrivers; rising gas prices hurting local governments; rising gas prices \nhurting lottery sales; rising gas prices hurting pizza delivery prices; \nrising gas prices hurting golf travel plans; and rising gas prices \nhurting leaf watchers.\n  I have no doubt these high prices are hurting families in each of \nthese situations.\n  But I also know that now, today, this week, in the height of harvest \ntime, no one is hurt by gas prices more than farmers and ranchers.\n  Here is what I am hearing from my State. During harvest, agricultural \nproducers are some of the largest fuel consumers in the U.S. and \nproducers are facing enormous fuel costs. In Grand Junction, CO, diesel \nprices are as high as $3.16.\n  I have heard from one Colorado farmer in Kit Carson County who has \nestimated that in order to harvest this year, he will need an \nadditional $46,000 to cover fuel costs alone.\n  I have also heard from another farmer in northeastern Colorado who, \nin order to cover the increasing price of fuel, has applied for \nadditional loans at this bank only to be turned down because he is \nalready overextended with existing loans.\n  That is why I am so pleased this bill now includes my amendment to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the Secretary of \nEnergy to produce a comprehensive report on the impact of high gas \nprices on our farmers, ranchers and rural communities across the \ncountry. That data is the first step toward a comprehensive solution to \nhelping these communities address these terrible prices.\n  I am also pleased the bill now includes my amendment to call the \nSecretary's attention to an issue that is plaguing Colorado and the \nWest. I know that the chairman is acutely aware of this problem, and \nthank him and his staff for their support.\n  The Forest Service reports that during 2004, a total of 7 million \ntrees covering over 1.5 million acres, were killed by several different \ntypes of bark beetles throughout the State of Colorado.\n  Severely impacted counties in my State include: Grand, Jackson, \nRoutt, Summit, Eagle, Park, Chaffee, Pitkin, Saguache, Gunnison, \nHinsdale, San Miguel, Ouray, Delta, Montrose, Mesa, and Garfield.\n  Awareness of the bark beetle infestation has grown with the \nincreasing visual impact of the large stands of dead trees visible from \nI-70 and Colorado's resort communities.\n  These infestations will leave millions of acres of Colorado forests \nat risk of a catastrophic fire.\n  Regrettably, in the face of this challenge, the Secretary of \nAgriculture continues to underplay the importance of Forest Service \nfunding. I am thankful that my colleagues on the Interior \nappropriations subcommittee have done what they can in this budget \nenvironment to increase funding to fight pine beetles.\n  But we can do better. Consider this: total USFS funding down 11 \npercent from last year; forest health management funding is flat; \nfiscal year 2006 wildland fire management appropriated additional $25 \nmillion for forest health activities on Federal and State land, $15 M \nand $10 M, respectively).\n  That is why it is so important that we send this message to the \nSecretary today. He needs to help us be able to do more to fight this \nscourge. And this amendment today is the first step in that effort.\n  I will spend this upcoming weekend with my mother, on our family \nranch in the San Luis Valley and will lend a helping hand to the potato \nharvest on the farm. The people of that valley--like the people of \nrural communities across this great country--may not get the chance to \never come to Washington to see the work we do. Nonetheless, I hope, \nthat our work makes it to them, so that they can be assured that we \nhave not forgotten them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, earlier this month, the emerald ash borer \nwas positively detected in the Upper Peninsula of my home State of \nMichigan for the first time. Officials believe that this may be an \nisolated outbreak, and hope that it can be successfully contained.\n  Unfortunately, this is an aggressive pest that we in Michigan have \nbeen fighting for years, however we have had only limited success in \ncontaining the infestation in the past. It is believed that the ash \nborer was brought to Michigan about 6 years ago through the channels of \ninternational trade. What started as a local infestation in a few \ncounties in southeastern Michigan has grown to infest the entire Lower \nPeninsula. This find in a State park in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is \nsignificant because it shows that efforts and the resources provided \nuntil now have not been adequate to contain the pest.\n  While even as we speak, research is being conducted by some of our \nState's best experts on ways to kill the bug while saving our ash \ntrees, a lack of funding is hampering these efforts. Whatever funding \nis available must be balanced between research efforts and eradication \nand containment. For now, that means removing our ash trees. In \nMichigan alone, we are nearing 10 million trees removed. I cannot tell \nyou how distressing it is for communities which have been forced to \nremove trees and have little or no funding to replace them. Ann Arbor, \nnear the heart of the infestation and known for its beautiful downtown \ntree-lined streets, is increasing devoid of foliage, as is the case \nwith too many of our cities and towns.\n  The State of Michigan anticipated $30 million in Federal funding last \nyear for activities related to eradicating emerald ash borer. \nUnfortunately, they only received a third of that. This has severely \naffected our ability to do what is necessary to eradicate this pest. \nChipping of these downed trees has ground to a halt, and funding to \nenforce the State's wood quarantines has been strained. We cannot \ncontinue to hold back the spread of the ash borer on our own with such \nmeager funding.\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\n  This year, recognizing the serious threat that the ash borer poses to \nthe Nation, the administration requested $32 million for eradication \nefforts. However, the Senate bill before us provides only $5.96 million \nfor the efforts. This is simply far too inadequate.\n  The House of Representatives approved $14 million for emerald ash \nborer-related activities in their Agriculture appropriations bill. \nWhile this is still far below what is required, I believe it is a \npositive first step to providing the desperately needed funding to slow \nthe spread of the ash borer.\n  We must recognize that this is a nationwide problem that is \nunfortunately not receiving the recognition or support that it should. \nA handful of States where EAB has been detected cannot be expected to \ncontain the bug on their own forever. We have seen how quickly the ash \nborer has infested my State of Michigan, taking only 5 years to spread \nthroughout the Lower Peninsula. Without adequate resources, we face a \nserious threat to our ash stock. The further spread of the emerald ash \nborer would be economically devastating to my State, and possibly to \nmuch of the rest of the Nation.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate conferees to this bill will accept the \nHouse's level of $14 million for EAB eradication efforts.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate has \napproved H.R. 2744, the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill providing \nvital funding for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug \nAdministration and related agencies. While I may not support every \nprovision, this bill provides important funding to support our Nation's \nfarmers, rural communities, and conservation programs along with \nproviding nutritious food for seniors, children and those in need.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee rejected a number of \nadministration proposals to reduce or eliminate important programs such \nas funds for research at our land-grant colleges and universities, \nconservation partnerships through resource conservation and development \ncouncils, and funds to combat Johne's disease in our dairy industry. \nAll of these programs were funded at a minimum of last year's levels \ninstead of receiving drastic cuts.\n  After years of delay, I was encouraged that the Senate bill included \nfunds to implement mandatory country-of-origin labeling, COOL, for \nmeat, vegetables and fruits. Country-of-origin labeling is vitally \nimportant to enable our farmers to show their pride in the quality of \ntheir products, from ginseng to cheese to cranberries. Wisconsin \nfarmers are proud of their work, and many consumers want to support \nAmerican products--with country-of-origin labeling, both farmers and \nconsumers benefit. I urge the Senate conferees to insist on funding \nCOOL when they meet with the House conferees to resolve differences \nbetween the two Chambers' bills.\n  The Senate bill included over $18 million for efforts to control and \neradicate chronic wasting disease, CWD, in deer and elk. In addition to \nthis much needed funding, I also worked with Senator Allard to include \na provision that would require the Department of Agriculture to set \nminimum national standards for CWD control. Under the current system \nthere are various State regulations but no set of basic procedures \nguiding the movement, handling, testing and permitting of captive-\nraised deer and elk. Our amendment, that was included as part of the \nbill, requires the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service to publish \nits uniform methods and rules concerning CWD within 90 days of \nenactment of the provision. With CWD being newly discovered in New York \nand West Virginia, it is clear that this disease requires a national \nresponse. This provision is an important step to prevent the further \nspread of CWD and help deer and elk farmers operate safely throughout \nthe Nation.\n  High fuel costs are putting a squeeze on all Americans, but our \nfarmers are in a particularly vulnerable position. While the high fuel \ncosts are hitting them at many levels, they have little flexibility in \nwhether to plant and harvest their fields, pay to move their products \nto market or procure fertilizer and feed. More than that, they receive \nwhat the market dictates for their products, so when fuel costs double \nor triple and they see fuel surcharges on every one of their bills, \nthey can't pass these costs on and receive a higher price for their \nmilk, grain or other products. In recognition of this difficult \nsituation, I was proud to cosponsor an amendment offered by Senator \nSalazar that was included in the bill as a first step to addressing \nthis problem. The amendment requires the Department of Agriculture to \nstudy the issue and issue a report on the impact to farmers.\n  I also submitted an amendment to the bill to require the Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, to conduct a study on the levels of \npesticides in domestic and imported ginseng. With Wisconsin ginseng \nbeing highly prized worldwide for its quality and lack of unsafe \nresidues, mislabeled imported ginseng, often with high levels of \npesticide residues, remains a problem for our producers. This study \nwould have investigated this issue and provided important information \nto focus FDA's enforcement activities on reducing the amount of unsafe \nginseng being passed off as Wisconsin- or U.S.-grown and helping \ngrowers fight back against this unfair competition. I was disappointed \nthat I was blocked from having this amendment included in the bill. \nDespite this setback, I will continue to fight for better enforcement \nto protect consumers and Wisconsin's ginseng growers.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank Senator Bennett and Senator Kohl \nfor their efforts as floor managers of H.R. 2744, the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, and for their willingness to include in that \nlegislation an amendment that I offered along with Senators Harkin, \nReed, Carper, Biden, and Lieberman.\n  Our amendment, No. 1818, expresses the sense of the Congress that the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, should act within 1 year to issue \ncomprehensive labeling guidelines for over-the-counter, OTC, sunscreen \nproducts--a so-called ``final monograph.'' The FDA began work to \ndevelop such a monograph in 1978. In 2002, after 24 years, the agency \nissued a final monograph. Unfortunately, the final sunscreen monograph \nfailed to address one of the most critical aspects of sunscreens--how \nto measure protection against UVA rays, which are responsible for \ncausing skin cancer. Because the final monograph failed to address this \nkey issue, the FDA stayed it until a comprehensive monograph could be \nissued in order to avoid consumer confusion and the need for \nunnecessary product relabeling.\n  That stay was issued nearly 4 years ago, and the FDA has yet to issue \na comprehensive final monograph. Sunscreen manufacturers need clear \nguidance on product labeling in order to provide consumers with crucial \ninformation about the protective benefits of sunscreen products. \nStudies have shown that skin cancer rates continue to rise, especially \nin younger adults and women.\n  Furthermore, in the face of FDA inaction, States are poised to fill \nthe void, raising the specter of a patchwork of state labeling \nrequirements that could be confusing to consumers and unnecessarily \nburdensome to manufacturers. Pursuant to section 751 of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FFDCA, which was enacted in 1997, a \nFederal rule on sunscreen labeling would preempt any related State \nlabeling requirements. But this preemption does not apply in the \nabsence of a Federal rule. A recent decision by the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court held that, because there is no final FDA monograph for \nsunscreens, the FFDCA does not preempt California State labeling and \nadvertising laws. Consequently, California State law can require \nspecific labeling for sunscreens sold in California.\n  The FFDCA expresses Congress' view that national uniformity of \nsunscreen labels is important to providing all consumers with equal \naccess to valuable information about the need for sunscreens to reduce \nthe risk of skin cancer. As such, under Public Law 105-115, the Food \nand Drug Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997, Congress \nintended the FDA, which has the requisite scientific and medical \nexpertise, to prescribe labels for sunscreen products.\n  In March 1999, in a letter to FDA Commissioner Jane Henney, Senator \nReed and I expressed similar concerns about the agency's protracted \ndelay in issuing a comprehensive final OTC\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\nmonograph for sunscreen. Sadly, and much to the detriment of many \nAmericans who need clear, accurate, and comprehensive sunscreen \nlabeling as their first line of defense against skin cancer, little has \nbeen done by FDA since that time. Twenty-seven years is more than \nenough time for FDA to finalize this monograph. Again, I thank Senator \nBennett and Senator Kohl for their willingness to address this issue. I \nurge the FDA to act with all possible haste to finalize the OTC \nmonograph for sunscreen products, and to do so within the next year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to offer this amendment with \nSenators Murray, Obama and Akaka, and I thank Senators Feinstein and \nHutchison, as managers of this bill, for working with us to place some \nreasonable limitations on the review of disability claims for post-\ntraumatic stress disorder that is currently under way in the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting a review of 72,000 \ncases of veterans whom the VA has already rated at 100 percent \ndisability due to post-traumatic stress disorder. The reason for this \nreview is that the Inspector General of the VA recently found that the \nDepartment has, in the past, approved many PTSD disability claims \nwithout obtaining key documents from the veterans necessary to \ndemonstrate that the PTSD is connected to their military service. In \nother words, the VA failed to adequately confirm the facts of the case.\n  In many cases, however, many years have now passed since the \nDepartment rated the veteran as disabled and began providing disability \ncompensation. For many of these veterans suffering from the mental and \nemotional burdens of some very horrific experiences, that VA disability \ncheck may be their only source of income.\n  Now, the VA is re-opening these cases to determine if there was an \nerror in their collection of documentation, and if so, where and how \nthe error occurred.\n  Even if there was an error, however, that veteran is now dependent on \nthat income. The veteran should not now--years later--be punished with \na loss of their income due to the late discovery by the VA of its own \nerror.\n  For this reason, the amendment I am offering today prohibits the use \nof any appropriated funds to revoke or reduce a veteran's disability \ncompensation for post-traumatic stress disorder based on a finding that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs failed to collect justifying \ndocumentation, unless such failure was the direct result of fraud by \nthe applicant.\n  It is the intent of this amendment that the Department may conduct \nthis review if it provides a report to the Committee on Appropriations \non the plan for staffing and funding requirements. The Department \ncannot, however, correct its error by taking money away from veterans.\n  America's veterans deserve the undying gratitude of the people of \nthis Nation. America's veterans deserve speedy and accurate processing \nof their claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs. They do not \ndeserve to be given compensation one day, only to have it taken away \nyears later. Fortunately, the Senate is acting today to prevent that \nfrom happening.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, every morning, farmers and ranchers \nacross America wake up to do the hard work of growing crops, tending \nlivestock, and providing food that is safe, abundant and affordable.\n  Over 2 million American farms grow the food that feeds the world.\n  And today we will pass, with near unanimous support, the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, which helps America's farmers to be the most \nproductive in the world.\n  The Agriculture appropriations bill funds $100.7 billion for a wide \narray of Government agencies. Roughly 80 percent of the funding in this \nbill is for those programs referred to as ``entitlements.'' That \nincludes farm price support programs and funding for low-income, \ndomestic food assistance programs such as food stamps, school lunch, \nand other child nutrition programs.\n  The portion of this bill we refer to as ``discretionary'' includes \nsuch activities as rural development, rural housing, agriculture \nresearch, FDA, and most conservation programs. That portion represents \n$17.3 billion--less than a 3 percent increase over this year's funding.\n  Later today, the Department of Agriculture will release their most \ncurrent estimates on the agriculture damages caused by Hurricane \nKatrina. Preliminary estimates indicate that the loss of agricultural \nproduction in the area might be less than $1 billion. Small comfort to \nthe hard working people who have lost their livelihoods--shrimpers \nalong the coast who have lost their shrimp boats, broiler producers in \nMississippi who have lost their facilities.\n  But we do know that 8 of the 10 major export grain elevators near the \nPort of New Orleans are operational today. Three major floating rigs, \nwhich have comparable capacity to these elevators, are also \noperational.\n  Eighty percent of grain export capacity has been restored, and barge \nmovement is now increasing. Export grain delivery from the upper \nreaches of the Mississippi is catching up with these capacity numbers. \nThe real impact of Katrina on the agricultural sector will be the \nincreasing cost of energy and fertilizer costs.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the largest expenditure made by the USDA is \nfor food and nutrition programs. The appropriations bill provides $40.7 \nbillion for the Food Stamp Program; $12.4 billion for the school meal \nprograms; $5.3 billion for the Women and Infants and Children program. \nRural housing loan programs are allotted nearly $5 billion.\n  Another critical function of the USDA is to conduct research into \nimproving our farming and conservation methods.\n  The Department provides grants to local communities for a variety of \nrural development projects, ranging from electricity improvements, to \nwater infrastructure, waste management, broadband service, and energy \nefficiency.\n  During the August recess, I had the opportunity to meet with a group \nof county mayors back in my home State. Tennessee is a major grower of \ncotton, corn, and soybeans. This year, we are expected to produce 48 \nmillion bushels of soybeans on 1.2 million acres of farmland. The \nTennessee USDA office also predicts we will set a new State record for \ncotton production, at over 1.1 million bales.\n  While I was home meeting with the county mayors, we discussed \nTennessee's thriving farming business and what they need to help it \ngrow. Greater research into agricultural production was one area they \nhighlighted. The farm bill includes significant support for those \nefforts.nc1udes significant support for those efforts.\n  It includes: $2 million for Appalachian horticultural research, a \ncollaborative project between the USDA and University of Tennessee; \n$955,000 for research into the best way to protect soil and water \nquality on farms which can suffer from heavy erosion; and nearly $40 \nmillion for the boll weevil eradication program to help our cotton \nfarmers combat this destructive pest.\n  These programs, along with major funding for the USDA's rural \ndevelopment programs and housing services, are helping farmers around \nthe country continue to feed America, and indeed, the world.\n  From the very beginning of our Nation's history, farming has been the \nbackbone of our economy, our growth, and our independence. Our earliest \nsettlers were farmers. Farmers and ranchers pioneered our expansion to \nthe West. Indeed, the first patent issued by the Patent Office in 1790 \nwas to Samuel Hopkins for a farming innovation.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Kohl, on reporting a bill that, even in a \ntime of tight budgets, targets spending on the needs of rural America, \nwhile also maintaining funding for essential food assistance programs.\n  By pulling together and remaining focused, the United States Senate \nis keeping America's expansive food and fiber system moving forward.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, all other amendments having been \nwithdrawn or disposed of, we are now to final passage. To accommodate \nthose who need to leave, I reserve any remarks about the bill until \nafter final passage and urge we move to the vote.\n  Madam President, I yield for the Senator from Alaska.\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him, and I look forward to continuing to work together as we \nconference this bill with the House. I also publicly and sincerely \nthank John Ziolkowski, Fitz Elder, Hunter Moorhead, Dianne Preece, and \nStacy McBride on his staff for their hard work and dedication.\n  They exhibited professionalism and a strong work ethic throughout \nthis entire process, and worked seamlessly with my staff--something I \nam constantly reminded of as a rare occurrence in what can be an \nincredibly partisan place. I look forward to continuing this strong \nspirit of cooperation.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

We also thank David Tinsley, Kathie \nAlvarez, Lula Davis, the Parliamentarians, and the cloakroom staff. \nThese marathon activities are not the best kind of situations for some \nof these folks whom we take for granted around here. I want to \nacknowledge their help and their support.\n  I, of course, want to acknowledge the staff of the subcommittee, and \nI will list their names as a single staff, even though technically they \nare divided between majority and minority, but in this subcommittee we \nwork together as if we are one staff: John Ziolkowski, Fitz Elder, \nHunter Moorhead, Dianne Preece, Stacy McBride, Galen Fountain, Jessica \nFrederick, Bill Simpson, and Tom Gonzales.\n  All of these people have my very deep and sincere thanks for the work \nin getting this done.\n  Now, Madam President, I understand we have to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday morning I made a trip to meet \nwith the head of the American Red Cross. ADM Marty Evans is an \nextraordinary person. She was born in Springfield, IL, and served in \nthe U.S. Navy for 29 years. She rose to the rank of rear admiral and, \nafter her retirement from the Navy, spent several years as head of the \nGirl Scouts of America. Then a few years ago, she was chosen to be CEO \nof the American Red Cross.\n  The American Red Cross is an extraordinary agency. There are some \n4,500 employees in Washington, 30,000 nationwide, millions of \nvolunteers. Those of us who have had the good fortune of working with \nthe Red Cross know that the people working in Washington are important, \nbut the volunteers in the field are absolutely essential--men and women \nfrom communities across America who, at the first warning signal, are \nprepared to give up their personal lives and move to where they are \nneeded. The help they bring and have brought has made a difference so \nmany times in the lives of victims.\n  As Ms. Evans told me yesterday, this is not just a matter of \nhurricanes and floods. They respond to house fires to try to make \ncertain that families and individual communities have a helping hand. I \nasked her what she did in preparation for Hurricane Katrina, how the \nAmerican Red Cross positioned itself. I asked what they were doing in \nanticipation of Hurricane Rita, which we are all watching so closely. \nShe said they didn't wait for a Government signal. They knew what they \nhad to do. They positioned their people, their resources in safe \nlocations where they could move in as quickly as possible after the \ndisaster. They gave a helping hand in the evacuation. But they were \nready and prepared, if something terrible occurred. It was heart \nwarming and reassuring to know that the American Red Cross and other \nextremely important charitable organizations such as America's Second \nHarvest based in Chicago,\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\nthe Salvation Army, and so many faith-based groups are prepared and \nready to move.\n  We are now watching, because of satellite imagery, the course of \nHurricane Rita, praying that it will not strike with the force of a \ncategory 5 hurricane on the coast of Texas and Louisiana, and that \nsomehow, some way, at the last moment we will be spared. But whether we \nare spared or not, we must be prepared.\n  This administration has been haunted by Hurricane Katrina for the \nlast 3 weeks. President Bush has made at least five different visits to \nNew Orleans to be visibly present during the rescue and recovery. He \nmade a historic speech from Jackson Square about the challenge which \nHurricane Katrina places on Americans. I thought what the President \nsaid was the right thing. I am a loyal Democrat, but I listened \ncarefully to what the President said, and I thought the President \nshowed the kind of leadership America needs at this moment.\n  I will refer later in my remarks to the question of what went wrong \nwith Hurricane Katrina. But looking forward, as we must as a nation, we \nneed to stand behind those victims, their families, the communities, \nand the States that were hit by Hurricane Katrina. It was a call to \narms by the President for this Congress to join with him and the \nAmerican people in standing up for the most vulnerable people in our \ncountry. That is as truly American as it gets.\n  Listen to the debate that has followed President Bush's announcement \nin New Orleans. We have had Members of Congress saying we can't afford \nto do it. We can't afford to provide the disaster assistance for these \npeople to rebuild their lives and for these communities to rebuild \ntheir infrastructure and their homes. There have even been arguments \nfrom some that we can't consider spending this money because we have to \nkeep our word to the wealthiest people in America that we promised we \nwould cut their taxes.\n  The budget resolution we passed in the Senate and in the House this \nyear promised that before we went home at the end of the year, we would \ngive $70 billion more in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America. \nWe also promised in the budget resolution, which I opposed, that we \nwould cut Medicaid, which is health insurance for poor and elderly \npeople, and that we would cut student loan assistance. That was part of \nwhat I considered a poorly thought out budget resolution which passed \nwith Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\n  Now with the intervention of Hurricanes Katrina and Ophelia, and the \npossibility of Hurricane Rita and damage, many Republicans are arguing: \nWe have a solemn responsibility to cut the taxes for the wealthy first, \nto cut Medicaid expenditures for the poor and elderly, and to cut \nstudent loans, and we don't have the resources to help the victims.\n  That is unfortunate. It reflects a difference in values. It reflects \na difference in priorities. This Senator from Illinois believes that \nour first obligation is to the most vulnerable in America. Our first \nobligation is to those helpless victims and those communities who, \nthrough no fault of their own, are suffering today. It is time for us \nto be straightforward. It is time for the President to be \nstraightforward to Republican leaders in the House and Senate, to say \nclear and unequivocally: We cannot afford to go forward with more tax \ncuts for wealthy people as we fight a war in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nas we come to the assistance of our neighbors who suffered because of \nthese terrible natural disasters.\n  If the President will do that, I can guarantee him this: There is \nplenty of room on this side of the aisle for Democrats to join him in a \nbipartisan response to a national disaster which paid no attention to \nparty affiliation.\n  I can say that with confidence because after 9/11/2001, that is \nexactly what happened. Democrats and Republicans alike joined hands in \nthe face of that terrorist disaster and said we will stand behind the \nvictims and their families and the State of New York and that city that \nendured that great loss, as well as, of course, our friends in the \nPentagon who were victims as well of 9/11.\n  We stood together on a bipartisan basis. We did some exceptional \nthings, things to make our country stronger, things to respond to the \nattack that had taken place. The list is long, starting with \nresolutions condemning terrorism, appropriations bills, and special \nbills to put money after 9/11 where it was needed the most, the Airline \nStabilization Act, Uniting and Strengthening America Act, the USA \nPATRIOT Act, the intelligence bills, the defense bills--the list goes \non and on.\n  These were strong bipartisan measures taken in the wake of 9/11 by \nDemocrats and Republicans. We need that same spirit today. We need that \nspirit to stand behind the victims of Hurricane Katrina and their \nfamilies and, God forbid, if Hurricane Rita will wreak the same type of \nhavoc, we need to stand behind those victims as well, making certain \nfirst we have the resources in FEMA to respond to national emergencies.\n  There was a feeling 4 years ago that America had received a wakeup \ncall after 9/11, that we had to be ready and prepared as a nation to \nrespond to whatever was thrown at us. Extraordinary measures were \ntaken, extraordinary speeches were made, but when Hurricane Katrina \nstruck, we were not ready.\n  There has been a lot of question about how to answer the question, \nWhat did we do wrong, what did we fail to do with Hurricane Katrina? We \nbetter get those answers and get them quickly, not just to point blame, \nwhich some say is what it is all about, but for accountability, to \nfigure out what went wrong so it does not happen again. That is basic. \nIt is not a blame game. There is no game involved. It is a matter of \naccountability.\n  Sadly, our friends on the other side of the aisle believe the only \naccountability can come about if a majority of those who are asking the \nquestions are members of the President's party. We learned after 9/11 \nthat it was much better to bring in an independent, nonpartisan \ncommission to ask those hard questions.\n  The 9/11 Commission, cochaired by Gov. Thomas Kean, a former \nRepublican Governor of New Jersey, and Congressman Lee Hamilton, a \nformer Democratic Congressman from Indiana, did an exceptional job. The \nstrong bipartisan commission came up with measures and recommendations \nwhich truly changed the way we govern America and changed the way we \nthink about our responsibility in Congress, as well as in the executive \nbranch.\n  We need exactly the same type of commission when it comes to \nHurricane Katrina. But for reasons I cannot explain, the Republicans \nhave steadfastly refused to appoint an independent, nonpartisan \ncommission to find out what went wrong several weeks ago with Hurricane \nKatrina. That is the only way to come up with a credible analysis of \nthat failing, whether it occurred at the Federal level, the State \nlevel, the local level, or right here in Congress. Let's have an \nhonest, independent, nonpartisan commission, as we did after 9/11.\n  Instead, the Republican leadership says let's press forward with our \nown internal investigation. That has no credibility--or very little, I \nmight say. I have been a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nwhere Senator Roberts, as the chairman, has promised he would \ninvestigate the misuse of intelligence information before the invasion \nof Iraq. That promise has been made for over a year. Nothing has \nhappened.\n  We have called time and time again for a congressional investigation \nof the contracts in Iraq, the no-bid contracts in Iraq to companies \nsuch as Halliburton. We know there is evidence of abuse, misuse of \ntaxpayers' funds, and yet this Republican Congress refuses to have a \nfull-scale, honest investigation of Halliburton and the other \ncontractors who are profiteering at the expense of our troops and at \nthe expense of our taxpayers.\n  So it is time to concede the obvious. We cannot have a thorough, \nmeaningful investigation of Hurricane Katrina without an independent \ncommission. And we cannot come up with the resources to address Katrina \nand the other natural disasters until the President makes it clear to \nthe Republican leadership in Congress that we can no longer afford the \npromised tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America.\n  It is time for us to assess the reality of the challenges we face in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, and right here at home. It is\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\ntime for us to dedicate the resources to rebuilding and strengthening \nAmerica, rather than strengthening the coffers of a few corporations \nthat happen to have political connections. That is our responsibility.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate and the House will gather together \nand understand that rebuilding our Nation is our first responsibility. \nWe must understand that the least fortunate among us need our help \ntoday. They are more vulnerable than they have ever been.\n  We cannot change the past, but now with another hurricane moving \nacross the Gulf of Mexico, we can work together in a bipartisan way to \nchange the future. America can certainly do better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Hurricane Rita, bearing down on \nthe gulf coast of Texas, perhaps Louisiana again, a category 5, with \nwinds that have gotten up to 175 miles an hour, is very similar to \nHurricane Katrina 3 or 4 weeks ago. It sprang up as a category 1, \nhitting south Florida first. Katrina did quite a bit of damage, as you \nwould expect with winds in the range of 80 and 85 miles an hour. There \nwas a lot of debris. There was the loss of electricity as it went over \nMiami, Dade County. Then, of course, when it got out to the gulf, \nfueled by those warm waters, about 87 degrees, providing the fuel for \nthe hurricane, it surged in intensity on up to category 5, coming down \nto a category 4 before it hit the Louisiana coast.\n  It is eerily similar; Hurricane Rita springing up and hitting Florida \nthis time actually 50 miles south of Key West, of course, with those \ncounterclockwise winds, and a category 1 hitting Key West--that being \nthe strongest side of the storm--and then out over the warm waters of \nthe gulf. This is what we have as it is approaching landfall Saturday \nmorning.\n  Before Katrina, this Nation was finally waking up to how vulnerable \nwe are in our dependence on energy sources. Specifically, the Nation \nwas waking up to the fact that 58 percent of our daily consumption of \noil comes from foreign shores. That is not a very good position to be \nin if you have to depend on foreign lands for that oil. The price of \ngasoline was spiking up prior to Katrina, in the range of $2.70 a \ngallon. This was during August. I was doing townhall meetings all over \nmy State of Florida, and I can tell you at $2.70 a gallon, people are \nhurting. Senior citizens on fixed incomes cannot afford to drive to the \ndoctor. People making $20,000 a year can't afford to drive to work.\n  Then along comes Katrina, and because of hitting the area of our \nrefinery capacity, the scare goes into the market and the price of \ngasoline surges. In one station, overnight--one station on Interstate \n10 near Tallahassee--it surged 40 cents to well over $3 a gallon.\n  I can tell you because I know what my people feel in Florida, they \nare hurting. They are having difficulty making ends meet, even without \nnow having this additional cost. Here we go again. Here comes the next \nmajor hurricane, Hurricane Rita. It is now apparently bearing down on \nthe Galveston-Houston area, one of the major shipping ports of the \nworld. Also, that is where a great deal of the oil activity and the oil \nrefinery capacity of this country is located. If it does knock out some \nof that refinery capacity, we are going to see these spikes in the \nprice of gasoline to the point that it is starting to hurt our people.\n  Is it going to take another tragedy like this for us to finally wake \nup and, as a nation, get our heads out of the sand and address this \nenergy-dependent condition in which we find ourselves? Mind you, this \nis with the backdrop that over the past 4-plus years I have been \nprivileged to be a Member of the Senate, we have tried almost every \nyear to do a simple little thing, and that is to raise miles per gallon \non SUVs and phase it in over a long period of time so it doesn't hurt \nanybody. But we cannot even get 40 votes out of 100 Senators for an \namendment like that, to try to address the energy-dependent condition \nin which this Nation finds itself.\n  What are we going to do? Is it going to take another Katrina-like \ntragedy to shake us out of our lethargy? We might be shaken come next \nSaturday morning.\n  There are a number of things we can do. But before I go into that, \nlet me tell you about this thin thread we are hanging onto in our \nenergy dependence. With 58 percent of our daily consumption foreign \noil, any disruption in the system automatically will cause prices to \nspike and could come to the position of paralysis. It could be a major \nshutdown because of some malfunction in a refinery. Lord forbid, it \ncould be a terrorist sinking a supertanker in the Strait of Hormuz, \nthat 19-mile-wide strait in the Persian Gulf through which all of the \nworld's tankers have to go out into the open sea to supply a world \nthirsty for oil. It could be another series of hurricanes. Whatever it \nis, that thin thread of the supply line could have devastating \nconsequences for this country, if we cannot satiate our parched \nthroats, this thirst for oil.\n  We best get on with it. I suggest we start rethinking and get more \nthan 39 votes for mandating increased miles per gallon. I suggest we \nstart making ethanol, not just from corn--which is an expensive \nprocess--but from less expensive sources from which our technology now \nallows us to make ethanol. We can surely make it from sugar cane. We \ncan make a lot from normal waste. Do you know something else. We can \nmake it from grass. We have 31 million acres of prairie grass in this \ncountry. Let's cut the grass. Let's make cheaper ethanol and let's mix \nthat ethanol with gasoline that will burn in our existing car engines.\n\n  The primary consumption of oil is in the transportation sector, and \nin the transportation sector are our personal vehicles, where we \nconsume most of that oil. If we start mixing ethanol with gasoline in \ngreater proportions, it will burn in our existing car engines and we \nwill use that much less oil.\n  But let's do something else. Let's make sure that when the car \nmanufacturers are satisfying the demands of the American public for new \nautomobiles, they satisfy the demands and start producing more hybrid \nvehicles. If you have a hybrid vehicle, which Toyota has had for the \nlast 6 years, that will get the equivalent of 50 miles per gallon in \nstart/stop traffic, then you are burning less oil. The consumption of \noil is less.\n  If that hybrid vehicle is now burning a fuel that is not just \ngasoline but is a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, then you are \nconsuming all the less oil.\n  I suggest one more thing, that we build our hybrid vehicles so that \nwhen you park in your garage at night, you plug it in and it charges up \nthat battery, so the next day, when you drive out, you have a fully \ncharged battery so the gasoline engine in your hybrid vehicle is being \nused less to charge up that battery, and you have charged up that \nbattery overnight from a source of energy other than oil.\n  These are steps we can take right now. How many more monster \nhurricanes is it going to take, hitting the refinery capacity of this \nNation along the gulf coast, for us to get our heads out of the sand? I \nhope and pray that Rita is going to lessen and that it will not strike \na portion of the coast that brings devastation and tumult and hardship. \nBut as of Thursday midday, that is the course it is on for Saturday \nmorning landfall. The National Hurricane Center is pretty accurate in \ntheir predictions.\n  I am talking to an empty Chamber because we are all out there in \ncommittee meetings. I have just run here from trying to help protect us \nin the Commerce Committee on a question of communications after a \nnatural disaster--which we have experienced after\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\nKatrina. The Judiciary Committee is meeting at this moment as they \nconsider a nominee for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I have made similar remarks on this floor time and time again. If \nthey have not fallen on deaf ears, they have been ignored, as have the \nsimilar remarks of other Senators. How many times do we have to be \nreminded of our vulnerability as a nation, dependent on foreign oil? \nLet's start enacting some energy policies that will address this \nproblem immediately, to wean ourselves as quickly as possible from \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to bring the \nfiscal year 2006 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and related \nagencies bill to the Senate for consideration.\n  First, I would like to say that as a result of Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Byrd's leadership, we received an increase in our allocation \nfrom the very beginning of this process of over $1.2 billion above the \nPresident's request to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs. It \nwas only through this increase that Senator Feinstein and I were able \nto take care of our Nation's veterans.\n  This bill stays within our 302(b) allocation. It provides \n$12,116,611,000 for military construction and $70,710,881,000 for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and $157,126,000 for related agencies.\n  This bill bridges two significant funding gaps in fiscal year 2006 \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs. This is a total of $3.2 \nbillion.\n  First, the President's budget request included two legislative \nproposals for the VA's health system that would have increased the \ncopayments for prescription drugs and instituted new enrollment fees, \nboth of which were to be paid for by veterans. Revenue estimates for \nthese proposals were approximately $1.2 billion. The administration \nreduced the VA's budget request by this amount. This bill does not \ninclude either of those two legislative proposals, and instead the \nsubcommittee used all of its increased allocation to cover the $1.2 \nbillion difference for VA health care.\n  The second gap in the VA's 2006 budget was a shortfall in VA's health \ncare budget identified by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs this \nsummer. The bill contains $1.977 billion requested by the \nadministration in a budget amendment. While Senator Feinstein and I \nhave included the full amount requested, the bill designates this \nfunding as an emergency appropriation.\n  I would like to especially thank the subcommittee's ranking member, \nSenator Feinstein, for her efforts and cooperation over the summer \nregarding that particular critical issue. In addition, I thank Senator \nLarry Craig, and Senator Patty Murray, as well as Senator Akaka for \ntheir help in solving that problem that was looming as an emergency. \nAnd we all came to an agreement on a bipartisan basis that is certainly \nworthy of our colleagues' support. We had part of it as an emergency, \nand we will finish what we need in the 2006 budget.\n  The bill recommends $23.3 billion for the VA's medical services \naccount. This funding level is $1.3 billion above the President's \nrequest. Again, this was only possible with the extra allocation \nprovided by the full committee chairman and ranking member.\n  This bill recommends $412 million for medical and prosthetic \nresearch. The budget request for this account was $9 million below the \nfiscal year 2005 level. The funding level in the bill increases this \naccount above the fiscal year 2005 level by $19 million.\n  We have specifically included funds directed solely to research for \ngulf war illness syndrome. This is an area that I feel very strongly \ncommitted to because so many of our veterans came back from the first \ngulf war--one in seven veterans who returned from that war--with \nsymptoms they had not ever had in their lives. I believe we were slow \nto recognize that, but we are now putting greater emphasis on that--not \nonly to treat those veterans but also to see what the cause is and \nprevent future members of our armed services from being susceptible to \nthat kind of chemical warfare. This bill provides full funding as \nrequested for the VA's medical facilities account at $3.3 billion, as \nwell as new construction and renovation of existing facilities at $607 \nmillion and $209 million, respectively.\n\n  The bill creates an account for the VA information technology. This \nis a very important effort that will help achieve efficiencies in \ndelivering care to our veterans. We do not have the technology we need \nin our veterans system to do what needs to be done on an efficient \nbasis. This will reorganize the entire technology portfolio and give \nCongress more oversight, as well.\n  For our Nation's veterans compensation, pensions, and other benefit \nprograms, we fully funded the administration's request of $36.8 \nbillion. The bill\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\nalso provides sorely needed funds for military construction with the \nimpending return of troops. As a result of the current overseas \nrebasing effort, BRAC, Army modularity, and the global war on terror, \nour service men and women are in a time of great transformation. It is \nimportant they have facilities in place to enable the transformation.\n  The bill, including the first phase of funding for the BRAC 2005 \nround, should it be approved by Congress, adds $1.5 billion. We have \nalso included a provision that facilitates congressional oversight by \nrequiring the Secretary of Defense to provide a spending plan before \nobligating any funds from this account.\n  The bill also continues funding for many important quality-of-life \ninitiatives, including 11 family housing privatization projects, and it \nincreases Guard and Reserve funding more than $295 million over the \nPresident's request.\n  For the related agencies under our jurisdiction, we include $51.5 \nmillion for the American Battle Monument Commission, which is $1 \nmillion above its request, and $28.5 million for Arlington National \nCemetery, which is $500,000 above their request.\n  Our subcommittee has worked hard to bring a fair and balanced bill. \nIt warrants the support of our colleagues. We could not have done this \nwithout the total cooperation of Senator Feinstein and her staff. We \nhave always worked together on a bipartisan basis. We always will on \nthis subcommittee.\n  I yield the floor to my ranking member, Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee-\nreported substitute is agreed to as original text for the purpose of \namendment, with no points of order waived.\n  (The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed \nto.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my chairman, \nSenator Hutchison, in recommending the 2006 Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill to the \nSenate. I thank Senators Cochran and Byrd for their leadership and \nassistance in guiding this bill through the committee and to the floor.\n  I very much appreciate the support of our leaders in allowing us to \ntake up this bill at this time before we have completed action on the \nDefense authorization or appropriations bills. I recognize this is not \nthe normal order of business. With the clock running and a large amount \nof unfinished business facing the Senate, it is imperative we press on \nwith these bills as quickly as possible.\n  With one disastrous hurricane behind us and another bearing down on \nTexas, we all recognize there is no time to dawdle. We face enormous \nchallenges with these hurricanes. Both Senator Hutchison and I hope and \npray it will not bring another measure of devastation on our coastal \nStates. My heart goes out to my chairman, Senator Hutchison, to her \npeople, our people, in the State of Texas. I hope we can move this bill \nquickly so she can return to Texas later today to help her constituents \nprepare for the onslaught of the storm.\n  I want the Senator to know all on this side wish you and your people \nGodspeed. I hope it does not hit as hard as it looks like it might.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say thank you for those kind \nwords. I appreciate them. I know the Senator from California has lived \nthrough some very tough earthquakes.\n  We appreciate the response Congress is giving to the many needs of \nthe victims of Hurricane Katrina and possibly those who will be in a \nsimilar situation from Rita.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We have watched with great pride the heroic actions \nof our Nation's active and reserve military personnel as they have \nrushed to respond to devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. We have \nwatched these same troops courageously carry out their missions in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  We ask so much of our military and we all recognize we can never \nadequately repay our debt of gratitude to them. That said, we as \nSenators have both the opportunity and the responsibility to ensure \nprograms important to our military forces and our veterans are \nadequately funded.\n  As Senator Hutchison has said, the bill before the Senate today is a \nbipartisan effort to provide a portion of that funding for the \ninfrastructure needs of our military and the health care and other \nneeds of our veterans.\n  I want to emphasize the bipartisan nature of this bill and to \nespecially commend the chairman, Senator Hutchison, for her skill and \nher determination--and she can be very determined--in addressing the \nbudgetary complications posed by merging the massive and troubled \nbudget of the VA into the military construction appropriations bill.\n  In that respect, when we had hearings, it was interesting to see that \nSenator Craig came, Senator Akaka came, Senator Murray came, the former \nauthorizers, as well as appropriators when the VA was in another \nbudget.\n  I hope veterans all over the United States recognize how deeply this \nSenate does care that the VA budget is adequately funded. It was a \nstruggle, but we got there and we got there together. That was thanks \nto the authorizers and the appropriators and the former appropriators, \nincluding my friend Senator Mikulski, for working closely with us.\n\n  This bill is notable in several regards. First, under the leadership \nof Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd, we were able to provide $1.977 \nbillion in emergency funding to address the projected shortfall in \nveterans health care. This was originally disputed, but the authorizers \nfound that the percentage of increase in the planning model was wrong. \nTherefore, additional moneys were, in fact, needed. That was in \naddition to the $1.5 billion in the 2005 supplemental funding we were \nable to add to the 2006 Interior appropriations bill to make up the \ncurrent shortfall in veterans health care funding. So it was a double \neffort because money was also added on the Interior bill as well as on \nour bill.\n  At a time of tight budget constraints and many competing needs, the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations demonstrated it stands united in \nsupport of our veterans. I very much hope the full Senate and the House \nwill stand by our committee's recommendation.\n  The bill before the Senate today totals $82.98 billion, of which $44 \nbillion is discretionary. For military construction, the bill equals \nthe budget request of $12.116 billion, although we have rearranged some \nof the funding within that request.\n  For the VA, the total amount appropriated in this bill is $70.7 \nbillion, including $34.1 billion in discretionary spending and $36.6 \nbillion in mandatory spending. This is $3.2 billion above the \nPresident's original budget proposal.\n  Even before we learned of the terrible shortfalls in the VA budget, \nChairman Cochran and Senator Byrd provided an additional $1.26 billion \nto the subcommittee to cover shortcomings in the President's budget \nrequest for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Senator Hutchison and I \nused that additional funding to restore proposed cuts to programs and \nto make up all the savings assumed in the budget submission for \nproposed enrollment fees and increased pharmaceutical copayments, as \nthe chairman mentioned.\n  The Senate Committee on Appropriations unanimously rejected levying \nthese fees on our veterans and provided funding to ensure that the VA \ncould continue to provide service to all eligible veterans.\n  The bill also provides essential funding for military construction, \nmilitary family housing, and base realignment and closure costs. Once \nagain, Hurricane Katrina has demonstrated the vital mission of the \nGuard and Reserve forces to respond to disasters at home and the \nimportant backup role played by components of our Active-Duty Forces.\n  As any experienced military member will state, infrastructure is the \nkey to readiness. Our troops can't train or deploy effectively without \nthe infrastructure necessary to support their mission. This bill \nprovides important funding for military infrastructure needs, including \nfamily housing. As the chairman mentioned in the privatization of a \nnumber of new projects, those needs will only increase as a result of \nthe impact of Hurricane Katrina on a number of facilities and \ninstallations in Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\n  We must be prepared to meet those emerging requirements and others we \nmay yet face, without slowing down the progress we are making toward \naddressing the backlog of military construction requirements \nnationwide. I suggest that a necessary place for some of this will be \nthe next emergency supplemental rather than, hopefully, amendments to \nthis bill.\n  Finally, this bill includes necessary funding to implement the 2005 \nbase realignment and closure process and to continue the environmental \ncleanup from the previous BRAC rounds. This is very important to me. I \nthank the chairman for going along with it because the environmental \ncleanup needs are far beyond those envisioned or those budgeted.\n  Much of the remaining environmental cleanup requirements is in my \nhome State of California. I am particularly mindful of the need to \nfinish this job. Senator Hutchison has strongly supported me in this \neffort. I appreciate her concern that we fully fund environmental \ncleanup of military installations closed under the BRAC process.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Hutchison for her steadfast leadership on \nthis bill, and Chairman Cochran and Senator Byrd for their unstinting \nsupport of our Nation's military members and veterans. I also thank, \nbecause we have a great staff, Tammy Cameron, Sean Knowles, and Dennis \nBalkam on the majority, and Christina Evans, B.G. Wright, and Chad \nSchulken of my staff for their professionalism and their excellent \nwork.\n  This is a good bill. I encourage all of my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side, in particular, to support it and to move expeditiously \nto pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein. It is clear \nwe worked very well to address the needs of veterans in our country and \nthe military construction needs of all the services in our country. I, \ntoo, thank her staff and my staff, Tammy Cameron, Dennis Balkam, and \nSean Knowles, for working together to make sure we do the very best job \npossible and that we work together.\n  I also add that I appreciate what Senator Feinstein said about \namendments to the bill. We are going to shortly propose a unanimous \nconsent that gives a deadline for Members who may want to do an \namendment, but I hope no one will try for amendments related to Katrina \nor Rita because we will have another supplemental for those purposes \nand we would like to keep this bill in our 302(b) allocation.\n  Speaking of Katrina and Rita, I commend the Department, especially, \nfor the way they have handled the emergencies that have faced them. \nWhen Katrina was threatening the New Orleans and Mississippi areas, \nthey moved the patients out of harm's way before they were threatened. \nBefore anyone said they had to, they were calling the families of \npatients, explaining the options and telling the families where the \npatients were being moved. Records were moved to safe locations. \nEmergency stockpiles of prescription drugs were routed to the areas \nwhere the patients were going. It was truly a phenomenal success. Not \none veteran who was in the care of the Veterans' Administration was in \nany way harmed because of this evacuation and this service. Every \nsingle veteran had medication dispensed on time. Special arrangements \nwere made to deliver benefit payments to those who did not have an \naddress or a bank where they were.\n\n  Victims who were not veterans were also helped. No one was denied \nmedical treatment. VA doctors were there to help everyone, and they \ndid. This is due to the professionalism of the Department and the \ndetailed prior planning.\n  I can tell you the Department of Veterans Affairs is now doing the \nexact same thing in the areas that are thought to be in the path of \nHurricane Rita. They are beginning to evacuate the veterans who might \nbe in harm's way. They will continue to be ready to assure that all of \nour veterans on medications will have those medications. I commend \nSecretary Nicholson and all of the professionals at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs for stepping up to the plate and taking care of our \nveterans who are in these emergency situations on the gulf coast today.\n  There is no question that all of us--I happen to have been born in \nGalveston. I have lived through hurricanes, and I know how devastating \nit can be to an area to be struck by a hurricane. I was going to \ncollege when Hurricane Carla struck, which was the largest hurricane we \nhad ever had since the 1900 storms in Galveston. It was a level 4.\n  Now we are looking at possibly a level 5. So I have a lot of friends \nand family who are in the area who are just waiting to see what is \ngoing to happen. And it takes something out of you, there is no \nquestion.\n  But our veterans are going to be taken care of. The people of America \nwho are in trouble are going to be taken care of by our Federal, State, \nand local communities that are all working together to make sure that \nwhen Americans are in need, Americans will be there to do our part to \nease this pain.\n  So thank you, Mr. President. I thank my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Feinstein, for her concern. I commend our Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs for working with us through many of the travails we have had to \nassure that our veterans get the care they need and that our Active-\nDuty military also have the military construction for their quality of \nlife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Mr. President, I very much concur with what \nmy chairman has just said. In watching on television, one of the things \nthat has come through to me is the enormous sensitivity of our military \ntoward people's plights. What is coming back from people is: Oh, they \nare treating us so well. They really care.\n  I believe that is a real commendation for the American military, \nthrown into a situation for which they are not necessarily trained. \nAfter all, they are trained for war fighting. They have done amazingly. \nI think from the top, when General Honore went down--no nonsense, \n``move that gun down''--there was no doubt who was in command. It was a \ntrue command presence and followed down through the ranks in an amazing \nway.\n  So I just want to say thank you very much to each man and woman who \nis down there helping people go through some of the worst days of their \nlives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for bringing \nthat up because there are so many stories.\n  I talked to the FEMA Director yesterday, and he has already gone to \nthe Department of Defense to get a mobile hospital pre-positioned in \nthe area where Rita might come so we would have a MASH unit ready to \nhelp people who might be injured. He has asked for helicopters, which \nhe is going to get, for evacuation and rescue missions.\n  I do think the military has really stepped up to the plate in \nAlabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. They are ready to go and will be \ngoing to help the people of Texas where we think the brunt of this \nstorm will hit.\n  The other unsung heroes and heroines of this plight are the men and \nwomen of the Coast Guard. The person in charge from the Federal \nGovernment for the effort in Texas is going to be the admiral from the \nCoast Guard because they have done an incredible job. Admiral Allen \nover in Louisiana is doing a wonderful job. And now we will have other \nCoast Guard personnel helping with the operation in Texas.\n  So I have been working in the last 24 hours with our State and local \nofficials and our Federal officials to assure that the resources are \nthere. I am convinced everything that can be done is being done and \nthat if you can be prepared, we are prepared. But we all know \nhurricanes are unpredictable in many ways, and we are in for probably a \ntough time. We are up to it. We will make sure whatever can be done to \nease the pain of people who are in harm's way will be done.\n  I thank the Senator so much for her statement and the concern of all \nof my colleagues. Just as we have stated our concern to our colleagues \nfrom Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, people now realize we have \nanother State to add to the emergency needs of our country. I have no \ndoubt everyone will be there doing everything possible for my \nconstituents in Texas.\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n  Mr. President, we are going to shortly propose a unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask any of my colleagues who might have amendments to get \ndown to the floor immediately because we know of no amendments other \nthan a couple we have in the mix. Senator Coburn has one, and we have \none from Senator Feinstein for Senator Carper and Senator Biden. Those \nare the only ones we have been informed would be here, and we are going \nto dispatch those.\n  So I will ask for a quorum call so we can come back shortly for a \nunanimous consent request. But if anyone is thinking of an amendment, I \nwould ask my colleagues to address it immediately.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we do have a couple of other \namendments. Senator DeWine has put an amendment in. But I am going to \nsay that if we do not hear from anyone by 12:30, we are going to \nprepare to go to third reading and set a timetable for the vote. So I \nam just giving our colleagues fair warning that at 12:30, we will lock \nin the third reading and the vote on the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs and related agencies appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the expeditious way our leader \nand the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies has brought this important \nappropriations bill to the floor. It is, in my opinion, without \nquestion, that we ought to try to deal with all of our appropriations \nbills this year, complete them individually, complete the total \nprocess. We have seen the difficult and confusing process of omnibus \nbills over the last couple of years. Clearly, this Congress ought to \ndemonstrate to the American taxpayer that we can conduct our budgeting \nand our appropriating process in a reasonable and responsible fashion \nto move ahead. The chairman of the subcommittee is urging us to come to \nthe floor if we have amendments and address them in a timely fashion, \nto see if we can complete work on this appropriations bill today. I \nappreciate that.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have worked closely \nwith the chairman and the ranking member of this subcommittee to assure \nthat we have adequately funded the Veterans' Administration. As our \ncolleagues know--and certainly observers have known--we have had \ndifficulty in effective and responsible projections of costs. As we \nhave seen a ramping up of services to America's veterans and as the \nquality of veterans health care improves, there has been a \nsubstantially greater number of veterans who have chosen to use the \nveterans health care system to provide for their needs. As a result, \nH.R. 2528 provides $70.71 billion to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the highest amount of appropriated dollars in the history of \nthe Department. Of this funding, $34.09 billion is discretionary \nfunding, meaning spent across the spectrum of veterans services, which \nis $1.26 billion above the administration's request, and $23.32 billion \nis for medical services which is $1.3 billion above the \nadministration's request. Not only did the administration come in at a \nhigher number, but as the needs changed, Congress came in at an even \nhigher number. That speaks clearly to our commitment to America's \nveterans, as we have always responded to their needs in what we believe \nto be a direct, straightforward way.\n  The overall budget of Veterans Affairs has risen $22.5 billion or \n47.5 percent, with average increases for all veterans at nearly 7.8 \npercent every year. I am talking about since the Bush administration \ntook office. These increases more than double the growth of the entire \nFederal budget, which has increased by 4.14 percent. I am talking about \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Anyone who says we are not meeting the obligation to America's \nveterans with unprecedented increases and increases that are \nsubstantially more than in other areas of our Federal budget simply \nhasn't looked at the numbers and the level of health care being \nprovided. Health care funding alone has grown by $10 billion, or 52 \npercent, during the Bush administration. With that attention and \nresponse from the Congress and this President, VA has become a modern \nhealth care system, described in recent national publications as the \nbest health care anywhere. Of course, that is exactly why we now see \nmore veterans seeking veterans health care; it is not the health care \nof last resort. It is the health care of first choice. It is a modern, \nquality delivery system all of us can be proud of, not only because we \nare providing it but because it serves America's heroes in a way that \nwe feel an appropriate obligation to do so.\n  I thank Chairman Hutchison for the work she has done, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Feinstein, for their cooperative effort with us as we \nhave worked our way through this difficult funding process for \nveterans. The job is well done. The services and the resources provided \nare responsible and adequate for the serving of America's veterans.\n  I am privileged to serve on this subcommittee, to work with the \nchairman and ranking member to accomplish this task. I also have the \nunique responsibility of serving as chairman of the authorizing \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs. I am pleased and proud of the work we \nare doing, not only for America's veterans today but for those who are \nsoon to become America's veterans. The brave men and women serving us \nin the defense of our freedom in the war on terrorism in Iraq and \nAfghanistan are coming back. Many of them will be requiring significant \nservices as they have been injured and found themselves in harm's way. \nOf course, that is our responsibility. We will not back from it in any \nway. America's veterans or America's serving men and women soon to be \nveterans need to know that this Congress has and will continue to \naddress their needs in a responsible fashion, to serve them as we \nappropriately must, sometimes having to draw priorities but recognizing \nthat those needing the care are going to get the care, the kind that is \nappropriate and responsible for America's heroes, America's veterans, \nand men and women currently serving in the armed services.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask I be allowed to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Hurricane Katrina\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to express my heartfelt sympathy \nfor the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have been impacted and \ndisplaced by Hurricane Katrina. Many people will feel the effects of a \nnatural disaster of this magnitude for years. My thoughts and prayers \nare certainly with them all.\n  There have been an awful lot of negative publicity and stories \nsurrounding this natural disaster. But there also have been a number of \npositive activities that have taken place leading up to Katrina's \narrival, during the storm itself, as well as in the aftermath. I would \nlike to share some of those stories.\n  Since Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, public and private \nagencies have worked closely together to survey the damage to \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. The hurricane affected the Port of \nNew Orleans and the\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\nports along the gulf coast and grain facilities along the Mississippi \nRiver. Reports estimate that the total damage to the Port of New \nOrleans is approximately $1.6 billion, including damage to two bridges \nand a lock.\n  The Port of New Orleans is an economic asset to the City of New \nOrleans, contributing approximately $88 million to the city's economy \nand $1.6 billion to the statewide economy of Louisiana in the year 2001 \nalone. According to the New Orleans Customs District, for the period \nOctober 2004 through June 2005, an 8-month period, the dollar value of \nexports for bulk agricultural products is almost $1 billion going \nthrough New Orleans. This is almost half of the bulk product, by value, \nexported from the United States every year. In 2004, bulk amount was \n$25.6 billion.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, transportation on the Mississippi \nRiver is very important to our Nation's farmers and is critical to \nkeeping U.S. agriculture positioned and able to serve U.S. markets for \ngrain, oilseeds, and grain products shipped from New Orleans. The \nMississippi gulf typically is responsible for about 71 percent of corn, \n65 percent of soybeans, and 22 percent of wheat exports. This system is \none of the most important elements in keeping U.S. grains and oilseeds, \nparticularly corn and soybeans, as well as several other U.S. \nagriculture products, competitive in the world markets. Of the 50.2 \nmillion metric tons exported from U.S. ports thus far in 2005, 29.7 \nmillion metric tons or 59 percent was exported from the Mississippi \ngulf.\n  Export elevators in the Mississippi gulf region range in storage \ncapacities from 2 million to more than 7 million bushels each. These \nfacilities have a rated vessel loading capacity generally ranging from \n60,000 to 100,000 bushels per hour.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, my staff has been in \ntouch with all of the major U.S. grain exporters following Katrina's \naftermath moving north. The grain export industry and the industry's \nsupporting transportation infrastructure affected by this disaster \ncommitted early on to resume operations as soon as possible. Through \ncontinued perseverance, the National Grain and Feed Association, NGFA, \nand the North American Export Grain Association, NAEGA, which \nrepresents those business that handle 70 percent of the U.S. grain and \noilseed crop, have prioritized the recovery operations of the grain \nexport infrastructure in this region.\n  Due to the accomplishments of the private sector, as of today, the \ngrain export elevators are operating at a storage capacity in excess of \n84 percent in New Orleans. Moreover, the Federal agencies, especially \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard, have made \nthis possible because of the cooperation between the private sector and \nthe lessees of the port facilities, such as Cargill and ADM and other \ngrain brokerage companies.\n  Grain exporters, allied industries, and multiple U.S., State and \nlocal government entities continue to work around the clock under very \nchallenging conditions to restore operations on the Mississippi River \nand the affected region. While normal operating conditions at these \nfacilities are not fully restored, many of the obstacles are being \naddressed successfully to have them operate at full capacity.\n  A common challenge for every company is making sure enough workers \ncan reach their facilities and have a warm bed and a hot meal. Elevator \nworkers, port workers, and USDA grain inspectors were displaced by the \nhurricane's extensive damage or complete destruction to their homes--\nand they also obeyed evacuation instructions. All of these people need \nhousing and the appropriate infrastructure in order to be able to \nreturn to work.\n  As the companies secure adequate housing and living quarters for the \nemployees and their families, the employees of the industry, the Port \nof New Orleans and other gulf coast ports can more quickly get back to \nwork to ensure U.S. agriculture continues feeding the world.\n  This is at a point in time during the harvest of grains in the \nMidwest where we are at our peak, and it is such a critical factor, not \njust for the city of New Orleans but for all of our grain producers in \nthe Midwest that put their grain on barges, ship them down the \nMississippi River to the Port of New Orleans and other gulf coast \nfacilities.\n  The private sector, the Department of Agriculture, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and the Coast Guard are diligently working to restore \nthe gulf coast ports to full capacity in a timely manner. Congress will \ncontinue to provide these agencies the resources and the private sector \nthe ability they need to do so.\n\n  I am confident that the United States will continue to be a reliable \nsupplier to the international community of grain. I commend the \ntireless efforts of the U.S. Government agencies, NAEGA, NGFA, and the \ncompanies involved in resuming operations of the Port of New Orleans, \nthe ports along the gulf coast and grain facilities along the \nMississippi River.\n  There continue to be many great stories of other individuals and \ncompanies contributing and sacrificing time, money, and even their \nsafety to help the victims of Katrina. In my home State of Georgia, \nmany folks are volunteering in evacuee shelters, contributing food, \nclothes, and money. Some are even housing evacuees. Companies and their \nemployees are joining the effort as well.\n  The marquee company of my home State is Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola, its \nbottlers, and their employees are doing their part to assist the \nvictims of Katrina. Coca-Cola had its incident management team in place \nprior to the storm making land to coordinate its response to Hurricane \nKatrina. With a number of facilities damaged or without electricity in \nthe affected area, Coca-Cola and its bottlers immediately began \nproducing water and an assortment of beverages from other plants for \ndonation to FEMA and other relief agencies, even as they attempted to \nreach employees in the affected areas.\n  Running short of bottles and cans to deliver water and juice for \nchildren, Coca-Cola employees modified 2.5-gallon containers, which are \nnormally used for syrup in restaurant fountain dispensers, and \nconverted them to hold various beverages for shipment to emergency \nshelters at the Astrodome and other places in and around the affected \narea.\n  To date, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners have shipped more than \n30 million containers of filtered water, juice, sport drinks, and other \nbeverages to relief organizations, including the American Red Cross, \nDepartment of Defense, FEMA and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency \nand food service partners such as Aramark.\n  The Coca-Cola company and the Coca-Cola Bottlers Association \ncommitted $5 million to Hurricane Katrina relief. A major portion of \nthe donations went to the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army, \nwith $2 million being set aside to aid displaced Coca-Cola employees.\n  Because of Georgia's experience in disasters and because of the \nexpertise in mobile medical centers, Ben Hinson, the owner of Mid \nGeorgia Ambulance Company was asked by the State of Louisiana to \ncoordinate all ambulance and paramedic services coming into the State.\n  Within 2 days of Hurricane Katrina making landfall, Ben was on the \nground delivering medical services and coordinating response teams from \nall over the country. His company along with other Georgia ambulance \nservices would eventually send 20 ambulances and 50 paramedic crews to \nhelp in the relief efforts.\n  Ben and his son, Shay, now manage over 600 paramedics and nearly 400 \nambulances, a number that is growing every day as more States and \nlocalities continue to mobilize. Mid Georgia Ambulance is also working \nside by side with Navy medical teams in St. Barnard Parish providing \ntriage and primary medical care to survivors.\n  Home Depot is another company which is passionate about helping its \nneighbors and communities during times of need. Home Depot responded \nwith unwavering support to help Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and \nFlorida residents recover from this catastrophe.\n  One of Home Depot's policies during such emergencies is to freeze \nprices on all hurricane commodities to assure that no price gouging can \ntake place. Home Depot also established a 24-7 hurricane command center \nto support efforts to restore operations in the field. Home Depot \nrelocated 950 associates to work in affected stores while\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nimpacted associates focus on the needs of their families and homes. \nThey raised credit limits on its consumer credit cards and extended \nspecial offers to customers in the affected areas. They dispatched Loss \nPrevention personnel and uniformed guards to ensure the safety of \ncustomers and associates in affected and surrounding stores and \ntemporary support centers.\n  The Home Depot understands that its employees are the most important \ncompany asset and many were disaster victims themselves. To create a \nsupport network for short-term financial assistance to help ensure the \nsafety of each associate and their families, Home Depot provided more \nthan $1.2 million through 1,350 grants to workers impacted by Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  They also set up a toll-free disaster assistance line for affected \nassociates. The hotline helps associates find temporary housing, \nprovides transfers to other store locations and contacts mortgage and \ncredit card companies to temporarily suspend payments, among other \nservices.\n  The Home Depot has donated $1.5 million to support immediate relief \nand recovery efforts by relief organizations including $400,000 to the \nAmerican Red Cross and Salvation Army, and $600,000 to support long-\nterm rebuilding and volunteerism efforts.\n  The Home Depot Foundation donated $500,000 to community development \norganizations that rebuild low- to moderate-income housing in affected \nareas. With the help of its vendor partners, the Home Depot has \nprovided and shipped nearly $1.25 million in in-kind product donations \nincluding generators, gloves, flashlights and batteries, floodlights, \nfood, cleaning supplies and linens. This effort by Home Depot will \ncontinue until the cleanup process is completed.\n  Georgia's own Center for Disease Control has directed much of its \nresources toward providing both immediate help to the victims' day-to-\nday health needs, as well as the long-term difficulties of containing \nthe spread of disease and infection.\n  CDC positioned personnel on the ground in Louisiana prior to the \nstorm making land.\n  Dr. Julie Gerberding, CDC Director, has asked the CDC Foundation to \nactivate its Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund, created after 9/\n11 to provide flexible and immediate resources for CDC to use in a \npublic health emergency.\n  Dr. Gerberding has also activated the CDC state-of-the-art Bernie \nMarcus Emergency Operations Center to support the Department of Health \nand Human Services as a coordinating hub for the hurricane response.\n  Public health scientists, relief workers, and medical supplies as \nwell as environmental and medical test samples have been on the flights \nto and from the affected areas.\n  As of today, September 22, the CDC has sent hundreds of thousands of \ndoses of antibiotics and maintenance medications for chronic diseases \nsuch as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, pain and anxiety, \njust to name a few. Also included are IVs, insulin syringes, and basic \npharmaceuticals.\n  CDC has deployed 246 professionals to the field. Specialties include \nnursing, epidemiology, sanitation, occupational safety, disease \nsurveillance, and risk communication.\n  CDC is helping to vaccinate thousands of children at evacuation \ncenters' and CDC experts are helping to organize, implement, and assess \nthe evacuation centers' vaccination program.\n  CDC has been focusing on food-borne, water-borne, and insect-borne \ninfectious disease outbreaks as well as checking water quality, \nrestoring critical laboratory functions and rebuilding public health \nand laboratory infrastructures.\n  Many evacuees in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama lost their \npersonal health records. These needs are being addressed through \nexisting immunization systems.\n  In Louisiana alone, CDC estimated that 8,300 queries were made to the \nLouisiana Immunization Network for Kids statewide--LINKS--regarding \nvaccination histories for kids that were evacuated. CDC is using LINKS \nto determine health records of children and providing immunizations for \nthose in need and for those with no proof of health records.\n  A story of human interest: Liz O'Mara surveys a shelter in Jackson, \nMS. A CDC public health advisor, she spent her second week of marriage \non a cot in a conference room with 10 men ``who snored!'' But she says:\n\n       It is an honorable experience to play a small part of a \n     State and local response effort. We--Strategic National \n     Stockpile--are not here as individuals, but as a team. We \n     rely on each other's commitment to their specific \n     responsibilities and expertise as a synchronized unit, or we \n     simply would not be very successful assisting with State and \n     local needs.\n\n  I am proud of the efforts that Georgians, as well as all Americans \nare doing to help those who are suffering from Hurricane Katrina. We \nowe them a great deal of gratitude.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1852\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1852.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1852.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide an additional $10,000,000 for the Readjustment \n  Counseling Service, with a corresponding offset from the HealtheVet \n                                account)\n\n       On page 76, line 22, strike ``$23,308,011,000'' and insert \n     ``$23,318,011,000''.\n       On page 77, line 1, insert ``$109,000,000 shall be \n     available for the Readjustment Counseling Service: Provided \n     further, That'' after ``this heading,''.\n       On page 78, line 22, strike ``$1,456,821,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,446,821,000''.\n       On page 79, line 7, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$90,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this amendment would plus-up the \nReadjustment Counseling Service's funding by $10 million. RCS is the \narm of VA that operates the Vet Centers that many of us know so well. \nVet Centers have traditionally provided needed counseling services to \nveterans of the Vietnam War in community-based settings for over two \ndecades.\n\n  Now, in the midst of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, \nthe mission of the Vet Centers has been expanded to include outreach \nand counseling for service members, including members of the Guard and \nReserve, who are returning from these conflicts.\n  By providing the Vet Centers with an additional $10 million in \nfunding, VA would be able to hire additional professional family \ntherapists at Vet Centers nationwide to provide services to family \nmembers of veterans deeply affected by their service in combat. The \nreadjustment period can be difficult for the entire family.\n  We have all heard the statistics emerging from the groups that have \nalready come back from OIF and OEF. Families and marriages have \nsuffered due to rough transitions, and many have resulted in divorce.\n  These additional funds would also augment Vet Centers in underserved \nrural communities and would expand the capacity for these centers to \nprovide readjustment services to those veterans who may struggle with \nobtaining access because they live in a remote area.\n  Surviving family members of those servicemen who paid the ultimate \nprice, will be able to find solace through the Vet Center's bereavement \ncounseling program. Vet Centers would be able to hire more bereavement \ncounselors to provide counseling for those who must endure the pain of \nlosing a family member in combat.\n  Finally, I point out that in his testimony to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs this past June, VA Secretary Nicholson stated that \nonly $8 million would be required for additional services that were \nalready being implemented by the Vet Center program, such as providing \nadditional outreach workers. We need to make sure that these services \nare secure by providing\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nthe funds necessary to implement them. The requested amount would do \nthat and go even a bit further to support this invaluable program.\n  Mr. President, I ask for support of this amendment, knowing how \nimportant it is today for our veterans, and look forward to its \nadoption.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Global Climate Change\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in August, the voice of the Anchorage \nTimes printed an article authored by my good friend Dr. Syun-Ichi \nAkasofu. Dr. Akasofu is the director of the International Arctic \nResearch Center in Fairbanks. He is one of the world's leading experts \non Arctic science and global climate change.\n  Given the interest some of our colleagues have recently shown on this \nsubject, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Akasofu's article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Voice of the Times, Aug. 23, 2005]\n\n                  Alaska Glaciers Receding Since 1800\n\n                       (By Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu)\n\n       Few can argue that the earth's temperature is not \n     changing--especially in Alaska. However, before we create \n     fundamental policy changes, let's keep everything in context.\n       Our work at the International Arctic Research Center and \n     that of many other scientists has produced significant \n     findings. One thing we do know is that there is no definitive \n     scientific proof that all of the present global warming is \n     attributable to humans, or caused by the greenhouse effect. \n     Natural changes are also important factors to consider.\n       First, the Ice Age was only an average of 6 deg. C cooler \n     than today. There is permafrost in Alaska and Siberia, which \n     is the product of the Ice Age. The fact that it still exists \n     and is still thawing is partly due to the fact that the Ice \n     Age has not concluded yet. The present warming must partly be \n     due to the recovery from the Ice Age.\n       Alaska glaciers have been receding since 1800, before \n     greenhouse gases increased significantly after the Little Ice \n     Age. Portage Glacier has been receding from about 1890 or \n     earlier (the earliest record).\n       Additionally, we cannot scientifically explain the \n     complicated way the Arctic sea ice along the Alaska Arctic \n     coast and other areas such as Siberia are receding. We do \n     know that the resulting open sea allows for the development \n     of intense cyclones that cause serious coastal erosion in \n     Alaska and elsewhere. It cannot be concluded that this is a \n     result of the greenhouse effect.\n       Two other factors to consider are the North Atlantic \n     Oscillation and solar output. We know that the warm North \n     Atlantic water that is flowing into the Arctic Ocean is an \n     important factor in warming the Arctic Ocean. The intensity \n     of this flow occurs in pulses, some of which are driven by \n     cyclical changes known as the North Atlantic Oscillation.\n       In addition, the sun has been putting more energy out \n     during the last 100 years, which is estimated to be \n     equivalent to a 0.2 deg. C increase (not the greenhouse \n     effect!), one third of the 0.6 deg. C, which has been \n     determined to be the official estimate of global warming \n     during the last 100 years.\n       Added to such long-term trends, there are multi-decadal and \n     interannual fluctuations. Three years ago, Europe suffered \n     from an intense heat wave. One can easily see that it was not \n     due to the greenhouse effect, since uncommonly hot summers in \n     Europe did not make the headlines either last year or this \n     year.\n       Likewise, it has been said that the number of hurricanes is \n     increasing, however, there is no clear indication of it. \n     These are interannual fluctuations.\n       In addition to actual temperature changes, there are other \n     issues to consider. One such case is that many recent \n     disasters have been attributed to the greenhouse effect \n     without scientific proof; this includes the great floods in \n     Bangladesh and India in recent years.\n       These floods may partly be due to massive deforestation in \n     these countries, to which some people must be held \n     responsible. On the other hand, by saying it is due to the \n     greenhouse effect, I am afraid that they are hiding behind \n     the greenhouse catastrophic scenario. The danger from such \n     confusion and hysteria may be even greater than from global \n     warming itself.\n       In this respect, the reduction of CO2 release \n     must be based on a carefully assessed scientific ground, not \n     the catastrophic scenario. The United States spends more than \n     any other country on climate change research--$5 billion next \n     year. We should address the impacts of climate change while \n     allowing scientists to continue their work on the true causes \n     of these changes. Let's base our policy decisions on sound \n     science--not hysteria.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I trust Dr. Akasofu's research and \nopinions. He has published more than 550 articles and is the author or \ncoauthor of 10 books. His work has shown that he is an expert in Arctic \nresearch. It has shown that while there is little doubt the Earth's \ntemperature is changing, there is still much debate about what is \ncausing this change.\n  In his article, Dr. Akasofu says that the:\n\n       [One] thing we do know is that there is no definitive \n     scientific proof that all of the present global warming is \n     attributable to humans, or caused by the greenhouse effect.\n\n  Some of the changes we are seeing are the most recent stage in a \nhistoric evolution. In Alaska, our glaciers have been receding since \n1800, long before the advent of the so-called greenhouse gases.\n  In the past 100 years, the Sun has been giving off additional energy, \nwhich is likely responsible for one-third of the .6-degree Celsius \nincrease in global temperature. And there is now the so-called Atlantic \nand Pacific oscillation that may be dumping more heat, that is, warm \nocean water, into the Arctic Ocean.\n  Changes in climate and weather patterns are not isolated events. They \nare part of a long-range historic trend or trends. One cannot arrive at \nsound conclusions about the causes by observing the changes which occur \nin their own lifetime. Reliable conclusions can only be reached by \nsound science and the type of research being conducted by Dr. Akasofu \nand his staff.\n  We must not substitute our own casual judgment for sound science. \nThis will only lead to confusion. And Dr. Akasofu warned that:\n\n       The danger from such confusion and hysteria may be even \n     greater than from global warming itself.\n\n  The effects of global climate change are real. Regardless of the \ncause, changes are underway in the Arctic regions, including Alaska, \nand we must deal with these effects. But we must also allow the \nscientists to reach scientifically based conclusions on what is causing \nthis phenomenon.\n  The basic problem we face is distinguishing between natural causes \nand human impact. The Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Global \nClimate Change, chaired by Senator Vitter and cochaired by Senator \nLautenberg, held a hearing on global climate change policy in July. \nDuring that hearing, I asked Dr. James Mahoney, Assistant Secretary of \nCommerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, about the situation and he told me:\n\n       Sometimes there are . . . political arguments that want to \n     go in one extreme or the other. The scientific argument is \n     much more complicated in the middle.\n\n  Figuring out what is really happening in the Arctic will be very \nimportant to answering the overall question of global climate change, \nand I am dedicated to pursuing this. As far as the United States is \nconcerned, the evidence of global climate change is more apparent in \nAlaska than anywhere else. We should prepare for its effects, but I \nwant to seek sound science before we enact policies aimed at its \ncauses.\n  We have created two subcommittees in the Commerce Committee that deal \nin some way with global climate change, and we will continue in our \ncommittee to address this issue. But I think it is very dangerous to \nmake, as Dr. Mahoney called them, the ``political arguments.'' We must \nfollow science on this issue, and I commend Dr. Akasofu for leading \nthose efforts.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have a series of amendments that \nhave been cleared on both sides, and I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be temporarily set aside so that I could send these \namendments\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\nindividually to the desk for their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1858\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. On behalf of Senator Coburn, I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Coburn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1858.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that any limitation, directive, or earmarking \n   contained in either the House of Representatives or Senate report \n accompanying this bill be included in the conference report or joint \n  statement accompanying the bill in order to be considered as having \n               been approved by both Houses of Congress)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  .

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1865\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer with Senator Obama \nthis amendment to the Veterans appropriation bill. Our amendment will \ninform America's most under-compensated disabled veterans about how \nthey may have their claims reviewed.\n  Americans have a fundamental dedication to fairness. No matter what a \nperson's background, class, religion, race or other difference, \neveryone deserves to be treated equally under the law.\n  When we hear about unequal treatment, our basic sense of justice as \nAmericans is shocked. We are perhaps doubly shocked when we hear of \nunequal treatment of disabled veterans.\n  We would expect that disabled veterans will receive differing levels \nof disability compensation based on the degree and type of their \ndisability, but we do not expect to see the average amount paid to \ndisabled veterans to vary greatly from State to State.\n  Unfortunately, the truth is that the average amount paid to disabled \nveterans across this country varies widely.\n  The May 19, 2005 Review of State Variances in VA Disability \nCompensation Payments released by the Department of Veterans Affairs \nOffice of Inspector General confirms media reports that ``variances in \nannual disability compensation by State have existed for decades.'' The \naverage annual disability compensation payment in the highest State is \n$12,004 per year. In the lowest State it is only $6,961.\n  The State with the lowest average compensation is my own state of \nIllinois.\n  The report from the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs acknowledges that, in addition to demographic factors, \ninconsistency in VA rating decisions is one of the major causes of this \ndisparity. A major reason for inconsistent decisions is the shortage of \nrating specialists in the VA offices reviewing the claims. The review's \nsurvey of VA rating specialists revealed that most of them do not \nbelieve the regional offices have sufficient rating staff.\n  On May 20, the day after the release of the report, Senator Obama and \nI hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting in Chicago. We invited the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to join us so that he could help explain \nto the veterans of our State how they had been so short-changed and so \nunder-compensated for so long and--more importantly what he was going \nto do about it.\n  To the Secretary's credit he stepped up to the plate. He promised a \nspecial operation to review new claims as well as old ones and he \ncommitted to providing the additional staff to get this done.\n  These are steps in the right direction which might help correct a \ndecades-long history of unequal treatment; a decades-long pattern of \nunder-compensated veterans; a decades-long injustice.\n  Unfortunately, veterans can't ask for what they don't know about.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to set aside some funds which will \nallow the VA to conduct an information campaign to inform veterans of \nthis past history of unequal treatment and under-compensation and to \nnotify them of how they can have their case reviewed for possible \ncorrection.\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs made a commitment to making the \nsituation right.\n  Here is what the Secretary said:\n\n       We are committed to doing what is right for our veterans. \n     If that entails that we have to set up a special operation \n     here in Illinois to review your claims or to look at new \n     claims that you as an eligible veteran want to make, we will \n     do that. We want each of you to feel that you have been \n     treated fairly and equitably by your VA, because you deserve \n     that.\n       The past is past, but as I have been charged by both of \n     these Senators, the future is now, and we are going to make a \n     special effort to see if we can have you feel sure that you \n     have been treated fairly and equitably by the VA so that you \n     will have a chance if you so choose to have a review of that, \n     or you can bring the new information to us, and we will make \n     every effort to see that that is reviewed, and reviewed \n     fairly and equitably for you.\n\n  Later at that meeting, the Secretary promised to provide the staff to \nget this done. He said:\n\n       . . . If we need more people here, we're going to get them. \n     And as I said when I spoke earlier, it looks like we could \n     make a special effort for you to come in and have a review or \n     come in with a new claim, and we're going to have people \n     there to process it and do it just as timely as we can.\n\n  Recently, those additional disability rating specialists arrived to \naugment the existing staff at the Chicago regional office so that \nclaims can be reviewed more thoroughly and more quickly.\n  Now the final step is for the VA to inform veterans that, while they \nhave indeed been under-compensated and short-changed for decades, help \nis now available to them.\n  The amendment which we have offered requires the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to conduct an information campaign in those States \nwhere the average annual disability compensation payment made to \nveterans is less than $7,300. According to the Inspector General's \nreport of May 19, 2005, there were six ``low cluster'' States below \nthis level of average disability payment. Those States were Illinois, \nNew Jersey, Ohio, Connecticut, Michigan and Indiana. The intent of this \nmeasure is to inform veterans of the past history of below-average \ndisability compensation payments in these States. It is also intended \nto provide these veterans with information on how to request a review \nof past\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nclaims and ratings and how to submit new claims as the Secretary has \npromised. The campaign would include mailed notifications to all \nveterans in these States who are currently receiving disability \ncompensation. The amendment also requires the Department to disseminate \nthis information through broadcast and print advertisements in order to \neducate any veterans whose past claims may have been improperly denied.\n  The deliberate sharing of this information with our most under-\ncompensated disabled veterans will help provide them with an \nopportunity to have their case reviewed and perhaps at long last to \nreceive the compensation to which they are entitled.\n  I yield the floor\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1867 and 1868\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to discuss two amendments to the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill.\n  My first amendment No. 1867, is an attempt to avoid the budget fiasco \nwe faced earlier this year.\n  We are working on an appropriations bill for a Department of Veterans \nAffairs that is under a cloud. The VA is under a cloud because earlier \nthis year, it announced a $1.27 billion budget deficit.\n  This news came as a surprise to millions of veterans across the \ncountry and was completely unexpected by Members of Congress.\n  In fact, the news of this gigantic shortfall came, not from an \nofficial announcement, but by accident, during a routine budget meeting \nwith congressional staffers. This was a billion-dollar blindside that \nnever should have happened, and that should never happen again.\n  I commend Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Diane Feinstein as well \nas Senators Craig and Akaka for their leadership in speeding additional \nfunding to fill the gap this year.\n  I also commend them for their great work in this appropriations bill \nand in their subcommittee report to make sure that this kind of budget \nfiasco does not happen again.\n  Specifically the requirement in this bill that VA make quarterly \nbudget reports to Congress makes good sense.\n  My amendment would build on that obligation and require the VA to \nnotify Congress immediately, if at any point in the year, they discover \nthat the Department may face a budget shortfall totaling 2 percent or \nmore of the VA's discretionary budget. It also would require VA to come \nup with a plan to improve its actuarial and long-term budget planning.\n  This amendment just makes common sense. Throughout the year, the VA \nis constantly receiving new data on enrollment, utilization, and \nmedical costs.\n  The VA knew for some time that it faced higher than expected \nenrollment of returning Iraq veterans. The VA was shifting money \nbetween administrative accounts to cover the gap well before they let \nCongressional appropriators and authorizers know. The earlier that \nCongress finds out about a problem, the more we can be partners in \nfinding a solution.\n  Senators Akaka, Durbin, and I have asked GAO to investigate the VA's \nbudget and actuarial process. My first amendment also would require the \nVA to do its own internal review and come up with a plan to improve the \nbudget process to compliment this investigation.\n  My second amendment, No. 1868, would address a problem that was \nbrought to my attention during a field hearing I held in Colorado on \nrural veterans issues in August.\n  Veterans in rural areas are in poorer health than their urban \ncounterparts. A 2004 study found that rural veterans scored worse than \nurban veterans both in overall health and mental health. Because of the \ndistance and difficulties in obtaining care, many rural veterans put \noff preventive as well as necessary treatment, which results in poorer \nhealth and ultimately increased health costs.\n  Almost every Senator in this body has heard similar stories, but I \nwill tell one. Veterans in northwestern Colorado who have to drive as \nmany as 360 miles round trip through winding mountain roads to reach \nthe VA Medical Center in Grand Junction. This is a grueling trip that \ntakes an economic and physical toll on our veterans and leads many to \nnot seek care.\n  Community-based outpatient clinics can be the most cost-effective way \nto reach veterans and ensure they get the ongoing primary healthcare \nthey need to stay healthy, and ward off expensive complications that \ncome from lack of early treatment.\n  Despite this, the VA's prioritization methodology used to identify \nnew clinic locations hurts rural veterans disproportionately.\n  Because of its emphasis on reaching the largest number of veterans in \na cost-effective way, the VA's clinic planning process is geared to \nurban and suburban areas, where there are the largest numbers of \nveterans.\n  The Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services, CARES, \nCommission asked VA to address this issue, and the VA has taken some \nimportant steps forward. However, at my hearing, VA officials told me \nthat current policies still heavily favor urban areas, and were \nprecluding the building of additional rural clinics.\n  In too many rural corners of this country, there are isolated pockets \nof veterans who do not have enough access to VA care. I believe that we \nneed additional outpatient clinics in rural America. For too long, \ntight budgets and bad priorities have slowed the building of new \nclinics across the country. My amendment would take a small step to \ngiving the VA the authority to expand access to health care in rural \nareas.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1867\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Salazar and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Salazar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1867.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on any Department of Veterans Affairs \n budget shortfall totaling 2 percent or more of the Department's total \n            discretionary funding budget for a fiscal year)\n\n       On page 93, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 222. (a) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     immediately submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs and \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     a report on any Department of Veterans Affairs budget \n     shortfall totaling 2 percent or more of the Department's \n     total discretionary funding budget for a fiscal year.\n       (b) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, not later than \n     180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, submit \n     to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs and Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives a comprehensive \n     plan to improve long-term budget planning and actuarial \n     forecasting at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1867) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1868\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment numbered \n1868 on behalf of Senator Salazar. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for Mr. Salazar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1868.\n\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To assist rural veterans)\n\n       On page 93, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 222. (a) In conducting advanced planning activities \n     under this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     reevaluate Veterans Health Administration Handbook 1006.1 and \n     other guidance and procedures related to planning, \n     activating, staffing, and maintaining community-based \n     outpatient clinics.\n       (b) In conducting such planning, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) revise as appropriate existing policies to make them \n     less disadvantageous to rural veterans; and\n       (2) reexamine criteria used in planning, activating, \n     staffing, and maintaining such clinics, including geographic \n     access, number of Priority 1-6 veterans, market penetration, \n     cost effectiveness, and distance to parent facilities, to \n     determine whether such criteria are weighted in a manner that \n     negatively affects rural veterans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1868) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:10 today, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to Akaka amendment No. \n1852, with no amendments in order to the amendment prior to that vote; \nprovided further that no other amendments be in order to the bill and \nthat following disposition of the Akaka amendment, H.R. 2528 be read \nfor a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage with no \nintervening action or debate; provided further that following the vote \nthe Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Senator Akaka is en route to the floor to \nmake some final comments on his amendment prior to the vote. With that \nin mind, and that vote occurring at 3:10, I will take 5 minutes or less \nto debate in opposition to the Akaka amendment. I do this with great \ndifficulty because the Senator is proposing additional funding in an \narea that we have already concentrated on, both in the appropriating \nsubcommittee and in the authorizing committee. He is asking for an \nadditional $10 million in the budget for the Veterans Readjustment \nCounseling Service. This would represent a $14 million increase for the \nservice just this year and that is an increase of almost 15 percent in \nits budget.\n  I agree the Veterans Readjustment Counseling Service does great work. \nThey have taken on some additional roles, including the Global War on \nTerrorism Outreach Program, but this bill already provides a generous \n$4 million increase for this function and more broadly provides over $3 \nbillion for veterans health care programs.\n  I understand the Senator from Hawaii would like to focus some \nattention on this program with his amendment, but I would say to my \ncolleagues that I believe the administration and the Senate Veterans \nAffairs' Committee, which I chair, has already focused the necessary \nneeded additional attention on mental health and the counseling needed \nfor our returning service members. We have also dialoged very directly \nwith the Veterans' Administration and at this time they feel they are \nadequately funded.\n  The bill I sponsored, S. 1182, which was just reported to the floor \nfrom the Veterans' Committee, contains numerous provisions to increase \nand provide access to mental health and counseling services. VA could \nhire marriage and family therapists as well as licensed medical health \ncare counselors.\n  Further, VA is directed to work on improving access to telehealth \ninitiatives in our Vet Center Program, which VA has expressed a desire \nto do.\n  Finally, I oppose the amendment because it would further reduce VA's \ninformation technology budget, which I think is critical. VA has made \ntremendous strides in improving its IT programs. It has made some \nerrors, but clearly the benefits are outweighing the mistakes, in my \nopinion, in most instances.\n  This bill places conditions on VA's access to its IT money to ensure \nit is well spent and properly managed. But at the end of the day, they \nmust continue to move forward and make needed improvements to their IT \nprogram, and the money in this bill is critical to making sure they do \nthat.\n  It is for all of these reasons, regretfully, that I stand to oppose \nSenator Akaka's amendment. As I said, we are putting substantially more \nmoney into counseling and veterans readjustment counseling services.\n  We understand from where the Senator speaks. We appreciate it. \nClearly, he and I and all of us who look more closely at veterans \nprograms recognize the need for counseling for many of our veterans \nwhen they return. It is a high priority of this chairman; it is a high \npriority of the ranking member. It is my opinion that with the \nadditional $3.2 billion--new dollars--in the veterans budget which this \nrepresents, with the add-ons which we put in Interior and a variety of \nother appropriations, we have adequately funded necessarily and \nappropriately the services the Senator would wish to provide additional \nmoneys for, taking them from critical areas but still remaining very \nimportant.\n  I see the Senator is on the floor to speak to his amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I will speak on this amendment. I tell our \ncolleagues Senator Craig and I work very well together, and we will \nstill work well together with the Veterans' Administration.\n  My amendment is to meet the needs that are there now. This amendment \ntakes $10 million from VA information technology--specifically from a \ntroubled Health-E-Vet Migration Program. So this is an offset to the \n$10 million.\n  IT is critically important. We know that. As ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am quite familiar with VA's \nelectronic medical record. VA is making use of the best technology out \nthere. We saw how good the electronic medical record was following \nHurricane Katrina when VA providers were able to access medical records \nof evacuees. This amendment would not impinge upon that critical \nprogram. I am also quite familiar with a failed computer program called \nCORE-F.L.S., which was abandoned after its failure at Big Pines VA \nMedical Center in Florida. To be sure, this $300 million contract \nfailed because of lax project management.\n  I want to make perfectly sure that the Health-E-Vet is on the right \ntrack. As recently as February of this year, VA hired Carnegie Mellon \nto assess this Health-E-Vet Program. Carnegie Mellon found that VA did \nnot ``have the needed staff or procedures for a large-scale system \nintegration project.''\n  In the meantime, PTSD and mental health needs of returning soldiers \nare absolutely critical. Vet centers are most likely the VA entity \nwhich will be first accessed by a returning soldier. History tells us \nthat returning soldiers are more likely to seek treatment at a \nstorefront vet center rather than a VA hospital or clinic.\n  I also remind my colleagues that if we reach returning soldiers with \nless serious readjustment issues, we might be able to stave off the \nmore debilitating PTSD. This is a simple choice that we make at this \ntime.\n  I thank my chairman for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kerry as cosponsors of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today \nwill help to ensure that our veterans have easy access to information \nabout the benefits that they have earned through their service to our \ncountry.\n  Each year, the Department of Veterans Affairs publishes an updated\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\nversion of a handbook entitled, ``Federal Benefits for Veterans and \nDependents,'' which contains useful information about benefits that are \navailable through the VA. I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites \nwho are concerned that this useful handbook is not readily available to \nour veterans and to County Veterans Service Officers, CVSOs, and others \nwho assist our veterans.\n  It is my understanding that the Department purchases a limited number \nof copies of this handbook each year that some are distributed to VA \nregional offices, to VA health care facilities, and to State \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs. Some of my constituents are concerned \nthat some facilities appear to have large stockpiles of this handbook, \nwhile others only receive a very limited number. I am also told that \ndistribution of the handbook is largely left up to regional and local \nVA officials.\n  A number of Wisconsin CVSOs have informed me that they are having \ntrouble obtaining adequate supplies of this handbook, and that they \noften have to rely on VA health care facilities or other sources to \nobtain additional copies. While I recognize that the handbook is \navailable for download on the Department's Web site and for purchase \nthrough the Government Printing Office, GPO, many CVSOs and veterans \nservice organizations do not have the resources to copy or purchase \nthis handbook in large quantities. In addition, many veterans, \nparticularly older veterans, do not have access to--or are unable to \nuse--the Internet and it seems unreasonable to charge them $7 to \npurchase the handbook from GPO.\n  Veterans who want a copy of this handbook should get one--it's that \nsimple. This handbook serves as a tangible reminder of the benefits \nthey earned, and it also serves as a helpful guide for CVSOs, veterans \nservice organizations, and others who work every day to ensure that our \nveterans receive these benefits. One Wisconsin CVSO tells me that this \nhandbook is very valuable in his work with veterans, some of whom have \ntold him that they have difficulty navigating the VA Web site or easily \nfinding information in the online copy of the handbook. Being able to \npoint a veteran to a specific page in the handbook is an important step \nin helping veterans to learn about their benefits or to find the \nanswers to many common questions that veterans may have about these \nbenefits.\n\n  Last year, in response to the concerns raised by my constituents, I \nasked former Secretary Principi to review the Department's policy for \ndistributing this important handbook, including ensuring that CVSOs \nhave access to this document. I also asked that he look into how to \nreallocate the supply to avoid a situation in which certain parts of \nthe VA have surpluses while others are scrambling to get these \nhandbooks to veterans who are requesting them. I also asked that he \nprovide an estimate of how much it would cost to ensure that all CVSOs \nin the country are provided at least one case of the handbook each year \nand whether the Department's current annual supply of handbooks could \nbe reallocated to achieve this goal. Finally, I requested that the \nSecretary provide me with information on the distribution policies of \nthe various VA administrations with respect to providing copies of this \nhandbook to individual veterans, including a description of the VA's \npolicy regarding making these handbooks visibly available to individual \nveterans at VA facilities.\n  In the former Secretary's response, he assured me that ``. . . due to \nthe increased outreach efforts initiated this past year, as well as the \nrequests for additional handbooks from external veterans service \nproviders, I am directing my senior leadership to reevaluate their \nrequirements for publication and distribution of the 2005 handbook. \nPlease be assured that county veterans service officers across the \nnation are included in next year's distribution.'' While I was \nencouraged by the former Secretary's response, CVSOs around Wisconsin \ntell me that they received only one or two copies of the 2006 edition \nof the handbook. This meager supply is not sufficient to use the \nhandbook as a reference and to provide copies to veterans who request \nthem.\n  The amendment that I am offering today would require the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to submit to the Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittees a plan to provide an adequate supply of the 2006 edition of \nthe ``Federal Benefits for Veterans and Dependents'' handbook and all \nsubsequent editions of this handbook to all county veterans service \nofficers in the country.\n  My amendment would also require the Secretary to work with the \nNational Association of County Veterans Service Officers, other \nveterans service organizations, and state departments of veterans \naffairs to determine what supply is adequate and to include a cost \nestimate for providing these handbooks to all county veterans service \nofficers in his report. The report would be due not later than 60 days \nafter the enactment of this bill.\n  Some at the VA have argued that this important handbook was developed \nas a desk reference for VA employees, CVSOs, veterans service \norganizations, and others who help veterans to learn about and obtain \ntheir benefits. Former Secretary Principi's letter to me states that in \n2003 ``. . . more than 1.4 million copies of the handbook were printed \nand distributed through the VA system. VA facilities, in turn, \ndistributed handbooks to local veterans support agencies and \norganizations, responded to requests for the handbooks and used them as \nspecial events such as homeless veterans stand downs, veterans \nconferences, health fairs, and job fairs.'' While this handbook is \nindeed a helpful reference for those who work on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans, it is also a comprehensive and handy guide to veterans \nbenefits that many veterans around my State have requested from their \nCVSOs. And it is evident from the former Secretary's response that the \nVA itself has made this publication available to individual veterans at \na variety of events. No CVSO should have to refuse a veteran a copy of \nthis booklet because he or she has been given an inadequate supply. No \nCVSO should have to tell a veteran that he or she does not have the \nbudget to make the veteran a photocopy of the handbook or that he or \nshe can gain access to it on the Internet or by purchasing it from GPO.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has the support of the Wisconsin \nAssociation of County Veterans Service Officers and the Wisconsin \nDepartment of the American Legion.\n  I understand that the managers have agreed to accept my amendment, \nand I want to thank them for their support on this issue. I look \nforward to reviewing the Secretary's report.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to support this important \npiece of legislation. As many of you know, the young soldiers returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan are already coming home with post traumatic \nstress disorder. A recent Army study found that one in six soldiers in \nIraq reported symptoms of major depression. Some experts predict that \nmore than 100,000 soldiers may need some kind of mental health \ntreatment when they come home.\n  It is not only our patriotic duty to provide these soldiers with the \nbenefits they deserve; it is our moral duty at the most fundamental \nlevel. Unfortunately, PTSD is a disease that is still all too often \nmisunderstood, and as I speak, there are efforts at the VA to require \nthose folks who suffer PTSD to undergo additional scrutiny in the \ndisability benefits process.\n  According to VA, it will review 72,000 cases in which the maximum \namount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded. The rationale for \nreviewing these cases is VA's belief that 2.5 percent of these cases \nare ``potentially fraudulent.'' But notably, this review will entirely \nignore cases in which benefits may have been unjustly denied.\n  This review sends a troubling message to the brave men and women who \ndefended this country. Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy \nwith the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans. \nThis decision to reopen only approved PTSD claims merely serves to \npromote that impression.\n  It is unconscionable for our Government to put the onus on law-\nabiding veterans to affirmatively demonstrate that they are not \nengaging in fraud. The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD \ndisability is extremely time consuming. It requires the compilation of \nmedical records, military service records, and testimony from\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nother veterans who can attest to a person's combat exposure. I cannot \nfathom why the VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally \npainful process for a second time.\n  The VA--and our Nation's veterans--would be better served by creating \nnationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims. As underscored by the \ninspector general's report in May that evaluated the chronic disparity \nbetween benefits received by veterans in Illinois and veterans in the \nrest of the country, PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to \nsignificant variation. That same report uncovered significant variation \nin PTSD ratings from State to State--with Illinois consistently in the \nbottom rung for those ratings. The variation in PTSD ratings across the \ncountry may very well be the result of a lack of training or \nstandardized practices on the part of the VA, not fraud on the part of \nour Nation's veterans.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Hutchison and Ranking Member Feinstein \nworked with me and Senators Durbin and Murray to include an amendment \nthat prohibits the VA from proceeding with its review unless and until \nthe VA reports to the Appropriations Committee on its plan for \nimplementing this recommendation and outlines the staffing and funding \nrequirements.\n  While this is an important provision, I am disappointed that there \nwas no requirement that the VA look at denials of benefits as well as \ngrants. To get an accurate and fair depiction of PTSD claims in this \ncountry, we need to ensure that denials are reviewed as well as grants \nof benefits. I will continue to work with my colleagues to see that \nthis fundamental issue of fairness is addressed.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Hutchison and Ranking Member Feinstein \nfor their assistance in accepting an amendment to provide notice to \nveterans in certain States about their right to seek a review of their \ncases.\n  This provision addresses an important issue in Illinois. As some of \nyou may know, Illinois has for more than two decades ranked 50th out of \nall 50 States in terms of disability benefit compensation. This \nstaggering disparity in payments may well be the result of poor \nstaffing and a lack of standards for disability payments across the \nNation.\n  I have been pleased that Secretary Nicholson has agreed to provide \nthe veterans of Illinois with extra disability raters so that the \nveterans in Illinois who may have been unjustly denied benefits will \nhave the opportunity to seek a special review of their cases.\n  Unfortunately, up to now, there has been no special effort made to \nalert veterans to this special opportunity. This amendment will provide \nthe funds for information campaigns in states with less than average \ndisability compensation rates. These campaigns will alert veterans of \nthe past history of below-average disability benefit rates and provide \nthese veterans with information on how to request a review of any past \nclaims. The hiring of additional disability raters is important, but it \nis meaningless unless veterans know of their right to get their cases \nreopened.\n  I thank my colleagues for their assistance with these amendments.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I propose that for the moment we set \naside the Akaka amendment, that Senator Craig and I make our 2-minute \nending comments, and we then have the vote on the Akaka amendment, and \nthen final passage so there are consecutive votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this bill is notable in several regards:\n  First, under the leadership of Senator Akaka and Senator Byrd, we \nwere able to provide $1.977 billion in emergency funding in this bill \nto address the projected shortfall in veterans health care funding for \n2006.\n  This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in the 2005 supplemental \nfunding we were able to add to the 2006 Interior appropriations bill to \nmake up the current shortfall in veterans health care. The bill before \nthe Senate now totals $82.98 billion, of which $44 billion is \ndiscretionary spending.\n  For military construction, the bill equals the budget request of \n$12.116 billion. Although we have rearranged some of the funding within \nthat request for the VA, the total amount appropriated in this bill is \n$70.7 billion, including $34.1 billion in discretionary and $36.6 \nbillion in mandatory spending. This is $3.2 billion above the \nPresident's original budget request.\n  I commend and thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Hutchison \nof Texas. We have worked very well together in producing a very good \nbill. I am delighted we were able to finish it with quick speed.\n  I thank the staff on both sides. We have great professional staff. \nThey have done a fine job.\n  I would like to turn it over to the chairman of the committee, my \nfriend, Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly appreciate the comments of my ranking member, Senator \nFeinstein, with whom I have worked very closely on this bill. We have \ntried to accommodate every Member to the best of our ability with the \npriorities that many Members are concerned about--certain areas of the \nVeterans' Administration particularly. I think we have addressed those \nconcerns in a responsible way.\n  I think it is very important to pass this bill because we have stayed \nwithin our budget allocation. We will be coming in later, I am sure, \nwith some supplemental health for veterans facilities that have been in \nthe hurricane-affected areas of our country, but I hope we will be able \nto defeat the Akaka amendment, which would skew the cap on the bill, \nand then go to final passage. I think it is a bill everyone can \nsupport. It certainly goes further in terms of meeting our veterans' \nneeds than any veterans bill has ever done, including the supplemental \n$3.2 billion, because the Secretary of Veterans Affairs came to us and \nsaid our models are wrong, we need more money, and we have supplied \nthat money on a bipartisan basis.\n  I recommend this to my colleagues.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the chairman yielding.\n  Let me say to the chairman and ranking member, as the chairman of the \nauthorizing Committee of Veterans' Affairs, how much we appreciate the \ncooperative way in which we have worked together to get these numbers \nright. Both Senators have spoken very clearly to that effort and to the \nunprecedented amount of money that has flowed to veterans at this time, \nwhich we think is necessary and appropriate.\n  I thank the Senator for that due diligence.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, which amendment is pending?\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1852\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The question is on agreeing \nto the Akaka amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I wish to read a quote from the Chicago \nTribune, dated September 14, by Judith Graham, Tribune staff reporter \ncommenting on the conditions of people needing medical care and needing \nit desperately on the heels of Katrina:\n\n       A New Orleans man with a brain tumor needed surgery fast--\n     but when he found himself stranded without health insurance \n     in Baton Rouge after Hurricane Katrina, it took the \n     intervention of Ruth Kennedy, Louisiana's deputy Medicaid \n     director, to get him help.\n       Yet this energetic state official can't possibly pull \n     strings for all of the people who need medical assistance \n     after the storm, such as an 89-year-old Louisiana man, now in \n     Los Angeles with family, who couldn't fill his prescriptions \n     because his Louisiana Medicaid card isn't good in California. \n     Or a displaced New Orleans woman with colon cancer who needed \n     chemotherapy but couldn't get an appointment in the city she \n     had fled to after the storm.\n       Meeting the medical needs of up to 1 million hurricane \n     evacuees scattered across the country looms as an enormous \n     challenge. Most of them are without their medical records or \n     any way to contact their physicians; many are suddenly \n     without jobs and at risk of losing their medical coverage; \n     and as a group, they're disproportionately likely to be needy \n     and sicker-than-average.\n\n  Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and I have \nwritten a bill. We would like the swift passage of that bill. It is the \nEmergency Health Care Relief Act. This bill would provide victims of \nHurricane Katrina with the health care they urgently need. We should \npass this bill, and we should pass it immediately.\n  We have all seen the terrible destruction, the dead, the displaced, \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars in damages.\n  Traveling down to the Gulf Coast last week, I saw the havoc Katrina \nhad wreaked. It is stunning. It is like a war zone. It is worse than \nthe pictures. It is worse than I had imagined.\n  At one stop, we went into what was left of a library. Muck and ruin \ncovered books and other library materials. One shiny object caught my \neye. I reached down to pick it up. What was it? It was a DVD of the \nfilm, ``The Perfect Storm.''\n  Among its many consequences, the hurricane inflicted countless blows \nto people's health. A third of Katrina evacuees in Houston had injuries \nor health problems, and more than half of those evacuees were seeking \nmedical care.\n  The bill Senator Grassley and I introduced will provide that care. \nOur bill will provide temporary Medicaid coverage for Katrina \nsurvivors. It will provide for a streamlined application. It will make \nbenefits available right\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\nnow. It will provide coverage for up to 5 months, with a possible \nextension of 5 months. It is emergency health care benefits for people \nwho need it. Pregnant women and children will be eligible for help at \nhigher income levels, and an extended package of mental health services \nunder Medicaid will help survivors deal with the trauma of Katrina. To \nsupport those who have private health insurance, our bill will provide \nFederal assistance to help individuals keep their coverage. I say that \nwith reference to the article I read, the reporter's comments about \npeople who do not have health insurance anymore because they have lost \ntheir jobs. Our bill will help alleviate the burden of providing health \ncare. I have been inspired by the sights and stories of health care \nworkers who have done all in their power to help treat victims. To \nensure these providers are compensated, our bill establishes a disaster \nrelief fund to cover the uncompensated costs they incur because of \nKatrina.\n\n  There are millions of dollars of uncompensated health care costs. \nKatrina inflicted massive financial losses on the States of \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama. Our legislation calls on the \nFederal Government to pay 100 percent of Medicaid and children's health \ncare costs for 2006. For Alabama, the Government will pick up 100 \npercent of those costs in several particularly ravaged counties.\n  Our bill postpones a scheduled decrease in Federal Medicaid payments \nfor 2006 to ensure all States have the means to meet their health care \nneeds in this trying time.\n  Our legislation provides immediate access to funds through the TANF \nprogram for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama for 14 months and \nprovides these States, as well as States providing services to \nevacuees, immediate access to the TANF contingency fund, which is a \nvery important part of the 1996 welfare law. It has been difficult and \nhard to use until now. Our bill eases time limits on aid so people can \nget immediate help, and our legislation provides federally funded \nextension of unemployment benefits for unemployed workers in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. This law will go a long way toward helping \nKatrina survivors to get back on their feet.\n  We must act and act now to help those who have been harmed. This is \nan emergency. This is not time for the legislative process as usual. \nThis is an emergency. People need help now, not tomorrow. We must do \nour part to help this region and its people, and we can do so today by \npassing the Emergency Health Care Relief Act.\n  This bill should be brought up now, today. Several of us have \napproached the leadership to try to get this bill up now and passed \ntoday. People need help. Many have no insurance. They have lost their \njobs. Time is critical. Senator Grassley and I and our staffs have \nworked together for over a week. We have a good effort to help meet \nhealth care needs. The affected States agree. Senators from both sides \nof the aisle of the affected States have all worked with us. We have \nagreement. All Senators in the affected States, including Senator \nGrassley and myself, agree.\n  I cannot speak for the House of Representatives, but I can speak for \nus in this body. We have a very good package that I think should pass \nright now. I am very concerned that there are Senators here, on the \nother side of the aisle, who object. No one on this side of the aisle \nobjects to this legislation coming up. I am informed there are Senators \non the other side of the aisle who object to having this legislation \ncoming up. The objection is we have not had time to read it. I \nunderstand that. It was brought up fairly quickly. We can give Senators \ntime to read it. We can bring this legislation up tomorrow. Certainly \nthey can read it over 24 hours--that is enough time to read this bill--\nor the next 72 hours, over the weekend. Certainly there has to be some \ntrust around here. Senator Grassley and his staff and I have fly-\nspecked this bill. We worked very hard together over a period of almost \n2 weeks. We worked with the Senators affected. They all agree, this is \nan emergency. This is not legislation as usual.\n  I call on my colleagues, let's bring up this bill and get it passed. \nI am very tempted to ask for unanimous consent to bring up this bill \nnow, move us into legislative session, and bring this bill up now. Why? \nVery simply: It is the right thing to do. Very simply: These people \nneed help. Very simply: It has been worked on for almost 2 weeks now. \nVery simply: I cannot think of any possible significant, legitimate \nexception.\n  I will not push for consideration at this point in deference to those \nwho believe they need more time, but I very much hope when the time \ndoes come, maybe tomorrow, maybe on Monday, that this bill does come \nup, that we work our way through those objections so all Senators can \nunanimously pass this legislation. It is so important, it is so needed \nfor so many people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                            The War In Iraq\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have considered many important issues \non Capitol Hill this week. Here on the floor of the Senate, two major \nappropriations bills have passed, and in the Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I serve, we considered the historic nomination of John Roberts to \nbe our next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Those are all \nworthy issues for this Chamber to consider. Unfortunately, not enough \nhas been said this week about an ongoing challenge to this Nation, \nwhich costs us dearly.\n  I speak directly to the issue of the war in Iraq. Yesterday I joined \nmany of my colleagues for a briefing with the Secretary of Defense, \nAmbassador Jeffrey, and General Myers, about the situation in Iraq. \nNaturally I am constrained and cannot disclose details or specifics of \nthat briefing. But I think in the most general terms American people \nunderstand what is happening in Iraq. Whether it is called terrorism or \ninsurrection, it continues apace. Every single day, harrowing reports \ncome out of civilian casualties and the deaths and injuries to our \nsoldiers. Unfortunately, we do not speak enough on this floor about the \nreality of this war. This is the reality.\n\n       Americans killed in Iraq as of this morning, 1,907; \n     Americans wounded, 14,641.\n\n  If you are not familiar with how these categories of wounded soldiers \nare created, you should understand many of these soldiers suffer far \nmore than superficial wounds. I have visited with them at Walter Reed \nHospital and veterans hospitals back in my part of the country. I have \nseen men and women who are facing amputations, serious head \ninjuries, problems that will change their lives forever. The wounds \nthey have suffered are wounds they will carry for the rest of their \nlives.\n\n  There are many veterans who come home from that war with invisible \nwounds, with wounds of spirit--post-traumatic stress disorder from \nthings they have seen, things they have done, stress they have been \nplaced under for extended periods of time. If you have friends who \nserved in the Vietnam war, you may know one who is still trying to \novercome the fact that he is haunted by that experience. This is the \nreality of war. It is a reality you see time and again, as families \nstand by hospital beds or stand in grief at the funerals. It is a \nreminder that we cannot ignore the issue of the war in Iraq. We cannot \nignore the reality of what it has brought to America.\n  Last week, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani came to Washington. As he \narrived in Washington, he said he believed the United States could \nsafely withdraw 50,000 troops before the end of the year. He said Iraqi \nforces are trained and ready to assume control of their own country. \nThen he went to the White House and he changed his remarks. He was not \nas specific; he was not as definite. He said he hoped the Iraqi troops \ncould take over for American troops at some point in the future.\n  It was enticing to hear him suggest that 50,000 of the 146,000 \ncurrently serving in Iraq would be home by Christmas. I still think \nthat is a goal we should not give up on. Unfortunately, we are still \nwaiting for concrete evidence that Iraqi troops are ready to assume the \nresponsibility of defending their own country. I am not certain they \ncan take on this insurgency today from a political or a military point \nof view. But we need to see a clear path from the point where we are \ntoday to the withdrawal of American troops. We need to have this \nadministration articulate that path and make it clear to the people of \nthis country.\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n  Next month the second report on the status of the training of Iraqi \nforces is due. It is critical that this report provide real information \non the readiness of these forces to meet President Talabani's \nsuggestion. While it must not disclose vital security information, this \nreport must include enough data in unclassified form so we know exactly \nwhere we are today in terms of the Iraqi takeover of the defense of \ntheir own country.\n  The trajectory to date is not encouraging. There have been peaks \nrecently, including the historic vote in January in the first real \ndemocratic election in Iraq's history. But 470 Americans have been \nkilled since those elections on January 30 of this year--470. The \nadministration to date has not managed to change that terrible \nequation; and 2\\1/2\\ years after the invasion I still do not believe \nthe administration has a clear plan to secure the peace.\n  Intelligence analysts, both civilian and military, use a phrase \ncalled ``ground truthing.'' Geographers and geophysicists use the same \nterm. It means going out and physically surveying the terrain, \nrecognizing the reality on the ground may not match the map you have \nbeen given. The solution to this disparity is not to try to bulldoze \nthe landscape or to sculpt it to match the map or to sculpt it to match \nan expectation in your mind. The solution is not to blind yourself to \nreality on the ground. The solution is to recognize differences between \nwhat you expected and what you were actually experiencing. You may need \nto redraw your map. You will almost certainly need to readapt your \nplan.\n  From the day of the invasion, plans were drawn up that refused to \nrecognize the reality on the ground in Iraq. This administration has \nblinded itself to what I call these ground truths. Our troops rolled in \nand defeated Saddam Hussein and his vaunted National Republican Guard. \nYou know why--we have the best fighting men and women in the world. No \none else even comes close. But defeating an army is not the same as \ndefeating an insurrection. The reports we read in the press suggest \nthat insurrection is still very strong and very lethal.\n  Defeating an insurgency such as that is so much harder. These \nterrorists, these insurgents, do not swim in a sea of sand. They are \nsupported by people in Iraq. It demands a completely honest, clear-\neyed, honest, and unbiased understanding of what we are facing, the \npolitical, cultural, and physical ground truths. I am afraid this is \nlacking in this administration's administration of this war.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy gave the commencement address at \nthe U.S. Naval Academy. There he said:\n\n       You gentlemen, therefore, have a most important \n     responsibility, to recognize that your education is just \n     beginning, and to be prepared, in the most difficult period \n     in the life of our country, to play the role that the country \n     hopes and needs and expects from you.\n       You must understand not only this country but other \n     countries. You must know something about strategy and tactics \n     and logistics, but also economics and politics and diplomacy \n     and history.\n       You must know everything you can know about military power, \n     and you must also understand the limits of military power. \n     You must understand that few of the important problems of our \n     time have, in the final analysis, been finally solved by \n     military power alone.\n\n  Iraq has shown us again the limits of military power, even the \nmilitary capabilities of a super power. It has shown us the importance \nof allies. And it has shown us the importance of ground truthing.\n  We are now constrained by the limits that are imposed by the prior \npoor decisions this Administration has made in Iraq, not just by going \nto war but in how it went to war.\n  If we were prepared for the invasion and the war, we certainly were \nnot prepared for what followed. When the administration went to war, it \nfailed to build a real coalition. How much different that war would be \ntoday if the President had at his side Muslim nations helping us to \nmaintain stability in Iraq. When it executed the invasion, it tore down \nsocial, political, and economic structures that couldn't be replaced. \nWe saw the beginning of the disintegration when the looting began, and \nit continues almost every day with improvised explosive devices from \nthe almost endless arsenal of equipment and ammunition still on the \nground for the taking in Iraq.\n  In Iraq, it sometimes seems that we have been building levees of sand \nthat have steadily eroded. I am reminded of the images of the \nhelicopters in Louisiana dumping enormous sandbags into a gaping hole \non a broken levee and how these enormous sandbags would disappear, \nswallowed up by the force of the water. Is that what is happening in \nIraq? That is what we have to ask, and that is what this administration \nmust answer.\n  Are we making enough progress in Iraq to justify what it is costing \nus in blood, treasure, and in damage to our own national security? That \nis becoming a more and more difficult question. It certainly is a \nquestion this administration has not faced forthrightly. The American \npeople deserve an answer. Men and women in uniform risking their lives \ntoday in Iraq deserve an answer.\n  If we are not making sufficient progress, what are we going to do to \nchange direction?\n  I have joined others in saying that progress in the battlefield alone \nis never going to be enough. The Iraqi Government has to function as a \nreal Government. It has to be able to provide basic social services, to \nprotect its borders, offer its people security, and it is a far \ndistance before they ever reach that point. Now, the Iraqi Government \ncannot perform these basic functions. Today, electricity in Baghdad is \nstill at prewar levels. Power is off and on for only a few hours each \nday. Barely half the Iraqis have access to clean water. Unemployment \nestimates range from 27 to 40 percent. In addition to the terrible \natrocities of car bombings and other attacks, street crime is now \nepidemic.\n  There are 146,000 U.S. forces in Iraq today, and there are those who \nsay that they just aren't enough to do the job. There are others who \nwould like to see them all leave tomorrow. But whatever the right \nnumber is, stability in Iraq, security in Iraq, and peace in Iraq \ndepend ultimately upon the Iraqis and their Government--not American \nsoldiers and their lives.\n  Next month, the Iraqis will again go to the polls to vote up or down \non a draft constitution that is before them. Voting in a country under \nsiege is a real act of courage by the people of Iraq. We respect them, \nand we respect that decision to go and vote very much. This referendum \nis an important step forward in the political process. But however the \nreferendum turns out, it is not clear that on October 16--the day after \nthe vote--the people of Iraq will be all that much closer to a unified, \nstable, and secure Government. I certainly hope they will be.\n  But if the constitution passes without the support of a major faction \nsuch as the Sunnis, it is hard to see how security and unity will \nemerge, and if the constitution is defeated we may have to start over.\n  The best possible outcome I can imagine is whichever way the \nreferendum turns out that it is followed by civic engagements from all \nfactions in Iraq--the Kurds, the Sunnis, the Shiites, and others. \nWithout that civic engagement, I don't see how the political progress \nin Iraq can succeed. But whatever comes next, we must not let our \ndesire to see progress in Iraq blind us to reality.\n  We need some political ground truthing as well.\n  President Kennedy was right when he said many problems do not have \nmilitary solutions.\n  We need an integrated plan for Iraq that addresses critical political \nand economic needs. We need a plan that would finally bring \ninternational cooperation that this administration initially thought it \ncould do without. We need a plan to draw down American forces--not \nmerely because the war is less popular in our country but because we \nhave to tell the Iraqis, once and for all, they have to take charge of \ntheir own future and their own security.\n  We need a plan that is based on the Iraqi political calendar, not our \nown. That is a plan we still have not received from this \nadministration.\n  The 146,000 U.S. service men and women in Iraq today risking their \nlives deserve that plan, so do their families at home, and so do the \nAmerican taxpayers who have poured nearly $200 billion into this war--a \nwar which continues to demand over $1 billion a week. The war has come \nat a terrible price for Americans.\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\n  This chart shows the most graphic evidence of the cost: 1,907 of our \nbest and bravest who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, a sacrifice \nborne by their families forever.\n  We don't honor their sacrifice if we refuse to ask the hard \nquestions, if we refuse to demand of this administration--any \nadministration--to tell us the truth of what we are facing and how we \nwill bring this to an honorable conclusion.\n  October will give us a better understanding of what is happening in \nIraq with both the constitutional referendum and the Department of \nDefense report. It is then up to all of us to act on that knowledge, to \nrecognize our trajectory and to change the course, if we must.\n  Before America loses 2,000 of our best and bravest in Iraq, this \nadministration needs to come forward and speak clearly on its plan to \nbring our troops home. This administration needs to make it clear that \nIraq must accept its own responsibility to protect its own nation.\n  If the Iraqi war exposed a failure of intelligence, if Hurricane \nKatrina exposed a failure of imagination and preparation, the lives we \nlose every day in Iraq make it clear that we can wait no longer for \nleadership and vision to bring this war to an end as quickly as \npossible.\n  We in the Senate need to do our part. Each year, we consider a bill \ncalled the Department of Defense authorization bill. It is a bill which \nconsiders not only what our troops need but what our veterans need.\n  If there is ever a time when we should be spending more time on that \nthan anything else, it is now, right now, as we are losing soldiers \nevery day and seeing these soldiers come home wounded.\n  I am sorry to report to you that before we left on the August recess, \nthat bill was withdrawn from the calendar. It was taken off the floor \nof the Senate for reasons I still don't understand. The leadership in \nthe Senate decided there were more important things to talk about. We \nmoved from the Department of Defense authorization bill to a special \ninterest bill from the gun lobby that just had to be passed before we \nleft for our August recess. That is a mistaken priority. It is a \nmistake that, frankly, does not reflect well on the Senate.\n\n  What could be more important for us to consider at this moment in our \nhistory than the Department of Defense bill? What could be more \nimportant than talk about the equipment needs of our troops, to protect \nsons and daughters who are standing in the path of bullets, in the path \nof bombs in Iraq today? What can be more important than to talk about \nveterans' benefits for those who are coming home, to make sure we do \neverything we can to keep our promise to them; that if they will stand \nup for America, we will stand up for our veterans? Why aren't we \nreturning to this bill?\n  Why is the Republican leadership refusing to go back to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill? It should be the first thing \non the calendar. But, unfortunately, the decision has been made that we \nwill not. I think it is wrong. I think we owe it to the men and women \nin uniform, their families praying for them at home, and everyone in \nthis country who is so proud of their contribution to make that our \nhighest priority.\n  I sincerely hope that when we return to the Senate next week, we will \nreturn to that Department of Defense authorization bill--return to it \nto make certain that the equipment, the supplies, and all that is \nneeded will be there for those troops.\n  I can remember the first soldier I visited at Walter Reed so long \nago. He was from an Ohio unit. He had lost his left leg below the knee. \nI was amazed. There he was still scarred, with IVs running, recent \namputation. And I asked him what he thought. He said, I want to tell \nyou two things. First, please get some protection in those humvees. Put \nsome armor in those humvees. They are just moving targets for those \nterrorists in Iraq. Second, tell me how I can get back with my unit.\n  I heard that so many times from so many soldiers who feel such an \nobligation to the men and women who stood next to them in battle. If \nthey feel that obligation to fellow soldiers, shouldn't we feel an \nobligation to them? Shouldn't we make this our highest priority in the \nSenate?\n  I cannot understand why we have failed to do that. I call on the \nleadership, on Senator Frist and others, to set aside whatever you \nplanned after we consider Judge Roberts next week and move directly to \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill. I can guarantee you that \nyou will have the cooperation of the Democratic side of the aisle to \ncome up with a definite set of amendments, a limited time for debate \nand a movement to final passage as quickly as possible. Those are \nthings we can work out. But we can only work them out if the leadership \nof the Senate believes this is the same high priority that I feel \ntoday.\n  That is our responsibility--our responsibility for these men and \nwomen who have given their lives and given important parts of \nthemselves for this country.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10363-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10363-S10364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee voted \nto bring the nomination of John Roberts to the full Senate for its \nconsideration. I am quite sure that by October 3, 2005, Mr. Roberts \nwill be sworn in as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States.\n  Today is a very important day for the Senate. I say this because \nseveral months ago this body was mired in a partisan judicial battle \nthat many thought would end in a nuclear winter. Very few people, \nincluding a majority of the American public, thought that we would \nweather the storm and find common ground. But instead of nuclear \nwinter, this body was able to rise above the partisan bickering that \nhas plagued us for some time, and we were able to come to an agreement, \nan understanding that has allowed the judicial process to move forward.\n  While I do not intend to review that entire agreement, there is one \npart that is worth noting.\n  It states:\n\n       We believe that under Article II, Section 2, of the United \n     States Constitution, the word ``Advice'' speaks to \n     consultation between the Senate and the President with regard \n     to the use of the President's power to make nominations.\n       We encourage the Executive branch of government to consult \n     with members of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, \n     prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       Such a return to the early practices of our government may \n     very well serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately \n     accompanies the advice and consent process in this Senate.\n\n  I think that in the case of John Roberts, the clause I read has been \nheeded by this administration, and I applaud President Bush for \nfollowing in the tradition of past Presidents who have sought \nmeaningful consultation with the Senate.\n  For the first time in my short tenure as a Senator, I felt as though \nthis administration put forth an effort to gauge where the Senate was \non a nomination and acted accordingly.\n  I believe the White House, when working together with the Senate as a \ncoequal branch of Government, will always be able to find a consensus \nnominee who will faithfully uphold the Constitution and represent the \nbest of our justice system.\n  I think in the case of John Roberts, that was accomplished. This is \none of several reasons I have decided to vote to confirm John Roberts \nas the next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  When President Bush nominated Mr. Roberts, I said then that I felt \nvery strongly the Senate must fulfill its constitutional duty to learn \nas much about John Roberts' judicial record as possible, including his \nwork over the past 2 years since he has been on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the DC Circuit.\n  The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of our liberties and freedom, \nand appointments for these gatekeepers are rare and pivotal. A Supreme \nCourt Justice deserves a high threshold of review, and I think John \nRoberts was put to the test.\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n  I applaud the Judiciary Committee for all of their hard work over the \npast few months and for the quality of last week's hearings. The \nquality of the questions and the ensuing debate were a testament to the \nimportant work the committee does and a testament to the valued \nleadership of Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Patrick Leahy.\n  I had an opportunity to meet personally with John Roberts. He is \nsomeone with whom you can sit down and talk for hours about the law. He \nis genial and easy to get along with. He is a family man. While these \nare all wonderful qualities, it is not why I am voting for him.\n  I am voting for Mr. Roberts because he meets the criteria I have set \nout for judicial nominations, criteria I have used in assessing all \njudicial nominations that have come before this body.\n  When looking at the nomination of Mr. Roberts, I first asked: Does \nJohn Roberts have the qualifications or credentials to be a judge?\n  I think the answer to this question is obvious to anyone, and no one \nin this body will dispute it. Judge Roberts brings with him excellent \ncredentials. He is a brilliant lawyer, and I was very impressed with \nhis breadth of knowledge of the law. He has also, on multiple \noccasions, demonstrated a genuine understanding of the law.\n  I was also very impressed with his testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee. While some of my colleagues and I would have liked for Mr. \nRoberts to further explain some of his answers and positions, no one \ncan dispute he has the ability to take this most prestigious post.\n  My second criteria: Will Mr. Roberts be of the right judicial \ntemperament? As a lawyer who has argued in front of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt 39 times, I believe Mr. Roberts has a high level of respect for \nthe law, its institutions, and its traditions.\n  I am convinced, after spending time with Mr. Roberts, that he will \nconduct himself with the dignity befitting of a Supreme Court Justice \nand that he will lead the Federal judiciary with honor and integrity.\n  My third criteria: Will John Roberts be fair and impartial and not an \nactivist? I want to believe the answer is yes.\n  I do not think it is any secret there are Members of this body, \nincluding myself, who were and still are in disagreement with some of \nPresident Reagan's domestic policies, especially pertaining to civil \nrights.\n  I, of course, was not in the Senate during the 1980s, and being a few \nyears younger than Mr. Roberts, I was still in school when he was \nstarting his legal career. I do not agree with many of the opinions Mr. \nRoberts expressed in his memos while serving in the Office of the U.S. \nAttorney General, but I can say that as a lawyer I have taken positions \nthat were not my own but were my client's.\n  I can also say that time has a way of changing a man. It is my hope \nthat after 20 years of gaining life experience, John Roberts has a \nbetter understanding and appreciation of how important civil rights \nprotections are to the survival of this country and that he has moved \naway from some of his earlier writings.\n  There will be people in my home State of Arkansas who are going to be \nvery pleased that I am voting for Mr. Roberts. I will also face \nconstituents who will be disappointed. I am sure those constituents \nwill ask: Senator Pryor, how can you be sure? How can you be sure, \nwithout broader explanations from Mr. Roberts, or without more \ndocuments, that he will vote this way or that way on an issue?\n  My answer to that is twofold. First, I do not believe it is my duty \nas a Senator to confirm only judges I believe are going to vote the way \nI want them to 100 percent of the time. My duty as a Senator is to use \nmy discretion to put the best jurist possible on the bench. I believe \nwe have achieved that threshold with John Roberts.\n  Just as importantly, I would answer those critical of my decision to \nsupport Judge Roberts by saying, you can never be 100 percent sure.\n  I have chosen, based upon the evidence I have, based on my talks with \nJohn Roberts, based on his testimony, to put my faith in Judge Roberts.\n  I have chosen to believe him when he says he is not an ideologue. I \nhave chosen to believe he will uphold the Constitution above all else \nand that he will not let politics or personal agenda get in the way of \nhis job.\n  I am certain in the years that follow there will be times I laud \nJustice Roberts' opinions, and there will be times I will be \ndisappointed in his rulings. But I am confident I will never be \ndisappointed in his integrity, his temperament, or his ability to \nconduct himself as a man of the Court, not as a man of politics. \nTherefore, I once again state my intention to vote for Judge Roberts \nwhen his nomination comes to the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, headlines across the Nation warn of an \nimpending disaster facing American families this winter--rising energy \nprices that could wipe out working-class families and seniors. The New \nYork Times reports:\n       Energy Prices Lead Inflation, Overcoming Salary Increases.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal states:\n\n       Soaring Natural-Gas Prices Point to Record-High Electricity \n     Costs.\n\n  USA Today states:\n\n       Heating Prices Loom as Problems this Winter.\n\n  Prior to Hurricane Katrina's devastation in the gulf region, \nAmericans were facing record prices for oil, natural gas, and propane. \nHurricane Katrina exacerbated these costs by damaging production \nplatforms and ports and curtailing production at refineries in the Gulf \nof Mexico. Now Hurricane Rita threatens further damage and, in turn, \nprice increases. Natural gas prices are hitting all-time highs, and \ncrude oil and gasoline prices are again on the rise.\n  Consumers are feeling the price increases at the pump. But with \nwinter looming, the full effect of these costs has yet to hit us.\n  In New England, the average heating cost for a family using heating \noil is projected to reach $1,666 during the upcoming winter. This \nrepresents an increase of $403 over last winter's prices and $714 over \nthe winter heating season of 2003-2004, almost a $1,000 increase in 2 \nyears.\n  For a family using natural gas in the Midwest, prices are projected \nto hit $1,568, representing an increase of $611 over last year's prices \nand $643 over the heating season of 2003-2004. The Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation expects steep energy costs could increase the number of \nmissed payments and lost homes beginning later this year.\n  Yesterday, the State energy directors released a survey about the \nchoices that LIHEAP households make when they face unaffordable energy \nbills. Of course, LIHEAP is the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program \nthat we have authored and supported for many years in Congress. LIHEAP \nassists low-income Americans and seniors to ensure they can face these \nprices.\n  According to the survey by the State energy directors, 73 percent of \nthe households surveyed reported they reduce expenses for other \nnecessities because they do not have enough money to pay for their \nenergy bills. These other necessities are food, prescription drugs, \nrent, or mortgage payments. In\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nfact, one in five LIHEAP households reported they went without food at \nleast 1 day over the last 5 years due to unaffordable energy bills. \nTwenty-four percent used their stove or oven to provide heat because \nthey could not fill the tanks to provide heat.\n  On Monday, I visited the home of Aram Ohanian, an 88-year-old veteran \nwho lives in Rhode Island and whose monthly income consists of $779 in \nSocial Security payments. Money is so tight that Mr. Ohanian sometimes \neats at his daughter's house or goes to a local soup kitchen for food. \nHe also gets help from a local food bank. Last year, Mr. Ohanian \nreceived a total of $600 in LIHEAP grants to help him keep his home \nsafe and warm. But even with that assistance, he had to close off parts \nof his house to reduce energy costs.\n  In communities throughout this Nation, Mr. Ohanian's story repeats \nitself. The warning has been issued. We know that prices for energy \nproducts are on the rise. We can all foretell the next disaster facing \nAmerican families. The question is, What will we do to protect these \nAmericans from this upcoming energy storm?\n  We saw the most vulnerable Americans overwhelmed by rising waters in \nNew Orleans. If we do nothing, we can see other vulnerable Americans \noverwhelmed by rising energy prices this winter.\n  First, Senator Collins and I, joined by 39 colleagues, are calling on \nthe President and Congress to support $1.3 billion in emergency LIHEAP \nfunding in the comprehensive supplemental appropriations package for \nHurricane Katrina. This funding will provide our Nation's most \nvulnerable low-income families, seniors, and disabled individuals with \naffordable energy this winter. This is the additional funding--let me \nstress additional funding--needed for LIHEAP to maintain the purchasing \npower it had last year. This money is on top of the $3 billion we are \nseeking for the LIHEAP State grant program in the fiscal year 2006 \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill; the regular LIHEAP funding, if you will.\n  States are bracing for a crisis caused by the lack of affordable \nenergy, and this funding will ensure low-income families and seniors \nhave warm homes this winter.\n  Last year, a Rhode Islander receiving $400 in LIHEAP funds could buy \napproximately 235 gallons of heating oil, almost a full tank. At $2.60 \na gallon, $400 will only buy about 150 gallons of oil, a little over \nhalf a tank, which might only last about 2\\1/2\\ weeks. And, indeed, the \n$2.60 price in Rhode Island is a hard price to find now from oil \ndealers.\n  Rhode Island's LIHEAP program estimates the State needs $21 million \nto serve the 27,000 households it helped last year. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join Senator Collins and me to support our efforts to \nsecure $4.3 billion for LIHEAP funding this winter.\n  Second, we need to invest in energy efficiency. The Weatherization \nAssistance Program is vital to these efforts. The Weatherization \nAssistance Program has weatherized 5.3 million homes in the United \nStates during its history, including 30,500 in my State of Rhode \nIsland. The program, on average, saves families $274 per year and \nreduces heating bills by 31 percent. Rhode Island's program alone has \nsaved the United States an equivalent of 43 days' worth of oil \nconsumption, or an equivalent of 81 days of gas consumption over the \ncourse of the life of this program.\n  Now is the time to expand this and other energy efficiency programs \nto serve these families. This is one of those programs that benefits \nnot only individuals of the family by keeping them warm, by saving them \nmoney, but collectively benefits this country because one of our great \nproblems is our accelerating demand for energy which drives up prices. \nIf we can control that demand, if we can be more efficient in the use \nof energy, we can go a long way to help moderate the prices of energy \nthat we face.\n  In America--one of the wealthiest nations in the world--no family \nshould have to choose between heating their home and putting food on \nthe table for their child. No senior citizen should have to decide to \neither buy lifesaving prescription drugs or pay their electric bill. \nBut, unfortunately, our Nation's most vulnerable households--working \nfamilies, seniors living on fixed incomes, and disabled individuals--\nhave to make those very choices.\n  Third, we need to pass Senator Cantwell's Energy Emergency Consumer \nProtection Act, of which I am a cosponsor. The legislation would ban \nprice gouging at the gas pump in the wake of natural disasters, such as \nHurricane Katrina, and would empower Federal regulators to ensure \ngreater market transparency and go after market manipulation of oil and \ngas prices on an everyday basis.\n  The administration also must begin to rethink its bankrupt energy \npolicies. Reliable, affordable energy is critical to the social and \neconomic well-being of our Nation. Total energy spending for the Nation \nthis year will approach $1 trillion, 24 percent higher than in 2004. \nEnergy will claim the biggest share of U.S. output since the end of the \noil crisis 20 years ago. This is not good energy policy.\n  Americans deserve a better energy bill than the one President Bush \nsigned this summer. They deserve an energy bill that raises fuel \nefficiency standards and provides for oil savings, an energy bill that \ninvests valuable tax dollars--those currently being handed out \nunnecessarily to oil and gas companies--into the development of \nrenewable fuels and energy efficiency.\n  Oil and natural gas companies are making record profits while energy \nprices are overcoming workers' salary increases. These companies do not \nneed billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury.\n  The American public deserves greater accountability to ensure oil \ncompanies are not engaging in anticompetitive behavior, such as closing \ndown refining capacity to drive up prices.\n  Hurricane Katrina demonstrated the economic, social, and racial \ndivides that exist in America. As a nation, we must step back and \nreevaluate our priorities. Now is not the time to cut funding for or \nunderfund social programs, such as LIHEAP, Medicaid, and food stamps, \nthat support working families and seniors while the President proposes \ntax breaks for casinos, as the Washington Post reported this morning. \nWe must prioritize, and the most vulnerable amongst us must be \nconsidered first.\n  Hurricane Katrina upset the lives of millions, displacing families \nfrom their homes and inflicting severe economic damage. The people of \nthe gulf region deserve our continued support as they rebuild, and as \nHurricane Rita threatens the gulf coast of Texas, we must also be \nprepared to help those Americans affected in its wake.\n  We cannot, however, forget the millions of Americans who struggle \neach day to make ends meet. They also deserve our support. I hope the \nPresident and the Congress will heed this warning and help build an \nenergy safety net for all Americans beginning with adequate funding for \nLIHEAP, increasing investment in weatherization, passing sensible \nlegislation such as the Cantwell bill, and revisiting our overall \nenergy policy to make a stronger, more fair, and a more decent place \nfor all of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\n  First of all, let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy \nfor moving the process of confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts \nalong with such civility, a civility that I believe speaks well of the \nSenate.\n  Let me also say that I remain distressed that the White House during \nthis confirmation process, which overall went smoothly, failed to \nprovide critical documents as part of the record that could have \nprovided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect to \nthe nomination. This White House continues to stymie efforts on the \npart of the Senate to do its job. I hope with the next nominee who \ncomes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in \nfact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to the American people \nto make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of \nevery single nominee who comes before us.\n  Having said that, the decision with respect to Judge Roberts' \nnomination has not been an easy one for me to make. As some of you \nknow, I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 \nyears was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and \ntaught courses in constitutional law. Part of the culture of the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of \ncollegiality between those people who hold different views. What \nengenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar \narrives at but, rather, the intellectual rigor and honesty with which \nhe or she arrives at a decision.\n  Given that background, I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts \nbased on my study of his resume, his conduct during the hearings, and a \nconversation I had with him yesterday afternoon.\n  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to \nsit on the highest court in the land. Moreover, he seems to have the \ncomportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge. He is \nhumble, he is personally decent, and he appears to be respectful of \ndifferent points of view. It is absolutely clear to me that Judge \nRoberts truly loves the law. He couldn't have achieved his excellent \nrecord as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for \nthe law, and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does, \nin fact, deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 \npercent of the cases that come before the Federal court--adherence to \nprecedence, a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional \ntext, a respect for procedural regularity, and an impartiality in \npresiding over the adversarial system. All of these characteristics \nmake me want to vote for Judge Roberts.\n  The problem I face--a problem that has been voiced by some of my \nother colleagues, both those who are voting for Mr. Roberts and those \nwho are voting against Mr. Roberts--is that while adherence to legal \nprecedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will \ndispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court, so that \nboth a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the \ntime on those 95 percent of the cases--what matters on the Supreme \nCourt is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. In those \ncases, adherence to precedent and rules of construction and \ninterpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon. \nThat last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's deepest \nvalues, one's core concerns, one's broader perspectives on how the \nworld works, and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.\n  In those 5 percent of hard cases, the constitutional text will not be \ndirectly on point. The language of the statute will not be perfectly \nclear. Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision. In \nthose circumstances, your decisions about whether affirmative action is \nan appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this \ncountry or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more \nspecific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or \nwhether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues \nof broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what \nis easily defined as interstate commerce, whether a person who is \ndisabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside \nthose who are nondisabled--in those difficult cases, the critical \ningredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.\n  I talked to Judge Roberts about this. Judge Roberts confessed that, \nunlike maybe professional politicians, it is not easy for him to talk \nabout his values and his deeper feelings. That is not how he is \ntrained. He did say he doesn't like bullies and has always viewed the \nlaw as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and \nthe weak.\n  I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much \nthe same way. The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts' \nrecord and history of public service, it is my personal estimation that \nhe has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the \nstrong in opposition to the weak. In his work in the White House and \nthe Solicitor General's Office, he seemed to have consistently sided \nwith those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of \nracial discrimination in our political process. In these same \npositions, he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to \nmake it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather \nthan a man.\n  I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn't like bullies \nand he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing \nfield between the strong and the weak. But given the gravity of the \nposition to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the \ndecisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on \nthe Court, I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the \noverarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with \nthose in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our \nmeeting.\n\n  The bottom line is this: I will be voting against John Roberts' \nnomination. I do so with considerable reticence. I hope that I am \nwrong. I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and \nthat Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding \nlegal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court's historic role as \na check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch. I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and \nwho the strong are in our society. I hope that his jurisprudence is one \nthat stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes.\n  Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation \nprocess.\n  I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely \nDemocratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senator Leahy announced \nthat he would support Judge Roberts. Although the scales have tipped in \na different direction for me, I am deeply admiring of the work and the \nthought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision. The knee-\njerk unbending and what I consider to be unfair attacks on Senator \nLeahy's motives were unjustified. Unfortunately, both parties have \nfallen victim to this kind of pressure.\n  I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle, if they were \nhonest, would acknowledge that the same unyielding, unbending, dogmatic \napproach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible \nfor the kind of poisonous atmosphere that exists in this Chamber \nregarding judicial nominations. It is tempting, then, for us on this \nside of the aisle to go tit for tat.\n  But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move \nforward to the next nominee that in fact the issues that are confronted \nby the Supreme Court are difficult issues. That is why they get up to \nthe Supreme Court. The issues facing the Court are rarely black and \nwhite, and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound \ninterest in the decisions that are made by the Court should try to make \ncertain that their advocacy reflects that complexity. These groups on \nthe right and left should not resort to the sort of broad-brush \ndogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and \nconstrained each and every Senator in this Chamber from making sure \nthat they are voting on the basis of their conscience.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, last night we cleared by unanimous consent \nthe Grassley-Baucus Hurricane Tax Relief package.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina--and with Hurricane Rita now bearing \ndown--this legislation is sorely needed.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus and Senator Lott for \ntheir hard work and leadership to get immediate assistance to the \nhurricane victims.\n  All of America is pulling together to support the people of Alabama, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi.\n  Since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, Americans from all \nwalks of life, from all across the country, have poured out their \nhearts to help.\n  In just 3 weeks, private citizens and businesses have donated \nhundreds of millions of dollars to assist in the relief and recovery \neffort.\n  Schools across the country are opening their doors to the thousands \nof displaced students.\n  Communities are taking up collections of blankets, clothes, toys, and \nfood.\n  Families are literally opening their homes to shelter and comfort the \nsurvivors.\n  In the past three weeks, I've had the opportunity to see, firsthand, \nAmerica's compassion at work.\n  In the first week after the hurricane hit, I traveled to the gulf to \ndo volunteer medical work. I flew to the New Orleans airport and met up \nwith medical colleagues I know from Vanderbilt and Boston.\n  Many had been so moved by the stories they saw and read in the news \nthat they voluntarily organized themselves to head to the Gulf Coast to \noffer their help.\n  I met Knox County volunteers from my home State who had been flying \nhelicopter missions for days.\n  I saw a constant stream of people pitching in, helping out, and \nproviding spiritual and material comfort.\n  The bill we passed vitally supports and rewards this tremendous \ncharity.\n  It recognizes that every sector of civic life is engaged in the \nmassive recovery effort.\n  For example, families who are housing hurricane survivors will be \neligible to receive a personal tax exemption of $500 for every Katrina \nvictim they take in.\n  The bill encourages even more cash donations by waiving the income \nlimits that are otherwise discouraging.\n  The Grassley-Baucus package also rewards contributions from the \nbusiness sector.\n  Katrina is estimated to have swept away 400,000 jobs. Under this \nbill, companies that hire displaced workers are eligible to receive a \nWorking Opportunity Tax Credit of up to $2400 per employee.\n  Hundreds of schools are also in desperate need of extra school books \nfor the wave of displaced students coming through their doors.\n  Under this legislation, companies can receive an enhanced deduction \nfor donating books until the new year. Food donations will also receive \nan enhanced deduction.\n  As another way to promote cash donations, the bill increases by 50 \npercent the amount of cash contributions a company can deduct.\n  The Grassley-Baucus package also offers help to the hurricane \nvictims, themselves, in both time and money.\n  It allows families to dip into their retirement funds without penalty \nso that they can make ends meet while they struggle to regain their \nfooting.\n  It also makes sure that if a mortgage company or credit card company, \nfor example, decides to forgive a loan or a debt, there won't be any \nincome tax due on that amount.\n  Another important provision of the bill is its extension of time.\n  All of these families need time to find a place to live, to get a \njob, to get back on their feet and rebuild their lives.\n  To help ease the pressure, people whose homes are located in the \npresidentially-declared disaster area will have up to 5 years to \npurchase new property.\n  Their tax filing deadline will be extended until February of next \nyear.\n  These are only first steps. But they're important first steps that \nlift some of the pressure on these traumatized families.\n  I want to assure these good people that the United States Senate \nremains hard at work and focused on helping them recover. We are \ncommitted to the well being of our fellow citizens.\n  America is a family. And we pull together in times of need. And we \nwill grow closer, stronger and more compassionate as we confront the \nchallenges ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10367-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PATRICIA LYNCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Patricia Lynch and \nto recognize the contributions of Ms. Lynch to the State of Nevada. \nPatricia Lynch was first elected Reno City Attorney in 1987 and is \ncurrently serving her fifth term. She is a tremendous asset to our \ncommunity and Nation.\n  For the past 20 years Ms. Lynch has demonstrated a commitment to \npublic service. She has performed countless hours of service to \ncommunities in northern Nevada and helped to coordinate and direct the \nefforts of local charitable organizations.\n  Patricia began her career in public service as a legislative \nassistant to Representative John E. Moss from 1975 to 1977 in the \nUnited States House of Representatives; she is a current member of the \nboard of directors of the John E. Moss Foundation.\n  Patricia has also demonstrated unwavering commitment to protecting \nthe rights of women. She is a founding member and 1993 president of \nNorthern Nevada Women Lawyers Association. Her membership on Nevada \nstatewide boards includes the Nevada Prosecution Advisory Council, \nNevada Domestic Violence Prevention Council, and the Nevada Commission \non Domestic Violence.\n  In addition to her local and civic contributions, Patricia has served \nas an ambassador for the United States within the international legal \ncommunity. She is a member of the World Jurist Association, WJA, and \nhas presented papers at WJA conferences in Kiev, Ukraine in 1998 and \nBudapest, Hungary in 1999. She has also served as the moderator for \nlocal government law panels at WJA conferences in Budapest, Hungary in \n1999, Dublin, Ireland in 2001, and Adelaide, Australia in 2003. In \nJanuary 2003, Patricia participated in hosting the City Planner from \nKabul, Afghanistan in a tour of wastewater and drinking water \nfacilities in Reno, NV.\n  I hope you will join with me in honoring the outstanding achievements \nof Patricia Lynch and the selfless life she chose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10367-4", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10367-S10370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THIRD ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIVIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Justice Louis Brandeis once said, ``The only \ntitle in our democracy superior to that of President is the title of \ncitizen.'' This statement illustrates the paramount importance that the \ncitizen plays within these United States. And, as such, we must \ncontinue to learn and teach what it means to be a good citizen.\n  ``Civic education'' is the term used to describe the transmitting of \nknowledge\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\nand skills necessary for people to become responsible citizens. And our \ndemocracy is sustained and strengthened when our citizens have these \nskills and tools. In fact, there is no more important or urgent task \nthan preparing this and future generations of Americans to maintain our \ndemocracy.\n  To advance the continuing importance of civic education, I am pleased \nto announce that the Joint Leadership of the Congress of the United \nStates will host the Third Annual Congressional Conference on Civic \nEducation on September 24-26 here in Washington, DC.\n  The Congressional Conference on Civic Education will bring together \neducators and experts from all across the country who work to promote \ncivic education and civic engagement at the state and local levels. I \nam pleased to serve as honorary host for the conference, along with \nMajority Leader Frist, Speaker Hastert, and Leader Pelosi.\n  The 2005 Congressional Conference on Civic Education will emphasize \nthe state of civic education in America. In an effort to restore the \ncivic mission of schools, each State is working on creating a plan to \npromote civic education and engagement. Conferees will work to build \nupon these foundations built by participants and State delegations from \nthe past two conferences.\n  The Congressional Conference on Civic Education is the third of five \nannual conferences planned to focus public attention on the state of \ncivic education in America's public schools. This conference is \nsponsored by the nonpartisan Alliance for Representative Democracy, and \nconsists of the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Center \non Congress at Indiana University and the Center for Civic Education. \nThrough an act of Congress, the Alliance is funded by the Department of \nEducation.\n  I am honored to recognize the work of the Nevada delegation. The \nNevada Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools is building on the \nprevious success of the Nevada Commission on Participatory Democracy. \nThe Nevada Campaign has completed a benchmark survey regarding the \nstate of civic education in the State and is planning the First Nevada \nCivic Education Summit for this December. Thanks to the efforts of \ncongressional conference delegate, Senator Valerie Wiener, a resolution \nwas passed by the Nevada Legislature this year supporting efforts of \nthe Nevada Department of Education in increasing the role of civics in \nthe Nevada schools curriculum.\n  I find it particularly appropriate that the Congressional Conference \non Civic Education convenes this week. Just last week, on September 17, \nwe observed Constitution Day, celebrating the brilliance of our \nfounding document and the essential role citizens play in our \ndemocracy.\n  I am sure that the congressional leadership joins me in expressing \ngratitude to the many educators and State delegations that make this \nconference possible. We thank them for their time and commitment to \nthis important endeavor. We look forward to learning about their ideas \nand hearing of the progress made at next year's conference.\n  Among those delegates who are in Washington, DC, are the following, \nwhose names I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Alabama: Ms. Janice A.

Mr. President, it was President Harry Truman who \nobserved, half a century ago, that ``if you want a friend in \nWashington, get a dog.'' That is perhaps a little harsh. Nevertheless, \nI note that many of my colleagues in the Congress are dog fanciers, and \nthe Senate is a strikingly dog-friendly workplace. So it is fitting \nthat we pay tribute to a renowned people-friendly breed of dog: the \nSamoyed. Legendary for their beauty, friendly spirit and heroic and \nhistoric treks to the North and South Poles, Samoyeds pulled the \nadventurers of yesteryear to new frontiers.\n  Several hundred Samoyeds and their humans will be pulling into \nOwensboro, KY, in October for the Samoyed Club of America's ``Simply \nSouthern'' National Specialty. While I am pleased that these noble dogs \nand their guardians will be visiting the Commonwealth, it is, sadly, \nbecause of Hurricane Katrina's devastation in Biloxi, MS, where the \nevent was originally scheduled to be held. So the SCA Specialty this \nyear is a hurricane evacuee, but in addition to contributing over \n$10,000 from show proceeds to animal rescue in the devastated region, \nthe organizers look forward to going back to a rebuilt and newly \nvibrant gulf coast in the future.\n  Samoyed dogs were named for the semi nomadic tribe which developed \nthe breed. Living along the shores of the Arctic Ocean, north of Russia \nand Siberia, they were one of the earliest tribes of Central Asia. They \ndepended upon their dogs to herd reindeer, protect against wolves, hunt \nbears, and even keep the children warm as they slept. Their endurance \nand intelligence made the Samoyed dogs prized members of early European \nexpeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. Borchgrevink, Amundsen, and \nShackleton in the Antarctic, and Nansen and Abruzzi in the Arctic, \ncounted on Samoyeds to explore the extreme and then uncharted ends of \nthe Earth. The American explorers Fiala and Baldwin also used Samoyed \nsled teams. Most of the Samoyeds in England and the United States today \nare related to sled dogs from those expeditions.\n  Among them was Rex of White Way, who was renown as the lead dog on \nthe U.S. Mail sled team that used to run the 64-mile mail delivery \nroute from Ashton, ID, to West Yellowstone, over the 7000-foot Targhee \nPass. Rex was a superb canine athlete and hero. He even learned to \nparachute on rescue missions that retrieved survivors of airplane \ncrashes and a snowbound train in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Although \nSamoyeds are a medium-sized dog ranging in weight from 35-65 pounds, \nthey are very strong. Rex of White Way broke the world weight-pull \nrecord in 1953 by pulling 1,870 pounds.\n  Samoyeds have been described as ``by nature . . . not a quarrelsome \ndog though he will stand his ground for what he feels are his rights. \nEach Samoyed is an individual, even from one litter. One will be very \nattentive and obedient while another may be more headstrong and less \ndemanding of affection as long as he knows the house is his castle when \nhe wants it and he owns you.''\n  One may detect in that description some symmetry with Senators.\n  The description goes on: He has a keen sense of knowing when you are \nhappy, sad, who really loves him, just tolerates him, dislikes him and \nhe will return his love accordingly. He is a `talky' dog and with \nencouragement will voice his pleasures and his dislikes. Some enjoy \njokes and ham it up when laughed at while others resent it. He will \nspeak with his paw or nose.\n  Samoyeds today are still pulling sleds. They are also skijoring, \npulling scooters, herding, excelling in agility and obedience trials \nand otherwise exemplify the ``Working'' class of dogs. As therapy dogs, \nthey bring joy and comfort to people in nursing homes and hospitals. \nIndeed, at least one Samoyed therapy dog that I know of, Gidget \n(Salish's Potomac Fervour), recently visited Hurricane Katrina evacuees \nfrom Gulfport, MS, who are currently residing at the Armed Forces \nRetirement Home here in Washington. She teams up with another Samoyed, \nSamantha, in regular visits with children at Inova Fairfax Hospital in \nnorthern Virginia. So these are not just beautiful dogs, they are hard-\nworking dogs, doing great work for many people around the country.\n  On October 24, hundreds of Samoyeds, with their humans in tow, \nliterally as they are prone to pull, will arrive in Owensboro. For some \nit will have been a harrowing journey since Hurricane Katrina roared \nashore. Sheila and Walter Herrmann, cochairs of the event and residents \nof Covington, LA, described their hurricane experience: Walter and I \nwere hunkered down for the storm watching tree after tree fall and a \ntornado touch down and make a disaster of our kennels (the dogs, our \nown as well as the boarders were safely crated in the safest portion of \nour house) talking about the national is what helped us get through it.\n  Others involved in beating the odds and making this event happen \ninclude: Pam Barbe, Karen Brooks, Diane Dotson, Peggy Green, and Laurie \nStone. I would also like to thank Jim and Celinda Cheskawich for all \ntheir good work.\n  Mr. President, Kentucky and I extend a warm welcome to the Samoyed \nClub of America's 2005 ``Simply Southern'' National Specialty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10370-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On January 16, 2005, a man was attacked with broken glass bottles by \ntwo men outside his home in Manhattan, NY. The apparent motivation for \nthe attack was the man's sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10370-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10370-S10371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, with the Judiciary Committee's \nconfirmation hearings all but complete, I rise today to announce my \nvote on the nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve as the 17th Chief \nJustice and the 116th Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n  I have come to my decision not in haste, but with great care and \nconsideration. Over the history of our Nation, relatively few Senators \nhave had the opportunity to consider the nomination of a Chief Justice \nand I recognize the honor that accompanies this great responsibility.\n  Judge Roberts is an extremely well qualified nominee. Some have said \nhe\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nmay be the best nominee ever to the Supreme Court. I am not one that \nregularly calls on such hyperbole on most issues, but I can say today \nthat from what I have seen, I expect Judge Roberts to serve with \ndistinction and honor as Chief Justice. I think the Court will be \nenhanced despite the obvious and measurable impact of the loss to the \nCourt of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  My record on judicial nominations speaks for itself. I have supported \n213 of the 214 district and circuit court judges confirmed by the \nSenate. I voted against filibustering judicial nominees twenty-four \ntimes. I understand the executive branch's power to appoint judges--as \nNebraska's Governor I appointed the entire State Supreme Court and \nCourt of Appeals and more than half the State's sitting judges.\n  As a Senator who pledged to put aside the partisan games to get \nthings done in Washington, I was very concerned last year about how a \npotential Senate shutdown due to a stalemate over judicial nominations \nwould impact legislation important to the Nation, and especially my \nhome State of Nebraska.\n  We needed a national energy policy--including the renewable fuels \nstandard that would boost ethanol production, a very strong Nebraska \nindustry. We needed to complete the Highway bill--with $1.3 billion in \nroad construction funds that will create jobs and boost the economy in \nNebraska. We needed to avoid the now annual ``omnibus'' spending bill \nthat made it nearly impossible to monitor and control Washington \nspending. Social Security and Medicare need to be addressed. At the \ntime I was concerned about the ongoing drought--``Drought David'' as I \ncalled it to bring attention to it--that is ravaging our agricultural \nsector in Nebraska and across the Nation. We had no idea the wrath and \ndestruction that Hurricane season would bring to bear on the Nation, \nbut after Katrina we can see how important it is to have a functioning \nCongress.\n  Senator Alexander, during a floor speech regarding the judicial \nstalemate offered a suggestion, a call really, that many of us heard \nand decided to heed. Surely, a bipartisan group of Senators could \ndevelop an agreement that would resolve the stalled judicial \nnominations and diffuse the nuclear option--and ultimately, ease some \nof the partisan tension that had crippled the Senate and threatened to \nshut it down completely.\n  I am very proud of my role in the so-called ``gang of fourteen,'' the \nbipartisan group that navigated the path to confirmation for many of \nthe President's judicial nominees and preserved the precedents and \ntraditions of the Senate. I am also very proud that the gang's \n``memorandum of understanding'' paved the way to complete many of the \nlegislative priorities I mentioned earlier--including the energy bill \nand the highway bill.\n  The ``memorandum of understanding'' included an important section \nasking the President to improve communications with the Senate on \njudicial nominees. We asked that he spend more time on the advice part \nof the ``advice and consent'' clause in the Constitution.\n  When Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her planned \nretirement in June, the White House heeded our recommendation and \nconsulted with a vast majority of Senators before nominating Judge \nRoberts to the Court. That consultation with the Senate certainly \ndiffused some of the more extreme partisanship when the Roberts \nnomination was announced. Not all of it, of course, but some of it.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee began its process, I met personally \nwith Judge Roberts. In that meeting he impressed me. We talked at \nlength about judicial activism and the threat it poses to the Nation. \nWe talked about settled law. His knowledge of the history of law was \nimpressive. His belief in and dedication to the rule of law was \napparent and admirable.\n  At the outset of the Roberts confirmation process, I said that I \nhoped the gang of fourteen had no role in the process because that \nwould mean the process was working. And it did work.\n  The Roberts confirmation hearings were dignified, the questions were \ntough but appropriate, and the answers Judge Roberts provided were as \nmost expected. The hearings were no place to overturn law or discuss \ncase specifics. The hearings did not produce any disqualifying \nrevelations, nor did I expect that to happen.\n  Only time will tell where Judge Roberts will come down on the \nprevailing legal matters that come before the Roberts Court. I can only \ntake him at his word that he will approach his role on the Court \nwithout a predetermined agenda, without activism, and with only the \nintention to balance the scales of justice for all Americans.\n  What came though to me as I watched his confirmation hearings was a \nman with great poise, a deep and thorough knowledge of the law, a love \nfor this country and unmatched integrity. John Roberts is a man \ndeserving of the nomination and deserving of confirmation.\n  I will vote to confirm Judge John Roberts as Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10371-S10372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEDICATION OF THE STATUE OF PO'PAY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a special day for New Mexicans. \nEarlier today, Congress accepted the statue of Po'pay, a man from San \nJuan Pueblo who played an important role in New Mexico's colonial \nhistory. The acceptance of this work marks the 100th contribution to \nthe Statuary Hall Collection. On behalf of my home State, I give \nspecial recognition to sculptor Cliff Fragua, from Jemez Pueblo, for a \njob well done. He should be proud of his work. Cliff is the first \nAmerican Indian artist to sculpt a statue for the Statuary Hall \nCollection. I also thank the New Mexico Statuary Hall Commission and \nFoundation for all their dedication and tireless effort in making this \nendeavor a terrific success.\n  New Mexico's first statue in the collection is that of the late \nSenator Dennis Chavez. Unlike Senator Chavez, Po'pay was a leader of a \ndifferent era. Po'pay was a leader among the Pueblo people during the \nlatter part of the 17th century. He united the Pueblos and led the \nPueblo Revolt of 1680. This revolt made apparent the Pueblo Indians' \ndesire to maintain their dignity and culture--both socially and \nspiritually. The Po'pay-led insurrection against the Spanish conquerors \nwas at its core a basic human and American need to challenge \noppressors. Yes, there have been incidences of intolerance in our \nState's more than 400-year history. Those early days were hard and \noftentimes brutal. Wrongs were done, and the Pueblo Revolt--represented \nwith this statue--was the Native peoples' response to those hardships.\n  In the end, the Pueblo Revolt served as an important lesson for the \nSpaniards, who returned to New Mexico a dozen years later. The Pueblo \nRevolt forever shaped the history of the State of New Mexico and the \nAmerican Southwest. The result of that uprising is still evident today \nas the Pueblo Indians continue to live a distinct lifestyle. The Pueblo \nculture of New Mexico draws visitors from around the world. The \nAmerican people should take the time to visit and enjoy these ancient \ncultures that are alive today. Their lives give our State its name: \n``The Land of Enchantment.''\n  My own life has been made richer by my many Indian friends. My \nlifelong friend, Herman Agoyo, and his beautiful family are with us \ntoday. As well noted in the history of this event, Herman's leadership \nhas been inspiring and tireless. Herman leads the Turtle Dance at San \nJuan Pueblo on December 26 of each year. This year, Herman and San Juan \nPueblo Governor Garcia will have a special reason to celebrate this \nbeautiful event. This is the year of Po'pay--from San Juan Pueblo--who \nis now honored here in our Nation's Capitol.\n  Today's Indian Pueblos are a cultural haven from ancient times. \nHowever, for all New Mexicans who came after, the revolt taught us an \nenduring lesson of tolerance and acceptance. It is this lesson that has \nresulted in New Mexico having one of the best and richest multicultural \nsocieties in the United States. As my friend Benny Atencio, of Santo \nDomingo Pueblo, observed:\n\n       I strongly feel that the selection of Po'pay to be placed \n     in the nation's Statuary Hall along with that of the late \n     Senator Dennis Chavez, who was my personal friend, would \n     serve as a unique reminder to the world that two unique \n     cultures can coexist without destruction of their traditional \n     cultural values and beliefs.\n\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n\n  I could not have stated it better.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Po'pay, a man who \nthrough his life and philosophy inspired New Mexicans to unite and \nshare their experiences of life, happiness, and customs, with a marble \nstatue sculpted by Cliff Fragua of Jemez Pueblo. It will be the one-\nhundredth statue to be added to the National Statuary Hall collection. \nThe statue of this remarkable leader of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, is a \ngift from the State of New Mexico and was unveiled in the United States \nCapitol Rotunda today.\n  Po'pay was born in Ohkay Owingeh, San Juan Pueblo, in 1630. He was a \ndeeply humble man, with deep respect for his Pueblo's culture, \nlanguage, traditions, and customs, and a dedication to passing these \nthings on to future generations.\n  During the seventeenth century the Pueblo way of life was seriously \nthreatened. Some did not want the Pueblo people to practice their \nlanguage, culture, or traditions, depriving them of their very core. \nPo'pay successfully united the separate Pueblo nations. This group of \nsome 150 Pueblo leaders united against those who sought to destroy \ntheir way of life and prevailed. Po'pay led this great revolt and the \nfight for respect the Pueblo people deserved.\n  Through his devotion and commitment to the preservation of Pueblo \nculture, Po'pay played an irreplaceable role in helping to shape our \nNation's future. By championing the customs and traditional ways of his \nancestors, he strengthened and preserved the Pueblo heritage for future \ngenerations, bridging the rich Pueblo and Spanish cultures of the \nSouthwest. His dedication to this cause in response to the challenges \nthe Pueblo community faced is a testament to the spirit of New Mexico.\n  This statue will forever be a reminder of his leadership and courage \nin keeping the Pueblo culture alive. The statue of Po'pay will join the \nfigure of the late Senator Dennis Chavez that stands proudly outside \nthe doors of the old Senate Chambers. It is a privilege for New Mexico \nto be represented by two men with such vision, leadership, and courage.\n  The decision to honor Po'pay was brought to the foreground during the \ntercentennial commemoration of the Pueblo Revolt by a unified group of \nPueblo leaders. Thanks to their leadership, in November of 1996 the \ntribal council of Ohkay Owingeh, San Juan Pueblo, made the nomination \nofficial with a resolution. In 1997, State Senator Manny Aragon and \nRepresentative Nick Salazar introduced Senate Bill 404, which was \npassed and signed by Governor Gary Johnson on April 10. The nine member \nStatuary Hall Commission was formed and the fundraising began.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Hispanic \ncommunity. As we commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to \nrecognize the contributions made by millions of Hispanics to our \nNation. The greatness of California is that it is truly a multicultural \nState and I am honored to represent California's Hispanic community in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  This month we celebrate a community that believes in the American \ngoals of freedom, opportunity, and a chance to build a better life. In \npursuing these aspirations, Hispanics have made enormous contributions \nto life in the United States through business, politics, science, \nculture, sports, and entertainment. Hispanics have served in the armed \nservices with bravery and courage and many have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in giving their lives for the common good of our country. \nThrough their service, they have brought honor to America and their \nHispanic heritage--a rich heritage from which all of America benefits.\n  Today, I rise to honor the sacrifices that these brave Americans and \ntheir families have made. I also want to honor Hispanic heroes and \nheroines, such as the late Cesar Chavez. Indeed, Hispanics are changing \nthe way America looks at itself. Today there are 31 million Hispanics \nin the U.S. By 2050, our Nation's Hispanic population is projected to \nreach 96 million--an increase of more than 200 percent.\n  Hispanics are making their mark; between 1984 and 1998 Hispanic \nvoting increased nationwide in midterm elections by 27 percent, even as \noverall voter turnout declined by 13 percent. In my own State of \nCalifornia, where nearly 11.5 million Hispanics comprise over 32 \npercent of the population, Hispanics are participating and contributing \nto civic life in important ways. Two of the California State \nlegislature's three highest offices are occupied by Hispanics: Lt. Gov. \nCruz Bustamante and Speaker of the Assembly Fabian Nunez. On the local \nlevel, the people of Los Angeles elected Antonio Villaraigosa as the \nfirst Hispanic mayor in over a century, and 20 percent of Los Angeles' \ncity council seats are held by Hispanics. The Hispanic community has \nprovided great leadership for California, and will provide important \nleadership for our country.\n  Hispanics are visibly successful in other areas as well. From Sammy \nSosa in sports to Jennifer Lopez, Andy Garcia, and Salma Hayek in the \nentertainment industry, Hispanics have added greatly to the fabric of \nour Nation.\n  We must not forget the critical contributions Hispanics have made to \neducation and science. The 1995 Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry, Dr. \nMario Molina, joined the University of California, San Diego last year, \nand Dr. Eduardo Macagno is the founding dean of the Division of \nBiological Sciences at the same University.\n  A democratic and prosperous society should not step back from a \nnational commitment to provide assistance to those who strive to \nachieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to \nemphasize the importance of quality education for the success of \nHispanic children. The University of California system alone enrolled \nnearly 25,000 Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students last year. \nHispanic youths are a great source of strength and hope for the future \nof this Nation and they should be able to participate fully in the \nAmerican experience; that is the primary reason why I have been a \nstrong supporter of the DREAM Act.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to honor California's Hispanic community \nand to have the opportunity to ensure that Hispanic contributions and \nsacrifices do not go unnoticed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10372-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10372-S10373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING SHERI GARMON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I wish \nto announce the death of Sheri Garmon, one of many Idahoans who have \ndied from cancer that was likely attributable to nuclear fallout.\n  Like others, Sheri spent time and energy bringing awareness of this \nissue as it related to Idaho. However, Sheri, who was fighting multiple \ncancers, became a charismatic spokesperson for those suffering from the \nsame fate.\n  Sheri Garmon, daughter of Don and Millie Garmon, was born in Emmett, \nID, in 1952. When Sheri was just a baby, just 6 months old, the \nNational Cancer Institute estimates that on a single day, June 5, 1952, \nshe received 75 rads of iodine-131. That is the equivalent of 10,000 \nchest X-rays. The exposure came from nuclear testing being done in the \nNevada desert; fallout blew over the little valley where Emmett sits. \nFrom that day on, Sheri's ultimate fate was sealed. But no one knew \nthen what we know now. Sheri grew up healthy and strong, out there on \nher family's dairy farm, drinking milk from their cows, eating \nvegetables and fruits from their garden. She graduated valedictorian of \nher high school class, and then went on to graduate from the University \nof Idaho. She became a CPA and a mother. Sheri used her education as a \nway to provide for her family and pave the way for future achievement \nfor those\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\nwho knew her. She was always involved in her community and concerned \nfor the welfare of her friends and family. Along the way, Sheri was \ndiagnosed with thyroid cancer. She beat it. Then she was diagnosed with \nbreast cancer. The doctors gave her about a year to live. She wanted to \nmake it to August 20, 2005, to see her daughter graduate from college. \nWhile she did pass that date, she will never see Katie married or play \nwith her grandchildren. She did, however, leave a legacy that we have a \nresponsibility to uphold. Sheri is just one of many unrecognized \nradiation-exposure victims; her story is poignant, but it is echoed \nthroughout her community by many other families who have survived or \nlost cancer battles over the last 50 years. Sheri played a large role \nin bringing the plight of many of her friends and family to the \nattention of Idaho's congressional delegation and general public last \nyear. Sheri is survived by her mother Millie and her daughter Katie \nKlein.\n  On May 11, 2005, I came to this Chamber and introduced legislation to \namend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. My legislation would \nmake Idaho citizens, such as Sheri, who were exposed to fallout from \nnuclear testing in Nevada, eligible for compensation under the act.\n  In my introductory statement, I related stories of Idahoans who \nrecounted going outside in the evenings to look at the beautiful \nsunsets caused by the testing. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to them, \nthese skies were filled with dangerous radiation that elevated their \nexposure and subsequent risk of developing cancer. I also stated that \nnow is the time to amend the act to make it work for everyone who may \nhave become ill because of radiation fallout exposure.\n  Let us not let Sheri's death go unanswered. Join me in supporting S. \n998 to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act so that others who \nare suffering as Sheri did are given their just compensation and \ntreatment; it is the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10373-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10373-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10373-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 250.

A bill to-provide for the issuance of certificates to Social \nSecurity beneficiaries who are born before 1950 guaranteeing their \nright to receive Social Security benefits under title II of the Social \nSecurity Act in full with an accurate annual cost-of-living adjustment; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill I am \nintroducing called the Social Security Guarantee Act. The reason I am \nintroducing this piece of legislation is in an attempt to try, at a \ntime when it looks like the Social Security issue here in Congress has \nground down to almost a halt--although I think there is still an \nopportunity; as we hear, the House may pass something to move the ball \nforward--I want to put forth an idea I think would be helpful as \nsomething we can get done that should have, I hope, bipartisan support \nand would create a sense of security and certainly reduce\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nanxiety among those at or near retirement with respect to any future \nchanges to Social Security.\n  The Social Security Guarantee Act is a very simple concept. It says \nif you were born before 1950, this law now creates a right for you to \nthe benefits that you have been promised.\n  Now, you may say: Why is that a new thing? Well, believe it or not, \nthere is a Supreme Court case on this point that says Social Security \nrecipients have no right to the benefits they have been promised under \nthe law. This would create such a right for people born before 1950.\n  Now, why do I pick out 1950? Because in all the legislation that has \nbeen introduced in the Congress, the statements made by the President, \nand even statements made by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, we have all agreed that people who are at or near retirement \nshould not be subject to change, for a couple of reasons, not the least \nof which is there is money there to pay those benefits. Cashflow-wise, \nthere will be enough money to pay for the benefits for our seniors and \nthose who are near retirement or near the eligible age of 62. So there \nis not a need to change the Social Security system for these \nindividuals. Therefore, everyone who is proposing changes to the \nsystem, to save it and strengthen it for the future, has set them aside \nverbally and said: We are not going to propose anything that is going \nto affect your benefits if you were born before 1950.\n  Well, if we are going to say that, and promise that, then I think a \nstep forward--both in terms of our ability to find a solution to the \nproblem for younger workers and the fact that Social Security will not \nhave sufficient resources to pay for benefits in the future--we take a \nstep forward if we promise to put in law a guarantee that older \nworkers' and retirees' benefits are guaranteed by the law.\n  The second benefit is one that is political in this sense, in that \none of the difficulties in trying to rally support in the public for a \nprogram that will save and strengthen Social Security for younger \nworkers is the anxiety that older workers have and retirees have that \nsomehow or other, at the last minute, they will be folded into this \nbill and somehow their benefits will be affected or their taxes will be \nincreased.\n  This should provide a level of comfort and reduce that anxiety and \ncreate a proper focus for reform, the proper focus for reform being the \nfuture, not the present, not the past.\n  So I put this forward as an admittedly minimalist step, but I think \nan important one, that creates a better atmosphere where there are not \npolitical accusations of trying to take someone's Social Security check \naway or that grandma's check be cut in half, or whatever the case may \nbe. You hear all these things from those who do not want to make any \nkind of changes to the Social Security system for younger workers. So \nthey go out and try to scare older workers and retirees.\n  I might add, another reason to do this is, it would not be fair at \nthis point to reduce their benefits or to change the structure when \nthey are either in the system or very close to being in Social \nSecurity.\n  So this is a step on which I would hope we could get bipartisan \nagreement, that we could pass this by unanimous consent. I do not know \nof anybody in this Chamber who has made the statement that they think \nwe should change benefits for current retirees, or that we should \nchange benefits for folks who are near retirement. That being the case, \nI see no reason we would not pass this and, in a sense, take those born \nbefore 1950 and say: OK, you are off the table. No Social Security \nchanges are going to affect you. Your interest in the Social Security \ndebate then becomes the future, not you. It becomes your children, your \ngrandchildren, their children, their grandchildren, not how it affects \nyou and your life today.\n  I think that is a helpful step in the right direction, to try to get \nsomething that is appropriate, a stronger Social Security system, that \nis appropriately designed for future generations of Americans.\n  I am pleased Senator DeMint has joined me in this legislation. I \ncertainly put out a call for all those who are interested in trying to \ntake a small step forward in moving the Social Security agenda to join \nme in securing the benefits for our seniors, removing the anxiety that \noften comes, particularly with those who live from Social Security \ncheck to Social Security check, removing the anxiety that they have \nabout the potential for their benefits to be affected by any changes \nCongress would make. This would create a vote, which I suspect would be \nunanimous, that would put every Senator on record for putting in the \nlaw that they will not change the Social Security benefits for those \nwho were born before 1950. That has a powerful effect when a Member \nvotes that way. It makes it very difficult for them to come back and \nsay: I am going to change my mind.\n  It is a meaningful piece of legislation. It is a step in the right \ndirection. It does remove the anxiety which is a positive thing for our \nseniors. It creates a platform for us to build into the future a \nstronger Social Security system. I am hopeful that in the next couple \nof months, if not early next year, that we can get a vote on this; that \nwe can have unanimous consent to bring it up and to pass it and to get \na strong vote from every Member of the Senate that Social Security \nreform programs put forward in the Senate to save and strengthen the \nSocial Security system will be all about the future, will be all about \nyounger workers and how we make the system stable for them without \nusing scare tactics about how it is going to affect older workers who \nare, in most cases, the most vulnerable citizens in our society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 1751. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the \nState sentences for which burial in National Cemeteries and Arlington \nNational Cemetery are prohibited to include any sentence of life \nimprisonment for a State capital crime; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to close \na loophole in current law that allows convicted murderers to be honored \nat our national cemeteries. I believe we must preserve our national \ncemeteries as places of honor for our veterans. Arlington National \nCemetery--and all our national cemeteries--are hallowed ground. They \nshould not be polluted by the remains of convicted murderers.\n  In August, I learned of a tragic and troubling circumstance regarding \nour national cemeteries. The remains of a convicted cold-blooded \nmurderer sentenced to two life sentences for his crimes were buried at \nArlington National Cemetery on July 27, 2005. This man, Russell Wagner, \nwas convicted of stabbing to death two elderly residents of Hagerstown, \nMD--Daniel Davis, 84 and his wife, Wilda Davis, 80. He was sentenced in \nState court to two life sentences for these unspeakable crimes. While \nserving his sentence in prison, Wagner died from a heroin overdose. \nBecause he served honorably in Vietnam, his remains were allowed to be \nplaced in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors, even \nthough he committed this terrible crime.\n  This episode has been terribly painful for the Davis family, \nunderstandably: they have had to relive the horror of their parents' \nbrutal murder, while seeing the man who took away their loved ones \nbeing honored as a hero in our Nation's most sacred burial ground. \nThere has been community outrage--which I share. The law that allows \nthis disgrace must be changed.\n  Arlington is for heroes. So many Marylanders who served with honor \nwere laid to rest in Arlington, the heroes from every war: men like \nNavy Diver Michael Steadam, who was brutally murdered by terrorists \nsimply because he was a member of our military. In the Iraqi conflict, \n37 Marylanders have died, including two from the same high school who \ndied within weeks of each other. These are the heroes who deserve \nburial at our national cemeteries.\n  In my 18 years as the head of the VA-HUD subcommittee, I was proud to \nwork closely with our Veterans' Service Organizations. They are \ntireless advocates for America's veterans. I so respect and admire \nthem. I know many in these groups are uncomfortable with the idea of \nCongress tinkering with the benefits our veterans have earned. I can \nunderstand their yellow flashing lights. Promises made to our veterans\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\nmust be promises kept. For 18 years, I fought every day to safeguard \nthese benefits--and continue to do so, because they represent America's \npayment of a debt we owe our brave veterans for their service--a debt \nthat can never be fully repaid. But this is murder.\n  Federal law already prohibits murderers from being honored at \nArlington and our national cemeteries. In 1997, Congress passed a law \nto restrict burial eligibility, to prevent convicted Oklahoma City \nbomber Timothy McVeigh from being buried in a national cemetery \nfollowing his execution. Under current law, if a veteran is convicted \nof a capital crime in a Federal court, he or she cannot be placed in a \nnational cemetery. Yet, if someone is convicted of the same crime in a \nState court, they retain their eligibility to be placed in a national \ncemetery if they are eligible for parole. This loophole enabled the man \nwho murdered Mr. and Mrs. Davis to be placed alongside the heroes at \nArlington.\n  Why did Congress pass what is known as the McVeigh law? Not to \nfurther punish the guilty, but to preserve our national cemeteries as \nplaces of honor for our veterans. So I was shocked to learn that the \nlaw we passed in 1997 does not apply in the case of the man who \nmurdered Daniel and Wilda Davis. He was convicted of two life \nsentences, but because he was convicted in State court, he remained \neligible for interment with honors at Arlington National Cemetery. This \ndoesn't make any sense. The purpose of the 1997 law was to protect the \nstandards our military men and women live by: to protect the values \nthey fight and die for. The cold-blooded murder of an elderly couple is \ncertainly contrary to those values.\n  I am introducing this bill on behalf of the Davis family. But I am \nalso introducing it on behalf of a Nation at war. Every day across this \ncountry, brave young soldiers are being honored and laid to rest in our \nnational cemeteries. We have precious little to offer in comfort for \ntheir grieving loved ones, who have made the ultimate sacrifice a \nNation can ask. But we can insist that these sacred resting places and \nthe honors our Nation rightfully bestowed on those who have died in its \nservice are preserved as sanctuaries and monuments to the values they \ndied protecting. Placing the remains of a cold-blooded murderer in this \nhallowed ground makes a mockery of that service. And it is wrong.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1754. A bill to apply the Federal medical assistance percentage \ndetermined for a State for fiscal year 2005 for fiscal years 2006 \nthrough 2014; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to apply \nthe Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for a State for fiscal \nyear 2005 for fiscal years 2006 through 2014. Oklahoma is one of the \nhardest hit States receiving a 2.27 percent reduction in our FMAP funds \nfor 2006, resulting in a loss of approximately $65 million, along with \n21 other states that will suffer more than a 0.5 percent reduction. I \nwould like to introduce with unanimous consent the text of a chart \ncreated by the Oklahoma Health Care Authority that lays out the 2006 \nFMAP reduction.\n  Federal law states that the FMAP is based on the three most recent \ncalendar years with acceptable data available from the Department of \nCommerce. Every four to five years the Department of Commerce's Bureau \nof Economic Analysis performs a comprehensive revision of its \ncalculation of per capita income. They performed a revision in 2003 \nwhich revises the data for the previous years as well. Therefore, when \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) calculated the \nFMAP for fiscal year 2006, they used the revised data from 2001, 2002 \nand 2003. A reduction of 2.27 percent would be disastrous for the state \nof Oklahoma.\n  My legislation purposes to keep the fiscal year 2005 percentage \nlevels for 2006 through 2014, while we take an in depth look at \nrevising the formula so states do not continue to get hit with such \ndrastic reductions. Please join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n

A bill to establish a Department of Peace and Nonviolence; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncreate a Department of Peace and Nonviolence, headed by a Cabinet-level \nSecretary of Peace and Nonviolence. While I am loath to add another \nagency to the already oversized Federal bureaucracy, it is imperative \nthat we elevate peace to at least the same level as war within the \nFederal Government, inside the President's Cabinet Room, and in our \nnational policymaking.\n  The Department's mission is set forth in section 101 of the proposed \nlegislation. It says:\n\n       The Department shall--\n       hold peace as an organizing principle, coordinating service \n     to every level of American society;\n       endeavor to promote justice and democratic principles to \n     expand human rights;\n       strengthen nonmilitary means of peacemaking;\n       promote the development of human potential;\n       work to create peace, prevent violence, divert from armed \n     conflict, use field-tested programs, and develop new \n     structures and nonviolent dispute resolution;\n       take a proactive, strategic approach in the development of \n     policies that promote national and international conflict \n     prevention, nonviolent intervention, mediation, peaceful\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n     resolution of conflict, and structured mediation of conflict;\n       address matters both domestic and international in scope, \n     and\n       encourage the development of initiatives from local \n     communities, religious groups, and nongovernmental \n     organizations.\n\n  The legislation mandates that an amount not less than 2 percent of \nthe Department of Defense's annual appropriation be expended for those \npeacemaking and peace-advancing efforts, which does not affect the \nDepartment of Defense's level of funding.\n  Now is clearly the time to create a Department of Peace and \nNonviolence. The continuing war in Iraq, a war which I opposed, a war \ninitiated before all attempts at peaceful resolution had been made, \nshould teach us again that war is not the answer. Despite the \nincredible heroism of the men and women in our Armed Forces who have \nfought, patrolled, and helped so well and for so long in Iraq, 138,000 \nof them are still there with no end in sight. More of them are wounded, \nmaimed, and killed every day. Terrorism activities against our troops \nand against Iraqi citizens are continuing and even increasing in their \nlethality.\n  Tragically, wrongly, but unavoidably, anti-American hatred also \ncontinues to grow throughout the Arab world. Who can doubt that some of \nthe sons and daughters of Iraqis killed during the past 2\\1/2\\ years of \nwar will grow up to become vicious terrorists, hell-bent on revenge \nagainst America. Our leaders did not intend to create this anti-\nAmerican backlash, what the CIA calls ``blowback.'' However, they are \nignoring it at our peril.\n  Our Nation possesses a military might that is unprecedented in the \nworld's history and unparalleled in the world today. We must remain so.\n  Yet, if we are to remain the world's leader and if we are to lead the \nworld into a more secure and a more prosperous future, we must become \nbetter known and more respected for our peacemaking successes than for \nour military forces. Peace is far more than the absence of war, \nalthough that is the starting point. Peace, to have any lasting value, \nmust be advanced, expanded, and strengthened continuously. Doing so \nrequires skill, dedication, persistence, resources and, most \nimportantly, people. We need thousands of American emissaries of peace \nat home and abroad. We need our embassies to become centers for \npeaceful initiatives worldwide, and we need advocates for peace-\npromoting policies here in Washington.\n  This country was founded by a Revolutionary War, a necessary war for \nindependence. But our Nation's Founders wanted this to be a nation of \npeace. President Thomas Jefferson said, in 1801:\n\n       That peace, safety, and concord may be the portion of our \n     native land, and be long-enjoyed by our fellow-citizens, is \n     the most ardent wish of my heart, and if I can be \n     instrumental in procuring or preserving them, I shall think I \n     have not lived in vain.\n\n  Mr. President, 158 years later President Dwight Eisenhower, himself \nno stranger to war, said:\n\n       I think people want peace so much that one of these days \n     governments had better get out of the way and let them have \n     it.\n\n  To further that goal, in 1984, Congress passed legislation and \nPresident Ronald Reagan signed it into law, creating the U.S. Institute \nof Peace. Today, the Institute of Peace is an independent, nonpartisan \norganization funded by Congress to promote peace and curb violent \ninternational conflict. The last 20 years have shown that the \nInstitute, and all of us, have much more to do to create and to sustain \na peaceful world.\n  Similar to Thomas Jefferson, peace, safety and concord for our fellow \ncitizens is the most ardent wish of my heart. If I can be instrumental \nin procuring or preserving them, I think that I shall not have lived in \nvain.\n  A peaceful world, inhabited by people throughout the world who have \nlearned how to keep peace better than how to make war, who want peace, \nwho know its benefits and who insist that their governments let them \nhave it--that would be the best world and the greatest inheritance we \ncould give to our children and our grandchildren and generations that \nwill follow them. Without it, nothing else is reliable. With it, \neverything else is possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1763. A bill to promote the employment of workers displaced by \nHurricane Katrina in connection with Hurricane Katrina reconstruction \nefforts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have all seen the unprecedented \ndestruction and suffering caused by Hurricane Katrina.\n  With the Katrina disaster, tens of thousands of people in the Gulf \nStates have lost their jobs. In fact, over 200,000 have filed for \nunemployment benefits. For that reason, I introduced the Hurricane \nKatrina Reconstruction and Displaced Workers Assistance Act of 2005. \nThis legislation would give priority in awarding Federal contracts for \nthe rebuilding efforts to those companies where workers displaced by \nHurricane Katrina comprise at least 25 percent of the workforce \nfulfilling the contract. It is the least we could do to help displaced \nworkers.\n  Unfortunately, on the same day I introduced my bill to help workers, \nPresident Bush did just the opposite. He issued a proclamation saying \nthat those who get Federal contracts for rebuilding will not have to \npay workers the prevailing wage. This is unfair to working men and \nwomen. It is not right. The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina should not be \nused as an excuse to take advantage of working people.\n  Therefore, to ensure that workers in the region affected by the \nhurricane are paid the region's prevailing wages, I am introducing a \nsecond version of the Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction and Displaced \nWorker Assistance Act of 2005. It will still give priority to those \ncompanies who hire displaced workers, but it will also ensure that all \nworkers are paid the prevailing wage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10382-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10382-S10383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 247--COMMENDING THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS'S PRIVATE-\n   SECTOR ADVISORY BODY, THE JAMES MADISON COUNCIL, AND ITS FOUNDING \n CHAIRMAN, JOHN W.

Mr. President, this bill we just passed provides for the \ncontinued education of students who have been so severely affected by \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for her \ntremendous leadership on this bill. It is a very important bill and a \nbill that has been a long time coming. We--especially she and her \ncosponsors--have aggressively worked in this regard to pass this bill. \nI am happy to yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for helping us clear this legislation. This is a bill \ncosponsored by Senator Landrieu and Senator Cornyn. Twenty-eight States \nhave taken students, who are victims of Hurricane Katrina, into their \nhearts, into their arms, into their shelters, and into their \neducational systems.\n  We have been passing legislation that would cut red tape and pay for \ncertain items that are not covered by the law. One of the major areas \nfor which we have not had a precedent is schoolchildren in great \nnumbers going into public schools as a result of having to evacuate \nfrom an emergency disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina. That has been \nthe case.\n  We have more than 45,000 evacuee students now in our Texas public \nschools. As everyone knows, there is no school district that can afford \nto absorb that number of students without help. The bill we have just \npassed will allow the money that has already been appropriated to be \navailable for the Department of Education to pay for the extra teachers \nwho are being hired. It is limited to children who are victims of \nHurricane Katrina, and it also has a sunset. It is just for this school \nyear. So this is not a new law that is going to put the Federal \nGovernment into public education throughout our country. But it is \ngoing to offset the costs of hiring teachers and buying school supplies \nfor those students who have come to our State and 27 other States with \nnothing.\n  Today I am very proud of the Senate for passing this legislation to \ngive these 28 States the help they need. The money will flow through \nthe Department of Education. The Secretary of Education will have the \nauthority to take some of the money that has already been appropriated \nby Congress for this purpose.\n  I applaud the Senate for passing this bill, and I look forward to it \ngoing through the House and being signed by the President.\n  I thank Senator Frist so much for the help he has given in allowing \nthe Senate to act quickly on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10388-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF ROBERT B.

Res. 247) commending the Library of \n     Congress's private-sector advisory body, the James Madison \n     Council, and its Founding Chairman, John W. Kluge, on 15 \n     years of exemplary service to Congress and the Nation and \n     looking forward to the Council's continued success in the \n     years ahead.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise in support of a Senate resolution \nwhich I submitted commending the James Madison Council of the Library \nof Congress, which is celebrating its 15th year under the continuing \nstrong leadership of its founding chairman, John Kluge.\n  The James Madison Council is the first private sector advisory body \nin the history of the Library of Congress. With the approval of the \nJoint Committee on the Library, which I have chaired and served on for \nmany years, Librarian of Congress Jim Billington established the \nCouncil in 1990 as the Library's primary philanthropic body and link to \nthe business community. It consists of public-spirited citizens \ndedicated to helping the Nation receive the full benefits of the \nLibrary of Congress's incomparable educational, scientific, \ntechnological, and cultural resources.\n  In its 15 years of unprecedented private support of the Library, the \nMadison Council has acquired hundreds of items for the collections that \nwould have otherwise been unattainable through Federal appropriations \nalone, including the famous Waldseemuller map, the first map to bear \nthe name ``America''; the $45 million dollar campaign to launch the \nNational Digital Library, which provides free internet access to 10 \nmillion of the most important materials in the Library's collection; \nthe Library's bicentennial celebration in 2000 which featured the \nrecreation of Thomas Jefferson's library; the establishment of the John \nKluge Center, a major scholarly center, and its accompanying Kluge \nPrize in the humanities; and the National Book Festival, in conjunction \nwith First Lady Laura Bush, promoting literacy and the joys of reading, \nwhich is taking place this weekend.\n  This resolution commends and thanks the James Madison Council, \nparticularly its chairman, John Kluge, one of the most patriotic and \ngenerous philanthropists I have known, and looks forward to its \ncontinued success in supporting the world's greatest library in the \nyears ahead.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I rise in support of a Senate resolution \nwhich I submitted commending the James Madison Council of the Library \nof Congress, which is celebrating its 15th year under the continuing \nstrong leadership of its founding chairman, John Kluge.\n  The James Madison Council is the first private sector advisory body \nin the history of the Library of Congress. With the approval of the \nJoint Committee on the Library, which I have chaired and served on for \nmany years, Librarian of Congress Jim Billington established the \nCouncil in 1990 as the Library's primary philanthropic body and link to \nthe business community. It consists of public-spirited citizens \ndedicated to helping the Nation receive the full benefits of the \nLibrary of Congress's incomparable educational, scientific, \ntechnological, and cultural resources.\n  In its 15 years of unprecedented private support of the Library, the \nMadison Council has acquired hundreds of items for the collections that \nwould have otherwise been unattainable through Federal appropriations \nalone, including the famous Waldseemuller map, the first map to bear \nthe name ``America''; the $45 million dollar campaign to launch the \nNational Digital Library, which provides free internet access to 10 \nmillion of the most important materials in the Library's collection; \nthe Library's bicentennial celebration in 2000 which featured the \nrecreation of Thomas Jefferson's library; the establishment of the John \nKluge Center, a major scholarly center, and its accompanying Kluge \nPrize in the humanities; and the National Book Festival, in conjunction \nwith First Lady Laura Bush, promoting literacy and the joys of reading, \nwhich is taking place this weekend.\n  This resolution commends and thanks the James Madison Council, \nparticularly its chairman, John Kluge, one of the most patriotic and \ngenerous philanthropists I have known, and looks forward to its \ncontinued success in supporting the world's greatest library in the \nyears ahead.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of resolutions \ncongratulating the Ewa Beach little league team, the Oahu all-star \nteam, and the Hawaii Warriors on their world championships. All three \nteams recently persevered through difficult competition to become world \nchampions.\n  The Ewa Beach little leaguers competed in the Little League World \nSeries held in Williamsport, PA. The team posted an impressive 7-6 win \nin the championship game, in which they came from three runs down to \ndefeat the defending championship team from Curacao in extra innings.\n  The Oahu all-stars participated in the Cal Ripken World Series \ntournament held in Aberdeen, MD. In the championship game, the team \nused three pitchers to combine for a one hit shut-out as they prevailed \nby a score of 1-0 over the reigning champs, a very talented team from \nMexico. A special congratulations to Kewby Meyer for being named Most \nOutstanding Player of the series.\n  The Hawaii Warriors won the 2005 Continental Amateur Baseball \nAssociation World Series, ages 9 and under. The team battled from \nbehind in the final innings to win the championship game and complete \nthe series with a perfect 9-0 record.\n  I am proud not only of the impressive wins but also of the humility \nand sportsmanship that the teams displayed as they won with aloha. All \nthe teams represented the State of Hawaii, and the United States, very \nwell.\n  I recognize the sacrifices many family members and friends made to \nsupport the teams. These young men were able to enjoy the athletic \ncompetitions because of their loving and caring families. I applaud \nthese families' efforts and wish all the players and their families the \nbest in future endeavors.\n  I look forward to hearing more about the success of our little \nleaguers as they continue to pursue their education and baseball \nambitions.

Mr. President, the Senate does continue to make steady \nprogress on the business of the American people. We are hard at work \nfunding the basic obligations of Government.\n  Today, we passed the Military Construction Appropriations Act. The \nMilitary Construction appropriations bill funds the entire Department \nof Veterans Affairs along with the construction of all five branches.\n  It provides for cancer research and funding for our VA hospitals, \nalong with covering the cost of our treasured national monuments. I \ncongratulate Senators Hutchison and Feinstein for accomplishing \nconsideration and passage of that bill in a single day. It took the \ncooperation of a lot of Members and proves that we can go quickly \nthrough the appropriations process. Again, I thank both of them.\n  This morning we also passed with near unanimous support the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. I thank Senator Bennett and Senator \nKohl for their tremendous work and leadership on this important bill. \nThe Agriculture bill targets spending on the needs of rural America, \nwhile also maintaining funding for essential food assistance programs. \nThe bill is particularly important to farmers in States all across the \ncountry, but in particular I want to comment on my home State.\n  It provides $2 million for Appalachian Horticultural Research, a \ncollaborative project between the USDA and the University of Tennessee \nto help trees fight and resist disease; about $955,000 for research \ninto the best way to protect soil and water quality on farms which can \nsuffer from heavy erosion; nearly $40 billion for the very successful \nBoll Weevil Eradication Program which will help cotton farmers continue \nto combat this destructive pest.\n  These programs, along with major funding for USDA's rural development \nprograms and housing services, are helping farm areas around the \ncountry continue to feed America and, indeed, continue to help feed the \nworld.\n  Last week we also passed a third appropriations bill, the Commerce-\nJustice-Science bill. In addition to funding basic Government business, \nit includes significant Katrina-related measures. More than 350,000 \nfamilies have been made homeless by the Katrina disaster. The CJS bill \nprovides Federal housing assistance of up to $600 per family per month \nfor up to 6 months to get these families back on their feet. I commend \nmy colleagues for remaining focused on the appropriations process so \nthat we can also meet our responsibilities to the victims of Katrina. \nWe have extraordinary challenges before us, and we are working hard to \ndeliver meaningful relief in the gulf region in a fiscally responsible \nway.\n  We moved quickly in the initial days to allocate appropriate funding. \nWe also lifted the burden of student loans for those displaced from \ncolleges and universities. We made sure that FEMA had funding to cover \ntheir national flood insurance obligations, and we passed legislation \nto get the Federal courts back on track in the regions affected. Since \nthen, we passed aggressive tax relief to encourage charitable giving \nand to help hurricane victims rebuild their homes, restore their \npossessions, find housing, and find jobs. All of this is only the first \nstep. There will be more. Helping the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nrecover and rebuild is a monumental undertaking, an undertaking this \nbody is focused on. We understand the absolutely critical importance of \ndoing this in a fiscally responsible way, with full accountability and \nfull transparency. This is America. America is up to the challenge. The \nSenate will continue to do its work moving forward in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10392-5", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10392-S10393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, next week we will begin to debate the \nnomination of Judge John Roberts to be America's Chief Justice. I am \nconfident it will be a continuation of a process that has been quite \ndignified and civil. We will continue that momentum as we go through \nnext week. A final vote on his nomination will be held on Thursday, and \nI look forward to a full and robust debate that brings credit to this \ngreat institution. Our duty to advise and consent on the selection of \nSupreme Court Justices is perhaps one of our most solemn obligations. I \nthank my colleagues for their continuing hard work in this regard.\n  In summary, the order we have laid out provides that we will begin \nthe Roberts nomination on Monday. We were prepared to have Senators \ndeliver\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\nopening statements during Friday's session. However, nobody has come \nforward with a specific request to speak. Therefore, we will return on \nMonday and proceed to executive session to begin that debate.\n  I mentioned earlier that we will vote on Monday, and Senators should \nexpect that vote to begin somewhere around 5:30. We are clearing a \nnumber of legislative items, and we will announce on Monday what that \nvote will be.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take advantage of Monday and early \nTuesday to speak on the Roberts nomination. Senators should not delay--\nplease do not--their statements until Wednesday. The vote on the \nnomination will be next week. We will be prepared to remain in session \nas late as necessary to accommodate Members' speeches. I know that most \nall Members will either want to come to the floor or submit their \nstatements to the Record, and we will accommodate them. Again, I \nencourage them, so we won't have this great rush on Wednesday or \nThursday morning, to come Monday and Tuesday and make their addresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/22/senate-section/article/S10393-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.\n                       MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
