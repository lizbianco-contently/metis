The managers are here to work through the remaining \namendments this afternoon, and we will have votes on at least one \namendment at 5:30, or sometime around 5:30. The specific time we will \nstate shortly but at around 5:30 today. We have an agreement for \nfinishing this bill tomorrow. Under the agreement, Senators may offer \namendments today from the limited list we agreed to last week. We do \nhope most of these amendments will not require votes. There are a few \nremaining amendments that will need rollcall votes prior to passage. I \nonce again thank the managers for their hard work, and I look forward \nto finishing the bill tomorrow so we can get it to conference as soon \nas possible.\n\n\n                                Lebanon\n\n  Mr. President, in my leader remarks for the past week, I have come to \nthe Senate floor to briefly comment on a recent trip to the Middle \nEast. Over the April recess I had the privilege of traveling to Israel, \nthe West Bank, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon. In each of these stops, I \nmet with officials and community leaders. I also made a special point \nof meeting with opposition leaders as well.\n  With each conversation, I learned more about the challenges facing \nthis complicated part of the world. I became convinced that despite the \ndeep differences that divide them, each party is committed to and wants \npeace and prosperity. Each side knows that dialog is the only way \nforward.\n  Nowhere has this been on more astonishing display than in Lebanon. As \nwe all witnessed, following the assassination of former Prime Minister \nRafik Hariri in February, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese citizens \ntook to the streets to peacefully protest foreign occupation and \ninterference. The images on television were remarkable. Central Beirut \nwas awash in this sea of flags of red, green, and white. Proudly \ndefiant citizens passed out roses to the soldiers who had been sent in \nto contain them.\n  It was a triumphant moment for the Lebanese people and a turning \npoint in their country's history. Our delegation had the opportunity to \nwalk through Martyr Square, as that square is called, where, on March \n14, there were hundreds of thousands of people who came forth to \nexpress the will of the people.\n  Syrian military and intelligence personnel had been stationed in \nLebanon for decades and had consistently denied the Lebanese people the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity deserved by all independent \nnations. In addition, heavily armed militias, such as the Deborah \nterrorist group, have operated with virtual impunity in Lebanon and\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\nhave been allowed to pursue their radical agenda.\n  The last few months have been times of turmoil and opportunity for \nthe Lebanese people. For the first time in decades, the Lebanese people \nare free of the interference of the Syrian military.\n  However, it is still not clear that Syria is fully complying with the \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1559. Resolution 1559 calls \nfor the withdrawal of all foreign forces and intelligence personnel, \nand the disarming of armed militias. Although Syria claims to have \nremoved all of its intelligence personnel from Lebanon, this has not \nbeen confirmed. And groups such as Deborah refuse to disarm.\n  Resolution 1559 also calls for free and fair elections. Our first \nmeeting in Beirut was with members of the opposition. They represented \nparties and religious sects--Christian, Druze, and Muslim. These \nleaders were well versed in the requirements for a successfully \nfunctioning democracy. In particular, they discussed the need to \nrestore accountability, to restore transparency, to secure an \nindependent judiciary, and to rebuild their economy so all Lebanese \npeople have a stake in the future. Their commitment to freedom, the \nrule of law, and democratic governance was truly inspiring. They are \nintensely aware of the importance of this historic opportunity to \nsecure a truly free democracy, and they were all united in holding \nelections on time in late May. While I am hopeful, it remains to be \nseen how their unity will hold once that new government is formed.\n  We then met with the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Najib Mikati. I \nwas greatly encouraged when he echoed many of the concerns that had \nbeen expressed earlier in the day by leaders of the opposition. He \nspoke of the need for an independent judiciary and respect for Lebanese \nsovereignty. I agreed with his assessment that economic reform required \na strong private sector that is truly globally competitive.\n  He also expressed confidence that Syria had withdrawn all of its \nintelligence agents and that the Lebanese people would soon see the \nbenefits of freedom from foreign occupation.\n  The Prime Minister also echoed the assurances of Parliamentary \nSpeaker Nabih Berri that free and fair elections would take place as \nscheduled.\n  Finally, I had the opportunity to visit with participants in a \nprogram called AMIDEAST. This program was established by our State \nDepartment shortly after 9/11, seeking to rebuild a better \nunderstanding of the United States by selecting young Lebanese students \nto attend American schools and live with host families for a year. I \nhad the opportunity to meet with two students who will soon be in \nTennessee.\n  President Bush has rightly emphasized the importance of public \ndiplomacy in our efforts to spread freedom and democracy. My \ninteractions with the participants of AMIDEAST confirmed my belief that \nmore such programs are needed throughout the region. We need to make a \nmore concerted effort to reach out to the people of the Middle East, \nespecially the young, and demonstrate to them that they can achieve \ntheir hopes and aspirations for peace and freedom.\n  My visit to Lebanon and the determination exhibited by the Lebanese \npeople in the past few months have been truly inspiring. I hope my \nSenate colleagues will join me in continuing to support the Lebanese \npeople as they strive to achieve their dream of a free and prosperous \nLebanon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                   Wishing Senator Paul Sarbanes Well\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would first like to say we have just \nreceived word that Paul Sarbanes has been taken to the hospital. He was \nattending the funeral of Chairman Rodino in New Jersey. We hope that \nfor him and Chris everything works out fine. But I think everyone who \nis part of the Senate family should give their thoughts and prayers to \nPaul Sarbanes, a wonderful human being. I am confident he will be OK, \nbut he is at a hospital now in New Jersey.\n\n\n              Judicial Nominations and the Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. President, the majority leader stated the Senate will turn to the \nsubject of judicial nominations this week. We are ready for that. We \nstand united against an outrageous abuse of power that would pack the \ncourts with out-of-the-mainstream judges.\n  The time has come for those Senators of the majority to decide where \nthey stand, whether they will abide by the rules of the Senate or break \nthe rules for the first time in 217 years--217 years--of American \nhistory. Will they support the checks and balances established by the \nFounding Fathers or vote to give the President unaccountable power to \npick lifetime judges?\n  I am confident and hopeful there will be six Republican Senators who \nwill be profiles of courage. I have had Senators come to me, even \ntoday, Republican Senators, in personal conversations, telephone \nconversations, today and over the weeks, who have said: We know you are \nright. We know you are right. But we can't vote with you.\n  Boy, I will tell you, that is--I told my staff today, these \nconversations have been some of the biggest disappointments I have ever \nhad in my political life. To have people say they know they are \nbreaking the rules, but they want to--I don't know all the reasons--\nmaybe so the President likes them or they think he likes them. I don't \nknow all the reasons. It is hard for me to intellectually understand, \nemotionally understand how a Senator could say they know we are right \nbut they are willing to break the rules to change the rules. I believe \nthere must be at least six out there who are willing to stand up and \nbe, I repeat, profiles in courage.\n  While we are ready to debate this issue, I am deeply pained we need \nto do so. The Senate in which I have spent the last 20 years of my life \nis a body in which the rules are sacrosanct. We may choose to amend the \nrules by a two-thirds vote. We may enter into unanimous consent \nagreements to waive the rules. But never before in the history of the \nSenate has a partisan majority sought to break the rules in order to \nachieve momentary political advantage.\n  We know that the Parliamentarian has said--and it is a nonpartisan \noffice--this is the wrong way to go forward. I have had conversations \nwith the Parliamentarians myself. So I repeat, never in the history of \nthe Senate has a partisan majority sought to break the rules in order \nto achieve momentary political advantage, because that is what it would \nbe. If this happens, it will be a short-term win for my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle but a long-term loss for the Senate and for \nthe American people.\n  I have worked so hard, Mr. President--I am not boasting about how \nhard; we have all worked hard, but I have spent the majority of my time \nin the last month on this issue. I have said privately and publicly \nthis is the most important issue I have ever worked on in my 40 years \nin public service.\n  In an effort to avoid this confrontation and preserve constitutional \nchecks and balances, I have made every effort to be reasonable--every \neffort. Here on the floor, I offered last Monday an up-or-down vote on \nThomas Griffith, a controversial nominee to the DC Circuit. Last \nThursday, I offered to have an up-or-down vote on three nominees to the \nSixth Circuit, two of whom were filibustered last year.\n  These are not judges we would choose, but we know the difference \nbetween opposing bad nominees and blocking acceptable ones. In making \nwhat I thought were good-faith offers, I asked the majority: Do you \nwant to confirm judges or do you want to provoke a fight? Regrettably, \nall of my proposals have been rejected--all of my proposals. There were \ncertainly more than these, and I am not going to go through the \nproposals I made privately. I have only talked about those I have made \nseparate from these offers.\n  I wrote to the majority leader last week and suggested two ways to \nbreak the impasse. First, I made clear my previous offer to allow an \nup-or-down vote on one of the most controversial nominees remaining on \nthe table.\n  Second, I suggested we consider changing the rules in accordance with \nthe rules--not too unique; if you want to change the rules, follow the \nrules--if the majority leader were to put his\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\nproposal in the form of a Senate resolution and allow it to be referred \nto the Rules Committee.\n  I have spoken to Senator Dodd. In fact, he was here last week to \nspeak on this matter, but because of what was going on in the Chamber \nhe was unable to do that. Senator Dodd said he would do everything in \nhis power as ranking member to expedite this consideration.\n  Neither of these good-faith suggestions have been accepted, and I \nguess it is clear why, I am sad to say. Republicans in the Senate \ndemand to have it all. A 95-percent confirmation rate is not good \nenough. Votes on some of the most controversial nominees isn't good \nenough. They are prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve total \nvictory.\n  Meanwhile, the White House appears to be pulling strings.\n  At a meeting I had in the White House, I asked the President: Mr. \nPresident, you could avoid so much controversy in the Senate. We could \nmove forward on your agenda so much easier if you would intervene on \nthis so-called nuclear option and help us resolve it.\n  He said to me: I have nothing to do with that. That is all up to \nyou--not me but the Senate leaders--I am staying out of this.\n  Well, within hours after that, deputy White House Chief of Staff Carl \nRove was quoted as discouraging any middle ground, all or nothing. Then \nVice President Cheney gave a speech in which he said: All or nothing. \nOn Friday, the Washington Times--and this is really interesting for \nthose of us who love the Senate. On Friday, the Washington Times \nreported that White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan ``flatly \nrejected any talk of compromise that would confirm only some of the \nPresident's blocked nominees.'' The White House is telling the Senate \nhow to operate? The Press Secretary of the President is telling the \nSenate what to do and not to do? The White House, through their Press \nSecretary, flatly rejects an offer of compromise. What has this body \ncome to?\n  It is disturbing that the White House is playing an aggressive role \nto discourage compromise. Every high school student in America learns \nabout checks and balances. The Senate advice and consent role is one of \nthe most important checks on Executive power. The White House should \nnot be lobbying to change Senate rules in a way that would hand \ndangerous new powers to the President over two separate branches--the \nCongress and the judiciary.\n  Of course, the President would like the power to name anyone he wants \nto lifetime seats on the Supreme Court and other Federal courts, but \nthat is not how America works. The Constitution doesn't give him that \npower, and we should not cede that power to the executive branch.\n  As the majority leader admitted with Senator Byrd last week, there is \nno constitutional right to an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees. If \nthere were, more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees had their \nrights violated. In fact, the Senate has rejected hundreds of judicial \nnominations over the years. Legal scholars say 20 percent of those \nselected for the Supreme Court have not gone forward. Prior to 1917, \nthere was no way to stop the filibuster, and lots of judges simply \ndidn't come forward. So we have rejected hundreds of judicial \nnominations over the years, some by an up-or-down vote, some by \nfilibuster, and some by simple inaction. In each case the Senate was \nacting within its authority under the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution.\n  My friend, Senator Frist, says he wants a fairness rule, but a rule \nallowing the President to ram extreme judges through the Senate is \nunfair to the American people. Meanwhile, we need to get back to the \npeople's business and put people over partisanship. We were sent here \nto govern, and right now we are not doing that. Gas prices are up, \nfamilies have lost health insurance, pension plans are unstable, to say \nthe least, and the situation in Iraq is grave. The Senate, literally, \nis fiddling while Rome is burning.\n  Mr. President, I am going to continue to talk to the majority leader. \nI am going to talk and talk and talk as much as I can to try to resolve \nthis issue. I know there are other efforts at compromise under \nconsideration. But unless cooler heads prevail, this confrontation will \nbe upon us later this week. If it comes to that vote, Democrats and \nresponsible Republicans--if it comes to that vote, Democrats in the \nSenate and responsible Republicans in the Senate will vote to preserve \nchecks and balances and preserve the principle that the Senate rules \nmust not be broken.\n\n  Mr. President, the eyes of the Nation are upon us. There have been \nfew moments of truth like this one in the history of this great \ninstitution. The American people will see whether the Senate passes \nthis historic test.\n  Would the Chair announce what the business is before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is H.R. 3.\n  Mr. REID. There is no time for morning business this morning; is that \ntrue?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There has been none requested.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are at the point now where I believe we \nare going to hear from a number of Members who have submitted \namendments and some who simply want to talk about the bill, some who \nwant to talk about the formulas. We have had some requests for time. It \nis my understanding that we are going to have our vote at 5:30. It does \nmean we have limited time between now and then. Let me just make a \ncomment or two about this and then ask--\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments \nnumbered 638, 690, and 723 be removed from the list of first-degree \namendments to H.R. 3.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, \nand it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 619 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Lautenberg, I call up amendment No. \n619.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending amendment \nis laid aside and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 619.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase penalties for individuals who operate motor \n  vehicles while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol under \n                       aggravated circumstances)\n\n         Strike section 1403 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1403.

Mr. President, as I was saying, we do have a lot of \npeople who want to be heard on this bill. I believe I have said several \ntimes this could very well be the most significant vote we will have \nthis year. It is a vote that we actually had last year. Senator \nJeffords and I worked for 3 years on this bill, along with Senator Bond \nand Senator Baucus. The four of us have been shepherding this bill. Now \nit looks as if we are very close to getting a bill.\n  Last year, our bill was funded at $318 billion. It was passed on to \nconference, and we lacked one signature of getting a conference report, \nso it did not happen. As a result, we are operating on our sixth \nextension. I know the occupant of the chair understands the \nsignificance of this. It means all the reforms we have in here, \nstreamlining reforms, will not be a reality if we are not able to pass \na bill, if we have to operate on a seventh extension. It means we are \nnot going to have any help for the donee States. We will not have any \nhelp for the sparsely populated States. We are not going to be able to \nhave the commission that is going to look into new ways of funding \nhighways. We started off back in the Eisenhower administration. Since \nhe started the national highways program, we have been funding them \nessentially the same way ever since, but this bill appoints a \ncommission that is going to be creative and do a lot better job than we \nhave done before.\n  The formula--you always find someone objecting to the formula. It \ntakes into consideration about 10 different things: size of the State, \ndensity of the State, the donor status of the State--things that are \nvery significant in order to be totally equitable. One of the factors \nis the highway fatalities in the State on a per capita basis. That has \nto tell you something. If one of the States has a lot more fatalities \non the highway, it means they have greater needs. My State of Oklahoma \nhas terrible bridges. We are ranked dead last. We were tied with the \nState of Missouri, but I think we are now last. We want to correct \nthat. We want this bill. It is very important that we have this bill. \nWe are going to have our vote tomorrow, and we want to hear from anyone \ndown here.\n  I ask Senator Jeffords, did you want to make any comments at this \ntime?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't see Senator Baucus. I ask Senator Bond, do you \nwant to make any comments?\n  Mr. BOND. No.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will not take long. I know there is lots for us to do, \nbut I wanted to come over to the floor and express my support for the \nmovement and the passage of the highway bill. I, first of all, wish to \nthank the chairman and the ranking member for the work they have done. \nHaving been on that committee in years past, I know how difficult a \ntask it is and what a great job they have done.\n  We have been now some 5 or 6 years waiting to do what we really need \nto do, clearly need to do. All of us have highway problems. All of us \nhave need for an infrastructure. It is certainly one of the things that \ncreates more jobs than almost anything we could possibly have. And the \ntransportation system is something we clearly need for the future. So I \nguess I am a little disappointed that it has taken as long as it has \nfor us to move forward. But now we do have an opportunity to do that, \nand certainly it is the time to do it. This bill has been reviewed by \nalmost everybody in the place. We don't need to spend a lot more time \ntalking about it. Certainly, there will be some amendments. However, \nthe House has passed a similar bill. I think we should stick to the \nhighway funding as it was set up in the budget, frankly, but that is an \nissue that will be resolved in time.\n  So I just hope we can pass it here. I think these decisions as to how \nthe money is used should be made in the States, and we do not want a \nbunch of decisions made here as to the details of transportation.\n  I will not take more time, but I do want to say that it is \ndiscouraging and frustrating for us to take this long to move forward. \nWe have so many things out there we need to be doing. The Energy bill \nis just as important as this, perhaps even more. We have laid it aside \nand continue to wait. We need to be looking at the future both in the \nhighway bill and energy as to where we are going to be in 10 or 15 \nyears and make some policy decisions with respect thereto.\n  One of the real problems, of course, with highway funding is that \nall, practically all of the work that is done on highways is done by \ncontracting with our various State departments that handle highways. \nWhen you do contracting, you have to have knowledge of the time ahead \nas to what your financing is going to be because contracting is done in \nthe future.\n  So I hope we can get on with this bill. I think we need to be talking \nabout budgets. That is one of the things that is very important to us. \nEnergy is very important to us. I think we need to get over this idea \nof stalling.\n  I noticed the minority leader has said we are talking about breaking \nthe rules. We are not breaking the rules. We are going to change the \nrules so that we can move forward. I think it is time to stop the \nchatter about that as well and move on to something that we can do.\n  So we need a bill. Extensions are no longer acceptable. Our State \nDOTs cannot wait long periods of time. Our construction time in \nWyoming, for example, is very short during the summer.\n  So, Mr. President, I again thank the managers of this bill for moving \nforward. Let's get it done.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for an \nexcellent point, and that point is we are on our sixth extension now. \nSome extensions are 30-day extensions, some of them are 6-month \nextensions, and you can't expect the contracting community out there to \nbe able to plan in an efficient way to spend the money to build the \nhighways, to build the\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nbridges, or repair the highways if they can't plan in advance. This \nwould give us 5 more years on a 6-year authorization. It is absolutely \nimperative.\n  I say to my colleagues that we are now operating on the bill, so \nwhoever seeks recognition can get recognition as he or she desires.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't believe we are yielding time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I don't want to object, \nbut we have a short period of time until we have to go to the highway \nbill vote. We have a long list of people who want to speak on the \nhighway bill. What I would ask of the Senator from Hawaii is that \ninstead of his speaking for 15 minutes, he go ahead and start, and if \nanyone wants to seek recognition on the highway bill, they could do so.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator withdraw his request?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I will not ask for time. I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 1037 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have several requests to speak prior to \n4 o'clock and then more prior to 5:30 on the highway bill which is the \nregular order. So far, those speakers who want to speak in morning \nbusiness have been kind enough to say that they would not mind being \ninterrupted, if necessary, if someone came down to talk about the \nhighway bill. I appreciate that and remind my colleagues that we don't \nhave a lot of time between now and the vote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to introduce a bill and speak \nabout it briefly. I will do that with the proviso that if someone comes \nand wishes to speak about their amendment on the highway bill, I will \nbe happy to relinquish the floor.\n  Is the Senator from Iowa wishing to speak on an amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nhas a title under this bill. If you don't mind, I am sure there will be \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to defer. I know this highway bill is \nimportant to get passed as soon as possible. I am happy to yield the \nfloor and perhaps, following the Senator from Iowa, if there is an \nopportunity, I will make my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it should be quite obvious from \nAmerica's increasing dependence on foreign sources of oil that it has \nnow reached a very critical threshold which calls for immediate action. \nThis bill before us is part of our immediate action, as it has some \nthings in it to increase our availability of domestic supplies of \nenergy. Global oil prices and supplies remain beyond our reach, just as \nsurely as our own demand here at home will remain constant. Abroad, oil \nprices and supplies are at best in a state of flux, very unpredictable. \nAt worst, you could say that things are beyond our control.\n  Our obvious goal in a lot of our energy legislation--some of it is \npart of this bill and part of the debate we had 2 years ago on the \nhighway bill--is to get some of this under our control by having less \ndependence upon foreign sources of oil.\n  In China, for instance, the competition for oil is unprecedented. So \ndetermined is China to protect itself and its burgeoning growth against \nglobal uncertainty, they have recently secured supplies from both \nCanada and Venezuela and are actively seeking oil from producers upon \nwhom the United States has traditionally relied. Some experts suggest \nthat we have now reached our global supply limits, perhaps even that we \nhave exceeded them.\n  If they are correct--and of course we hope they are not--we face more \nshortages and rising prices. The answer to these very real and vexing \nquestions about the global security of supply and price for America's \noil demands are far beyond this Senator and indeed even beyond this \nlegislation before the Senate.\n  However, I believe, with this amendment as part of the managers' \npackage, we will go a long way toward reducing our domestic dependence \nupon oil dedicated to our transportation sector. We are gulping vast \namounts of imported oil in an increasingly futile attempt to quench our \nthirsty addiction to petroleum. Today, our transportation sector \naccounts for two-thirds of the total United States demand. This forces \nus to import a whopping 60 percent of our petroleum needs.\n  I remember a time when we thought it was inconceivable America would \never exceed even 50-percent reliance upon foreign oil. Yet, we have, \nand then we exceeded even that, until here we are today at more than 60 \npercent. What can we do now to alleviate the problem? How can we do so \nhere at home?\n  The President pointed something out when he spoke last week about the \npressing needs to develop and implement comprehensive national energy \npolicy, and I think it bears repeating if only through paraphrasing. \nPresident Bush indicated that technology would provide our Nation with \nthe means to reduce our demand for petroleum-based fuel, thus reducing \nthe high price of gasoline. The President also stressed we must embrace \ndomestic alternative fuels as a critical midstep on the pathway toward \nhydrogen, which may well prove to be our ultimate fix. But the simple \nfact remains that a sustainable, affordable hydrogen program is still \ndecades away. Transitioning America away from our entrenched dependency \non foreign petroleum fuels to cleaner, cheaper domestic alternatives is \noccurring right now here at home. We should not be oblivious to it. I \nagree with the President that these domestic alternatives need to be \nembraced and encouraged. To that end, therefore, as chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I have developed a proposal entitled the \n``Volumetric Excise Tax Credit for Alternative Fuels.'' It would be \njust like VEETC for ethanol and biodiesel that we passed last year, \nonly extended to alternative fuels. This proposal would help \nsignificantly accomplish that goal of being less dependent upon foreign \nsources of energy.\n  The VEETC proposal would provide for the expansion and modification \nof the Volumetric Excise Tax Credit for Alternative Fuels. Our proposal \nwill expand last year's excise tax formula, as it relates to ethanol, \nto include an excise tax credit for all domestic alternative fuels \nwhich would displace imported petroleum. This is how it would work. \nSome fuels, such as natural gas, presently pay a partially reduced rate \nof excise tax into the highway trust fund.\n  However, because these motor vehicles exact the same amount of damage \nto our roads and highways, my amendment would have them pay an \nincreased rate of Federal excise tax into the highway trust fund. With \nthis mechanism, the President's objective of displacing as much \nimported oil as possible is met. As importantly, the increased excise \ntax payments would go a long way toward increasing revenue into the \nhighway trust fund for the near term and well into the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  This is not a new concept. Congress passed, and the President signed \ninto law, a similar provision last year providing the same treatment \nfor ethanol and biodiesel. In an effort to further encourage other \ndomestic alternative fuels, this new VEETC amendment that we will be \ntaking up which enjoys broad bipartisan support, it constitutes a \nsimple expansion on the part of the framers to include other \nalternative fuels which displace imported petroleum-based fuels. \nAdoption of the VEETC for alternative fuels would constitute a win-win. \nIt puts more money into the highway trust fund, while at the same time \npromoting domestic sources of motor fuel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again, I seek permission to speak as in \nmorning business. I will relinquish the floor if somebody wishes to \nspeak about the highway bill.\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Piracy and Counterfeiting by China\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am introducing some legislation today, \nalong with Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina to construct. It \ndeals with the issue of piracy or counterfeiting of goods by China. It \nrelates to the substantial loss of U.S. jobs, and $200 billion in harm \nto the U.S. economy as a result of the piracy and counterfeiting that \nis going on in China.\n  What is our Government's reaction to this problem? Our government's \nreaction to date can be characterized as somewhere between looking \nworried, a deep frown, or thumb-sucking. Essentially, it is doing \nnothing to stand up for this country's economic interests.\n  Let me describe the problem. The U.S. Trade Representative has \nconcluded that: ``China has not resolved critical deficiencies in \nintellectual property rights protection and enforcement and, as a \nresult, infringements remain at epidemic levels.''\n  In short, the Chinese are cheating, counterfeiting American goods and \nrobbing jobs from our country. Chinese fake goods coming into the \nUnited States grew 47 percent last year. The Chinese government is not \ndoing anything about it. Investigations of counterfeiting in China, as \nyou see, have taken a nosedive. The vast majority of products in the \nUnited States that are counterfeits or pirated are Chinese; 67 percent \nof the counterfeit products in this country are Chinese counterfeit \nproducts.\n  The question is, What are we going to do about it? Senator Lindsey \nGraham and I are offering a sense of the Senate resolution--and we will \nask the Senate to vote on it at some point--calling for the immediate \nlaunch of a WTO case against China for gross violation of U.S. \nintellectual property rights.\n  On April 29, last month, the U.S. Trade Representative released a \nreport finding that China had broken its promises to crack down on this \npiracy and counterfeiting. They have done nothing. They promised the \nmoon, and they have done nothing. The question is, Will this country \nstand up for its own economic interests?\n  Mr. President, let me give you specific case that I think is \ninteresting. Time magazine wrote recently about a new car produced by \nChery, an automobile company in China--that's right, not Chevy, but \nChery the Chery Automobile Company.\n  A Chinese firm called the Chery Automobile Company has stolen \nproduction-line blueprints for a new GM car called the Chevrolet Spark. \nThe Chery Automobile Company is going to be producing that car, which \nthey call the QQ, and they plan to sell five models, including an SUV, \nin the United States. Chery has teamed up with the man who brought the \nSubaru to America in the 1960s. Their plan is to import up to a quarter \nof a million Cherys starting in 2007.\n  GM is now in court. General Motors filed an action alleging that \ntheir production-line blueprints were stolen.\n  But it is not just that. It is so many different products. Take a \nlook at the products that all of us know--films, publishing, software, \nelectric equipment, automotive parts, on and on--have been \ncounterfeited and pirated. It means American lost jobs and a higher \ntrade deficit to the tune, we are told, of $200 billion in piracy and \ncounterfeiting.\n  Now, given that we had specific promises by China that they would \nbegin to crack down on this with respect to their entrance into the \nWorld Trade Organization, and the fact we know they have done nothing--\nour own U.S. Trade Ambassador says they have done nothing, that it is \n``epidemic''--when will this country take action?\n\n  Winston Churchill once told a story of being taken to a carnival by \nhis parents. He was speaking to his adversary in the House of Commons, \nand he told the story about seeing the sideshow's big canvas sign that \nsays, ``Come Inside and See the Boneless Wonder,'' a man apparently \nborn without bones. Winston Churchill said he was with his parents that \nday; his parents thought it was too traumatic to take a young boy into \na carnival sideshow to see the boneless wonder. He never got to see it \nuntil that day on the floor of the House of Commons. When he addressed \nhis adversary, he said, ``Finally, I see a boneless wonder.''\n  Boneless wonder is a good way to describe, in my judgment, those \ninvolved in trade policy in this country, who fail to stand up for this \ncountry's economic interests, who don't have the backbone to stand up \nand say it is in our country's interests, in the interest of our jobs, \nto take action against those who pirate or counterfeit American \nintellectual property. I have talked often on the Senate floor about \ntrade with China and Japan and Korea and with Europe. There has been a \nlack of spine on many fronts. In this case, I am speaking specifically \nabout counterfeiting and piracy by the Chinese, with whom we have the \nlargest trade deficit in history.\n  Now we see that the USTR says it is in epidemic proportions--piracy \nand counterfeiting--and yet nothing is being done. The question is, \nWill we do something? Will we finally have the nerve to say we want a \nWTO case to be commenced against the Chinese?\n  This is a sense of the Senate resolution asking that the USTR \ncommence a WTO case against the Chinese. Again, it is not me who says \nthat the Chinese have cheated. The U.S. Trade Representative said \nhimself that: ``China has not resolved of the critical deficiencies in \nintellectual property rights protection and enforcement and, as a \nresult, infringements remain at epidemic levels.''\n  That amounts to massive wholesale stealing going on. It affects this \ncountry in a very detrimental way. Will we begin to finally take \naction? I have mentioned before that part of our trade problem is due \nto the incompetence of our trade negotiators. There is no other way to \ndescribe it. In the bilateral trade negotiation that occurred with \nChina about 5 years ago, our negotiators agreed that China would impose \n25-percent tariff on any American cars we tried to sell in China, and \nwe would impose only a 2.5-percent tariff on Chinese cars coming into \nthis country. That is fundamentally incompetent. I don't have any idea \nwho would have agreed to that, but it obviously pulls the rug out from \nour country's interests.\n  Now, we hear that General Motors has filed an action against Chery \nAutomobile Company in China for producing a car called the QQ, which \nGeneral Motors says was stolen from the production blueprints of \nGeneral Motors for one of their vehicles. And cars like these are \nheaded to our market soon, where the floodgates are wide open.\n  It all comes around. Incompetent negotiators on our side, piracy and \ncounterfeiting on their side, and unwillingness on our side to stand up \nfor this country's economic interests; and meanwhile we watch the \nexodus of American jobs and the sapping of our economic strength \nbecause of trade rules, trade agreements, and the lack of enforcement \nthat represents a basic unfairness to the producers and workers in this \ncountry.\n  So the question remains: When will our Government stand up for \nAmerican workers? When will our Government stand up for American \nproducers? I am talking about unfair trade, and about a Chinese \nGovernment that does nothing about it. It is past the time--long past--\nwhen our country should expect action. The citizens of our country \ndeserve a Government that does better for them in demanding fair trade.\n  So my colleague and I will introduce the resolution today. It is a \nsense of the Senate resolution that calls for a WTO case to be filed by \nour Trade Ambassador against China for gross violations of U.S. \nintellectual property rights.\n  There are so many examples of piracy and counterfeiting that I will \nnot begin to chronicle them, but I will say this: I know that many U.S. \ncompanies that are victimized by counterfeiting do complain mightily, \nbut they are also very nervous about an action being filed against this \nkind of stealing and cheating. It is time for them to decide whether \nthey are interested in solving the problem or just complaining about \nit. If they are interested in just complaining about being victims, \nthen they are going to ultimately be happy if the trade ambassador \ncontinues to do nothing. But in my judgment, it is a disservice to our \ncountry's interests at a time when we have the highest trade deficits \nin history, at a time when we are trying to hang on to American jobs, \ntrying to stem the flow\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nof American jobs outside of our country that are moving abroad in \nwholesale numbers. It is a disservice to our country's interests for us \nnot to stand up when we see unfair trade and take action against it.\n  That is why Senator Lindsey Graham and I have submitted this \nresolution today. That is why I hope in the coming days and weeks we \nwill be able to have an opportunity for the Senate to express itself. \nDoes the Senate believe we ought to have our trade ambassador file an \naction with the WTO, or does it not believe that? Does it believe this \nis a serious problem, or does it think it is simply an annoyance?\n  I hope most Senators will agree with Senator Graham and myself that \nthis is a very serious problem and one that deserves an opportunity to \nbe corrected.\n  Mr. President, let me now take a moment to congratulate Senator \nInhofe and Senator Jeffords for their work on the highway bill. This is \nbusiness that has been around the Senate for over 2 years. Most all of \nus wished--and I know no one more than the chairman and ranking \nmember--we had passed a highway bill a long while ago, but it has taken \nsome effort to get the kind of highway bill to the floor of the Senate \nthat they have been able to get here.\n  I very much appreciate their leadership. Is this bill perfect? No, \nbut it is an awfully good bill. Tomorrow, hopefully, when we finally \npass this legislation and get to conference, my hope is the conference \nwill have the wisdom to accept the Senate bill. There is a very big \ndifference between the Senate bill and the House bill. My thoughts go \nwith the chairman and ranking member and the conferees as they go to \nconference because this is a very important piece of legislation, and I \ncompliment them.\n  Finally, all the papers warned us this will be some momentous week \nwith respect to the so-called nuclear option and other issues. Just as \nI think all of us feel good about talking about a highway bill which is \nimportant and which strengthens this country, I think all of us would \nmuch prefer to be on the floor of the Senate talking about jobs, health \ncare, energy, and about all the other issues that are so important. My \nhope is at the end of this week, we will get back to those issues as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis comments on the highway bill. It is very significant. It probably \ncould very well be the most significant bill we will be voting on this \nyear.\n  If I can get the attention of the Senator from North Dakota, I have \nhad occasion to give four 1-hour China speeches on the floor of this \nSenate in response to the 2004 report to the Congress on the China \nEconomic and Security Commission. I do not know whether the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has read that yet, but I am going to call that up \nwith a resolution to implement the recommendations.\n  This is far more serious than even some of the issues the Senator \nfrom North Dakota mentioned in his excellent comments. If we look at \nhow China is now using up the resources we are depending upon, if we go \nto any of the countries in Africa, such as Nigeria and the coast of \nGuinea where they have huge reserves, we find the Chinese are building \nhuge stadiums, coliseums, and roads, and paying for it themselves to \nget the corner on those markets we will be dependent upon at some time. \nThey are dealing with countries such as Iran and exchanging nuclear \ntechnology.\n  I have been deeply concerned about the Chinese, not just in what they \nhave been able to do in terms of their nuclear capabilities, but also \ntheir conventional capabilities. It was in 1998 that GEN John Jumper \ncame forth and said something that startled a lot of people, but we \nknew it all the time, and that is the Russians are now making a strike \nvehicle, an SU-30, that is better than our strike vehicles, the F-15 \nand F-16. And then we find out China has purchased, in one purchase, \n240 of these vehicles. Their buildup of conventional forces and what \nthey are doing economically to this country is very disturbing to me. \nIt has to be addressed.\n\n  I hope the Senator from North Dakota will join us in trying to \nimplement the recommendations of this 2004 study--it was 4 years in the \nmaking--of the security and economic problems we are facing today as a \nresult of the Chinese buildup.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question. \nI agree with what Senator Inhofe has described with respect to the \nChinese, and I think he would agree neither of us is attempting to \npaint the Chinese as an adversary. Our intention is to make China a \nlong-term friend of our country, but for that to happen, the Chinese \nneed to do the right thing on trade and security issues.\n  I have described today with respect to piracy and counterfeiting some \nvery troubling issues, and Senator Inhofe knows and I know and others \nknow there are some very serious and very troubling issues with respect \nto international security. That is the movement of critical materials \nand technology to the wrong parts of the world, the purchase of that \ntechnology by the Chinese.\n  Our intention and our hope is to work with the Chinese. But I think a \ncountry cannot sit back and say, whatever happens happens, whatever you \nare doing, that is fine. You have to stand up to things you find \ntroubling. People take advantage of you if you let them take advantage \nof you. The same thing is true of countries, whether it is trade or \ninternational security. We have a responsibility to speak out with \nrespect to issues, whether it be the Chinese or others, when we think \nthey are an affront to our economic interests and our long-term \nnational interests.\n  I appreciate the comments of Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, this Commission worked 4 years. \nThey studied it from a security and economic standpoint. It was \nbipartisan and had every expert one can think of on the Commission. \nThey came out with some very strong recommendations. I would hope the \nSenator from North Dakota and the Senator from South Carolina might \nwant to expand what they are doing after reading the recommendations. \nMaybe we can join forces at a later date and have a resolution \nrecommending the adoption of the recommendations of this Commission.\n  Mr. President, again, we are on the highway bill. Senator Jeffords, \nthe ranking member of the EPW Committee, and I worked so well together \non this. I have to say before he makes his comments, there are a lot of \nprovisions in this bill that he likes better than I like, and there are \nprovisions I like better than he likes. That is what it is, that is how \nwe got to where we are today. It has been a great working relationship, \nand I anticipate we are going to be successful in getting this bill \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. \nWe are making progress. I know we are going to come out with a good \nbill. I look forward to working with him.\n  Today we begin the third week of debate on this very important \nlegislation. The bill before us, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and \nEfficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, better known as the \nhighway bill, is important to the Nation.\n  Too many Americans are sitting in traffic. The Texas Transportation \nInstitute, which ranks U.S. cities on the severity of their congestion, \ntells us in a recently released report that the average commuter in \nAtlanta sits in traffic for 67 hours each year; Washington, DC, for 69 \nhours; San Francisco, 72 hours; in Los Angeles, the average commuter \nsits in traffic for an astounding 93 hours each year. That is almost 4 \ndays each year wasted while sitting behind the wheel in traffic.\n  I would hope we could move away from our reliance on cars and make \nbetter use of public transit, but the reality is the number of cars on \nthe roads increases each year.\n  The bill before us will help cities in all of our States reduce \ncongestion by adding additional travel lanes, by building overpasses at \nbusy intersections, and using the best technology available to keep our \ntraffic moving.\n  We need this bill to make our roads safer. More than 42,000 Americans \nwill die in traffic accidents this year. The bill before us will help \nStates make\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\ndangerous intersections and curves safer by putting up better warning \nsigns, by building guardrails, and by building center median dividers.\n  This bill will make our roads safer by helping States build wider \nshoulders for disabled vehicles, by building rumble strips to slow down \ntraffic, and by building fences to discourage jaywalkers. This bill \nwill save lives.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman, Senator Inhofe, Senator Bond, and \nSenator Baucus for all their efforts in moving this bill forward. And \nwhile I am glad we expect to pass this bill tomorrow through the \nSenate, I remind all of my Senate colleagues we still have a lot of \nwork to do ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont brought up a very \ninteresting point when he said this bill will save lives. We have a \nwhole safety core in this bill. This was done in the Commerce \nCommittee's portion of the bill. That is why when we have a very \ncomplicated formula, one of the factors in the formula is the fatality \nrate on a per-capita basis of the States because that is one indicator \nthat there is a problem with surface transportation and a problem that \ncan be corrected with this bill.\n  We had called this bill the SAFETEA bill because it has the safety \nprovisions that will save lives. I can speak for my State of Oklahoma \nand many others that more than half the States are above this average \nin terms of fatalities. We need to do something about this. We cannot \ndo it if we extend it.\n  I do not think people realize that if we do not pass this bill by \ntomorrow and get it to conference and back from conference prior to the \ntermination of this sixth extension--and that is May 31--then we will \nhave to get another extension. If we get another extension, we will be \ndoing the same thing we have done over the last 2 years with \nextensions, and that is continue it as it was under the 7-year-old TEA-\n21. There have been a lot of changes since then.\n  All those Senators representing donor States, such as my State of \nOklahoma--I can remember when Oklahoma would only get back 75 percent \nof what they sent in, and now we have made improvements. The bill \npassed 7 years ago, TEA-21, brought up the minimum to 90.5 percent. If \nwe had passed the bill we had last year at a higher funding level, that \nwould have been 95 percent.\n  In other words, every donor State or every State would get back 95 \npercent of what they sent in. That would be better than the 90.5 today. \nAt this reduced funded level, it will be about 92 percent.\n  The point is this: If we do not pass a bill, it is not going to \nhappen. We are not going to have any relief for the donor States. The \nsafety core program Senator Jeffords talked about--he is right, it is a \nlife-or-death issue. If we do not pass this bill, people are going to \ndie. People are going to die because we don't have any safety \nprovisions in the extension so none of those would be adopted.\n\n  We have streamlining provisions. I think we all hear stories about \nhow some of our antiquated rules, regulations, and statutes have made \nit almost impossible to get roads built and have made them cost \nsomething close to 15 percent more. We have streamlining provisions and \nreviews of this process in the bill, but if we don't pass the bill we \nwill be operating under an extension, and that is not going to happen.\n  I mentioned earlier today this all started with President Eisenhower, \nactually Major Eisenhower, back in World War II when he realized he was \nunable to move troops and equipment around the United States to \nprosecute World War II as well as he should have been able to. So when \nhe became President, he decided to have this National Highway System \nand we passed this bill. We have been operating the same way since \nthen, almost 50 years now, raising money to pay for our infrastructure \nin America the same as we did 50 years ago.\n  We have done two things. First, we are giving the States the ability \nto be creative. I know a lot of people think no decision is a good \ndecision if it is made in Washington. I have learned, after having been \nin State government and mayor of a city, that the closer you get to the \npeople, the better the decision is and the more accurate it is. We \nrecognize this. We allow the States not just to do things in general \nbut also to come up with creative funding mechanisms, where they \nexercise the maximum of the private sector involvement in order to get \nthese problems resolved.\n  In this bill we hope to pass, we even have a national commission to \nexplore how to fund transportation in the future. This is something \nthat will not happen if it is an extension. So we need to have this. \nThat is why it is important.\n  We have the Safe Routes to School provision. I could probably name 20 \ndifferent provisions of this very large bill, but this is one that \nseveral Members had a great passion for. I know several Members in the \nother body, as well as Senator Jeffords, were concerned about the Safe \nRoutes to School provision. This is something that will save young \npeople's lives, but if we do not do it and instead operate under an \nextension, we will not have that provision in there.\n  Anyone who has been in business and who has watched and waited, knows \nwhat you have to go through to get contracts, how you plan the \nfinancing, and that when you get the labor pool and your resources, in \norder to get the very most from them, you have to plan years in \nadvance. The problem with the extension is it could be a 2-month \nextension or a 1-month extension or it could be 6 months. They are out \nthere trying to address serious problems such as we have in Oklahoma \nwith our bridges.\n  By the way, we have had several losses of life in my State of \nOklahoma--two in the fairly recent past--due to bridges crumbling and \nkilling people. So we need to correct this problem. We cannot do it \nunless we pass the bill.\n  A lot of the States are complaining right now, the border States--\nCalifornia, Arizona, Florida, Texas--about the fact that, because of \nNAFTA, a lot of excess traffic is going through their States. We want \nto do something about that and we are doing it. We have a borders \nprovision in this bill that gives them some of that relief. We will not \nbe able to do that if we do not pass the bill. It is not going to work \nwith an extension.\n  Right now we have chokepoints such as the canals we have in Oklahoma. \nPeople do not realize they are navigable. I remember many years ago \nwhen I was in the State senate, in order to try to get the point across \nto people that we have a navigable channel that goes all the way to my \nhometown of Tulsa, OK, or Catoosa, and in order to show this we managed \nto take a World War II submarine, the USS Batfish, from Texas, in the \nboneyard, and moved it all the way to Oklahoma, and it is sitting in \nMuskogee to tell that story.\n  The point is, if we have channel traffic activity, we have railroads, \nwe have air, and we have surface, this provides chokepoints. We address \nthe chokepoints as a major part of this bill.\n  The last and maybe most important thing is we have firewalls. When a \nperson goes to the pump and pays Federal excise taxes when they buy a \ngallon of fuel, that person expects that money will go to improving \nhighways and go to transportation. That is a no-brainer. That is what \nis supposed to happen. That is what we told the people is going to \nhappen. But that is not what is happening. The insatiable appetite of \nmembers of an elected body to spend somebody else's money is something \nwe have to deal with on a regular basis. So we have a trust fund and \npeople pay money into the trust fund, but every time they have a chance \nto steal money out of the trust fund, they do.\n  What the Finance Committee tried to do, and I applaud them, they have \nput this together so they cannot do this that easily. For example, \nsomeone was complaining about the way this finance package is working. \nThey said we have this program where we have hybrid cars so we give \nthem financial advantages to encourage them so we can look out for the \nenvironment and save money on fuel and not aggravate the already \nexisting energy shortage problem we have in America.\n\n  What do they do? They give them that money. But they take it out of \nthe trust fund. It has nothing to do with\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\nthat. This is environmental policy, economic policy, but it is paid for \nby the trust fund. This is wrong.\n  In 1998, when President Clinton was President, he had a balanced \nbudget amendment. He was going to balance the budget. But a lot of that \nmoney, $8 billion, was out of the trust fund to go toward the deficit. \nAt that time I voted against it. All my conservative friends said, You \nwant to do something about the deficit, don't you? But I said, Not on \nthe back of the highway trust fund.\n  The point I want to make is there have been raids on the trust fund, \nand not just the highway trust fund but others. In this legislation we \nhope to pass tomorrow, we have firewalls built in so they can no longer \nraid the highway trust fund. If there is no other reason to pass this \nbill, this would be enough of a reason.\n  There will have been some complaints concerning our approach. There \nare two different basic approaches that one might take, putting \ntogether something such as the allocation of money that goes to the \nStates. One is used in the other body. I served 8 years on the \nTransportation Committee in the House of Representatives. I know how \nthat works over there. Frankly, it is more on projects than anything \nelse. Not that there is anything wrong with that, except it would seem \nto me, and it seems to the majority of people in this body, better if \nyou allocate on formula an amount of money then that goes back to the \nStates and those States determine how to use it. In the State of \nOklahoma we have eight transport districts, eight transportation \ncommissioners. They sit down in a room. Certainly they know more about \nthe needs in Oklahoma than we know here in Washington, DC. So we \nallocate the money in accordance with a lot of factors.\n  We have low-income States as a factor. If you are in a State such as \nWyoming or Montana that has a low population density, yet you have to \nhave roads to get across it, that is a consideration. If you have a \nhigh fatality rate, as we mentioned before, that is a consideration. We \nwant to consider the number of interstate lane miles they have, the age \nof those, the traffic on those--all these things are factors that are \nin a formula. It might be politically a lot smarter to line up 60 \nSenators and say this is what we are going to do in your States and \nforget about all the rest of them and just do projects. We could do \nthem. It is perfectly legal. We elected not to do that. We elected to \ndo it the hard way with a complicated formula, and by the way, that is \none nobody likes and that is probably a pretty good indication it is a \npretty good formula. There are things I don't like. There are areas \nwhere I don't believe Oklahoma is being treated fairly. I am sure every \none of the 100 Senators in this body can say the same thing.\n  We are still waiting now. We will be having a vote. We are 2 hours \naway from the vote. So we will wait for those to come down.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 706 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  On behalf of Senator Snowe, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment 706.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 706 to amendment No. 605.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To specify which portions of Interstate Routes 95, 195, 295, \n  and 395 in the State of Maine are subject to certain vehicle weight \n                               limiatins)\n\n         On page 410, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18__. VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITATIONS IN MAINE.\n\n         Section 127(a) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended in the last sentence by striking ``respect to that \n     portion'' and all that follows through ``New Hampshire State \n     line,'' and inserting ``respect to Interstate Routes 95, 195, \n     295, and 395 in the State of Maine,''.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I observe Senator Snowe is en route and \nunless someone else wants to gain access to the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me reserve the right to object and ask the Senator if \nhe would amend his unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as \nin morning business. However, if a Member comes with an amendment--\nsince the cutoff is 25 minutes away--the Senator agrees not to speak \nfor more than a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I very much appreciate the work of the Senators from \nVermont and Oklahoma, and if we have a Senator, I will wrap up within a \ncouple minutes of time at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Disclosure of CEO Pension Funds\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is a time when millions of our \nfamilies are walking on an economic tightrope. I will talk for a couple \nof minutes about the double standard that applies with respect to the \npension rights of our workers. When we look at what is happening today \nin America with the workers--for example, at United Airlines, we saw it \nat Enron, as well--the pensions of our workers are in a free fall, but \nthe pensions of the executives, the CEOs, are safe and secure in a tidy \nlockbox. I don't think that is right.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I will do everything I \ncan to change it. I have been trying to figure out exactly how much \nmoney the CEO of any major company is receiving in this country in his \nor her pension package. This is a very difficult exercise. It is sort \nof like trying to find a needle in multiple haystacks.\n  To begin the effort to try to figure out what these executives are \npaid, I was first instructed to call the Department of Labor to obtain \na copy of a company's annual report of employee benefit plans. This is \nwhat is called the form 5500. After I did that, I was told to contact \nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to get hold of the \ncompany's 10(k) filing for the year in question.\n  Armed with these two documents, you then have to figure out the \namount of unfunded liability for all of the groups the company pays, \nand then subtract that number from a line item in the 10(k) form. Even \nwhen you go this route, what you have is, at best, a rough estimate \nthat requires a background in pension legislation, an intimate \nknowledge of SEC requirements, and a degree in calculus.\n  It seems to me that American workers, at a time when they are seeing \ntheir pensions shellacked--we saw it at Enron in Oregon where we had \nworkers who used to have close to $1 million, and their private pension \nfunds now have $3,000 or $4,000. They deserve better than to have to \ntry to figure out, through a bevy of forms and stock options, deferred \naccounts, years of service calculations, equations--one form of paper \nafter another--they deserve better than to try to have to sort all that \nout to see what the executives are making in their pensions while they \nare seeing their pensions evaporate in front of their eyes.\n  Senator Kennedy has done very good work in terms of trying to sort \nthis out so as to determine when a company tries to unload their \nresponsibilities at a time of crisis.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, should do more. \nWhat the Senate ought to be doing at a time when we are seeing our \nworkers suffer and their pensions disappear, the Senate ought to make \nsure that shareholders and the public can find out exactly and \nconveniently what these executives will be getting upon their \nretirement.\n  I am proposing a bit of sunshine come into these executive pension \nlockboxes. Let's do for the workers whose pensions are being offered up \nfor the CEOs, a bit of justice. Let's also do it for taxpayers because \nwith every company that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation steps \nin to rescue, the agency's deficit grows. From an estimated $23 billion \ntoday, it is anticipated to grow to an expected $40 billion with the \ntakeover of additional airlines.\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\n  We are seeing our workers sacrifice. The question is, What are they \nsacrificing for? Apparently, on the basis of the news in the last \ncouple of weeks, some of these workers are sacrificing in order to fund \nthe retirement packages for the CEOs. That is not my view of making \ntough decisions together. That is not my view of coming together and \ndealing with a tough problem in an equitable way. It is a double \nstandard.\n  If you ask the average person on the street if they knew, for \nexample, that the worker was going to be at risk with their pensions \nwhile the enormous pension of the CEO was protected, those workers \nwouldn't have any idea that was the case. They would say the same \nrules apply to everyone.\n\n  We are seeing they don't. Look particularly at the pension \narrangement for the CEO at United. Three months before United Airlines \nfiled for bankruptcy in 2002, the company placed $4.5 million in a \nspecial bankruptcy protected trust for the CEO. So right now we are \nseeing the workers of United Airlines face the devastation of their \npensions literally disappearing. They look at this double standard. The \npeople at the top do not have to sweat it. That is not right. We ought \nto have one set of pension rules for everyone in this country. It ought \nto be based on disclosure and transparency.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee I am going to do \neverything I can in this session, on a bipartisan basis, to get this \npassed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for his excellent \nstatement. I offer to work with the Senator to see if we can bring \nabout some action to take care of those problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since we are \nright to the 4 o'clock deadline, that the managers' amendment proposed \nby myself and the ranking member be introduced at a time after 4 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there are many people to thank in what \nhas been a long 3-year process.\n  First, Chairman Inhofe. It has been an honor and a privilege to work \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma. He has always been fair and \nconsiderate, and I enjoy our friendship. We have a couple weeks, \npossibly months, more to go to get this bill done. I look forward to \nworking with him.\n  Senator Bond also has been wonderful to work with. He brings spirit, \nenthusiasm to all his work, and a lot of humor, and I appreciate our \nclose working relationship. He is a good friend.\n  Senator Baucus, my colleague on this side, is a very close friend and \nhas been a great addition to the team and this process. The Senator \nfrom Montana is a true legislator. He knows how to get things done. \nWithout him, I don't think we would be as far as we are here today. It \nis an honor to work with such an intelligent and fair-minded Senator.\n  There are many staff to acknowledge, also. I have always told my \nstaff director, Ken Connolly, that in order to succeed in his job, he \nneeded to hire a strong team and to hire staff smarter than me and him. \nWell, in this case, it wasn't difficult. Anyway, let me run through a \nfew staff members who have helped the cause of moving this bill.\n  Senator Inhofe's staff: Ruth VanMark, Andrew Wheeler, James O'Keefe, \nNathan Richmond, Angie Giancarlo, Greg Murrill, John Shanahan, Marty \nHall, and others; Senator Bond's staff: Ellen Stein, John Stoody, \nHeideh Shahmoradi; Senator Baucus's staff: Kathy Ruffalo returned to \nthe Senate just this past spring to help us complete this legislation. \nShe has been a fantastic addition to that team.\n  On my staff, there are many people to thank, including JoEllen Darcy, \nCatharine Ransome, Margaret Wetherald, Chris Miller, and MaryFrancis \nRepko.\n  However, there are four key people who need to be acknowledged and \nthanked for bringing this bill to us today. Malia Somerville has been \nthe glue that kept our team together; Alison Taylor, the best chief \ncounsel of any committee in either body of Congress; J.C. Sandberg, the \nonly staffer who really knows what is in the bill, and the hardest \nworker in the Senate; and Ken Connolly, my staff director, who has \nbuilt such a good team. To him I owe a great deal for the work that has \nbeen done.\n  All of these staff members, I am sure, are looking forward to final \npassage tomorrow. They are even more eager, I am sure, to go to \nconference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also am going to thank staff. This was \nnot easy. We have endured 3 years now. Ruth VanMark has been with me 18 \nyears and has all of the background in the other body in the \nTransportation Committee. They will all be glad to get a good night's \nsleep at some time. We go from here into conference.\n  I suggest that we be aware that our 4 o'clock deadline has passed \nnow. We have exempted the managers' amendment so it can be done at a \nlater time. We are now down from 173 amendments to 7, so we have 7 to \nbe voted on between now and tomorrow. At the conclusion of that, we \nwill then vote on final passage and send it to conference. I hope \nleadership is working on both sides of the aisle to appointing \nconferees and that we can get it to conference and get it back.\n  I keep responding that I believe we can do this within the May 31 \ndeadline and avoid an extension. We can show that things can happen in \nan expeditious way in the Senate, whether people believe it or not. If \nwe get this passed tomorrow, we would have time to do it, if we are \ncommitted to making it a reality.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, earlier this week, I offered an \namendment, which was passed unanimously, to eliminate the ability to \ntoll existing interstate highways. I did this because I believe in \nusing our tax dollars that we collect to support the Federal interstate \nhighway program. But we ought to do it fairly.\n  The majority of the highway system was designed in the 1950s to meet \nthe needs of the westward expansion of a rapidly growing nation. Today, \nwe face different needs. For example, new areas of population growth, \nespecially along the southern tier, require new infrastructure, and \nalso with the trade coming from NAFTA, we are seeing an even more \nincreasing load that adds to the transportation burdens of our border \nregions.\n  Strong trade partnerships with Mexico and Canada have provided great \nbenefits for us, but the resulting traffic is damaging the highway \nnetwork in my State and others, such as Arizona and Michigan.\n  Most of the goods in our economy ride on our Nation's highways. In \nlarge part, over the past 50 years, the Federal highway aid program has \nassisted the States in producing one of the world's finest highway \nnetworks.\n  To meet our needs, Congress must reauthorize surface transportation \nprograms this year. States are responsible for converting the resources \nthis legislation provides into infrastructure that allows traffic to \nmove efficiently, and we want and need to undertake that construction.\n  My major concern with the Federal highway program is that Texas has \nbeen a donor State for 50 years, contributing billions to other States \nto enable them to build their highway network. As a strong adherent of \na National Transportation Safety Board system, I understand that large \nStates, such as Texas, should assist smaller and rural States with \ntheir transportation needs because we all profit from the comprehensive \nhighway network. What concerns me is the level of support Texas has \nbeen forced to provide to other States.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Texas and other donor States \nreceived\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nas little as 76-percent rate of return on what our taxpayers send to \nWashington. With the 1998 bill, TEA-21, Texas's rate of return rose to \n90.5 percent in the formula program.\n  This program produced real dollars. From 1994 to 2003, Texas \ncontributed $20 billion to the highway trust fund and received $18 \nbillion in return. If not for other donor State Senators, such as the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Oklahoma, and improving the \nrate of return, Texas would have received only $15.8 billion. The \nadditional $2.4 billion has been critical for us to meet our \ntransportation needs. However, Texas has still given $2 billion to \nother States over this period.\n  States such as Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado, and Michigan are \ncontributing more and more, and we are the States that need the most \nnew infrastructure to handle the greatest population growth. In \naddition, most of the donor States are border States with unique needs \nresulting from trade.\n  Texas has more than 300,000 highway miles, the most of any State in \nour Nation. Texas highways are almost 10 percent of the national total. \nEighty percent of NAFTA traffic travels through my home State of Texas. \nBut while the entire Nation benefits from the resulting commerce, Texas \nbears the brunt of maintenance and upkeep on our highways.\n  In 2003, more than 4 million trucks, hauling 18 billion pounds of \ncargo, entered from Mexico through 24 commercial border-crossing \nfacilities. More than 3 million of those trucks, or 68 percent, entered \nthrough Texas. In addition, 90 million personal vehicles from Mexico \nalso travel through the southwest border States.\n\n  The donor States are the fastest growing States in America and are \nmost responsible for the growth in the highway trust fund. Ironically, \nthe formula in this bill offers the least relief to the States where \ncities are developing most rapidly.\n  In 1998, Texas accounted for 7 percent of the highway trust fund \nreceipts. In 2004, it rose to 9 percent, and during this bill, it may \ntop 10 percent. In other words, we are paying a larger and larger \nshare.\n  The formula in the bill reported out of committee created a floor \nguaranteeing every State at least 110 percent of the total cash it \nreceived under TEA-21. To limit costs, no State may receive more than a \ncertain percentage, 130 percent in year 1, of the TEA-21.\n  So even if a State's contribution to the trust fund grows in excess \nof 130 percent, it hits the ceiling and it hits pretty fast on growing \nStates such as Texas, capping our funding.\n  Using cash as the measuring stick rather than the percentage a State \ncontributes to the trust fund ignores whether a State is growing or \nshrinking, and it ignores whether it is giving more to the fund or \nless. This methodology hurts our growing States, and it helps the donee \nStates which are contributing less to the trust fund.\n  For example, Pennsylvania's share of contributions during TEA-21 was \n4.1 percent, but it is expected to contribute just 3.9 percent of the \ntrust fund during SAFETEA. It does not make sense to guarantee an \nincrease in cash when a State is contributing less.\n  The formula in the pending substitute is made worse. Not only does it \nincrease spending for the bill by $11 billion, it increases the floor \nto 115 percent. So Pennsylvania is now guaranteed to receive 15 percent \nmore cash than it received from Washington in 1998, even though it is \ncontributing a smaller proportion of the trust fund. Superdonor States, \nsuch as Texas, move up to an average return of only 91.3 percent.\n  While this is an improvement, it is not enough. The committee tells \nme I should like this legislation because while total spending grows 30 \npercent, Texas will see a 37-percent dollar increase compared to 6 \nyears ago. However, Texas's increase has little to do with the formula \nand instead is the result of Texas buying more gas and paying more \ntaxes into the highway trust fund.\n  It is fair, if a State's contribution is growing faster than the \naverage, that it should receive higher than the average in return. This \nbill does not give Texas the resources to adequately expand our \ninfrastructure at the rate the traffic is growing on the NAFTA corridor \nof Mexico and around our fast-growing cities. If Texas received all of \nthe money that we contribute to the fund, this disparity would be \nreduced.\n  I believe the ability to pay for highway project needs with their own \ncontribution exists for most States, with very few exceptions, \nparticularly in the West, and funding increases should be based on \ngrowth and need rather than tradition.\n  I am not suggesting that we cut off aid to other States altogether, \nbut I do think we can reduce this disparity in the current donor-donee \nsystem. It has been too large for too long and unfairly limits the \nability of States to benefit from their tax dollars.\n  We all want the Federal highway system to be good throughout our \nNation, and that may require some donor status, but donating almost 10 \ncents of every dollar is not necessary, and it is not fair.\n  I recognize the needs of donee States vary widely, but we have never \nbefore created this special class of donor State to carry the heavier \nload, and I hope we will not do it when this bill is finished.\n  At a minimum, we should all receive at least 92 percent in year 1 \nrather than having to wait until the final year to get to that level.\n  I have worked with the chairman for a long time trying to come up \nwith a formula that would help mitigate the border States' particular \nneeds because we are border corridors and most of us are growing \nStates. I have come up with a lot of alternatives. None of them have \nbeen acceptable to the chairman and the ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  It is my hope that as this bill goes out of the Senate, which it \nwill, we will be able to work in conference for some more fair \nallocation that is based on a State's needs, a State's taxing, and a \nState's efforts. It is only fair that the States that are growing, that \nare putting more money into the highway trust fund should get some \nbonus for doing that to help them with the needs they have.\n  I think we have gone in the wrong direction, and I certainly hope we \nwill come much closer to a fair allocation. I am not saying there \nshould be 100 percent, but 91.3 percent is a mighty price for Texans to \npay when it is growing at such a fast rate and has the most highway \nmiles of any State in our Nation.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and the ranking member as \nthis bill does sail out of here. I cannot possibly support it in this \ncurrent configuration. I still hold out hope that if we can come up to \nthe 92-cent level, we would be in a much better position to feel good \nabout this legislation, helping all of our States instead of just the \ndonee States. And I hope the door will still be open to helping all of \nthe States feel good about this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas for \nher comments. I know the depth of her interest and the passion she has \nfor doing everything she can for her State.\n  I have said several times on the floor of the Senate how difficult it \nis to come up with formula approaches. It is difficult. It is a tough \nthing to do. There are so many factors that go into it, such as the \ninterstate lane miles, miles traveled, principal arteries, cost to \nrepair and replace deficient highway bridges, weight nonattainment \nmaintenance areas, low-population States, donor States, donee States, \nfast-growing States. Again, it would have been so much easier to do it \nthe way it has been done before and the way we have done it, actually, \nin the other body just by making a political list, and when we get to \nthe 60 votes saying: All right, that is it, the other 40 of you guys, \nit is your problem.\n  We try not to do that. There is not one State represented in this \nSenate that cannot complain about some parts of the formula. We have \ntried hard. When we passed the bill out of committee, starting in 2005 \nthrough 2009 in Texas, 90.5 percent was all the way to 2009, and then \nit was 92 percent. Now in 2006, 2007, 2008 at 91 percent and going to \n92 percent.\n  Of course, the Senator is right that Texas is a very large State, so \nit represents very large amounts of money. But it is a half percent \nmore in each of those 3 years of 2006, 2007, 2008. We have\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\ntried to do it. We tried to work with each one of the States.\n  As I say, I know her depth of interest. We spent many hours trying to \nwork out variances.\n  The problem we always have is nothing happens in a vacuum. If we take \ncare of a problem in Texas, then that aggravates a problem in \nPennsylvania.\n  So formulas are tough. They are tough to deal with politically. They \nare tough to deal with rationally. I think we have tried to do the very \nbest we can. With that, I am glad to yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I do \nunderstand exactly what has happened to the bill. I do understand the \ndifficulty. The Senator is responsible for getting the number of votes \nhe has to have to get the bill out of the Senate, and my colleague has \nthose votes.\n  I do hope, in conference, he will look at the border corridor issue \nwhich, when the bill came out of committee, was above the line, outside \nthe formula, and did give some of the help to these fast-growing border \nStates that have the NAFTA traffic coming in directly, which then fans \nout to the rest of the country where it is dissipated. I hope my \ncolleague will take that into account.\n  I was the one who authored the border corridor idea. It really did \nhelp when it was, as we discussed, above the line. I just hope, as you \ndo fix particular problems for other States--whether they be pass-\nthrough States or other types of designations--you will look at the \nborder corridor issue, which would help both northern corridor States \nsuch as Michigan and southern border States such as California, \nArizona, and Texas. It is still going to make us very big donor States, \nbut it would mitigate it, to a great extent, because that is where our \nbiggest problem is. We have three border corridors and two of them are \nclogged completely, all the way through Texas. That is not helpful to \nanyone.\n  I don't want to toll a highway that is already in place. We have \nspoken on that. But I think we need to try to look at that issue in \nconference--if you can do something that would mitigate that particular \nproblem.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is a very reasonable request the Senator from Texas is \nmaking. I observe we talked about this ``above the line/below the \nline.'' We plowed this furrow several times. However, when you get in \nconference, there are things that can be done. I can assure the Senator \nthe State of Texas will be well represented in conference. I am sure we \nwill hear proposals, and there will be some give and take in all areas.\n  Of course, we will be dealing with another whole body over there, so \nit is hard to predict what will come out. But we will try to get to it \nexpeditiously and see that Texas--as I say, they will be well \nrepresented. I think we all understand that.\n  We are now waiting. We are, as I said before, down to about seven \namendments. There could be a germaneness problem with some of them. \nSome of them could be worked out. My guess is, other than the managers' \namendment, which Senator Jeffords and I will be propounding, there are \nprobably, realistically, maybe four votes that we will be having. That \nis my guess what it will be. We have announced already we are going to \nhave one tonight at 5:30, which is just an hour and 6 minutes from now.\n  After that, we invite Senators to stay here and debate their \namendments. I think we probably will not have votes until tomorrow \nmorning. We can debate these amendments. I think by that time there may \nbe as many as three or four amendments that would be appropriate for us \nto debate. Then we can get on to the final passage.\n  As it is right now, we have plenty of time tonight. We have another \nhour and 5 minutes before the vote. I am sure Senator Jeffords joins me \nin making this request: Members who are authors of these amendments, \nthey know who they are, come down. We are open for business. Come down \nand debate your amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President I will briefly talk about a provision in \nthe Commerce title of the highway bill. We have the Commerce title, \nBanking, Finance, and EPW title. Section 7370 creates a hazardous \nmaterial cooperative research program. It authorizes $2 million a year \nfor each year, including 2006 through 2009, for hazardous material \ntransport research projects on topics that are ``not adequately \naddressed by existing Federal private sector research programs.''\n  The section goes on to require that at least one of the studies \n``provide an assessment of the need and feasibility of substituting \nless lethal substances than toxic inhalation hazards in the \nmanufacturing process.''\n  I oppose the provision and hope it can be removed in conference. I \nwill be actively opposing it in conference to see it is removed. There \nis no such language in the House portion.\n  The concept at the heart of this provision is called inherently safer \ntechnology and it is not about transportation but a longstanding wish \nof some of the environmental extremist communities. The EPW has spent \nthe last 4 years working on the issue of chemical security and this \nissue of FIST has arisen several times in the context of the security \ndebate. The idea of inherently safer technology predates September 11. \nIt was around long before the tragedy of September 11. It has never \nbeen about security. It has never been about transportation. It is a \nconcept that dates back more than a decade when the extremist \nenvironmental community--Greenpeace and others--was seeking bans on \nchlorine, the chemical used to purify our Nation's water. After \nSeptember 11 they decided to play upon the fears of the Nation and \nrepackage FIST as a solution to potential security problems. Now they \nseek to repackage it again as a transportation issue, which it is not.\n  This issue is not about security. It is not about transportation. It \nis about trying to find a research justification for giving the Federal \nGovernment authority to mandate that a private company change its \nmanufacturing process or the chemicals they use. The study's parameters \nreveal this intent when it states ``substituting less lethal substances \nthan toxic inhalation hazards in the manufacturing process.''\n  There are entire books written about the subject of FIST by various \ngroups, including current efforts by the Center for Chemical Process \nSafety and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers to update their \n1996 ``gold book'' on the subject. These are chemical process experts. \nThe Federal Government is not.\n  I do not believe mandatory FIST is good for our Nation's security. \nBesides that, it is not a transportation issue. If it is something you \nwant to debate in the Senate as a freestanding bill, do it that way, \nbut do not sneak around behind and throw little a part into this bill \nthrough the Commerce title that has nothing to do with transportation.\n  I mention this and anything else we find in the bill that perhaps we \nhave overlooked that has nothing to do with transportation, we will \nmake every effort to make sure it gets out when it is in conference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will speak on another subject, but as \nper an agreement with the Senator from Oklahoma, should someone else \ncome to the Senate floor and wish to speak on the subject of the bill \nat hand, I will yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Option\n\n  Mr. President, I will change the subject to the subject on everyone's \nmind other than the transportation bill, probably more on our minds \nthan just about anything else, and that is the upcoming nuclear option. \nRight now, we are on the precipice of a constitutional crisis. We are \nabout to step into the abyss. I want to talk for a few minutes why we \nare on that precipice and why we are looking into the abyss.\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\n  Let me first ask a fundamental question: What is the crisis that \ncalls for the undoing of two centuries of tradition? What is the crisis \nthat requires such an unprecedented parliamentary sleight of hand? What \nis the crisis that calls for a response that is so controversial and \nextreme that Senator Lott coined the term ``nuclear option'' to \ndescribe it?\n  Is it that President Bush has had the terrible misfortune of having \nonly 95 percent of his judicial nominees confirmed? That is, 208 out of \n218? It can't be that. Every President should have the luck of George \nBush and have so many nominees confirmed to the bench. I might also \nadd, in part because of this high confirmation rate, court vacancies at \nthe end of last session were at their lowest rate in 14 years. So it \ncan't be either vacancies on the bench or overwhelming rejection of the \nPresident's nominees because neither is the fact.\n  Is it that the Constitution, as my strict constructionist friends \nacross the aisle like to argue, requires an up-or-down vote on every \njudicial nominee? Is that the crisis? No, Senator Frist acknowledged as \nmuch last week when he conceded, after a question from Senator Byrd, \nthat there was no such language in the Constitution.\n  In fact, it is a great irony that those on the other side of the \naisle who are seeking this nuclear option in the name of strict \nconstruction are being activists, as they call it, because they are \nexpanding the Constitution, reading in their own views in the \nConstitution when the very words do not exist.\n  It is my understanding that is what the Constitution-in-exile school \nholds; that is, what the strict constructive school of Justice Scalia \nholds. If the words are not in the Constitution, you do not read them \nin.\n  Is the word ``filibuster'' in the Constitution? No. Are the words \n``majority vote,'' ``up-or-down vote'' in the Constitution? Absolutely \nnot. That is not the crisis, either.\n  Let me ask again, Why are we on the brink of destroying what is good \nin the Senate and destroying whatever is left of good will in the \nSenate? Is it that the public, in high dudgeon, is demanding this \nradical rule change? Are Republican Senators merely doing their jobs as \nlegislators, responding to a generalized public calling for the \nabolition of the filibuster? Clearly not.\n  It is not the American people at large who are demanding detonation \nof the nuclear option. Indeed, in poll after poll, first, people say \nthey do not know what it is when asked, and then when it is described \nto them, the people have made clear they believe the filibuster is an \nimportant check and balance to be preserved, not vaporized. Most \nrecently, for instance, according to a Time magazine poll, the American \npeople are against the nuclear option 59 to 28.\n\n  Nor is it rank-and-file Republicans who are clamoring for an end to \nfilibusters on judges. A Wall Street Journal poll showed 41 percent of \nRepublicans support giving the Democrats the right to keep the \nfilibuster going. They, like most Americans, are wondering, and rightly \nso, why we are talking more about the nuclear option in the Senate than \nabout nuclear proliferation in North Korea.\n  Nor is it the business establishment--clearly, usually, a \nconservative constituency--that is calling for a change in the rules. \nTo the contrary, the business community wants the Senate to get busy \naddressing important issues they believe will get the economy back on \ntrack. The Chamber of Commerce and many other business groups have \neither publicly or privately stated their opposition to invoking the \nnuclear option.\n  Is it the ``gray heads'' of the conservative movement who are calling \nfor this? No. By and large, elder statesmen from the conservative \nmovement are not demanding this radical move. Many, including such \nleading figures as George Will and Ken Starr, have criticized the \nnuclear option and urge restraint--so have Senators Armstrong and \nMcClure, hardly beacons of a liberal influence in this country or in \nthe Senate.\n  So if there is no constitutional requirement, and there is no vacancy \ndisaster, and there is no public clamoring for the extinguishing of the \nminority rights to filibuster, why are we here? Why are we on the edge \nof the abyss? Why are we--at least the majority--being motivated to \nplunge this Senate, this city, and this country into a constitutional \ncrisis, into an end of what is ever left of comity in the Senate, which \nis the body that has at least some comity left?\n  Well, let me tell you why I fear we are here. We are here, I fear, \nbecause the nuclear option is being pushed largely by the radioactive \nrhetoric of a small band of radicals who hold in their hands the \npolitical fortunes of the President and a minority of sitting Senators \nwho would be President. The once conservative Republican Party has, I \nbelieve, been hijacked by activist, radical, rightwing ideologues who \nare exerting too much influence over Senators.\n  These ideologues have taken to intimidating and even threatening the \nindependent judiciary. They have, among other things, compared judges \nto the KKK and claimed that the independent judiciary is worse than al-\nQaida. Unfortunately, these extreme groups are exerting \ndisproportionate influence on certain Senators from the other side \nwho--because of pure political pressure--are proceeding at pace with \nthe nuclear option.\n  There is, to be sure, much irony and hypocrisy in this dance. It is \nparticularly perverse that many of my colleagues purport to preserve \nthe principle of majority rule by doing the bidding of a distinct, but \npolitically powerful, minority.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to finish my remarks, and then I would be \nhappy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. VITTER. OK, but I say to the Senator, I understood you had been \ngiven the floor until someone came to the floor to speak on the highway \nbill. About how much longer?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I probably will need no more than 5 minutes, if that is \nOK with my colleague.\n  Mr. VITTER. OK, that will be fine.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that very much.\n  It seems the only conservatives who are strongly in favor of the \nnuclear option--who are pushing it--are some Senators who might wish to \nrun for President.\n  Now, to hear the tirades of those demanding the nuclear option is \nspine tingling.\n  Conservative activist James Dobson compared the nine Supreme Court \nJustices to the Ku Klux Klan's men in robes.\n  Pat Robertson said the threat posed by judges was ``more serious than \na few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings.''\n  Conservative lawyer-author Edwin Vieira said Justice Kennedy should \nbe impeached and invoked Joseph Stalin's murderous slogan, which he \nsaid worked very well for him:\n\n       [W]henever he ran into difficulty: ``no man, no problem.''\n\n  Do we hear any denunciation of this inflammatory rhetoric? No. \nDenunciations of heinous characterizations of independent judges? No.\n  Instead, Senators--some maybe with Presidential ambitions--are \nkowtowing to these extremists. When the Democratic Party kowtowed to \nextremists on the left, we paid the price. It is a lesson I think we \nhave learned. It is a lesson that ought to be learned by my colleagues \non the other side.\n  Now, let's try to examine the record. And this is the No. 1 point I \nwant to make. Look what conservatives are saying, conservatives not \nrunning for President or running for office, but people whose \nconservative credentials go unchallenged. These are not moderates. \nThese are not liberals. They are true conservatives, and a chorus of \ntheir voices is speaking out against the nuclear option.\n\n  True conservatives, independent thinkers who are not under pressure \nfrom the likes of Tony Perkins and Pat Robertson and others, have \neloquently made the case against the nuclear option. These \nconservatives have two things in common: They were strongly in favor of \nGeorge Bush for President, and they are strongly against the nuclear \noption.\n  Here are some of the names. Many leading conservative commentators \nand thinkers are against it, such as George Will and Kenneth Starr. \nMany former Republican Senators are against it, such as Senator \nArmstrong, Senator McClure, Senator Wallop, Senator Simpson. Many \neditorial boards\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nthat endorsed George Bush for President are against it--the Dallas \nMorning News.\n  I recognize that in these polarized times maybe the words of a \nDemocratic Senator from New York will have little sway across the \naisle, but what about the words of some icons and leaders of the \nconservative movement?\n  I urge my colleagues who have not yet made up their minds and been \ncommitted to the nuclear option to heed these words. Most of those who \nhave not made up their minds are far more moderate than the voices that \nwe listed here, but they should be listened to in this instance. It is \nrare that you get so many conservatives--not in office, not under the \nthumb of these extreme, small-numbered groups--but rarely do you get \nsuch a chorus.\n  Here are the arguments of the conservatives. The conservatives \nunderstand that destroying an important tradition of the Senate is not \nconservative. Conservatism has a long tradition in American politics. I \nagree with some of its tenets and disagree with many others. But true \nadvocates and students of that tradition recognize better than anyone \nthe violence that the nuclear option does to conservative principles.\n  Ken Starr said in one leading magazine:\n\n       It may prove to have the kind of long-term boomerang \n     effect, damage on the institution of the Senate, that \n     thoughtful Senators may come to regret.\n\n  How about former Senator Armstrong? He said this:\n\n       Having served in the majority and in the minority, I know \n     that it's worthwhile to have the minority empowered. As a \n     conservative, I think there is value to having a constraint \n     on the majority.\n\n  Let me repeat that: ``As a conservative, I think there is value to \nhaving a constraint on the majority.''\n  Jim McClure and Malcolm Wallop:\n\n       It is disheartening to think that those entrusted with the \n     Senate's history and future would consider damaging it in \n     this manner.\n\n  Second, these conservatives realize that the Constitution, even in \nexpansive reading, let alone strict constructionism, does not support \nthe nuclear option.\n  In advocating for the nuclear option, Republicans in the Senate have \nabandoned conservative principles for convenient propaganda. In doing \nso, however, they are committing a level of intellectual hypocrisy that \nwe have not seen since Bush v. Gore. To make sure that strict \nconstructionist judges are placed on the bench, the nuclear advocates \nare reading the Constitution so broadly and elastically that it would \nmake the most activist judge cringe. Do not take my word for it.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague is getting ready to speak, and I \nam almost finished. I appreciate his indulgence.\n  Here is what George Will said:\n\n       Some conservatives say the Constitution's framers ``knew \n     what supermajorities they wanted''--the Constitution requires \n     various supermajorities, for ratifying treaties, impeachment \n     convictions, etc.; therefore, other supermajority rules are \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  These are the words of George Will, not Chuck Schumer.\n\n       But it stands conservatism on its head to argue that what \n     the Constitution does not mandate is not permitted.\n       Some conservatives say there is a ``constitutional right'' \n     to have an up-or-down vote on nominees. But in whom does this \n     right inhere: The nominees, the President? This is a perverse \n     contention, coming from conservatives eager to confirm judges \n     who will stop the promiscuous discovery by courts of spurious \n     constitutional rights.\n\n  That is George Will, not Chuck Schumer.\n  Here is what Stephen Moore, founder of the arch conservative Club for \nGrowth says:\n\n       Eviscerating the filibuster would violate the spirit of the \n     Constitution and endanger our rights as individuals against \n     excessive governmental power.\n\n  These conservatives also understand that no party lasts forever in \nthe majority and the nuclear option may come back to haunt Republicans. \nFor short-term political gain, Republican Senators are willing to trash \na tradition that will hurt themselves in the long run.\n  Former Senator Simpson recognizes this:\n\n       [T]here isn't a question in my mind that when the \n     Republicans go out of power and they, they're looking for \n     protection of minority rights, they're going to be alarmed \n     and saddened.\n\n  Finally, the conservatives also understand that once triggered, there \nwill be no stopping the continued erosion of the filibuster. The \nlegislative filibuster is also at great risk. Listen to former Senators \nMcClure and Wallop:\n\n       It is naive to think what is done to the judicial \n     filibuster will not be done to its legislative counterpart, \n     whether by a majority leader named Reid, or Clinton, or \n     Kennedy.\n\n  Here is David Hoppe, former chief of staff to Senator Lott:\n\n       That's the problem with the nuclear option, because it will \n     not stop there. The next step when somebody needs it will be \n     to get rid of the filibuster on legislative issues.\n\n  In conclusion, we are here. We are at a defining moment in the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. Now, this week, in the next few \nweeks, will enough of my colleagues across the aisle act with courage \nand conviction? Will enough of them resist the extremist entreaties of \na tiny but vocal minority who only want their way 100 percent of the \ntime, not 99, not 98, not 97? Will enough of them pay heed to the \narguments made by independent conservatives of their own party, whether \nit is George Will or Bill Armstrong or Ken Starr or so many of the \nothers I mentioned?\n  Time is running out. Time is running out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, now that time has run out, I am excited to \nbe here to talk about the highway bill, important work of the American \npeople that we must get done this week. I am here to stand in strong \nsupport of H.R. 3, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act of 2005.\n  Last year, I traveled Louisiana extensively, campaigning all around \nthe State. I heard concerns expressed in every part of the State about \nthe importance of making sure that we in Louisiana get our fair share \nof Federal highway funding. In the past, Louisiana was a donor State, \nwhich means our State's taxpayers contributed more in gas tax revenue \nthan they got back from the Treasury in highway moneys. As one of the \nnewest members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I worked \nhard this year to ensure that we try to change this unfair state of \naffairs. So Louisiana's rate of return will substantially increase \nunder the bill before us from about 90.5 cents for every dollar that we \nsend in Louisiana taxpayer money to the Federal Government to 95 cents \non the dollar. That is a huge jump. It is still not a dollar--we need \nto go further--but it is a dramatic improvement.\n  This increase will provide my State with $2.9 billion over the next 5 \nyears, funding that is critical to ensure that work continues on one of \nmy State's major corridors, I-49, as well as many other Louisiana \nhighway projects.\n  Providing additional funding for I-49 has been a goal of mine since \nmy days in the House of Representatives. Upon assuming my seat in the \nSenate this January, I have continued to fight for those additional I-\n49 dollars. That is why I initiated a letter in February to Chairman \nInhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords calling for them to support a \nsignificant level of funding for the corridor improvement program in \nthe highway reauthorization bill. That letter was cosigned by five \ncolleagues.\n\n  As a member of the committee that produced that bill, I am also \npleased that we were able to agree on language that would redress a \nserious transportation and safety issue for my State. You see, \nLouisiana is the 22nd most populous State, yet it ranks third in the \nNation in the number of collisions at highway-railroad crossings and \nfifth in the Nation in the number of railroad fatalities.\n  Along the 3,000 miles of tracks in Louisiana are over 6,000 rail \ncrossings, more than any other State except Illinois. So the bill we \ncrafted would provide $178 million for the elimination of hazards and \nthe installation of protective devices at railroad highway crossings.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, in \nparticular those on the Environment and Public Works Committee, for \nagreeing to the inclusion in the highway bill of three significant \namendments that I offered. I thank Chairman Inhofe for his work on \nbehalf of these amendments.\n  One of the amendments would ensure that emergency evacuation routes \nare\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nemphasized as a program priority under the Multistate Corridor Program. \nThe second amendment I authored would channel additional dollars to \nhurricane evacuation routes under the Federal Infrastructure \nPerformance and Maintenance Program. And the third will help local \nofficials complete much faster, and at much lower cost locally, a \nhighway project connecting the parishes of Houma and Thibodaux, LA. The \ninclusion of these amendments in the managers' amendment will greatly \nbenefit Louisiana and other coastal States across the country that \nexperience frequent hurricanes.\n  As noted in the Times Picayune and other Louisiana newspapers, the \n2004 evacuation of Louisiana due to Hurricane Ivan was disturbingly \nslow and marked by traffic gridlock. Traffic was backed up for 26 hours \nin Baton Rouge and 14 hours in New Orleans, while nearly 4,500 cars per \nhour were crossing the Mississippi River on I-10 at the peak of \nevacuation. Two of my amendments will provide additional funding for \nevacuation routes such as I-49, La. 1, and La. 3127 during hurricanes \nor other emergencies. Providing Federal resources to upgrade and \nmaintain evacuation routes throughout the State will certainly help \navoid the astounding gridlock and danger that occurred during the \nevacuation of Hurricane Ivan.\n  The third amendment I offered will expand the scope of an existing \nFederal highway project without increasing the cost-share burden on the \nlocal community and State. Without my amendment, the areas of Houma and \nThibodaux, LA, would have had to come up with as much as $5 million \nmore money. This transportation project will establish a new north-\nsouth evacuation route that is vitally important to residents of Houma \nand Thibodaux and all of those areas in southeast Louisiana.\n  I thank, again, the full EPW Committee, the chairman, Mr. Inhofe, the \nranking member, Mr. Jeffords, the subcommittee chairman and the \nsubcommittee ranking member and all of the staff who have assisted on \nthis bill, particularly Andrew Wheeler and Ruth Van Mark. I call on my \ncolleagues to support the chairman and ranking member in their efforts \nto shepherd this bill through the Senate and through important \nconference committee negotiations.\n  Congress has been extending funding for Federal aid to highway \nprograms six times. The current extension is set to expire on May 31 \nthis year, a little over 2 weeks away. We need to pass this bill. Then \nwe need to quickly go to conference with the House and resolve our \ndifferences with the other Chamber before that important May 31 \ndeadline.\n  That is when the current extension expires and funding for Federal \naid to highway programs will run out. I know that is a tall order, but \nall of our States' transportation needs, our Nation's transportation \nneeds cannot wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana is being modest \nbecause he has had a great deal of influence on the amendments. A \ncritical problem in Louisiana is beach erosion. He has persuaded our \ncommittee, in an articulate way, to become much more aggressive in \nsolving that problem. We are a much better committee because of him. I \nthank him for his hard work on the committee.\n  It is my understanding the senior Senator from Massachusetts wishes \nto speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I commend my friend and colleague \nfrom New York, Senator Schumer. I was listening to him when he \nmentioned some of our former colleagues, all with whom I have served. \nHe mentioned Senator Armstrong, and he also mentioned Senator McClure, \nand Senator Simpson, who was a good friend. I served with him on the \nJudiciary Committee. He mentioned Senator Durenberger. An excellent \narticle was written by Senator Mathias last week. He mentioned Senator \nWallop, and the list goes on. They are seven or eight members of the \nSenate who served in recent times and have a very good sense of the \ninstitution's importance, the importance of the powers of this \ninstitution and the relationship to the executive. They have a very \nkeen awareness of the advice and consent role and understand this is a \nbalance that both have responsibilities to fulfill. I think very deeply \nthat Members of the Senate who have strong views on these nominees \nshould not be muzzled, silenced, and they should not be gagged.\n  The point I might have missed from my friend from New York is the \nrestatement that 96 percent of this President's nominees have been \napproved. That is always something that causes constant amazement, I \nfind, from people who call my office in Massachusetts inquiring about \nmy position. They find out that 96 percent of the President's nominees \nhave been approved and they wonder what this battle is all about. Then \nwhen you tell them this was not a battle the Members of the Senate were \ninterested in, that it was as a result of the President sending back to \nthe Senate those who have previously been rejected and indicated that \nthey were going to add other individuals as well, such as the current \ngeneral counsel of the Defense Department, Mr. Haynes, who was the \narchitect of the whole torture and emasculation of the Geneva \nConventions--these are individuals who are far outside of the \nmainstream of judicial thinking. I have had the chance to address many \nof these issues in the markups of the Judiciary Committee in recent \ntimes, particularly with regard to Mr. Pryor, who is from the State of \nAlabama.\n  I took great pride in working with my colleague and friend from Iowa \non the Americans with Disabilities Act. We spent a good deal of time \nnegotiating that legislation. We had strong, bipartisan support at the \nvery end. And then to read Bill Pryor's assessment of what that act \nsaid and his interpretation of it is completely antithetical to what \nthe legislation was about, the language that was clear and explicit, \nand what the sense of the intent and the supporters of that legislation \nwere about. The list goes on. So we welcome this debate.\n  I agree with the Senator from New York that this is a monumental \ndecision. We are talking about changing the rules of the game in the \nmiddle of the game. Americans may not understand completely all of the \nparliamentary maneuvers here that are available in the Senate, but they \nunderstand when you have an agreed set of rules, you don't change them \nin the middle of the game, and I think they also understand that when \nMembers have strong views and believe nominees who are going to have \nlifetime appointments to the Supreme Court--not 3\\1/2\\ years, such as \nthis President has in the remainder of his term, but a lifetime \ncommitment--those who have strong views ought to be able to speak to \nthose views and have a right to be heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another matter, I rise in strong \nsupport of Senator Schumer's amendment to raise the amount employers \ncan give workers tax free for mass transit commuter costs from the \ncurrent $105 a month to $200 a month.\n  In the face of high fuel costs and constant urban congestion, more \ncommuters using mass transit makes increasingly good sense, and the tax \nbenefit is an effective way to encourage it.\n  The current benefit of $105 a month is too low to cover most mass \ntransit costs in major metropolitan areas, and it is counter-productive \nthat current law provides a benefit almost twice that size for \nparking--$200 a month.\n  I have here a diagram that indicates the commuter fees for the \ndifferent parts coming into Boston. Even from this distance, you can \nlook at them. For Fitchburg, $198; $181 for Lowell; $191 for \nGloucester; and the list goes on. From the South Shore, $198; from \nStoughton, $149; and $198 from Worcester.\n  This amendment is good transportation policy and good environmental \npolicy too. It is an energy policy that makes sense as workers see more \nand more of their paychecks go up in smoke at the gas pump. It is an \nenergy policy that I hope we can all support.\n  In Massachusetts, the change will help nearly 200,000 commuters who \npurchase monthly T-passes to commute by bus, subway or commuter rail to \nwork.\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\n  By increasing the commuter tax break to parity with the parking \nbenefit--$200 a month--the amendment will cover the cost of every \nmonthly T-pass sold in Massachusetts.\n  The highest monthly T-pass cost from Worcester, Middleborough/\nLakeville or Fitchburg is $198, and would be covered in full, as would \nfares from Gloucester and Haverhill.\n  Commuters could have the full $181 cost of commuting from Lawrence or \nLowell covered or the $149 cost from Brockton.\n  By raising the cap to $200, the amendment will also encourage more \nnew employers to participate in the program. They will be able to give \nan affordable benefit of much greater value to their employees.\n  And as more employers come into the program, we can cut down on \ngridlock in Boston and other urban areas across the country.\n  In Boston, gridlock cost the average commuter 51 extra hours a year. \nCongestion nationwide costs $63 billion a year in wasted productivity \nand energy.\n  The amendment means more moms and dads will have more time to spend \nwith their children, instead of being stuck in traffic. And more \nemployees will get to work on time, meaning higher productivity.\n  We cannot afford to waste fuel like this anymore. Our dependence on \nforeign oil is a national crisis. The amendment will help save some of \nthe 2.3 billion gallons of gas a year now being lost to unnecessary \ncongestion. This amendment will mean clearer air in our cities and less \nwear and tear on our roads.\n  In so many ways, this is a smart amendment and a fair amendment, and \nI urge our colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to give a progress report. We \nare down to four or five amendments now. Many of them have been agreed \nto or have been withdrawn. We don't have anyone at this moment who is \ngoing to ask for a vote tonight. We had previously scheduled a vote at \n5:30. We did not anticipate at that time that we would be getting the \ncooperation we are getting from the Members who have worked things out. \nSo I announce on behalf of the leadership that we will not be having \nthe vote at 5:30 tonight.\n  Let me make a couple of comments. I know anxieties are high \nconcerning the so-called nuclear option, or what we call the \nconstitutional option. I hesitate to take up time. If anybody comes to \ntalk about the highway bill, we will stop and talk about the highway \nbill.\n  If you stop and realize what we really want, what we have been asking \nfor is a vote. People are entitled to have a vote on the floor of this \nSenate. They are nominees. You may not like the nominees of the \nPresident for the circuit court positions, but certainly these people \nat least deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  It is kind of interesting to see how the minority has changed its \nmind from just a short period ago.\n  Senator Biden on March 19, 1997, said:\n\n       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is \n     nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have \n     a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor \n     . . . It is totally appropriate for Republicans to reject \n     every single nominee if they want to. That is within their \n     right. But it is not, I will respectfully request, Madam \n     President, appropriate not to have hearings on them, not to \n     bring them to the floor and not to allow a vote . . .\n\n  Senator Boxer on May 14, 1997, said:\n\n       According to the U.S. Constitution, the President \n     nominates, and the Senate shall provide advice and consent. \n     It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process and \n     prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even being \n     given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Senator Daschle on October 5, 1999, said:\n\n       I find it simply baffling that a Senator would vote against \n     even voting on a judicial nomination . . . We have a \n     constitutional outlet for antipathy against a judicial \n     nominee--a vote against that nominee.\n\n  Senator Durbin on September 28, 1998, said:\n\n       I think that responsibility requires us to act in a timely \n     fashion on nominees sent before us. The reason I oppose \n     cloture is I would like to see that the Senate shall also be \n     held to the responsibility of acting in a timely fashion. If, \n     after 150 days languishing in a committee there is no report \n     on an individual, the name should come to the floor. If, \n     after 150 days languishing on the Executive Calendar that \n     name has not been called for a vote, it should be. Vote the \n     person up or down. They are qualified or they are not.\n\n  Senator Feinstein on September 16, 1999, said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down . . . What this does to a [nominee's] life is, it leaves \n     them in limbo . . . It is our job to confirm these judges. If \n     we don't like them, we can vote against them. That is the \n     honest thing to do. If there are things in their background, \n     in their abilities that don't pass muster, vote no.\n\n  On October 4, 1999, she said:\n\n       Our institutional integrity requires an up-or-down vote.\n\n  And on May 19, 1997, Senator Feinstein said:\n\n       Mr. President, the time has come to act on these \n     nominations. I'm not asking for a rubber stamp; let's hold \n     hearings on those nominees who haven't had them, and vote on \n     all of them, up or down, yes or no.\n\n  Senator Kennedy on January 28, 1998, said:\n\n       The Constitution is clear that only individuals acceptable \n     to both the President and the Senate should be confirmed. The \n     President and the Senate do not always agree. But we should \n     resolve these disagreements by voting on these nominees--yes \n     or no.\n\n  And on February 3, 1998:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like \n     them, vote against them. But give them a vote.\n\n  Senator Kohl on August 21, 1999, said:\n\n       [T]here are many other deserving nominees out there. Let's \n     not play favorites. These nominees, who have to put their \n     lives on hold waiting for us to act, deserve an `up or down' \n     vote.\n\n  Senator Lautenberg on June 21, 1995, said:\n\n       Talking about the fairness of the system and how it is \n     equitable for a minority to restrict the majority view, why \n     can we not have a straight up-or-down vote on this without \n     threats of filibuster? When it was Robert Bork or John Tower \n     or Clarence Thomas, even though there was strong opposition, \n     many Senators opposed them. The fact is that the votes were \n     held here, up or down.\n\n  Senator Leahy on June 21, 1995, said:\n\n       When President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, I was the first member of the Senate to \n     declare my opposition to his nomination. I did not believe \n     that Clarence Thomas was qualified to serve on the Court. \n     Even with strong reservations, I felt that Judge Thomas \n     deserved an up-or-down vote.\n\n  On October 14, 1997:\n\n       I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully \n     filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the \n     Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted \n     how improper it would be to filibuster a judicial nomination.\n\n  October 22, 1997:\n\n       I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will \n     accept our responsibility and vote people up or vote them \n     down. Bring the names here. If we want to vote against them, \n     vote against them.\n\n  June 18, 1998:\n\n       If we want to vote against somebody, vote against them. I \n     respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't \n     hold up a qualified judicial nominee . . . I have stated over \n     and over again on this floor . . . that I would object and \n     fight against any filibuster on a judge, whether it is \n     somebody I opposed or supported; that I felt the Senate \n     should do its duty. If we don't like somebody the President \n     nominates, vote him or her down.\n\n  September 16, 1999:\n\n       I . . . do not want to see the Senate go down a path where \n     a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on \n     votes of 41 . . . [D]uring the Republican administrations I \n     rarely ever voted against a nomination by either President \n     Reagan or President Bush. There were a couple I did. I also \n     took the floor on occasion filibusters to hold them up and \n     believe that we should have a vote up or down.\n\n  Again on September 16, 1999:\n\n       I do not want to get having to invoke cloture on judicial \n     nominations. I think it is a bad precedent.\n\n  October 1, 1999:\n\n       Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch, \n     not delayed for 2 and 3 years. We are talking about people \n     going to the Federal judiciary, a third independent branch of \n     Government. They are entitled to dignity and respect. They \n     are not entitled atomically for us to vote aye, but they are \n     entitled to a vote, aye or nay.\n\n  October 3, 1999:\n\n       When we hold a nominee up by not allowing them a vote and \n     not taking any action one way or the other, we are . . . \n     doing a terrible disservice to the man or woman to whom we do \n     this.\n\n  March 7, 2000:\n\n       The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court said: \n     ``The Senate is surely\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\n     under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but \n     after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or \n     vote him down.'' Which is exactly what I would like.\n\n  October 11, 2000:\n\n       I have said on the floor, although we are different \n     parties, I have agreed with Gov. George Bush, who has said \n     that in the Senate a nominee ought to get a [floor] vote, up \n     or down, within 60 days.\n\n  Senator Levin on June 21, 1995, said:\n\n       The President is entitled to his nominee, if a majority of \n     the Senate consent.\n\n  Senator Lincoln at a press conference on September 14, 2000, said:\n\n       If we want people to respect their government again, then \n     government must act respectably. It's my hope that we'll take \n     the necessary steps to give these men and these women \n     especially the up or down vote that they deserve.\n\n  Senator Reid on March 7, 2000, said:\n\n       Once they get out of committee, let's bring them here and \n     vote up or down on them. . . . I think anybody who has to \n     wait 4 years deserves an up-or-down vote.\n       . . . If there is a Senator who believes there is a problem \n     with any judge, whether it is the one we are going to vote on \n     at 5 o'clock or the two we are going to vote on tomorrow, or \n     Thursday, they have every right to come to talk at whatever \n     length they want. But with Judge Paez, it has been 4 years. \n     There has been ample opportunity to talk about this man. He \n     has bipartisan support.\n\n  On June 9, 2001, in an interview on Evans, Novak, Hunt, and Shields \nsaid:\n\n       [W]e should have up or down votes in the committee and on \n     the floor.\n\n  Senator Schumer on March 7, 2000, said:\n\n       The basic issue of holding up judgeships is the issue \n     before us, not the qualifications of judges, which we can \n     always debate. The problem is it takes so long for us to \n     debate those qualifications. It is an example of Government \n     not fulfilling its constitutional mandate because the \n     President nominates, and we are charged with voting on the \n     nominees.\n       . . . I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with \n     alacrity--vote them up or down. But this delay makes a \n     mockery of the Constitution, makes a mockery of the fact that \n     we are here working, and makes a mockery of the lives of very \n     sincere people who have put themselves forward to be judges \n     and then they hang out there in limbo.\n\n  These are people who are now saying they do not want to have a vote \non these nominees. We have nominees who have been waiting not for weeks \nor months but for years. I believe some of these Senators who before \nhad a philosophy that everyone is entitled to a vote ought to turn \naround and give the current nominees a vote. I have a great deal of \nrespect for these people, except I would like to have them express some \nlevel of consistency.\n  The issue has become a bit clouded and confusing. When one talks \nabout the various polls, I suggest that one can word a question to get \nalmost any kind of answer one wants. When it gets down to the facts, \nthe Constitution says the President nominates and the Senate is either \nto confirm or not confirm. It does not say anything about a mandatory \nsupermajority. It just says confirmed. That is a simple majority, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Again, I invite Members to come to the Chamber. We are going to keep \nthe floor open. There will not be any votes tonight on the amendments. \nWe are down to about four amendments, although they should be debated \ntonight if at all possible. We need to get the debates behind us so we \nwill be prepared to vote tomorrow morning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Inaccurate Press Reports\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while we are waiting for Members to come \ndown to the Senate floor to offer their amendments, to talk about their \namendments, and be prepared for votes tomorrow morning, I will share \nwith you that we have had a lot of erroneous reports concerning what is \ngoing on in Iraq and in other sensitive areas of the world. Quite \nfrankly, I believe the greatest disservice that has been done to our \ntroops in Iraq has been by the press, by the press not giving an \naccurate accounting as to what is really happening there.\n  I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as such I \nhave taken on the responsibility of spending time in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nAfrica, and different places where terrorism may come due to the \nsqueeze in the Middle East. But as far as Iraq is concerned, I will \nshare a couple of experiences.\n  One was a couple days after the January 30 election. So many people \nin the media were trying to say the election is not going to come off \non January 30, it is not going to happen; democracy is not going \nprevail there; they are not going to be able to make the deadlines; \nthey are not going to be able to handle the elections and they are not \ncapable of doing it on their own; they do not have the security because \nthey would have to provide all the security for the elections. Yet a \nfew days after that, you might remember, of the three elements over \nthere, the Sunnis were the ones--not the Shiites or the Kurds--but the \nSunnis were the ones wanting to obstruct the elections--the most anti-\nAmerican of all the groups. Yet the day after the election, the two \nprimary Sunni leaders stood and said publicly that they were surprised \nit went the way it did. They wanted to be in on this. They wanted to \nparticipate. We know subsequent to that they have.\n\n  I remember testimonials by different people who had participated in \nthat election. One was a lady who said she could not read the ballot \nbecause of the tears in her eyes. She couldn't see the ballot.\n  Another person told me through a translator that she was in there to \nvote, and it occurred to her at the time they were voting that this was \nnot just the first time in 35 years of a bloody regime of Saddam \nHussein, but it was the first time in 7,000 years that they had an \nopportunity for self-determination.\n  It is a huge thing happening over there. Who would ever have dreamed \nat any time in the last 35 years that they would actually be \nparticipating in a free election?\n  Now we have seen what has happened since then. Sure, the terrorists \nover there who do not want this to happen are out there and they are \nkilling as many of the Iraqis as possible to try to obstruct this new \nfreedom that is coming their way.\n  The last time I was there, I decided it would be a good idea to spend \ntime in the Sunni triangle. That is where most of the hostilities are. \nIt was the Sunnis who were the ones holding out last, the ones who were \nsupporting Saddam Hussein. I recall going to Falluja, just a matter of \na few weeks ago, and in Falluja there was a general whose name was \nMahdi. He was the general, the commanding officer of the brigade. He \nwas the brigade commander for Saddam Hussein. He hated Americans and he \nhad the background to demonstrate how deeply that hatred went, the \nmurders and all these things going on.\n  Yet that general, after we moved the Marines into Falluja and they \nstarted going door to door, and they were embedded with the Iraqis, \nthis general was so impressed with the Marines that he made a \nstatement. When they rotated the Marines out and said the Marines were \ngoing to have to go into a rotation, they had become so close working \nand fighting together that when they all got together before the \nMarines left, he said they all cried. There was a general looking at me \nsaying: We cried because we didn't want the Marines to leave. He \nrenamed the security forces of Falluja the Iraqi Marines. He named them \nafter us.\n  While we were there in Tikrit, the home of Saddam Hussein, there was \nan explosion. It was at a place they called a police station, but it \nwas a training area where they were training Iraqis for the security \nforces. It killed 10 immediately and seriously injured 30 more so they \ncould not be trained. The families of these 40 individuals who were \neither killed or were severely injured offered up another member of \neach of their families to substitute for the one who was killed or the \none who was injured. It was the type of sacrifice you would never dream \npossible a few years before--a few days before, really.\n  I remember going all over the Sunni triangle in a Blackhawk \nhelicopter, 100 feet off the ground. That is the only safe way to get \nthere. There are terrorists who have SAMs, surface-to-air missiles, \nalthough some pretty crude.\n  Many American families who have sent care packages to the troops over \nthere--candy, cookies, these different\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nthings--what they have done with these is repackage them and, as we \nwere going over the Sunni triangle and looked down at these small \nvillages, all the kids were out there and we threw them candy and \nthings like that, and they were waving American flags and cheering. \nThis is not the picture you get from the media.\n  I applaud the job our guys and gals have done over there, our troops. \nOf course, many have lost their lives, but people don't stop to realize \nhow many more lives would have been lost if we had not been involved in \nthat area, offering that kind of freedom.\n  Now we see a lot of terrorists are going into other areas. One of the \ngood things I would announce that is going on right now is down in \nAfrica we are now in the process of assisting Africans in forming five \nAfrican brigades, and these African brigades, we will put them in a \nposition to help them train themselves so when something like this \nerupts down there it will not be the Americans who have to do it.\n  I just wanted to take this time to applaud our troops for the great \njob they are doing. I really believe, as great a disservice as the \npress has provided, that the people of America know better. They are \nshowing they do know better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 761 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside for the consideration of the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 761.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \namendments.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask for adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 761) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Detective Donald Young\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with tremendous sadness that I rise \ntoday to commemorate the life and work of Detective Donald ``Donnie'' \nYoung of the Denver Police Department.\n  In the early morning hours of Sunday, May 8, Detective Young \ntragically lost his life while working off-duty as a security guard at \na private party in Denver. Today, I join the people of Denver and my \nhome State of Colorado in mourning the loss of a dedicated public \nservant, and a devoted husband and father.\n  Detective Young is remembered by his family, friends, and colleagues \nas a man who was always willing to help others in need, whether by \nhopping out of his truck on a broken foot to help a stranded driver out \nof a snowdrift, lightening the mood with his unique sense of humor, or \nworking overtime to help protect women from the threat of domestic \nviolence, Donnie never failed to embody the selflessness and compassion \nso common among his 850,000 brothers and sisters serving as law \nenforcement officers in this country today.\n  It will come as no surprise to those men and women and anyone \nfamiliar with their line of work that Donnie was also exceedingly \nmodest; it is consequently left to the rest of us to give the many \nawards and honors he received over the course of his 12-year career in \nlaw enforcement the attention they deserve. In recognition of the \nbravery and dedication he displayed on countless occasions, Detective \nYoung received three of the Denver Police Department's four most \nprestigious awards, including the medal of honor for his role in the \n1994 rescue of two kidnapping victims.\n  Yesterday, more than 20,000 people gathered in our Nation's capital \nto formally honor and remember Detective Young and other law \nenforcement officers recently injured or slain in the line of duty. \nThis day was marked in part by a Senate resolution I had the privilege \nof cosponsoring that recognizes May 15, 2005, as Peace Officers \nMemorial Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \ndisabled while working to protect the public. Having served as Attorney \nGeneral for the State of Colorado, I know first-hand the sacrifices our \nmen and women in law enforcement make on a daily basis, and I am deeply \nproud to have had the honor of serving in the same family as Detective \nYoung and others like him.\n  Today, I join my former brothers and sisters in the law enforcement \ncommunity--in Colorado and across the Nation--in grieving the loss of a \npassionate and capable public servant, Detective Donald ``Donnie'' \nYoung.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to report that the Senate \ntransportation bill not only continues but also greatly expands a \nprogram I authored in the TEA-21 law to promote smart growth \ninitiatives. When TEA-21 became law in 1998, this pilot program was the \nfirst Federal program ever created to provide incentives to help States \nand local governments pursue smart growth policies.\n  The good news is that the Senate transportation bill recognizes the \nvalue of this groundbreaking program by providing a substantial funding \nincrease.\n  The original smart growth pilot program I authored, the \nTransportation and Community and System Preservation Program, TCSP, \nprovided $25 million per year to investigate and address the \nrelationships between transportation projects, communities and the \nenvironment. Under the SAFETEA bill now before the Senate, funding for \nthis program would nearly double to about $47 million per year.\n  The not so good news is that 7 years after Congress enacted the TCSP \nprogram it remains the only Federal program to provide incentives for \nsmart growth. In the last 7 years, the problems of urban sprawl have \nonly gotten worse. Clearly more needs to be done.\n  Sprawl development not only hurts our citizens where they live and \nbreathe, it also hits them in their wallets. A number of studies have \ncome out that show the costs of sprawling growth are significantly \nhigher than more compact, managed growth patterns. These studies show \nthat taxpayers can save billions of dollars in public facility \nconstruction and operation and maintenance costs by opting for growth \nmanagement.\n  Because of the major impacts federally funded transportation projects \ncan have, there is an appropriate role for the Federal Government in \nensuring these projects and the development they spawn are both \neconomically and environmentally sound.\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n  That role should not be to embroil the Federal Government in land use \ndecisions that have historically been State and local issues. We do not \nwant Federal zoning.\n  Instead, the proper role for the Federal Government is to create \nincentives to encourage and build on the State and local efforts to \naddress transportation and growth that are already underway. I am very \npleased that the Senate SAFETEA bill extends and expands the TCSP \nprogram to help local communities grow in environmentally sustainable \nways by creating incentives for smart growth management.\n  The additional funding for TCSP in the Senate transportation bill is \na good start. But if we are going to improve both our Nation's \ninfrastructure and our quality of life, we need to do more at the \nFederal level to provide incentives to support smart growth policies.\n  My home State of Oregon leads the Nation in developing innovative \napproaches to manage our growth and to tie transportation policies in \nto growth management. Our statewide land conservation and development \nprogram requires each municipality to establish an urban growth \nboundary to define both the areas where growth and development should \noccur and those areas that should be protected from development. This \nsystem keeps agricultural and forest lands in productive use and \npreserves ``green corridors'' for hiking, biking and other recreational \nuses that are located in or close to urban areas. Our transportation \nplanning and construction efforts reinforce these policies by not only \navoiding developing in environmentally sensitive areas but also by \nhelping make the areas where we want development to occur more \naccessible.\n  Oregon recognizes that it is not enough to tell people where they can \nnot build. For our system to work, we have to make it easier to develop \nthe areas where we want growth to occur. And we do not just give lip \nservice to this principle. We actually put our money where our mouth is \nto make sure the development we want occurs.\n  These policies make the State of Oregon, Metro, the city of Portland, \nand other localities in our State ideal candidates to apply for funding \nunder the Transportation and Community and System Preservation Program.\n  I greatly appreciate the support of Chairman Inhofe, Chairman Bond \nand Senators Jeffords and Baucus in working with me to increase funding \nsubstantially for this important program in the bill. Thanks to their \nefforts the bill now before the Senate will enable State and local \nsmart growth policies to merge more smoothly with our transportation \npolicies.\n  As Congress considers other Federal infrastructure programs, I will \nbe looking for ways to build on the success of TCSP. The TCSP model can \nalso be adapted for water, sewer and other federally funded \ninfrastructure to help save taxpayers money and support State and local \ngovernments smart growth efforts. By following that approach, Congress \ncan provide our citizens with both better infrastructure and better \nquality of life.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

KENT MURPHY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nSenate's attention the retirement of a distinguished member of our \nmilitary, Col. Kent Murphy, who is retiring this year after a \ndistinguished 25-year career in the Air Force.\n  Colonel Murphy started his career at the U.S. Air Force Academy, \ngraduating in 1980. From there, he went on to the Uniformed Services \nUniversity of the Health Sciences, USUHS, and became a doctor in the \nAir Force Medical Corps. Dr. Murphy served in varying assignments in \nthe United States and overseas while in the Air Force. He has held \nsurgical positions ranging from a F-16 flight surgeon to a staff \nsurgeon in the Air Force Academy Hospital's Department of \nOtolaryngology, where he later became department head. He has been an \nadjunct assistant professor at USUHS and the senior otolaryngology \nmalpractice consultant for the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General. \nCertainly, such a career serving his country as a doctor in the Air \nForce would be laudable in its own right, but Colonel Murphy went far \nbeyond that.\n  In 1997, Colonel Murphy founded the Center of Excellence for Medical \nMultimedia at the U.S. Air Force Academy. There, Colonel Murphy \npioneered the concept of information therapy throughout the Air Force \nMedical Service. He developed high-tech programs, using the Internet, \nvideo and CD/DVD ROM, that are the cornerstone of Air Force efforts to \neducate service members, dependents and retirees about important \nmedical conditions such as pregnancy, hypertension and diabetes. \nAdditionally, he served as the chairman of the Prorenata Health Media \nFoundation to help create access to these innovative programs for \nunderserved populations across the Nation. In August of 2003, he was \nawarded the Frank Brown Berry Prize by US Medicine magazine--the \nhighest honor in Federal Healthcare. Colonel Murphy is the only Air \nForce physician to have won this prestigious honor and the youngest \nrecipient to date.\n  I am proud to call Colonel Murphy a friend and thank him today for \nhis service to the Air Force and our country. I would be remiss however \nif I did not also thank his loyal wife Cindy. As anyone who has been \naround the military will attest, a good military spouse is vital to the \nsuccess of the servicemember. As Colonel and Mrs. Murphy head out now \ninto civilian practice, I know that they will continue to make lasting \ncontributions to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5215-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE RECOGNITION OF DETECTIVE DONALD R. ``DONNIE'' YOUNG\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to honor all law enforcement \nofficers who protect our families and communities against crime during \nNational Police Week 2005. Also, I ask to pay special tribute to \nDetective Donald R. Young of Denver, CO, and others officers like him \nwho have given their lives in service.\n  Communities readily rely on law enforcement officers to answer the \ncall in times of great need. These men and women serve to enforce not \nonly our laws, but to defend the weakest and most vulnerable among us. \nI think it is suitable that we salute and recognize these dedicated \nheroes with a National Police Week.\n  Detective Donald R. ``Donnie'' Young was shot and killed in Denver, \nCO, on May 8, 2005. He was working off duty at the time, providing \nsecurity detail at a baptismal event. Detective Young was a 12-year \nveteran of the Denver Police Department. He leaves behind a wife and \ntwo young daughters.\n  Along with Detective Donald R. Young, I ask that we pay homage to all \nour fallen heroes. Law enforcement officers knowingly put themselves in \nharms way every day. It is important to take this time to remember \ntheir service. We must acknowledge their efforts as some of the bravest \namong us and share our gratitude for their sacrifice with their \nfamilies.\n  I rise to humbly pay my respect to law enforcement officers \neverywhere and honor the legacy that fallen officers leave \nbehind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5215-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5215-S5216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING KAHUKU HIGH SCHOOL ``WE THE PEOPLE'' TEAM\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure and pride \nto announce that students from Kahuku High School, on the Island of \nOahu, honorably represented Hawaii at the national finals of ``We the \nPeople: The Citizen and the Constitution.'' These Hawaii students \njoined more than 1,200\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nstudents from across the country to visit Washington, DC, and take part \nin national competition during the first week of May. These bright \nstudents showcased their exemplary knowledge of the U.S. Consitution, \nand did my State proud against competition from other States. I applaud \nthe achievement of the Kahuku students for placing in the Top 10 of \nNational Finalists out of the 51 schools participating.\n  The ``We the People'' program is administered by the Center for Civic \nEducation and is an extensive educational program developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and Bill of \nRights. The 3-day competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. \nCongress and provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate \ntheir knowledge before a panel of adult judges while they evaluate, \ntake, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary \nissues. Their testimony is followed by questions designed to probe the \nstudents' depth of understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  I recognize the following 23 Kahuku students who proudly represented \nthe State of Hawaii: Genevieve Allen, Yesenia Arevalo, Amanda Baize, \nBonnie Cameron, Meri Ching, Dannah Christensen, Krystle Corpuz, Oliver \nHowells, Lorna Kekua, Jokke Kokkonen, Jacquelyn Lautaha, William Law, \nCatalina Markowitz, Ajri McArthur, Sara Mirels, Brad Rasmussen, Ashley \nRillamas, Lizette Sauque, Noelle Spring, Shirly Tagayuna, Joseph \nTrisolini, and Morgan Wright. I especially thank their teacher, Ms. \nSandra Cashman, for once again seizing this opportunity to educate \nstudents about the significance of the American institutions of \nconstitutional democracy. The mere fact that Kahuku students competed \nhere for 11 of the last 12 ``We the People'' competitions is a \ntestament to Ms. Cashman's skills as a civics education teacher.\n  As a former Kahuku High School teacher, I take pride in these \nstudents who rose to the challenges presented in this competition, and \ngave impressive performances. I know that it is because of school and \nparental support, dedication, and commitment that these students were \nempowered and encouraged to excel in this arena. These students have no \ndoubt made everyone in their school, their families, and their friends \nproud of what they achieved. We should all recognize that they are \nlearning and advocating the fundamental ideas that identify us as a \npeople and bind us together as a nation. The zeal and diligence these \nstudents showed in their understanding of Government ought to serve as \na symbol for all citizens to pursue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5216-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXCELLENCE IN NURSING\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I celebrate the hard work and \ndedication of all nurses that serve the veterans of our great Nation. \nIn particular, I congratulate the recipients of the Secretary's Award \nfor Excellence in Nursing and Advancement of Nursing Programs. These \nrecipients were nominated for dedication to their profession and for \noutstanding service to our veterans and to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA. The honor bestowed on these individuals is greatly \ndeserved.\n  The 2005 Nursing Award Recipients for Excellence in Nursing include: \nMarthe Moseley, Kim Pyatt, Ferris Jones, and John Cheng. The recipients \nof the 2005 Award for the Advancement of Nursing Programs are Timothy \nB. Williams and Rebecca Newson Williams. All these individuals have \ndemonstrated high level of achievement and dedication through their \nservice with VA.\n  Marthe Moseley, PhD, RN, CCRN, CCNS, is an award recipient from the \nSouth Texas Veterans Health Care System. Dr. Moseley coordinates and \nevaluates integrated programs that demonstrate clinical excellence in \nthe field of orientation, competency development and implementation. \nShe has been a key consultant to entities such as the National Dialysis \nConference; Brook Army Medical Center; and Wilford Hall Medical Center, \nAir Force. Dr. Moseley has been a leader in improving the quality and \neffectiveness of care for critically ill patients.\n  Kim Pyatt, RN, BSN, of the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, \nhas been an outstanding and positive nurse for the past 5 years. She \nserved as a staff nurse and a night charge nurse in the Nursing Home \nCare Unit, NHCU, before being selected as the Geriatrics and Extended \nCare Wound coordinator in 2002. Ms. Pyatt has a great passion for \nveterans and for providing excellent nursing care in the NHCU.\n  Ferris Jones, LPN, works in the Puget Sound Health Care System with \nthe Mental Health Service in the Homeless Care Line, Domiciliary Care \nProgram, and also through a residential program that treats veterans \nfor post traumatic sress disorder. His strong medical background, \ntraining in the U.S. Army, and experience in mental health have worked \ntogether to set a standard of excellence. He has contributed to quality \nof care through evaluations of procedures for the Domiciliary Care \nProgram and the development of an educational orientation video for \nthose newly admitted to the program.\n  John Cheng, from the Northport VA Medical Center, has been a nursing \nassistant in Extended Care since 1998. Mr. Cheng as continued to \nprovide top quality, as well as encouragement, to his veteran patients. \nMr. Cheng recently spent a great deal of time with a young traumatic \nbrain injury patient who had been admitted to the NCHU. During this \ntime, Mr. Cheng demonstrated compassion and selfless dedication to \ntreating patients. He did the little things that are necessary during a \ntime of extended treatment, such as developing a relationship with this \nyoung patient. Mr. Cheng is also dedicated to professional growth. He \nis the only employee to graduate from the VA-sponsored Licensed \nPractical Nurse, LPN, program and is now working on achieving his \nregistered nurse degree.\n  Timothy B. Williams is the director of the VA Puget Sound Health Care \nSystem. Mr. Williams has worked closely with nursing and physician \nleadership to implement innovative strategies to optimally deliver \npatient care, in spite of limited resources. He has continuously sought \nopportunities to ensure nurse support and to encourage professional \ndevelopment of nursing at all levels. Mr. Williams has also been an \neffective supporter of VA efforts to recruit and retain nursing staff.\n  Rebecca Newsom Williams, RN, MPH, is the associate director for \nPatient/Nursing Services for the VA Eastern Colorado Health Care \nSystem. In her role, Ms. Williams directs the integration of all \nnursing related activities throughout the VA Eastern Colorado Health \nCare System, in collaboration with the executive leadership team. Ms. \nWilliams has demonstrated excellence in her leadership by recognizing \nthe need for combined research and clinical practices.\n  As you can see, these phenomenal nurses deserve to be applauded for \ntheir accomplishments. Through their commitment and compassion to our \nNation's heroes, they themselves also become heroes to our veterans.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I again \ncongratulate these distinguished award recipients. They demonstrate the \nneed and importance of excellence at every level of care giving, for \nevery patient. In this time of critical need for nurses, it is \nimperative that we thank these nurses who have chosen to serve in the \nVA health care system for their diligence and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5216-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5216-S5217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HIGH TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP HONORED\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

These businesses are the \nlifeblood of Idaho's economy and their existence indicates the \noverwhelming entrepreneurship that abides in our communities large and \nsmall. A unique public-private partnership between the Idaho National \nLab, Boise State University, and the Idaho Department of Commerce and \nLabor is helping these vital organs of Idaho's economy grow and \nfunction to their best potential. The Small Business Administration \nrecently recognized this effort, giving Idaho TechConnect a national \n``Best Practices'' award at an economic development conference here in \nWashington.\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\n  Idaho TechConnect has been instrumental in providing small high tech \nbusiness entrepreneurs with development assistance, and facilities and \nservices to assess the progress and direction of their business \nexpansion. The partnerships with industry and higher education provide \nthese ventures with inspiration, innovation, outside experience and \nconsultation from those in academia as well as the established and \nthriving high tech industry in Idaho.\n  Sharing resources, whether intellectual or tangible, provides \noutcomes that are productive and long lasting. The people and \norganizations involved with Idaho TechConnect are to be commended on \ntheir commitment to our State's economy and by extension, communities \nand families. This tremendous honor by SBA is most certainly well \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5217-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LARAMIE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CAPITOL HILL CHALLENGE\n\n Mr. ENZI.

A bill to require disclosure of financial relationships \nbetween brokers and mutual fund companies, and of certain brokerage \ncommissions paid by mutual fund companies; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mutual Fund \nTransparency Act of 2005. Mutual funds are vital investment vehicles \nfor middle-income Americans that offer diversification and professional \nmoney management. Mutual funds are what average investors rely on for \nretirement, savings for children's college education, or other \nfinancial goals and dreams.\n  I was outraged by the widespread abuses in the industry. Ordinary \ninvestors were being harmed due to the greed of brokers, mutual fund \ncompanies, and institutional and large investors. That is why I \nintroduced the Mutual Fund Transparency Act in November 2003 with my \ncolleagues Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Lieberman.\n  I want to thank the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC, William Donaldson, for his courageous leadership. \nChairman Donaldson has demonstrated a commitment to bring about reforms \nthat better protect investors. I applaud the SEC's enforcement and \nregulatory efforts in addressing weaknesses and abuses in the mutual \nfund industry.\n  The SEC has adopted several reforms that mirror provisions found in \nmy original Mutual Fund Transparency Act. In July 2004, the SEC adopted \nreforms requiring mutual funds, with certain exemptive rules, to have \nan independent chairman and ensure that 75 percent of their board \nmembers are independent.\n  Although the SEC has undertaken a number of impressive reforms, I \nhave chosen to reintroduce a modified version of my original bill to \nfurther strengthen the independence of boards, make investors more \naware of the true costs of their mutual funds, and prevent several key \nreforms from being rolled back. It is also important to legislatively \naddress areas where the SEC needs additional statutory authority. \nLegislation is needed to ensure that the increased independence rule \napplied universally among mutual funds.\n  My bill includes a number of provisions intended to strengthen mutual \nfund boards. It will require that mutual fund boards have independent \nchairmen and that 75 percent of their directors be independent. My bill \nstrengthens the definition of who is considered an independent director \nand requires independent directors to be approved by shareholders. \nThese steps are necessary to strengthen the ability of mutual fund \nboards to detect and prevent abuses of investor trust.\n  My bill will also increase the transparency of the complex financial \nrelationships between brokers and mutual funds in ways that are both \nmeaningful and easy to understand for investors. Shelf-space payments \nand revenue-sharing agreements between mutual fund companies and \nbrokers present conflicts of interest that must be addressed. Brokers \nhave conflicts of interest, some of which are unavoidable, but these \nneed to be disclosed to investors. Without such disclosure, investors \ncannot make informed financial decisions. Investors may believe that \nbrokers are recommending funds based on the expectation for solid \nreturns or low volatility, when the broker's recommendation may be \ninfluenced by hidden payments. This legislation will require brokers to \ndisclose in writing the amount of compensation the broker will receive \ndue to the transaction, instead of simply providing a prospectus. \nCurrently, the prospectus fails to include the detailed relevant \ninformation that investors need to make informed decisions.\n  The SEC has requested comments on a proposal to require a \nconfirmation notice, as well as increased point-of-sale disclosures, to \nprovide investors with more information about broker conflicts in \nmutual fund transactions. The SEC is reviewing comments on its \nproposal, and studying other possibilities. I have included a point-of-\nsale disclosure requirement in my legislation that was absent in the \nprior bill. In my bill, investors would have to be provided with the \namount of differential payments and average fees for comparable \ntransactions. My legislation also requires that confirmation notices be \nprovided for mutual fund transactions, which will include how their \nbroker was compensated.\n  To further increase the transparency of the actual costs of the fund, \nbrokerage commissions must be counted as an expense in filings with the \nSEC and included in the calculation of the expense ratio. Consumers \noften compare the expense ratios of funds when making investment \ndecisions. However, the expense ratios fail to take into account the \ncost of commissions in the purchase and sale of securities. Therefore, \ninvestors are not provided with a complete and accurate idea of the \nexpenses involved with owning that fund. Currently, brokerage \ncommissions are disclosed to the SEC, but not to individual investors. \nRight now, brokerage commissions are only disclosed to the investor \nupon request. My bill puts teeth into brokerage commission disclosure \nprovisions and ensures that commissions will be included in a document \nthat investors have access to and can utilize.\n  The inclusion of brokerage commissions in the expense ratio creates a \npowerful incentive to reduce the use of soft dollars. Soft dollars can \nbe used to lower expenses, since most purchases using soft dollars do \nnot count as expenses and are not calculated into the expense ratio. \nThere have been calls for the prohibition of soft dollars. This is a \nrecommendation that needs to be further examined. My bill provides an \nalternative, which is an incentive for funds to limit the use of soft \ndollars by identifying them as expenses. If commissions are disclosed \nin this manner,\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nthe use of soft dollars will be reflected in the higher commission fees \nand overall expenses. This makes it easier for investors to see the \ntrue cost of the fund and compare the expense ratios of funds.\n  Some may argue that this approach gives an incomplete picture and \nfails to account for spreads, market impact, and opportunity costs. \nHowever, the SEC has the authority to address the issue further if it \ncan determine an effective way to quantify these additional factors. My \nbill does not impose additional reporting requirements that would be \nburdensome to brokers. It merely uses what is already reported and \npresents this information in a manner meaningful to investors.\n  Another important provision in my bill requires the SEC to conduct a \nstudy to assess financial literacy among mutual fund investors. This \nstudy is necessary because any additional disclosure requirements for \nmutual funds will not truly work unless investors are given the tools \nthey need to make smart investment decisions.\n  Mr. President, my legislation will ensure that mutual fund boards are \nindependent and that investors are provided with more relevant and \nmeaningful disclosures from which they can make better informed \nchoices. I look forward to continue working with my colleagues and the \nSEC to better protect investors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1037\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 16, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We are writing to express our \n     enthusiastic support for your Mutual Fund Transparency Act of \n     2005. Your bill will benefit fund shareholders in three \n     significant respects. First, it will strengthen the \n     independence of fund board to help ensure that the gross \n     abuses of trust committed by fund managers in connection with \n     the recent mutual fund scandal will not be repeated. Second, \n     the bill will require that fund shareholders be provided with \n     full and understandable disclosure of brokers' fees and \n     conflicts of interest, and that when brokers provide \n     individualized investment advice they will be held to the \n     same fiduciary standards to which all other investment \n     advisers are held. Third, the bill will promote competition \n     through increased price transparency, and thereby improve \n     services and reduce costs for the almost 100 million \n     Americans who have entrusted their financial security to \n     mutual funds.\n\n\n                            Fund Governance\n\n       The mutual scandal that erupted in September 2003 and \n     continues to be litigated to this day revealed ``a serious \n     breakdown in management controls in more than just a few \n     mutual fund complexes.'' As noted by the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission:\n       ``The breakdown in fund management and compliance controls \n     evidenced by our enforcement cases raises troubling questions \n     about the ability of many fund boards, as presently \n     constituted, to effectively oversee the management of funds. \n     The failure of a board to play its proper role can result, in \n     addition to serious compliance breakdowns, in excessive fees \n     and brokerage commissions, less than forthright disclosure, \n     mispricing of securities, and inferior investment \n     performance.''\n       The Act directly addresses the governance weaknesses \n     revealed by the scandal by strengthening the independence of \n     fund directors. It plugs loopholes that have allowed former \n     executives of fund managers and other fund service \n     providers, among others, to qualify as ``independent'' \n     directors when their independence is clearly compromised \n     by their former positions. The Act also ensures that the \n     board's agenda will be set by an independent chairman, and \n     not by the CEO of the fund's manager, as is common \n     practice, and that independent directors will control \n     board matters and the evaluation of independent nominees. \n     The Act's requirement that independent directors seek \n     shareholder approval at least every 5 years will enhance \n     the accountability of independent directors to the \n     shareholders whose interests they are supposed to serve.\n       Although the SEC recently adopted rules requiring \n     independent fund chairmen and a 75% independent board, these \n     rules will not prevent fund managers from terminating \n     independent chairmen or reducing independent representation \n     on the board to the statutory minimum of 40%. The SEC's rules \n     apply only when the funds choose to rely on certain exemptive \n     rules. If there is a conflict between the fund's independent \n     directors and the fund manager, the fund manager can simply \n     stop relying on the rules and seek to install its own \n     executives in a majority of board positions. This is \n     precisely what Don Yacktman did when the independent \n     directors of his funds opposed him, and it will undoubtedly \n     be repeated the next time that there is a similar \n     confrontation. More importantly, independent directors know \n     from the Yacktman experience that the protection given them \n     by the SEC is limited, and they therefore will be less likely \n     to stand up for shareholders than if--as you have proposed--\n     the SEC's requirements were codified.\n\n\n    Fiduciary Duties and Full Disclosure for All Investment Advisers\n\n       Recent regulatory investigations and enforcement actions \n     have uncovered persistent and widespread sales abuses by \n     brokers. Regulators have found that brokers have \n     systematically overcharged investors for commissions, \n     routinely made improper recommendations of B shares, accepted \n     undisclosed directed brokerage payments in return for \n     distribution services, and received revenue sharing payments \n     that create incentives to favor funds that pay the highest \n     compensation rather than funds that are the best investment \n     option for their clients.\n       Last fall, the Commission promised that it would address \n     the problems that have so long plagued brokers' sales \n     practices, but the Commission's efforts have fallen far short \n     of the mark. Its recent proposals fail to require full \n     disclosure of brokers' compensation,\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\n     much less the disclosure of information that would enable \n     investors to fully evaluate their brokers' conflicts of \n     interests. The new disclosure requirements that you have \n     proposed will ensure that brokers' conflicts of interest will \n     be fully transparent to investors. Investors will be able to \n     view the amount the broker is being paid for the fund being \n     recommended compared with the (often lesser) amount the \n     broker would receive for selling a different fund, which \n     cannot help but direct investors' attention to the conflict \n     of interest created by differential compensation structures. \n     We especially applaud your proposal to ensure that all broker \n     compensation, including revenue sharing payments, is \n     disclosed in the point-of-sale document, which ensures that \n     disclosure rules will not create an incentive for brokers to \n     favor revenue sharing as a means of avoiding disclosure.\n       Remarkably, in the wake of a longstanding pattern of \n     brokers' sales abuses, the Commission has recently repealed \n     Congress's narrow exemption from advisory regulation for \n     brokers who provide only ``solely incidental'' advice. The \n     Commission's strained interpretation of ``solely incidental'' \n     advice to include any advice provided ``in connection with \n     and reasonably related to a broker's brokerage services''\\3\\ \n     has effectively stripped advisory clients of the protections \n     of an entire statutory regime solely on the ground that the \n     investment advice happens to be provided by a broker. The \n     Commission's position flatly contradicts the text and purpose \n     of the Investment Advisers Act, which, as the Supreme Court \n     has stated: ``reflects a congressional recognition ``of `the \n     delicate fiduciary nature of an investment advisory \n     relationship,' as well as a congressional intent to \n     eliminate, or at least to expose, all conflicts of interest \n     which might incline an investment adviser--consciously or \n     unconsciously--to render advice which was not \n     disinterested.''\n       Your proposal restores crucial components of Congress's \n     carefully constructed regulatory scheme for the distinct and \n     complementary regulation of brokerage and advisory services. \n     It properly recognizes that a ``fiduciary, which Congress \n     recognized the investment adviser to be,'' is also what \n     consumers expect an investment adviser to be, as is generally \n     the case when professional services are provided on a \n     personalized basis. The Act also recognizes the importance \n     of''expos[ing] all conflicts of interest which might incline \n     an investment adviser--consciously or unconsciously--to \n     render advice which was not disinterested'' by requiring full \n     disclosure of such conflicts of interests and other material \n     information at the time that the prospective client is \n     deciding whether to enter into the relationship.\n\n\n                  Fee Disclosure and Price Competition\n\n       Your fee disclosure provisions will do double duty, by \n     addressing conflicts of interest and brokers' sales abuses \n     while also promoting competition, thereby improving services \n     and driving down expenses. Requiring brokers to disclose the \n     amount of differential payments and average fees for \n     comparable transactions will provide the kind of price \n     transparency that is a necessary predicate for price \n     competition and the efficient operation of free markets. In \n     addition, the requirement that funds disclose the amount of \n     commissions they pay will ensure that the fund expense ratio \n     includes all of the costs of the fund's operations and enable \n     investors to make more informed investment decisions. The \n     best regulator of fees is the market, but the market cannot \n     operate efficiently when brokers and funds are permitted to \n     hide the actual cost of the services they provide.\n\n\n               Financial Literacy and Fund Advertisements\n\n       Finally, we strongly agree that there is a need to further \n     study of financial literacy, including especially information \n     that fund investors need to make informed investment \n     decisions and methods to increase the transparency of fees \n     and potential conflicts of interest. Your proposed study of \n     mutual fund advertisements is also timely, as the regulation \n     of fund ads continues to permit misleading touting of out \n     sized short-term performance and other abuses.\n       Mutual funds are Americans' most important lifeline to \n     retirement security. The regulation of mutual funds, however, \n     has not kept pace with their enormous growth. We applaud your \n     continuing efforts to enhance investor protection, promote \n     vigorous market competition and create wealth for America's \n     mutual fund investors through effective disclosure and truly \n     independent board oversight.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Mercer Bullard,\n       Founder and President, Fund Democracy, Inc.\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Ken McEldowney,\n       Executive Director, Consumer Action.\n     Sally Greenberg,\n       Senior Counsel, Consumers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                             AARP,\n\n\n                                                 E Street, NW,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: AARP supports your continuing efforts \n     to expand investor awareness of mutual fund costs, to promote \n     fund competition by making those costs transparent and \n     comparable, and to improve the independent oversight and \n     governance functions of fund boards of directors. Building on \n     legislation that you introduced in November of 2003, which \n     AARP supported, we are also pleased to support the updated \n     and upgraded legislation that you are introducing today, the \n     ``Mutual Fund Transparency Act of 2005.''\n       We believe that there exists a growing need for legislative \n     action that clarifies, reinforces, strengthens, and secures \n     the corrective rule-making efforts undertaken by the U.S. \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that were--in part--\n     stimulated by your earlier legislative proposal. We look \n     forward to working with you on these issues that are critical \n     to the economic security of millions of Americans--\n     particularly those of or near retirement age. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to call me, or have your \n     staff call Roy Green of our Federal Affairs Department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Certner,\n                                        Director, Federal Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1039. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe treatment of depreciation of refinery property; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gas Price \nReduction through Increased Refining Capacity Act of 2005, S. 1039.\n  This bill provides tax incentives to encourage increases in oil \nrefining capacity in the United States. By increasing domestic refining \ncapacity, we will increase supply of refined oil products, thus \ndecreasing the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  This bill is the second in a package of three bills I am proposing to \npromote long-term solutions to our Nation's energy needs.\n  Our nation needs clean, affordable sources of energy, and we should \nincrease our energy security by focusing on those sources of energy \nthat can be developed domestically.\n  Two weeks ago I introduced the CLEAR ACT, which provides market \nsolutions to promote breakthroughs in the use of alternative fuels and \ntechnologies in our transportation sector.\n  The third bill, which I will introduce in the near future, will focus \non increasing U.S. energy independence through the development of our \nnation's gigantic, untapped oil shale and tar sands reserves.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats recognize that increasing our domestic \nsupplies of crude oil is not an effective solution unless we can \nincrease our capacity to refine it. This is the genesis of the Gas \nPrice Reduction Through Increased Refining Capacity Act.\n  Refining capacity in the United States cannot keep up with demand. In \nfact, there has not been a new refinery built in the United States \nsince the 1976.\n  But that is only part of the story.\n  The fact is that the economics of refining are so tough that we have \nactually lost about 200 refineries since the last one was built. So \nnow, our powerful Nation is down to only 149 overworked refineries.\n  Technological improvements at existing refineries have brought some \nincrease to capacity, but these increases have fallen far short of \ndemand. As a result, we now meet the gap in demand by importing more \nand more oil products that have already been refined, which makes us \nall the more dependent on foreign suppliers.\n  Every day, I hear from Utahns who are burdened by rapidly rising gas \nprices. Let me quote from just a portion of a letter from one of my \nconstituents, Richard Decker of West Jordan, Utah:\n\n       ``I am interested in knowing the progress or status of \n     planning to protect Americans from the continually rising oil \n     prices . . . I am just a normal guy with a tiny family. Given \n     salaries, inflation, lack of fuel efficient automobiles at a \n     decent price, I worry if I and others will be able to make a \n     decent life here--not just in Utah but in America. \n     Personally, I wish I had the option of a hydrogen-powered \n     vehicle that would completely rid us of the dependence on \n     foreign oil imports.\n       However, this isn't likely soon, so can we work on the gas \n     prices? Do you have any suggestions? . . . Keep up the good \n     work. Best Regards, Richard Decker''\n\n  My answer to Richard is that we hear him, and we are trying to \nrespond.\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\n  We have a serious problem.\n  It is easy to point a finger at the energy companies for high gas \nprices, but the reality is that government rules and regulations \ncombined with a complete lack of a national energy policy and \nunfriendly tax rules have kept our refining capacity far short of our \nneed. There are no silver bullets that will bring price relief \nimmediately, but we can act now to start meeting this need.\n  Last year, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham asked the National \nPetroleum Council to make recommendations to improve our oil supply and \nto increase our nation's oil refining capacity. Among the Council's \nrecommendations was a call to adjust the depreciation schedule for new \nrefining equipment from 10 years to five years to make refineries \nconsistent with other manufacturers in the U.S.\n  I believe that the 10-year depreciation schedule is unwarranted, and \nthat it has contributed to a hostile economic environment for \nrefineries. Leveling the playing field on depreciation is long overdue, \nand the Gas Price Reduction Act would accomplish that goal.\n  But it is also important that we see this new refining capacity as \nsoon as possible. So, I have added a provision in my bill aimed at \npushing refining companies to act quickly to increase capacity. For \nrefiners that can commit to starting construction on new refining \nequipment before 2007 and have new facilities built by 2011, the bill \nwould allow a complete write-off for their new equipment in the first \nyear. This is a powerful incentive, and I believe it will capture the \nattention of decision-makers in the refining industry.\n  Again, the goal of the Gas Price Reduction Act is to get results as \nsoon as possible, and I believe my legislation will make a difference. \nThis bill will not bring immediate relief at the pump. But it will \nbegin to put the brakes on escalating prices in the next few years and \nincrease our nation's control over our energy future.\n  There are other good reasons to support this bill.\n  As part of my three-pronged approach to meeting our Nation's energy \nneeds, it is in accord with the President's energy plan.\n  It does not provide a windfall to oil companies but puts refineries \non an equal footing with other industries in the manufacturing sector, \nwhich already have a five-year depreciation.\n  It is important to note that S. 1039 does nothing to weaken our \nstrong environmental laws and regulations; rather, it would lead to \ncleaner technologies as refineries upgrade equipment.\n  This bill is also an essential part of our strategy to increase \ndomestic production. When we begin to realize the potential of our vast \noil shale and tar sands reserves we will need domestic refining \ncapacity to handle any increase in domestic crude oil production.\n  Finally, I must point out that, in the long run, this bill will not \nhave any cost, since refineries are allowed to change the timing of the \ndepreciation of their equipment, but not the amount.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in this important \neffort to increase our refining capacity, lower gas prices for our \ncitizens, and provide for our Nation's security through increased \nenergy independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1040. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide for \nenhanced disclosure under an open end credit plan; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Credit Card \nMinimum Payment Notification Act.\n  Today, 144 million Americans utilize credit cards and charge more \ndebt on those cards than ever before. In 1990, Americans charged $338 \nbillion on credit cards. By 2003, that number had risen to $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  Many Americans now own multiple credit cards. In 2003, 841 million \nbank-issued credit cards were in circulation in the U.S. That number \nbecomes nearly 1.4 billion credit cards, when cards issued by stores \nand oil companies are factored in. That's an average of 5 credit cards \nper person.\n  The proliferation of credit cards can be traced, in part, to a \ndramatic increase in credit card solicitation. In 1993, credit card \ncompanies sent 1.52 billion solicitations to American homes; in 2001, \nthey sent over 5 billion.\n  As one would expect, the increase in credit cards has also yielded an \nincrease in credit card debt. Individuals get 6, 7, or 8 different \ncredit cards, pay only the minimum payment required, and many end up \ndrowning in debt. That happens in case after case.\n  Since 1990, the debt that Americans carry on credit cards has more \nthan tripled, going from about $238 billion in 1990 to $755 billion in \n2004.\n  As a result, the average American household now has about $7,300 of \ncredit card debt.\n  As has been discussed much in this Congress, the number of personal \nbankruptcies has doubled since 1990. Many of these personal \nbankruptcies are people who utilize credit cards. These cards are \nenormously attractive. However, these individual credit card holders \nreceive no information on the impact of compounding interest. They pay \njust the minimum payment. They pay it for 1 year, 2 years--they make \nadditional purchases, they get another card, and another, and another.\n  Unfortunately, these individuals making the minimum payment are \nwitnessing the ugly side of the ``Miracle of Compound Interest.'' After \n2 or 3 years, many find that the interest on the debt is such that they \ncan never repay these cards, and do not know what to do about it.\n  Statistics vary about the number of individuals who make only the \nminimum payments. One study determined that 35 million pay only the \nminimum on their credit cards. In a recent poll, 40 percent of \nrespondents said that they pay the minimum or slightly more. What is \ncertain is that many Americans pay only the minimum, and that paying \nonly the minimum has harsh financial consequences.\n  I suspect that most people would be surprised to know how I much \ninterest can pile up when paying the minimum. Take the average \nhousehold, with $7,300 of credit card debt, and the average credit card \ninterest rate, which in April, before the most recent Federal Reserve \nBoard increase of the prime rate, was 16.75 percent. If only the 2 \npercent minimum payment is made, it will take them 44 years and \n$23,373.90 to pay off the card. And that is if the family doesn't spend \nanother cent on their credit cards--an unlikely assumption. In other \nwords, the family will need to pay over $16,000 in interest to repay \njust $7,300 of principal.\n  For individuals or families with more than average debt, the pitfalls \nare even greater. $20,000 of credit card debt at the average 16.75 \npercent interest rate will take 58 years and $65,415.28 to pay off if \nonly the minimum payments are made.\n  And 16.25 is percent only the average interest rate. The prime rate, \ndespite recent increases, remains relatively low--at 6 percent. \nHowever, interest rates around 20 percent are not uncommon. In fact, \namong the 10 banks that are the largest issuers of credit cards, the \ntop interest rates on credit cards are between 23 and 31 percent--and \nthat does not factor in various penalties and fees. When penalty \ninterest rates are factored in, the highest rates are 41 percent. In \n1990, the highest interest rate--even with penalties, was 22 percent, a \nlittle more than half of what they are today.\n  Even if we assume only a 20 percent interest rate, a family that has \nthe average debt of $7,300 at a 20 percent interest rate and makes the \nminimum payments will need an incredible 76 years and $41,884 to pay \noff that initial $7,300 of debt. That's $34,584 in interest payments--\nmore than 4 times the original debt. And these examples are far from \nextreme.\n  Moreover, these are not merely statistics, but are reflective of very \nreal situations for many people. On March 6, the Washington Post ran a \nheadline story on its front page, entitled ``Credit Card Penalties, \nFees Bury Debtors.'' I would recommend this article to my colleagues, \nbecause it illustrates part of the problem--that credit card companies, \naggressively marketing their products, end up charging outrageous \ninterest and fees to their customers. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be included in the Record. The article highlighted the \nfollowing stories:\n  Ohio resident, Ruth Owens tried for 6 years to pay off a $1,900 \nbalance on her\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nDiscover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492 in monthly \npayments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew to $5,564.28.\n  Virginia resident Josephine McCarthy's Providian Visa bill increased \nto $5,357 in 2 years, even though McCarthy has used the card for only \n$218.16 in purchases and has made monthly payments totaling $3,058.\n  Special-education teacher Fatemeh Hosseini, from my state of \nCalifornia, worked a second job to keep up with the $2,000 in monthly \npayments she collectively sent to five banks to try to pay $25,000 in \ncredit card debt. Even though she had not used the cards to buy \nanything more, her debt had nearly doubled to $49,574 by the time she \nfiled for bankruptcy last June.\n  Unfortunately, these stories are not unique.\n  Part of the problem goes back to changes made in the credit card \nindustry. For a long time, most banks required their customers to pay 5 \npercent of their credit card balance every month. That was before \nAndrew Kahr, a credit card industry consultant, got involved. Mr. Kahr \nrealized that if customers were able to pay less, they would borrow \nmore, and he convinced his clients that they should reduce the minimum \npayment to just 2 percent.\n  The PBS program ``Frontline'', ran a program in November of last year \ntitled ``The Secret History of the Credit Card'' that examined the \nrapid growth of the credit card industry and included an interview with \nMr. Kahr.\n  Mr. Kahr's innovation has been a windfall for the credit card \nindustry. If consumers are paying a lower percentage of their balance \nas the minimum payment, the credit card companies will make more money \nover time. In fact, many in the industry refer to individuals who pay \ntheir credit card bills in full as ``deadbeats'', because they are less \nprofitable than individuals who carry large balances, who are known as \n``revolvers.''\n  And Mr. Kahr's own research showed that just making the minimum \npayment eased consumers' anxiety about carrying large amounts of credit \ncard debt--they believe they are still being financially prudent.\n  The bill I am proposing speaks directly to those types of consumers. \nThere will always be people who cannot afford to pay more than their \nminimum payments. But, there are also a large number of consumers who \ncan afford to pay more but feel comfortable paying the minimum payment \nbecause they don't realize the consequences of doing so.\n  Now I am certainly not trying to demonize credit cards or the credit \ncard industry. Credit cards are an important part of everyday life. \nHowever, I do think that people should understand the dangers of paying \nonly their monthly minimums. In this way individuals will be able to \nact responsibly.\n  It's not necessarily that people don't understand the basics of \ninterest. Most of us just don't realize how fast it compounds or how \nimportant it is to do the math to find out what it means to pay a \nminimum requirement.\n  The bottom line is that for many consumers, the 2 percent minimum \npayment is a financial trap.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act is designed to \nensure that people are not caught in this trap through lack of \ninformation. The bill tracks the language of the amendment originally \nproposed to the Bankruptcy bill that was co-sponsored by Senator Kyl, \nSenator Brownback, and myself.\n  Let me tell you exactly what this bill would do. It would require \ncredit card companies to add two items to each consumer's monthly \ncredit card statement: 1. A notice warning credit card holders that \nmaking only the minimum payment each month will increase the interest \nthey pay and the amount of time it takes to repay their debt; and 2. \nExamples of the amount of time and money required to repay a credit \ncard debt if only minimum payments are made; OR if the consumer makes \nonly minimum payments for six-consecutive months, the amount of time \nand money required to repay the individual's specific credit card debt, \nunder the terms of their credit card agreement.\n  The bill would also require that a toll free number be included on \nstatements that consumers can call to get an estimate of the time and \nmoney required to repay their balance, if only minimum payments are \nmade.\n  And, if the consumer makes only minimum payments for six consecutive \nmonths, they will receive a toll free number to an accredited credit \ncounseling service.\n  The disclosure requirements in this bill would only apply if the I \nconsumer has a minimum payment that is less than 10 percent of the debt \non the credit card, or if their balance is greater than $500. \nOtherwise, none of these disclosures would be required on their \nstatement.\n  The language of this bill comes from a California law, the \n``California Credit Card Payment Warning Act,'' passed in 2001. \nUnfortunately, in 2002, this California law was struck down in U.S. \nDistrict Court as being preempted by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act. The \nTruth in Lending Act was enacted in part because Congress found that, \n``The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost of \nthereof by consumers.'' Consequently, this bill would amend the Truth \nin Lending Act, and would also further its core purpose.\n  These disclosures allow consumers to know exactly what it means for \nthem to carry a balance and only make minimum payments, so they can \nmake informed decisions on credit card use and repayment.\n  The disclosure required by this bill is straightforward how much it \nwill cost to pay off the debt if only minimum payments are made, and \nhow long it will take to do it. As for expense, my staff tells me that \non the website Cardweb.com, there is a free interest calculator that \ndoes these calculations in under a second. Moreover, I am told that \nbanks make these calculations internally to determine credit risk. The \nexpense would be minimal.\n  Percentage rates and balances are constantly changing and each month, \nthe credit card companies are able to assess the minimum payment, late \nfees, over-the-limit fees and finance charges for millions of accounts.\n  If the credit card companies can put in their bills what the minimum \nmonthly payment is, they can certainly figure out how to disclose to \ntheir customers how much it might cost them if they stick to that \nminimum payment.\n  The credit card industry is the most profitable sector of banking, \nand last year it made $30 billion in profits. MBNA's profits alone last \nyear were one-and-a-half times that of McDonald's. Citibank was more \nprofitable than Microsoft and Walmart. I don't think they should have \nany trouble implementing the requirements of this bill.\n  I believe that this is extraordinarily important and that it will \nminimize bankruptcies. With companies charging very substantial \ninterest rates, they have an obligation to let the credit card holder \nknow what those minimum payments really mean. I have people close to me \nI have watched, with 6 or 7 credit cards, and it is impossible for \nthem, over the next 10 or 15 years, to pay off the debt if they \ncontinue making just minimum payments.\n  We now have a bankruptcy bill that has passed into law. I continue to \nbelieve that a bill requiring a limited but meaningful disclosure by \ncredit cards companies is a necessary accompaniment. I think you will \nhave people who are more cautious, which I believe is good for the \nbankruptcy courts in terms of reducing their caseloads, and also good \nfor American consumers.\n  The credit card debt problem facing our Nation is significant. I \nbelieve that this bill is an important step in providing individuals \nwith the information needed to act responsibly, and it does so with a \nminimal burden on the industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 6, 2005]\n\n   Credit Card Penalties, Fees Bury Debtors; Senate Nears Action on \n                            Bankruptcy Curbs\n\n                (By Kathleen Day and Caroline E. Mayer)\n\n       For more than two years, special-education teacher Fatemeh \n     Hosseini worked a second job to keep up with the $2,000 in \n     monthly payments she collectively sent to five banks to try \n     to pay $25,000 in credit card debt.\n       Even though she had not used the cards to buy anything \n     more, her debt had nearly doubled to $49,574 by the time the \n     Sunnyvale,\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\n     Calif., resident filed for bankruptcy last June. That is \n     because Hosseini's payments sometimes were tardy, triggering \n     late fees ranging from $25 to $50 and doubling interest rates \n     to nearly 30 percent. When the additional costs pushed her \n     balance over her credit limit, the credit card companies \n     added more penalties.\n       ``I was really trying hard to make minimum payments,'' said \n     Hosseini, whose financial problems began in the late 1990s \n     when her husband left her and their three children. ``All of \n     my salary was going to the credit card companies, but there \n     was no change in the balances because of that interest and \n     those penalties.''\n       Punitive charges--penalty fees and sharply higher interest \n     rates after a payment is late--compound the problems of many \n     financially strapped consumers, sometimes making it \n     impossible for them to dig their way out of debt and pushing \n     them into bankruptcy.\n       The Senate is to vote as soon as this week on a bill that \n     would make it harder for individuals to wipe out debt through \n     bankruptcy. The Senate last week voted down several \n     amendments intended to curb excessive fees and other \n     practices that critics of the industry say are abusive. House \n     leaders say they will act soon after that, and President Bush \n     has said he supports the bill.\n       Bankruptcy experts say that too often, by the time an \n     individual has filed for bankruptcy or is hauled into court \n     by creditors, he or she has repaid an amount equal to their \n     original credit card debt plus double-digit interest, but \n     still owes hundreds or thousands of dollars because of \n     penalties.\n       ``How is it that the person who wants to do right ends up \n     so worse off?'' Cleveland Municipal Judge Robert J. Triozzi \n     said last fall when he ruled against Discover in the \n     company's breach-of-contract suit against another struggling \n     credit cardholder, Ruth M. Owens.\n       Owens tried for six years to payoff a $1,900 balance on her \n     Discover card, sending the credit company a total of $3,492 \n     in monthly payments from 1997 to 2003. Yet her balance grew \n     to $5,564.28, even though, like Hosseini, she never used the \n     card to buy anything more. Of that total, over-limit penalty \n     fees alone were $1,158.\n       Triozzi denied Discover's claim, calling its attempt to \n     collect more money from Owens ``unconscionable.''\n       The bankruptcy measure now being debated in Congress has \n     been sought for nearly eight years by the credit card \n     industry. Twice in that time, versions of it have passed both \n     the House and Senate. Once, President Bill Clinton refused to \n     sign it, saying it was unfair, and once the House reversed \n     its vote after Democrats attached an amendment that would \n     prevent individuals such as antiabortion protesters from \n     using bankruptcy as a shield against court-imposed fines.\n       Credit card companies and most congressional Republicans \n     say current law needs to be changed to prevent abuse and make \n     more people repay at least part of their debt. Consumer-\n     advocacy groups and many Democrats say people who seek \n     bankruptcy protection do so mostly because they have fallen \n     on hard times through illness, divorce or job loss. They also \n     argue that current law has strong provisions that judges can \n     use to weed out those who abuse the system.\n       Opponents also argue that the legislation is unfair because \n     it ignores loopholes that would allow rich debtors to shield \n     millions of dollars during bankruptcy through expensive homes \n     and complex trusts, while ignoring the need for more \n     disclosure to cardholders about rates and fees and curbs on \n     what they say is irresponsible behavior by the credit card \n     industry. The Republican majority, along with a few \n     Democrats, has voted down dozens of proposed amendments to \n     the bill, including one that would make it easier for the \n     elderly to protect their homes in bankruptcy and another that \n     would require credit card companies to tell customers how \n     much extra interest they would pay over time by making only \n     minimum payments.\n       No one knows how many consumers get caught in the spiral of \n     ``negative amoritization,'' which is what regulators call it \n     when a consumer makes payments but balances continue to \n     grow because of penalty costs. The problem is widespread \n     enough to worry federal bank regulators, who say nearly \n     all major credit card issuers engage in the practice.\n       Two years ago regulators adopted a policy that will require \n     credit card companies to set monthly minimum payments high \n     enough to cover penalties and interest and lower some of the \n     customer's original debt, known as principal, so that if a \n     consumer makes no new charges and makes monthly minimum \n     payments, his or her balance will begin to decline.\n       Banks agreed to the new rules after, in the words of one \n     top federal regulator, ``some arm-twisting.'' But bank \n     executives persuaded regulators to allow the higher minimum \n     payments to be phased in over several years, through 2006, \n     arguing that many customers are so much in debt that even \n     slight increases too soon could push many into financial \n     disaster.\n       Credit card companies declined to comment on specific cases \n     or customers for this article, but banking industry \n     officials, speaking generally, said there is a good reason \n     for the fees they charge.\n       ``It's to encourage people to pay their bills the way they \n     said they would in their contract, to encourage good \n     financial management,'' said Nessa Feddis, senior federal \n     counsel for the American Bankers Association. ``There has to \n     be some onus on the cardholder, some responsibility to manage \n     their finances.''\n       High fees ``may be extreme cases, but they are not the \n     trend, not the norm,'' Feddis said.\n       ``Banks are pretty flexible,'' she said. ``If you are a \n     good customer and have an occasional mishap, they'll waive \n     the fees, because there's so much competition and it's too \n     easy to go someplace else.'' Banks are also willing to work \n     out settlements with people in financial difficulty, she \n     said, because ``there are still a lot of options even for \n     people who've been in trouble.''\n       Many bankruptcy lawyers disagree. James S.K. ``Ike'' \n     Shulman, Hosseini's lawyer, said credit card companies \n     hounded her and did not live up to several promises to work \n     with her to cut mounting fees.\n       Regulators say it is appropriate for lenders to charge \n     higher-risk debtors a higher interest rate, but that negative \n     amortization and other practices go too far, posing risks to \n     the banking system by threatening borrowers' ability to repay \n     their debts and by being unfair to individuals.\n       U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David H. Adams of Norfolk, who is \n     also the president of the National Conference of Bankruptcy \n     Judges, said many debtors who get in over their heads ``are \n     spending money, buying things they shouldn't be buying.'' \n     Even so, he said, ``once you add all these fees on, the \n     amount of principal being paid is negligible. The fees and \n     interest and other charges are so high, they may never be \n     able to pay it off.''\n       Judges say there is little they can do by the time cases \n     get to bankruptcy court. Under the law, ``the credit card \n     company is legally entitled to collect every dollar without a \n     distinction'' whether the balance is from fees, interest or \n     principal, said retired U.S. bankruptcy judge Ronald \n     Barliant, who presided in Chicago. The only question for the \n     courts is whether the debt is accurate, judges and lawyers \n     say.\n       John Rao, staff attorney of the National Consumer Law \n     Center, one of many consumer groups fighting the bankruptcy \n     bill, says the plight consumers face was illustrated last \n     year in a bankruptcy case filed in Northern Virginia.\n       Manassas resident Josephine McCarthy's Providian Visa bill \n     increased to $5,357 from $4,888 in two years, even though \n     McCarthy has used the card for only $218.16 in purchases and \n     has made monthly payments totaling $3,058. Those payments, \n     noted U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stephen S. Mitchell in \n     Alexandria, all went to ``pay finance charges (at a whopping \n     29.99%), late charges, over-limit fees, bad check fees and \n     phone payment fees.'' Mitchell allowed the claim ``because \n     the debtor admitted owing it.'' McCarthy, through her lawyer, \n     declined to be interviewed.\n       Alan Elias, a Providian Financial Corp. spokesman, said: \n     'When consumers sign up for a credit card, they should \n     understand that it's a loan, no different than their mortgage \n     payment or their car payment, and it needs to be repaid. And \n     just like a mortgage payment and a car payment, if you are \n     late you are assessed a fee.'' The 29.99 percent interest \n     rate, he said, is the default rate charged to consumers ``who \n     don't meet their obligation to pay their bills on time'' and \n     is clearly disclosed on account applications.\n       Feddis, of the banker's association, said the nature of \n     debt means that interest will often end up being more than \n     the original principal. ``Anytime you have a loan that's \n     going to extend for any period of time, the interest is going \n     to accumulate. Look at a 30-year-mortgage. The interest is \n     much, much more than the principal.''\n       Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American \n     Bankruptcy Institute, a nonpartisan research group, said that \n     focusing on late fees is ``refusing to look at the elephant \n     in the room, and that's the massive levels of consumer debt \n     which is not being paid. People are living right up to the \n     edge,'' failing to save so when they lose a second job or \n     overtime, face medical expense or their family breaks up, \n     they have no money to cope.\n       ``Late fees aren't the cause of debt,'' he said.\n       Credit card use continues to grow, with an average of 6.3 \n     bank credit cards and 6.3 store credit cards for every \n     household, according to Cardweb.com Inc., which monitors the \n     industry. Fifteen years ago, the averages were 3.4 bank \n     credit cards and 4.1 retail credit cards per household.\n       Despite, or perhaps because of, the large increase in \n     cards, there is a ``fee feeding frenzy,'' among credit card \n     issuers, said Robert McKinley, Cardweb's president and chief \n     executive. ``The whole mentality has really changed over the \n     last several years,'' with the industry imposing fees and \n     increasing interest rates if a single payment is late.\n       Penalty interest rates usually are about 30 percent, with \n     some as high as 40 percent, while late fees now often are $39 \n     a month, and over-limit fees, about $35, McKinley said. ``If \n     you drag that out for a year, it could be very damaging,'' he \n     said. ``Late and over-limit fees alone can easily rack up \n     $900 in fees, and a 30 percent interest rate on a $3,000 \n     balance can add another $1 ,000, so you could go from $2,000 \n     to $5,000 in just one year if you fail to make payments.''\n       According to R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers, a California \n     credit card consulting firm, banks collected $14.8 billion in \n     penalty fees last year, or 10.9 percent of revenue, up\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\n     from $10.7 billion, or 9 percent of revenue, in 2002, the \n     first year the firm began to track penalty fees.\n       The way the fees are now imposed, ``people would be better \n     off if they stopped paying'' once they get in over their \n     heads, said T. Bentley Leonard, a North Carolina bankruptcy \n     attorney. Once you stop paying, creditors write off the debt \n     and sell it to a debt collector. ``They may harass you, but \n     your balance doesn't keep rising. That's the irony.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1041. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo \nPlascencia Lopez and his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican \nnationals living in San Bruno, CA.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, \nwithout this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much \nlonger.\n  In the seventeen years that the Plascencias have been here, they have \nworked to adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels, \nonly to have their efforts thwarted by inattentive legal counsel.\n  Repeatedly, the Plascencia's lawyer refused to return their calls or \notherwise communicate with them in any way, thereby leaving them in the \ndark. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even \nnotify the Plascencias that he had them. Because of the poor \nrepresentation they received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware \nthat they had been ordered to leave the country fifteen days prior to \ntheir deportation. Although the family was stunned and devastated by \nthis discovery, they acted quickly to fire their attorney for gross \nincompetence, secure competent counsel, and file the appropriate \npaperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any other legal \naction could be taken.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed \nfrom the United States.\n  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. \nPlascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded \ncouple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to family \nand devotion to community.\n  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's \nShellfish for the past 13 years, where his dedication and willingness \nto learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial \nposition. He now oversees the market's entire packing operation and \nseveral employees. The President of Vince's Shellfish, in one of the \nseveral dozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, \nreferred to him as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles \nhimself in a very professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' \nto other employees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. \nPlascencia's job performance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' \n``trusted,'' ``honest'' and ``reliable.''\n  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as \na medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. \nNot satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia \nwent to school, earned her high school equivalency degree, improved her \nskills and became a medical assistant.\n\n  For four years, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's \nOncology Department, where she attended to cancer patients. Her \ncolleagues, many of whom have written to me in support of her, commend \nher ``unending enthusiasm'' and have described her work as \n``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.'' In fact, Kaiser \nPermanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse Rose Carino, wrote to \nsay that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the community and exemplifies \nthe virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, \ntrustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her community. She and her \nfamily are a solid example of the type of immigrant that America should \nwelcome wholeheartedly.'' Nurse Carino went on to write that Mrs. \nPlascencia is ``an excellent employee and role model for her \ncolleagues. She works in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued \nand depended on by the physicians she works with.'' The physicians \nthemselves confirm this. For example, Dr. Laurie Weisberg, the Chief of \nOncology at Kaiser Permanente, writes that Mrs. Plascencia ``is truly \nan asset to our unit and is one of the main reasons that it functions \neffectively.''\n  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional \nsuccesses to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. \nThey saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health \ncare benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want \nto send their children to college and give them an even better life.\n  This private relief bill is important because it would preserve these \nachievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to \nmake substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is \nimportant, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the \ncouple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and each of \nwhom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay \nArea community.\n  Christina, 13, is the Plascencia's oldest child, and an honor student \nwith a 3.0 grade-point average at Parkside Intermediate School in San \nBruno.\n  Erika, 9, and Alfredo, Jr., 7, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, \nwhere they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and \ngood grades from their teachers. In fact, last year, the principal of \nErika's school recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her \nclass. Recently, Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report \ncard, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''\n  The Plascencia's youngest child is 2-year-old Daisy.\n  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be most \ntragic for their children. Children who were born in the United States \nand who through no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation \nthat has the potential to alter their lives dramatically.\n  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencia's older children--\nChristina, Erika and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They \nare old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their \nteachers, their friends and their home. They would leave everything \nthat is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico \nwithout a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate \nto a different culture, language and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave \ntheir children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which \nno parents should have to make.\n  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are \nnot my own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with \nthe Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the \nAmerican spirit. I have sponsored this private relief bill, and ask my \ncolleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that \nwe must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to \nleave the United States would extinguish that spirit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private relief bill and \nthe numerous letters of support my office has received from members of \nthe San Bruno community be the printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALFREDO PLASCENCIA \n                   LOPEZ AND MARIA DEL REFUGIO PLASCENCIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia shall each \n     be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of that Act \n     or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and \n     Maria Del Refugio Plascencia enter the United States before \n     the filing deadline specified in subsection (c),\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n     Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia \n     shall be considered to have entered and remained lawfully and \n     shall be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of immigrant visas or the application for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Alfredo \n     Plascencia Lopez and Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 2, during the current or next following fiscal \n     year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives of the country of the aliens' birth \n     under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that \n     are made available to natives of the country of the aliens' \n     birth under section 202(e) of that Act.\n\n\n                                  Vince's Shellfish Co., Inc.,\n\n                                  San Bruno, CA, January 12, 2005.\n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of \n     Maria and Alfredo Plascencia from San Bruno, California. \n     Alfredo has worked for me at Vince's Shellfish Co. Inc. for \n     the past 13 years. Alfredo is well respected here at Vinces. \n     Alfredo is a very reliable, dependable individual who has \n     worked his way up and is now a foreman who is in charge of \n     our packing department. Alfredo is responsible for 10 \n     employees at this time.\n       On a personal basis, Alfredo is a fine father. He is trying \n     desperately to keep his family together. It has been a 15-\n     year struggle for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to create a better \n     life in America for their four U.S. born children. If Mr. and \n     Mrs. Plascencia were to face deportation it would be \n     devastating for his four children.\n       At this time I support the private bill that is to be \n     presented before the Senate at the end of this month. The \n     Plascencia family will greatly benefit from its passing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Christopher N. Svedisc,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    The Permanente\n\n\n                                          Medical Group, Inc.,\n\n                       South San Francisco, CA., January 13, 2005.\n     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria del Refugio Plascencia\n\n     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to you in representation of \n     the Oncology department staff at Kaiser Permanente So. San \n     Francisco. We are shocked to hear the events regarding Maria \n     and Alfredo's United States residency status and we are \n     convinced that it could not be due to any omissions on their \n     part. We have the pleasure and good fortune of working with \n     Maria for over four years and she has always distinguished \n     herself for her intelligence, and good judgment. She is truly \n     an asset to our unit and is one of the main reasons that it \n     functions effectively and to the betterment of our patients. \n     This letter is a plea to ask you to reconsider the \n     deportation of this young couple. Their four children, who \n     are all United States citizens, do not need to suffer this \n     ordeal, which seems to be a horrible nightmare. They deserve \n     to stay in America, as these are the kind of citizens that we \n     should welcome with open arms. Maria and Alfredo save and \n     spend their money wisely. They have been able to save enough \n     to buy a home for their family in our community. We can't \n     even imagine their loss, as well as ours, if Maria and \n     Alfredo are required to leave the United States. They both \n     love our country and they support it with their heart and \n     soul.\n       Maria seems to have an unending energy and enthusiasm \n     volunteering numerous hours at her church, the community, as \n     well as working full time in a fast paced medical \n     environment, caring for her four children and attending \n     college to continue her education to become a registered \n     nurse. Maria and Alfredo are raising four exceptional \n     children who are excelling in school and extracurricular \n     activities. It would cause an immeasurable hardship on these \n     children if their parents are not allowed to stay in the \n     United States. Therefore, we ask you please allow them to \n     stay so that their children can continue with their education \n     and their lives. The effect on their children would be \n     emotionally and mentally severe and it would seem unfair to \n     all to allow this situation to happen to people who deserve \n     to be in this country.\n       We will like for our plea to be heard by the members of the \n     Senate and for them to consider the acceptance of the private \n     bill on behalf of this family. Please consider the high \n     regard that Maria and Alfredo have earned with their fellow \n     workers when making the determination regarding of their \n     residency status.\n           Sincerely,\n         Laurie Weisberg, M.D. Chief of Oncology, Edmond \n           Schmulbach, M.D. Oncology Specialist, William Huang, \n           M.D. Oncology Specialist, Kelly Sutter, RNNP Oncology, \n           Jodie L.

I have known this family for over ten \n     years as the Principal of Belle Air Elementary School. I have \n     the utmost respect for the parents and their family values. \n     The children are wonderful. They are well taken care of and \n     are well adjusted. I am so worried that if they are separated \n     from their parents the affect of the separation will cause \n     reprievable damage to their well being. I have personally \n     counseled the children during the drama of the possible \n     deportment of their parents. I saw the deep sadness and worry \n     that the stress caused. I know that parents wanted a better \n     life for their children and have worked very hard to \n     actualize that. To take the parents and or move this family \n     would be tragic. There are so many undeserving people who \n     will stay in the United States that should leave and be sent \n     back to their countries. But this family is not one. They are \n     a picture of the American dream. They work hard, support \n     their family, church and community. Their children have grown \n     to be proud American citizens. The oldest daughter Christy is \n     an honor student and a cheerleader at Parkside Middle School \n     and a graduate of Belle Air. Christy's brother and sister, \n     Alfredo and Erica, are both on our school's student council. \n     They too, are very bright students.\n       Please do not let an injustice of deportment happen to this \n     family. Please assist them and keep them a family unit. We \n     have so many children hurt and scared already in the world. \n     Please do not add these children and this family to the \n     numbers. This family and these children are what help keep \n     American values and traditions alive. I came from an \n     immigrant family and have made it my mission to give back to \n     others by working in education and that is why I am \n     personally writing this letter because I know what family, \n     hard work, and love can do to produce productive adults and \n     citizens.\n       Please find it in your heart, to help this family.\n       If you need to speak with me personally feel free to \n     contact me.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                Angela M. Addiego,\n     Belle Air School, Principal.\n                                  ____\n\n         Mensajeros de Cristo, Comunidad de Oracion y \n           Evangelizacion, All Souls Parish,\n                              San Francisco, CA, January 13, 2005.\n     Sen.

While we are certainly aware of the laws of this \n     country we believe that this is a time when we should do \n     everything possible to allow legal residency so this family \n     can stay in this country.\n       We urge you to afford the Plascencia family whatever \n     consideration possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Larry Franzela,\n       Mayor.\n     Jim Ruane,\n       Vice Mayor.\n     Chris Pallas,\n       Councilmember.\n     Irene O'Connell,\n       Councilmember.\n     Ken Ibarra,\n       Councilmember.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           St. Bruno's Church,\n\n                                  San Bruno, CA, January 13, 2005.\n     Sen. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       The purpose of this letter is to present my observations on \n     Alfredo Placencia Lopez and Maria Placencia's character and \n     work ethic. I first came to know them in our Church when they \n     came to worship on a Sunday. This happened around January \n     1998.\n       And so far, the last 7 years both Alfredo and Maria have \n     been two of our outstanding parishioners at St. Bruno's \n     Church. They come to Sunday Mass and worship, and have been \n     involved in many ministries and services here in our Church \n     at St. Bruno's. Alfredo has been especially a minister of \n     hospitality, always welcoming people to church and \n     participation in the life of the community, helping to \n     provide a spirit of acceptance and concern among our people \n     and providing bread and refreshments for some gatherings. \n     Alfredo has also reached out to the homeless for whom we have \n     a shelter in our Parish and especially providing them with \n     food. Maria has been especially involved as a teacher, \n     faithfully giving to our children the fundamentals of our \n     Faith, of the Gospel and of a Christian moral life. She has \n     founded a Children's Choir and leads them with our Special \n     Music for Sunday worship. They have four children all of whom \n     have been baptized at St. Bruno's Church and come to our \n     School of Religion and our Church.\n       Alfredo and Maria have been most generous with their time, \n     their talents and their money, sharing all these with the \n     members of our Church Community. They have also frequently \n     donated food to the Church and to the Pastor. I have found \n     them to be really good Christian people, most generous, \n     considerate, kind, honest and reliable. If they would have to \n     leave the United States, it will be most difficult for them \n     and for their children who have been growing in a Christian \n     environment and are doing so well; it would be a tremendous \n     loss. We too here in our Church would find it difficult \n     without them. For they are a great asset to this country and \n     to our Church and to many people.\n       We appreciate whatever you can do for them to help them get \n     their legal papers of residence in the United States.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Rene Gomez,\n     Pastor of St. Bruno's Church.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                San Bruno, CA,\n\n                                                 January 13, 2005.\n     Re Alfredo Placencia Lopez and/or Maria Del Refugio \n         Placencia.\n\n       To Whom It May Concern: My name is Elisa Alvarez. Alfredo \n     and Maria Placencia and Family are my neighbors and friends, \n     I have known them since 1999. They live on 3rd Ave. and I \n     live on 4th. Since I have known them I saw that they are a \n     very close and spiritual family. I enjoyed their company \n     because they have been a great example of how a close family \n     they are and how spiritual they are. They are great parents \n     and they love and are very close with the rest of their \n     family. They always go every where together as a family, you \n     never see them without each other. They always get together \n     with the rest of their relatives they are very close family. \n     They invited me one night to a prayer group and even offered \n     to pick me up and take me and bring me home when I was going \n     through some hard times. This experience was so moving, and \n     it help me and my whole life changed from that day on. I have \n     became very spiritual thanks to the Alfredo and Maria. I met \n     them at St. Bruno's Church. They always do voluntary work at \n     the church they both do so much for our parish and are always \n     willing to help anyone who needs it.\n       If Alfredo and Maria are separated from their children and \n     family it will be very hard for their children to be with out \n     their parents or I know if they all go to Mexico it will be \n     very hard for this family to survive there. I hope you can \n     help them by not separating this family, they are hard \n     workers and I'm sure they would never be a burden for this \n     country. This is a very nice young family, you don't see \n     families like this one these days. I hope everything can be \n     done so Alfredo and Maria can get their permanent residency \n     and their lives can get back to normal and . they don't have \n     to suffer from this bad roller coaster.\n       Thank you for your attention to this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elisa Alvarez.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5230-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 142--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nUNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD BRING A CASE BEFORE THE WORLD \n TRADE ORGANIZATION REGARDING THE VIOLATIONS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n                RIGHTS BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 33\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     many whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 a significant number of the nations of the \n     world adopted the International Convention for the Regulation \n     of Whaling, which established the International Whaling \n     Commission to provide for the proper conservation of whale \n     stocks;\n       Whereas in 2003 the Commission established a Conservation \n     Committee, open to all members of the Commission, for the \n     purpose of facilitating efficient and effective coordination \n     and development of conservation recommendations and \n     activities, which are fully consistent with the conservation \n     objectives stated in the 1946 Convention;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of whale stocks, many of which had been hunted to near \n     extinction by the commercial whaling' industry;\n       Whereas the rights of indigenous people to whale for \n     subsistence purposes has been specifically recognized under \n     the 1946 Convention;\n       Whereas the Commission has desigl1ated the Indian Ocean and \n     part of the ocean around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas two member nations that lodged objections to the \n     Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling when it was \n     adopted continue to hold such objections, a third member \n     nation asserted a reservation to the moratorium on rejoining \n     the Commission, and one member nation is currently \n     conducting commercial whaling operations in spite of the \n     moratorium and the protests of other nations;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to halt commercial \n     whaling activities conducted under reservation to the \n     moratorium and to refrain from issuing special permits for \n     research involving the killing of whales;\n       Whereas one member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas one member nation has recently begun to conduct \n     unnecessary lethal scientific whaling in the Atlantic;\n       Whereas whale meat and blubber is being sold commercially \n     from whales killed pursuant to such unnecessary lethal \n     scientific whaling, further undermining the moratorium on \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal research and recognizes the importance \n     of demonstrating and expanding the use of non-lethal \n     scientific research methods;\n       Whereas more than 8,700 whales have been killed in lethal \n     scientific whaling programs since the adoption of the \n     commercial whaling moratorium and the lethal take of whales \n     under scientific permits has increased both in quantity and \n     species, with species now including minke, Bryde's, sei, and \n     sperm whales, and media reports indicate a new plan may be \n     offered that could expand such whaling to fin and humpback \n     whales;\n       Whereas engaging in commercial whaling under reservation \n     and lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation \n     program of the Commission;\n       Whereas discussions are taking place within the Commission \n     on a Revised Management Scheme (RMS) that would regulate any \n     possible future commercial whaling;\n       Whereas any decision to lift the moratorium against \n     commercial whaling must be taken independently from \n     negotiations and adoption of an RMS;\n       Whereas any RMS must include or be conditioned on the \n     concurrent adoption of provisions similar to those in other \n     international agreements related to fisheries and marine \n     mammals, including transparent and neutral observer \n     mechanisms, and effective compliance and dispute settlement \n     mechanisms;\n       Whereas to be effective, if an RMS is adopted, any future \n     commercial whaling must take place pursuant to the RMS, and \n     no reservations allowing commercial whaling outside of the \n     RMS should be permitted; and\n       Whereas any decision to lift the moratorium against \n     commercial whaling must be conditioned on the immediate \n     cessation of lethal scientific whaling: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring) That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) at the 57th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling and any \n     linking of adoption of a Revised Management Scheme (RMS) to \n     the lifting of the commercial whaling moratorium;\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (C) seek to ensure that any RMS includes, or is conditioned \n     on the concurrent adoption of provisions similar to those in \n     other international agreements related to fisheries and \n     marine mammals, including transparent and neutral observer \n     mechanisms, and effective compliance and dispute settlement \n     mechanisms;\n       (D) insist that any future commercial whaling must take \n     place pursuant to the RMS, that no reservations allowing \n     commercial whaling outside of the RMS should be permitted, \n     and that lethal scientific whaling must immediately cease \n     upon the commencement of any commercial whaling;\n       (E) uphold the rights of indigenous people to whale for \n     subsistence purposes, and firmly reject any attempts to \n     compromise such rights or to equate commercial whaling with \n     such rights;\n       (F) initiate or support efforts to end the lethal taking of \n     whales for scientific purposes, seek support for expanding \n     the use of non-lethal research methods, and seek to end the \n     sale of whale meat and blubber from whales killed for \n     unnecessary lethal scientific research;\n       (G) support proposals for the permanent protection of whale \n     populations through the establishment of whale sanctuaries \n     and other zones of protection in which commercial whaling is \n     prohibited;\n       (H) support efforts to expand data collection on whale \n     populations, monitor and reduce whale bycatch and other \n     incidental impacts, and otherwise expand whale conservation \n     efforts;\n       (I) support the adoption of an active program of work by \n     the Conservation Committee to address the full range of \n     threats to whales, and otherwise expand whale conservation \n     efforts;\n       (J) call upon the Contracting Parties to the Convention to \n     submit to the Commission for discussion within the \n     Conservation Committee national approaches, including laws, \n     regulations and other initiatives, that further the \n     conservation of cetaceans; and\n       (2) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, Federal law, relevant \n     international laws and agreements, and other appropriate \n     mechanisms to implement the goals set forth in paragraph (1).\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nFisheries and Coast Guard of the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, I am pleased to join the chair of the Subcommittee, \nSenator Snowe, in submitting a resolution regarding the policy of the \nUnited States at the upcoming 57th Annual Meeting of the International \nWhaling Commission (IWC). I wish to also thank my colleagues Mr. \nMcCain, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Biden, Ms. Boxer, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Feinstein, Mr. Pryor, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Lieberman for co-sponsoring \nas well.\n  Recognizing that whales are highly migratory and therefore require \ninternational cooperation for their preservation, the IWC was formed in \n1946 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. \nIn 1982, due to the severe impacts of whaling on the populations of \nlarge whale species, the IWC adopted an indefinite moratorium on all \ncommercial whaling.\n  Despite the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, significant whaling \nhas continued. In particular, Japan and Iceland have been using a \nprovision in the Convention--which allows countries to issue themselves \npermits for ``scientific whaling''--to kill whales in the name of \nscience, and later sell the meat commercially. More than 8700 whales \nhave been killed in lethal scientific whaling programs since the \nadoption of the commercial whaling moratorium, and press reports \nindicate that a new plan may be offered that would expand such whaling \nto fin and humpback whales. The IWC Scientific Committee has repeatedly \nstated that such lethal takes are not necessary for scientific \nresearch.\n  In this resolution we call on the U.S. delegation to remain firmly \nopposed to commercial whaling. We urge the U.S. to initiate or support \nefforts to oppose the unnecessary lethal taking of whales for \nscientific purposes and to seek to end the sale of meat and blubber \nfrom whales killed for scientific research in order to remove this \nperverse incentive.\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\n  This resolution comes at a time when discussions are underway in the \nIWC to establish a framework, or ``revised management scheme'' for any \nfuture commercial whaling, should it ever occur. The resolution calls \nfor the U.S. delegation to the IWC to insist that any RMS negotiations \nremain separate from discussions on whether to lift the moratorium on \ncommercial whaling, and that any such RMS include provisions on \naccountability, transparency, and compliance that are part of all \neffective international agreements. It further calls on the U.S. \ndelegation to insist, as part of the RMS language, that lethal \nscientific whaling immediately cease upon the commencement of any \ncommercial whaling. The resolution also firmly recognizes the rights of \nindigenous people to whale for subsistence purposes, and calls on the \nU.S. delegation to firmly reject any attempts to compromise such rights \nor to equate commercial whaling with such rights.\n  In order to ensure future abundance and health of whale populations, \nwe call on the U.S. to support the work of the Conservation Committee, \nand to otherwise expand whale conservation efforts. The resolution \ncalls for the U.S. delegation to support the permanent protection of \nwhale populations through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in \nwhich commercial whaling is prohibited. Finally, the resolution directs \nthe U.S. to make full use of all appropriate mechanisms to change the \nbehavior of other nations which are undermining the protection of these \nmagnificent creatures.\n  I would like to again thank chairwoman Snowe for collaborating with \nme on this important effort, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that is \nboth timely and vital to the future of the world's large whale \npopulations. In little more than a month, representatives from around \nthe world will gather in South Korea for the 57th annual meeting of the \nInternational Whaling Commission. These representatives will consider \nproposals to weaken or lift the moratorium on commercial whaling and \nexpand whaling operations around the globe. It is more critical than \never that the United States remains firmly opposed to any proposals to \nresume commercial whaling and maintain its leadership role in shaping \nglobal whale conservation policies through the Commission.\n  The Commission's early attempts to regulate commercial whaling did \nnot stop the precipitous decline of whale populations around the world. \nThis management failure exposed a dramatic lack of knowledge and \nunderstanding of whales and their environment. In response to dwindling \nwhale populations, the Commission declared a global moratorium on \ncommercial whaling in 1982. The United States was a leader in the \nefforts to establish this moratorium, and in the intervening decades we \nhave continued our outspoken opposition to commercial whaling.\n  My colleagues and I are submitting this resolution to give needed \nsupport to the U.S. negotiators as they strive to preserve vital whale \nconservation measures through the International Whaling Commission. \nPro-whaling countries have made clear, through numerous media outlets, \nthat they plan to work to lift the moratorium at this year's meeting, a \nmove that threatens to undo years of international efforts to recover \nwhale populations. As a Nation we must stand firmly against lifting of \nthe moratorium and the resumption of commercial whaling. But we cannot \nstop there. As we continue our international efforts for effective, \nglobal whale conservation we must work to close loopholes in, and end \nabuses of, Commission regulations. This resolution calls for the \nclosing of a scientific whaling loophole that some countries are \nexploiting to allow whaling, not just in the open ocean, but in \ndesignated whale sanctuaries. Lethal scientific whaling is an outdated \nconcept that serves no useful purpose; even the Commission's own \nScientific Committee has called for the cessation of this practice. In \naddition to the scientific whaling provision, some countries choose to \ntake reservations to the moratorium under which they continue to expand \ncommercial whaling activities year after year. These unilateral actions \nweaken the Commission and undermine international whale conservation \nefforts; therefore, they must be brought to an end.\n  We must consider the future as we strive to ensure the sustainability \nof the world's whale populations. At this year's meeting, the \nCommission may address the critical issue of a Revised Management \nScheme, or RMS, to govern whale conservation in future years. As we \nconsider possible management systems, it is imperative that we build \nany RMS on a solid foundation of scientific knowledge and \nsustainability. If our Nation is to support any RMS, we must ensure \nthat it addresses the need for additional research and ensure that all \nwhaling outside the scheme ceases immediately. Any RMS that we are \nparty to must also include provisions that we find in other \ninternational fisheries agreements, such as transparency in decision \nmaking, objective observers, and effective compliance mechanisms.\n  I thank my colleagues who have already signed on as co-sponsors of \nthis resolution for their continuing commitment to marine conservation: \nSenators Cantwell, Levin, Kennedy, McCain, Lieberman, Kerry, Collins, \nBiden, Jeffords, Dodd, Lautenberg, Reed, Wyden, Boxer, Feinstein, \nPryor, and Akaka. Their dedication to responsible protection and \nmanagement of our whale populations helps ensure the healthy \nfunctioning of marine ecosystems for generations to come.\n  Whales constitute a vital component of the world's marine ecosystems. \nWhales are some of the largest and most intelligent mammals on Earth, \nand conserving them requires us to uphold strong international \nagreements and an unwavering commitment to science-based management. \nSupporting whale conservation is more critical now than ever, and I \nurge my colleagues to support swift passage of this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5232-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 761.

Mr. President, as in executive session I ask unanimous \nconsent the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \nconventions transmitted to the Senate on May 16, 2005, by the President \nof the United States: Convention Concerning Migratory Fish Stock in the \nPacific Ocean (Treaty Document 109-1); and Convention Strengthening the \nInter-American Tuna Commission (Treaty Document 109-2).\n  I further ask the conventions be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and the \nPresident's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation \nand Management of the Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and \nCentral Pacific Ocean, with Annexes (the ``WCPF Convention''), which \nwas adopted at Honolulu on September 5, 2000, by the Multilateral High \nLevel Conference on the Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and \nCentral Pacific Ocean. The United States signed the Convention on that \ndate. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of \nthe Secretary of State with respect to the WCPF Convention.\n  The WCPF Convention sets forth legal obligations and establishes \ncooperative mechanisms that are needed in order to ensure the long-term \nconservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks (such \nas tuna, swordfish, and marlin) that range across extensive areas of \nthe high seas as well as through waters under the fisheries \njurisdiction of numerous coastal States. These constitute resources of \nworldwide importance, with the fisheries for tuna in the Western and \nCentral Pacific being the largest and most valuable in the world. \nImplementation of the WCPF Convention will offer the opportunity to \nconserve and manage these resources responsibly before they become \nsubject to the pressures of overfishing and over-capacity that are so \nevident elsewhere in the world's oceans.\n  The WCPF Convention builds upon the 1982 United Nations Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea and the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the \nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \nMigratory Fish Stocks. The WCPF Convention gives effect to the \nprovisions of these two instruments, which recognize cooperation to \nconserve highly migratory fish stocks as essential, and require those \nwith direct interests in them coastal States with authority to manage \nfishing in waters under their jurisdiction and nations whose vessels \nfish for these stocks to engage in such cooperation through regional \nfishery management organizations.\n  The WCPF Convention balances in an equitable fashion the interests of \ncoastal States, notably the island States that comprise the Forum \nFisheries Agency (FFA), in protecting important fishery resources off \ntheir shores, and the interests of distant water fishing States, \nnotably Asian fishing nations and entities (Japan, Republic of Korea, \nChina, and Taiwan), whose fishing vessels range far from their own \nshores.\n  The United States, which played an instrumental role in achieving \nthis balance, has direct and important interests in the WCPF Convention \nand its early and effective implementation. The United States is both a \nmajor distant water fishing nation (with the fourth-largest catch in \nthe region) and an important coastal State with significant Exclusive \nEconomic Zone waters in the region (including the waters around Hawaii, \nAmerican Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands).\n  United States fishing concerns, including the U.S. tuna industry, \nU.S. conservation organizations, and U.S. consumers, as well as those \nresidents of Hawaii and the U.S. Flag Pacific island areas of Guam, \nAmerican Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, all have a crucial \nstake in the health of the oceans and their resources as promoted by \nthe WCPF Convention.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe WCPF Convention and give its advice and consent to its \nratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, May 16, 2005.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Convention for the Strengthening \nof the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission established by the 1949 \nConvention between the United States of America and the Republic of \nCosta Rica, with Annexes, (the ``Antigua Convention''), which was \nadopted on June 27, 2003, in Antigua, Guatemala, by the Parties to the \n1949 Convention. The United States signed the Antigua Convention on \nNovember 14, 2003. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, \nthe report of the Secretary of State with respect to the Antigua \nConvention, with an enclosure.\n  The Antigua Convention sets forth the legal obligations and \nestablishes the cooperative mechanisms necessary for the long-term \nconservation and sustainable use of the highly migratory fish stocks \n(such as tuna and swordfish) of the Eastern Pacific Ocean that range \nacross extensive areas of the high seas as well as through waters under \nthe fisheries jurisdiction of numerous coastal States. Once in force, \nthe Antigua Convention will replace the original 1949 Convention \nestablishing the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). \nRevisions to the 1949 Convention will strengthen the mandate of the \nIATTC to reflect changes in the law governing living marine resources \nsince the adoption of the original Convention more than 50 years ago.\n  The highly migratory fish stocks governed by the Antigua Convention \nconstitute an important economic resource for the countries of the \nregion and vital components of the marine ecosystem of the Eastern \nPacific Ocean requiring careful conservation and management. Early \nentry into force\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nand implementation of the Antigua Convention will offer the opportunity \nto strengthen conservation and management of these resources in \nimportant ways, including through enhanced efforts to ensure compliance \nand enforcement of agreed conservation and management measures.\n  The Antigua Convention draws upon relevant provisions of the 1982 \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the ``LOS \nConvention'') and the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the Conservation \nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \nStocks (the ``U.N. Fish Stocks Agreement''). The Antigua Convention \ngives effect to the provisions of the LOS Convention and U.N. Fish \nStocks Agreement that recognize as essential, and require cooperation \nto conserve highly migratory fish stocks through regional fishery \nmanagement organizations, by those with direct interests in them--\ncoastal States with authority to manage fishing in waters under their \njurisdiction and those nations and entities whose vessels fish for \nthese stocks.\n  The United States, which played an instrumental role in negotiation \nof the revised Convention, has direct and important interests in the \nAntigua Convention and its early and effective implementation. United \nStates fishing concerns, including the U.S. tuna industry, U.S. \nconservation organizations, and U.S. consumers, as well as those people \nwho reside in those U.S. States bordering the Convention Area, have \ncrucial stakes in the health of the oceans and their resources as \npromoted by the Antigua Convention.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Antigua Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 143, which was submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 143) to authorize Senate Legal \n     Counsel to appear in legal proceedings in the name of the \n     Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in connection with \n     its investigation into the United Nations' ``Oil-For-Food'' \n     Programme.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \nrepresentation in a civil action pending in Federal District Court in \nthe District of Columbia. In this case, the United Nations is seeking \nto prevent an individual from complying with subpoenas for testimony \nand documents issued by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nand other congressional committees in connection with their inquiries \ninto allegations of fraud and corruption in the United Nations Oil for \nFood Program. The individual at issue, Mr. Robert Parton, is an \ninvestigator formerly associated with the Independent Inquiry \nCommittee, an entity formed by the United Nations to conduct its own \ninvestigation into the program. The United Nations contends that its \nprivileges and immunities, and its contracts with Mr. Parton, bar him \nfrom complying with the subcommittee's subpoenas.\n  Mr. President, subcommittee staff has been discussing for some time \nwith United Nations and IIC counsel their concerns regarding United \nNations privileges and how any such privileges might be accommodated \nconsistent with the investigative needs of the subcommittee. The \nsubcommittee does not desire adversely to affect the IIC's ongoing \ninvestigation of the Oil-for-Food Program. However, the subcommittee \nbelieves that it is possible for Mr. Parton to provide information \nneeded by the subcommittee in the fulfillment of its responsibilities \nwithout doing so.\n  In the event, however, that the subcommittee's negotiations with the \nUnited Nations and the IIC do not resolve this matter, the enclosed \nresolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel, when directed by the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, or by the chairman and \nranking minority member, acting jointly, to appear in the name of the \nsubcommittee as amicus curiae, intervenor, applicant or respondent in \nUnited Nations v. Robert Parton or any related action or proceeding.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 143) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 143\n\n       Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is \n     conducting an inquiry into the United Nations' ``Oil-for-\n     Food'' Programme;\n       Whereas, the Subcommittee has need to obtain access to \n     evidence from an individual formerly associated with the \n     Independent Inquiry Committee, a committee formed by the \n     United Nations to investigate claims relating to the \n     Programme;\n       Whereas, in the course of the Subcommittee's efforts to \n     obtain access to such evidence, legal issues may arise \n     requiring the Subcommittee to appear in the courts of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, pursuant to section 703(c), 706(a), and 713(a) of \n     the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. 288b(c), \n     288e(a), and 288l(a), the Senate may direct its Counsel to \n     appear as amicus curiae or to intervene in the name of a \n     subcommittee of the Senate in any legal actions in which the \n     powers and responsibilities of Congress under the \n     Constitution are placed in issue: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized, when \n     directed by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, or \n     by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, acting jointly, \n     to appear in the name of the Subcommittee as amicus curiae, \n     intervenor, applicant or respondent in United Nations v. \n     Robert Parton or any other related action or proceeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/16/senate-section/article/S5247-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 17, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
