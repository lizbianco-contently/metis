I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased we have had a good week of \ndebate on the bankruptcy bill, which I believe is a very important \npiece of legislation. It is something this Congress has a \nresponsibility to deal with since bankruptcy procedures are Federal \ncourt procedures and bankruptcy judges, although not article III \njudges, are Federal judges.\n  The court system, over the last 20, 30 years, has grown incredibly. \nWe have gone from a few hundred thousand bankruptcies a year, to 1.6 \nmillion personal bankruptcies in 2003. It has been driven by a lot of \nthings. Some say it is economic problems, but our economy compared to \nother times has not been as bad. We have had some tough years, but we \nhave also had some good years. We have seen bankruptcies exceeding \neverything that could be based on the economy. I suspect a good part of \nit is because of the advertising of lawyers in the newspapers.\n  People who have built up some debt and are having a hard time dealing \nwith it, and creditors are calling, they see an ad that says something \nlike this: Come on down. We can take care of those debts and help you. \nSo people have been filing bankruptcies at a record pace, caused \nsomewhat by these ads. Many of the people work their way out of it; \nmany of them cannot.\n  We absolutely believe and support the classic American view that you \nshould be able to have a fresh start; that if debts overpower a family \nor individual, they can go to bankruptcy court and wipe out those debts \nand not pay a dime. That is the way the law is, no matter the income of \nthe person who files. A person who has a quarter of a million in income \ntoday can go into bankruptcy court, if they have, say, $150,000 in \ndebts, debts they could pay if they put their mind to it, they can just \nwipe out those debts and keep making $250,000 a year and not pay their \nlocal banker, their local hospital, doctor, car dealer, or whoever they \nbankrupt against. It is an unhealthy practice.\n  We thought a lot about how to deal with the problems and how to deal \nwith the abuses. Having practiced law a good bit, I have a hard time \nblaming the lawyers who take advantage of the laws that we in Congress \nhave provided. They look at the legal system, they see what helps the \ndebtor the absolute most, and they file the bankruptcy in that fashion, \ntaking full advantage of the law.\n  It is appropriate for the Senate, for the first time since 1978, to \npass a reform of those laws to deal with the problems we know arise, to \nhelp people who legitimately need relief from their debts to start \nafresh. Those who can pay some of it ought not to get off scot-free. \nThat is the fundamental principle of this bill.\n  Let me mention one of the best things about bankruptcy. When people \nfall behind in their debts, penalties get assessed against them. They \nhave to take out even higher interest rate loans to stay afloat, and \nthey begin a downward spiral. They have creditors--in most instances, \nmany creditors. These creditors call debtors, they file lawsuits and \nthey file liens against the debtor's property. It can be a crushing, \nhard time for them.\n  When they file bankruptcy--either in chapter 7 where all the debts \nare wiped out, or in chapter 13 where they pay back a portion of those \ndebts--the creditors cannot keep bothering them. They cannot be sued. \nAny lawsuits that have been filed against them are stayed, stopped. The \ncourt manages their money under chapter 13. They wipe away all their \ndebts if they file under chapter 7, and they can start afresh. That is \na provision of law in America that is worthy of continuing. But we also \nsee there are some problems and abuses.\n  As we look at the changes in this legislation, I will mention a few \nas we get started this morning.\n  One is there was a consensus of those working on the bill that if \nindividuals had a higher income and could pay back a portion of their \ndebts, at least--perhaps all of them, but most likely not all of them--\nthey ought to do so. Why should they not pay back something if they are \nable to do so? So we put in the bill a means test.\n  This has been in the legislation for the last 8 years. It has come \nbefore this Congress four separate times. This is the fourth time. And \nit has received a strong majority vote, bipartisan vote every single \ntime. But for one reason or other, we have not been able to make the \nbill law. We are going to do that this time, I am confident.\n  But on the question of, What about the changes? How does it impact a \nperson who would go and file in bankruptcy? We know that 80 percent of \nthe people who file for bankruptcy make below median income. That means \nunder the provisions of this bill, no fundamental changes will occur. \nThey cannot be made to go into chapter 13 unless they choose to do so. \nThey can wipe out all their debts, not pay a single one, under the \nprovisions of chapter 7, unless it is a debt that is not dischargeable, \nsuch as a result of an intentional or fraudulent act.\n  If they make above median income, and there are no special \ncircumstances that apply that might excuse them from that, such as a \nhealth problem or a problem with an ill child or something that \nrequires extra expense, then they could be moved into chapter 13, where \nthey pay back a portion of their debts. The judge would decide how much \nthey could pay, and they could be made to pay a portion of those debts \nfor a period of up to 5 years.\n  We think that is a reasonable and fair approach. In fact, this Senate \ncertainly did during the 107th Congress when we passed a similar bill \n83 to 15. So I think that is the basic procedure.\n  It also provides that before you file in bankruptcy, you should at \nleast examine the possibility of credit counseling. There are credit \ncounseling agencies all over America. They have proven to be effective \nfor a large number of creditors. These agencies are able to negotiate \nreduced payments for the debtors, to reduce interest rates and to help \nthe debtor sit down and work out a family budget. They bring in the \nwhole family. They sit around the table. They work out a budget. They \nhelp teach them how to manage their money. They reduce interest rates. \nThey reduce debts through negotiation. Many families are finding they \ncan work their way out of debt without filing for bankruptcy, without \nwalking out on their solemn obligations and actually feeling better \nabout themselves, as well as learning a lesson for the whole family.\n  So we say they at least ought to know about this option and ask them \nto consider that. It can be to go by and have a brief meeting, a \ndiscussion, and receive some paperwork on it, and discuss it before \nthey file for bankruptcy. We think that can make a big difference for a \nlot of people. How many bankruptcies might be avoided by that? I don't \nknow--5 percent, 10 percent--but I think it could be a significant \nimprovement in our system.\n  We also say that before you can be discharged and finally walk away \nfrom your debts, you should go through a financial course on how to \nmanage money because we want to see people manage money wisely, to \navoid high interest debts when they can, to keep their interest rates \nlow, their borrowing low, to manage their money wisely. This bill would \nalso require that.\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n  These are things that have gained strong bipartisan support. I know I \noffered the amendment on credit counseling. I visited credit counseling \nagencies in Alabama and talked to them. I think they provide a \ntremendous service for a lot of people.\n  That is where we are with the fundamentals of the bill. It has, as I \nsaid, come before Congress four different times. In 1998, during the \n105th Congress, we passed the bill with a 97-to-1 vote. The most recent \nvote, as I noted, was in 2001, and it was 83 to 15. We reported this \nbill out of the Judiciary Committee last week with a vote of 12 to 5, \nwith strong bipartisan support again. So we are confident that if we go \nforward and we have an up-or-down vote on the bill, it will pass. I \nbelieve the House of Representatives will pass it again this time, and \nwe can make some progress in that Federal court system that we have the \nresponsibility to monitor.\n  We have the responsibility to analyze it on a regular basis, and if \nit is not performing up to standards, we ought to fix it. That is what \nwe are doing. We have had a surge of bankruptcies. We have had a surge \nof abuses in bankruptcies where people, for example, lawyers, run ads \nin newspapers saying: Are you about to be evicted from your apartment? \nFile bankruptcy. Call us. And they have their phone number there.\n  People are filing bankruptcies to stay an eviction for not a house \nthey own but an apartment. That is not legitimate. So when the case is \nheard in the bankruptcy court, the apartment owner, who oftentimes is a \nsmall businessperson or retiree, has to go down to bankruptcy court, \nhire a lawyer, and then they win because the debtor does not have any \nproperty interest in the apartment. The lease has expired. They owe \nmoney on it. They are due to be evicted. Then it comes back to the \nState court for eviction proceedings, and they have to pick that up \nagain. And they extend, for months, their stay in people's houses or \napartments through the manipulation of the bankruptcy system. That is \none of the things we tightened.\n  We raised the priority for women and children with regard to alimony \nand child support. Those payments are going to be far more high on the \npriority of payments when there is a limited amount of money by the \ndebtor. So now, instead of money going strictly to lawyers or to other \ndebts, it is going to go straight to children for child support and \nalso for alimony. We had testimony in the Judiciary Committee, of which \nI am a member, from professionals in child support who say this will be \na magnificent advance for women and children. We are excited about that \npotential.\n  There is so much more in the bill. I believe it is a sound bill. It \nhas been on this floor, as I said, four times. It has been in the \nJudiciary Committee four times. We have had 15 hearings on the bill. I \nbelieve every possible objection has been considered, and I believe we \nare on the verge of making some positive change in our bankruptcy \nsystem. It is certainly overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 50\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my pending amendment, \namendment No. 50, to the bankruptcy reform bill. This is an amendment \nto correct an enormous injustice in my home State. And that is not an \nunderstatement. That is accurate. It is very accurate. It is not an \noverstatement. It is dead on.\n  My amendment is based on a bill I have introduced in past Congresses \nto set up a permanent health care trust fund for current and former \nLibby residents, and former workers at the W.R. Grace vermiculite mine \nin Libby, MT. The trust fund would help pay for the costs of treating \nasbestos-related illness caused by exposure to deadly tremolite \nasbestos and other fibers released by Grace's mining operations.\n  This amendment would require a company such as W.R. Grace--which has \nwillfully harmed the innocent citizens of Libby, MT--to set up a health \ncare trust fund for its victims before it can emerge from bankruptcy. \nAs a result of this amendment, W.R. Grace cannot emerge from bankruptcy \nuntil it has established a trust fund of at least $250 million to cover \nthe cost of health care for the people of Libby.\n  The people of Libby, the Libby community, and the State of Montana \nface an immediate health care crisis. This crisis was caused by \nalarming rates of asbestos-related exposure, disease, and illness.\n  Former Libby residents face their own personal health care crisis \nbecause they are denied access to private health insurance. Why? \nBecause they have been diagnosed with an asbestos-related disease or \nillness, or show signs that they have been exposed to asbestos. They \nhave been denied insurance for that reason only. Projected health care \ncosts to treat all sick people in Libby, MT, run into the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  This dire situation was created because the responsible party in this \ncase, the W.R. Grace Company, which had the mine in Libby, MT, \nwillfully harmed the people of Libby--willfully harmed the people of \nLibby. There is immense documentation showing that the company knew the \nmine operations were causing illness, asbestos-related diseases, in the \nform of tremolite, which is the worst kind of asbestos disease, and \ncaused the death of many people in Libby and the very serious illness \nof very many people in Montana. The company knew that. They willfully \nknew that. The documents prove it.\n  After harming Libby, Grace ignored its responsibility for Libby's \nhealth care needs. Grace ignored the harm it inflicted on Libby. They \nturned their back to it. They showed no accountability. They ignored it \neven though they knew they were the cause of the disease in Libby.\n  More than that, the actions of W.R. Grace were criminal. The U.S. \nAttorney General's Office has filed a historic indictment against \ncurrent and former W.R. Grace executives for knowingly concealing \ninformation about asbestos pollution in Libby. This pollution led to \nthe death of more than 200 people in Libby, and made hundreds of others \nsick.\n  Mr. President, I wish you could go to Libby, MT. Go see it. Any \nMember of this body who would visit Libby, MT, would know exactly what \nI am talking about and understand why this amendment is needed. Seeing \nis believing. I know we hear lots of stuff around here. We hear lots of \nSenators stand up and talk about problems they see. I tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I tell my colleagues, if you were to visit Libby, MT--just \nto see it, spend a couple hours--you would know exactly what I am \ntalking about and you would support this amendment.\n  It is one of the most tragic situations I have ever seen in my life. \nThat is not an overstatement. It is one of the most tragic situations I \nhave seen in my life. That is why this amendment is so important.\n  It is also very unfortunate that my amendment is so necessary, but it \nis. It is vital. It is just. And the people of Libby should not have to \nhope they will be treated fairly in the Grace bankruptcy. They should \nknow they will be treated fairly and that at the very least they will \nnot have to worry about how to pay for costly medical care. These costs \nshould not be borne by Grace's victims, nor should the taxpayers have \nto pick up the tab through Medicare or Medicaid or through other \npublicly funded programs. The responsibility lies squarely with the \ncompany that caused the sickness in the first place--W.R. Grace.\n  Mind you, this is not a company that is struggling. According to \nGrace's recent financial results, issued in January, W.R. Grace \nreported that 2004 fourth quarter sales were up 15 percent over the \nfourth quarter of 2003. And for the full year of 2004--a full year--\nGrace reported sales of over $2.2 billion, which is a 14-percent \nincrease over the previous year.\n  That is right. As Libby's economy struggles, and people are waiting \nfor health care, and dying, W.R. Grace's business is booming, with \noperations in nearly 40 countries. And Libby residents are left to die. \nThey are left to die because of Grace's actions. A Grace spokesman once \nboasted, as this was happening, ``We are very pleased with our business \nprogress and results for 2004.''\n  Ask those who died or who fell ill last year because of W.R. Grace \nwhether they are pleased with the progress and results of 2004. I \nsuspect you will get a different answer.\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n  The Congress cannot make right what happened to Libby. No amendments, \nno legislation, no resolutions will bring back those who died or \nprevent the afflicted from getting sicker. But we can ensure that those \nafflicted do not have to pay health care costs incurred through no \nfault of their own. And we can ensure that the party responsible--in \nthis case W.R. Grace--does.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is so important, \nit is a matter of accountability, it is a matter of fairness, and it is \na matter of time before more folks from Libby, MT, get sick as a result \nof W.R. Grace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Alaska, the \nPresident pro tempore.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is it proper to speak on a matter not \nconcerning bankruptcy at this time without consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take consent.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes on a matter not concerning the bankruptcy \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           High Energy Prices\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope all Members of Congress saw the \nnews yesterday, that oil prices reached $55 a barrel. Now, some of us \nreacted with shock and amazement, but others knew the reality that this \nday would come.\n  We have witnessed the impact of these high energy prices every time \nwe fill up our gas tanks and pay our heating or electric bills.\n  These high prices are unsustainable, jeopardizing jobs and \nthreatening the long-term health of our economy. The impact of high \nenergy prices can be seen at all levels of our economy. High energy \nprices have produced job losses, trade deficits, and constraints on \nconsumer spending and economic growth. Demand for energy in the United \nStates is outstripping supply, and Americans are feeling the impact of \nCongress's failure to act to solve the problem. Our people rely on our \nability to stabilize energy prices and provide them with the energy \nresources all of us need.\n  The good news is that this worsening crisis is avoidable. The United \nStates has the natural resources to increase our energy supply. But \ninconsistent Government policies discourage the exploration, \ndevelopment, and use of our own energy resources. Almost 30 percent of \nall the lands in this country are owned by the Federal Government. That \nis 657 million acres--almost four times the size of Texas. Under those \nlands lies 90 percent of the predicted undiscovered oil and 40 percent \nof our undiscovered natural gas. Those public resources are needed to \nmeet our energy needs and secure our future.\n  Since 1983, access to our Federal lands has declined by 60 percent. \nOver half of the lands that are designated currently as multiple use--\nin other words, ones that oil and gas exploration could take place on--\nare subject to highly restrictive land classifications or lease \nstipulations which effectively restrict energy exploration and \ndevelopment.\n  The effect of these policies is clear. In 1981, 91,533 oil and gas \nwells were drilled in the United States. In 2000, that number declined \nto 29,284, almost down to 25 percent of what we did some 20 years ago. \nAs a result, crude oil production in the United States is at a 50-year \nlow, and permitting for oil and gas projects on Federal lands that once \ntook 18 months--and that was considered a long time then--can now take \nup to 10 years. In some instances, it takes 10 years to clear a permit \nto start exploring for oil on Federal lands. Those delays force \ncompanies to pursue projects overseas rather than develop U.S. \nresources.\n  Some people have commented upon the fact that the U.S. oil industry \nis no longer seeking to support the concept of drilling on Alaska's \nArctic plain. They have opportunities all over the world where they can \nproceed much more rapidly than in this country, and there is no \nquestion that they need to find oil to meet our needs. What industry is \ngoing to put up the money for 10 years to explore for and develop \nenergy here at home when it can go abroad and do that in less than 1 \nyear?\n  In a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral \nResources, Stephen Entin, a former staff economist for the Joint \nEconomic Committee and currently president of the Institute for \nResearch On the Economics of Taxation, argued that our current policies \nactually support OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, and enhance its power. By locking up our own lands we have \nbasically manipulated prices because we have restricted competition \nfrom American companies, and OPEC reaps the benefits from an \ninequitable playing field. As a matter of fact, we encourage them to \nraise prices because our demand constantly increases and our domestic \nsupply constantly decreases. Jobs and energy security have been \noutsourced, as we seek our energy security in places where there are \nunfriendly and unstable regimes. I have had personal talks with some \nmembers of the oil industry. They know that those are unstable regimes, \nbut they have no alternative.\n  For every $1 billion we spend to develop petroleum resources \ndomestically we would create 12,500 jobs. That would mean that last \nyear we lost over 1.3 million jobs by importing oil instead of \nproducing it. People wonder why our jobs are going abroad. When we \nwithdraw lands from oil and gas exploration, that is not free. Many \npeople in this country think it is an easy decision and it doesn't cost \nanything. It is a very expensive policy. We are paying a huge price now \nbecause we have locked up our lands and made them inaccessible, when \nthey purportedly are open, by restrictive policies, restrictive \nstipulations that take so long to comply with that no industry is going \nto put up the money and wait so long for the opportunity to see if \nthere is oil and gas in those lands.\n  The American taxpayer picks up the tab, and the American consumer is \nseverely punished by this policy. Consumers are paying more for food, \ngoods, and energy bills. According to Daniel Yergin, an economist from \nCambridge Energy Associates, high energy and gasoline prices \nessentially act as a consumer tax, leaving Americans with less \ndisposable income for travel, home buying, restaurants, and retail \nestablishments, all of what we call our quality of life.\n  Only yesterday, I received this estimate. It is estimated now that \nfor every one-cent increase for gasoline at the pump, there is $1 \nbillion lost in consumer spending. Just look at the price of gasoline \nnow. The price of gasoline is at an alltime high, and it will not come \ndown. It is going to continue to go up.\n  In China, 5 years ago only 5 percent of their people were using \nenergy. Now 15 percent are using it. Even at that low rate of 15 \npercent of their people using energy, talking about oil and gas energy, \nthey have now passed Japan in consumption annually of oil and gas. They \nare second only to the United States, and only 15 percent of their \npeople are using oil and gas so far. People blame a lot of things for \nthese high prices, but the fact is the world is starting to use oil and \ngas. We are competing for the world's oil production and ignoring \ncompletely our capability to produce right here at home.\n  Unless Congress acts to ensure greater domestic production of our oil \nand gas resources, our energy security is jeopardized. I am talking \nabout security. We had one embargo since I have been in the Senate in \nthe 1970s, when we were totally embargoed by OPEC. They would not sell \nus oil. At that time about 33 percent of our oil was coming in from \nOPEC countries. Today it is 60 percent. An embargo today would destroy \nour economy.\n  There are many people who advocate quick fixes to use alternative \nsources. I believe there must eventually be alternative sources to oil \nand gas in our economy, but just relying on them and saying we are \ngoing to do it and never bringing that about has led us to the point \nwhere we no longer have the capability to produce the oil and gas to \nmeet our needs in the event of national security.\n  We believe that it is time now that we should review these policies, \nand one of the key policies, of course, is an area that comes from the \ndevelopment of an area in my State. In 1980, we passed the Alaska \nNational Interest Conservation Lands Act, an act that withdrew over 100 \nmillion acres of Alaska's lands for national purposes.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nOne provision in that bill guaranteed the right to explore the Arctic \nplain, a million and a half acres, for oil and gas, probably even then \nknown as the area most probable to produce substantial quantities of \noil and gas. It is estimated to contain 10.4 billion barrels of oil. \nJust as a comparison, when we first drilled at Prudhoe Bay, the \nestimate was it might contain 1 billion barrels of oil. We have already \nproduced 16 billion barrels of oil from Prudhoe Bay. In other words, \nthis area now considered to be capable of producing 10.4 billion \nbarrels of oil is probably the last most significant oil and gas area \nin the country, and we have worked, now since 1981, to try to fulfill \nthe promise made to us in the 1980 bill that that area could be \nexplored.\n  It is high time that we take action to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. As I said, we rely upon foreign sources for 60 percent of \nour energy needs. The area of the Arctic plain, 1.5 million acres \nguaranteed to be available for oil and gas exploration, is there. \nAllowing exploration and development of this area that is known as \nANWR, although it is not part of the refuge until oil and gas \ndevelopment is over, would improve our U.S. balance of trade, reduce \nthe amount of money we spend abroad, and improve our national security \nby having available the capability to produce that amount of oil.\n  It is estimated that by 2025, the United States will spend \napproximately $200 billion on foreign oil and petroleum products. By \nopening this area, and when it produces, we could save a considerable \nportion of that by producing our own oil and gas. It means we could \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs and contribute greatly to the overall \neconomy.\n\n  There is no question that we are now in an energy crisis. Anytime we \nsee $55-dollar-a-barrel oil, that is a crisis. I cannot believe that \nCongress wants to wait until the price goes up to somewhere around $80. \nI believe it is going that high unless we start developing our domestic \nresources and look to alternative supplies of energy right here at \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Steve Metli\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor and appreciation \nthat I recognize the leadership and the many achievements of Mr. Steve \nMetli. Steve will soon retire from his post as city planner for the \ncity of Sioux Falls, SD, a position he has held since 1974. He embodies \nthe highest qualities of public service and has aptly earned the \nrespect and admiration of his colleagues and leaders throughout South \nDakota. I am proud to claim Steve as a friend.\n  Steve Metli consistently addressed challenges with determination and \nforesight which significantly improved the strength of the local \neconomy and the quality of life in Sioux Falls and thus expanded \nopportunities for all South Dakotans. His success is rooted in \nenthusiasm, vision, leadership, and progressive South Dakota values \nthat will undoubtedly continue to echo in the growth and prosperity of \nthe entire region for many years to come.\n  In 1974, Mayor Rick Knobe appointed him to head an overburdened four-\nperson planning and zoning staff. Since that time, the city has swelled \nin population from about 75,000 to over 141,000 people, and Sioux Falls \nhas become a major regional center for health, education, culture, \nrecreation, and job growth.\n  Steve now oversees the city departments of planning, transit, \nbuilding services, media services, and arena, airport, convention \ncenter, and Washington Pavilion.\n  Steve Metli's fortitude and resolve is evident in his private life as \nwell as his public service. As an adult, he has survived three bouts \nwith cancer, two changes in the form of city government, and the \nadministrations of five mayors--Rick Knobe, Joe Cooper, Jack White, \nGary Hanson, and Dave Munson. He devoted significant attention to the \nBig Sioux River greenway project and on expanding the city's park \nsystem, which now consists of 76 parks covering 2,600 acres. He has \nsought to reinvigorate and revitalize the downtown community. His \nvision of Sioux Falls downtown centers on the beautiful natural \nresource of the Big Sioux River.\n\n  He led development of the city's growth management plans, which \ninclude infrastructure direction as well as parks, schools, and fire \nservices. His vision of the Phillips to the Falls project was recently \ncompleted and he stood at the ribbon cutting with the pride of a parent \nwhose child achieved a long-time dream and accomplishment. He has \ndeveloped plans for the Big Sioux River Greenway, Falls Park and \nDowntown Development, and served as project manager for the \nconstruction of the Sioux Falls Convention Center.\n  I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to work with Steve. His \nleadership and vision were critical to the successful growth of the \nSioux Falls region. National publications have consistently recognized \nSioux Falls as among the best communities of its size in which to live \nand do business. I am proud to recognize Steve Metli's critically \nimportant contributions to the success of the City of Sioux Falls, SD, \nand to our entire State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     the history of social security\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the ancient text teaches: ``Honor your \nfather and your mother so that you may live long and that it may go \nwell with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.'' And Paul \nnoted that `` `Honor your father and mother' is the first commandment \nwith a promise--`that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy \nlong life on the earth.' ''\n  That's what Social Security is about. It is about honoring our \nfathers and our mothers. And like the commandment, Social Security also \ncarries with it a promise. Social Security benefits not just our \nelders. It also benefits their children, and us all.\n  Families throughout history have faced uncertainties, old age, \ndisability, and death of the breadwinner. Before Social Security, the \nextended family provided what economic security they had.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt described those times:\n\n       In the early days of colonization and through the long \n     years following the worker, the farmer, the merchant, the man \n     of property, the preacher, and the idealist came here to \n     build, each for himself, a stronghold for the things he \n     loved. The stronghold was his home the things he loved and \n     wished to protect were his family, his material and spiritual \n     possessions. His security, then as now, was bound to that of \n     his friends and his neighbors.\n\n  In the 18th and 19th centuries, most Americans lived and worked on \nfarms. Before 1840, 9 out of 10 Americans lived in rural areas. And as \nlate as 1880, 7 in 10 did.\n  This chart on my right shows the degree to which Americans lived in \nrural America and over time moved to cities. Back in 1790, about 95 \npercent of Americans lived in rural areas. Right now, the trend line is \ndown to 1990, where about 20 percent lived in rural areas. Everybody \nelse moved to the cities.\n  Back then, in the early days, life was hard and often short. A boy \nborn in the year 1850 could expect to live 38 years. That is all. By \n1900, the male life expectancy rose to about 46 years. As this chart \nshows, things changed with the Industrial Revolution. America changed \nfrom an agricultural to an industrial economy. People moved away from \nthe family farm into the city, and by 1920, most Americans lived in \nurban areas. The extended family and family farm failed to provide the \nsecurity they once did.\n  At the same time, the people of a more prosperous nation began to \nlive longer. As this chart shows, around 1930, a baby boy could expect \nto live 59 years--13 years longer than in 1900. And a 60-year-old man \ncould expect to live to age 75. More and more Americans had to address \nthe challenges of living into old age.\n  This chart shows the male life expectancy at birth has risen \nsignificantly, from 39 in 1850 to 68 years of age 100 years later, in \n1950. Of course, today the lifespan is longer.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  Senator Robert Wagner of New York described how the burdens of \nsupporting those growing numbers of seniors fell heavily through a \npatchy safety net and onto their grown children. He said:\n\n       In truth . . . every civilized community does and must \n     support its old and dependent people in some way. In this \n     country, we have been doing it largely by inefficient relief \n     methods, by shabby pension systems, and by imposing burdens \n     upon millions of younger members of families, with consequent \n     impairment of their industrial efficiency, their morale, and \n     their own opportunities for future independence.\n\n  And President Roosevelt looked back on those times, saying:\n\n       Long before the economic blight of the depression descended \n     on the Nation, millions of our people were living in \n     wastelands of want and fear. Men and women too old and infirm \n     to work either depended on those who had but little to share, \n     or spent their remaining years within the walls of a \n     poorhouse. Fatherless children early learned the meaning of \n     being a burden to relatives or to the community.\n\n  President Roosevelt saw America's social changes as grounds for a \nchange in government's role. In his June 1934 message to Congress, he \nsaid:\n\n       [S]ecurity was attained in the earlier days through the \n     interdependence of members of families upon each other and of \n     the families within a small community upon each other. The \n     complexities of great communities and of organized industry \n     make less real these simple means of security. Therefore, we \n     are compelled to employ the active interest of the Nation as \n     a whole through government in order to encourage a greater \n     security for each individual who composes it.\n\n  The Great Depression triggered government's response.\n  As this chart shows, the American economy in 1933 produced barely \nmore than half the output that it did in 1929.\n  And as the next chart shows, by 1933, a quarter of the American labor \nforce was unemployed.\n  Look at this next chart. From its 1929 high of 381, the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average fell to a trough of 41 in 1932. That's nearly a 90 \npercent drop in the Dow, in just 3 years.\n  Lifetimes' worth of private accounts evaporated into thin air. \nSenator Royal Copeland of New York recounted:\n\n       [T]here are thousands of families, I suppose millions, who \n     thought they had prepared for the rainy days, but by reason \n     of the Depression, and the circumstances involved in it, they \n     have come to be almost as bad off as many who were born and \n     have lived all their lives in poverty.\n\n  State governments found themselves under an increasing burden. This \nchart shows unemployed men in line. Senator Daniel Hastings of Delaware \nsaid,\n\n       [T]he individual States are laboring under a strained \n     financial condition; with many of them believing that they \n     cannot take care of their own.\n\n  As with economic hardship throughout history, the Depression hit \nwidows and orphans particularly hard. This chart shows a careworn 32-\nyear-old woman's face. Congressman William Sirovich of New York painted \nthe picture, in 1935:\n\n       Death, through the loss of the breadwinner, has broken many \n     a home. For centuries the widows, orphans, and dependent \n     children have cried aloud for help and assistance in their \n     tragic periods of economic insecurity. In the past the only \n     recourse for orphaned children was the poorhouse, alsmhouse, \n     and the orphan asylum. The twentieth century of civilization \n     has awakened our citizens to the duty and obligations they \n     owe to these unfortunate orphans.\n\n  And Congressman Fred Crawford of Michigan spoke of children with \ndisabilities:\n\n       One only needs to come in contact with a home which is \n     unable to provide any means of relief for a little child who \n     has been stricken with paralysis to appreciate what this will \n     mean to those homes so darkened with the suffering that \n     follows such a catastrophe.\n\n  Remember what happened back then. I am not saying we are going to \nagain suffer the same cataclysmic and dire consequences of the \nDepression. I don't think we will. But we could suffer bad times in the \nfuture. The stock market could fall precipitously. Two speakers ago on \nthe floor, the Senator from Alaska was talking about the economy, \nsaying it would be devastated if there was an oil embargo; that would \nbe the end of the American economy. The stock market would clearly \nfall. We don't know. We live in times that are a little more \nprecarious, uncertain, and it is harder to predict the future. We just \ndon't know. I am presenting these charts and this information to remind \nus that we don't know. Again, I doubt we will have another depression \nthat severe--we may, but I doubt it. But things can go south sometimes. \nThings don't always go well all the time.\n  President Roosevelt sought a comprehensive solution. To that end, in \nJune of 1934, he issued an Executive Order creating the cabinet-level \nCommittee on Economic Security. He charged them to, ``study problems \nrelating to the economic security of individuals.''\n  Labor Secretary Frances Perkins chaired the committee, which also \nincluded the Treasury Secretary, the Attorney General, the Agriculture \nSecretary, and the Federal Emergency Relief Administrator. Secretary \nPerkins relied heavily on her assistant secretary, Arthur Altmeyer, who \nwould become the first Social Security Commissioner.\n  And to address the need, President Roosevelt and other leading \nthinkers turned to the idea of ``social insurance.'' President \nRoosevelt said of social insurance: ``This is not an untried \nexperiment. Lessons of experience are available from States, from \nindustries and from many nations of the civilized world. The various \ntypes of social insurance are interrelated; and I think it is difficult \nto attempt to solve them piecemeal. Hence, I am looking for a sound \nmeans which I can recommend to provide at once security against several \nof the great disturbing factors in life--especially those which relate \nto unemployment and old age.''\n  Social insurance programs began in Europe in the 19th century. By the \ntime America adopted Social Security as a national social insurance \nprogram in 1935, 34 European nations and several States in the Union \nalready operated some form of social insurance program--34 nations \nbefore 1935.\n  I am very proud to say my home State of Montana played a leading role \nwhen, in March of 1923, it enacted its old age pension law. Montana's \nwas the first State law to stand the test of constitutionality for an \nold age pension law. Its sponsor was Lester Loble of Helena, MT.\n  I would like to show a picture of Lester Loble, who later became a \nState judge, Judge Loble. I knew him. He was a wonderful, wise man. \nFrankly, I did not know of his history until I did a little research \ninto Social Security and was delighted to find Judge Loble played a \nprominent role in developing Social Security.\n  He had been a delegate to the 1921 national convention of the \nFraternal Order of Eagles, which had devoted a special focus to pension \nlaws for seniors. Mr. Loble's old age pension law provided each \ncounty's fund would pay a modest monthly income--up to $25 a month--to \nthe poorest of Montana's seniors, those earning less than $300 a year.\n  In a legislative session torn by struggle over taxes on mining \nproperty, the bill passed, and Governor Joseph Dixon, a Republican, \nsigned it into law, saying:\n\n       You Eagles have planted this seed and you can no more stop \n     the progress of old age pensions than you can stem the tide \n     of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n  In November of 1934, on behalf of President Roosevelt's Committee on \nEconomic Security, Secretary Perkins invited Mr. Loble to Washington, \nsaying:\n\n       We are extending this invitation to you because you have \n     the honor of having been the author of the first old age \n     pension law in this Country.\n\n  The committee set to work on the idea of social insurance. Like all \ninsurance, social insurance protects against a defined risk. The \ninsurance pays beneficiaries when they need to bear a large expense, \noften at times when they would otherwise not be able to provide for \nthemselves. Like all insurance, social insurance spreads the burdens of \nthe risk broadly across a large pool of those who may encounter the \nrisk. When the risk does occur to one beneficiary, the sharing of the \nrisk makes it easier to bear.\n  Social insurance spreads these risks over the largest possible pool \nof potential beneficiaries--society as a whole. And social insurance is \nshaped by broader social objectives, helping to promote the Nation's \noverall economic security.\n  President Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security made its \nrecommendation to Congress in January 1935. The committee reported:\n\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\n\n       At least one-third of all our people, upon reaching old \n     age, are dependent upon others for support. . . . There is an \n     insecurity in every stage of life.\n\n  They went on:\n\n       Children, friends, and relatives have borne and still carry \n     the major cost of supporting the aged. . . . [T]his burden \n     has become unbearable for many of the children. . . .\n\n  They responded to that challenge with a proposal for Social Security, \nand they concluded:\n\n       The measures we suggest should result in the long run in \n     material reduction in the cost to society of destitution and \n     dependency and we believe will immediately be helpful in \n     allaying those fears which open the door to unsound \n     proposals.\n\n  The Finance Committee held hearings on the proposal. At one hearing, \nSenators watched as several elderly gentlemen who were totally blind \nwere led into the committee room by their guide dogs and told of their \nlife of need. This is before Social Security. Finance Committee \nChairman Pat Harrison of Mississippi said:\n\n       I do not know of any committee that was ever moved more \n     than was the Finance Committee.\n\n  During the Senate's floor debate on the bill, Senator Wagner from New \nYork said:\n\n       The social security bill embraces objectives that have \n     driven their appeal to the conscience and intelligence of the \n     entire Nation. We must take the old people who have been \n     disinherited by our economic system and make them free men in \n     fact as well as in name. We must not let misfortune twist the \n     lives of the young. We must tear down the house of misery in \n     which dwell the unemployed. We must remain aware that \n     business stability and prosperity are the foundation of all \n     of our efforts. In all of these things we are united, and in \n     this unity, we shall move forward to an era of greater \n     security and happiness.\n\n  This chart shows the signing of the Social Security Act. In signing \nthe Social Security Act in August 1935, President Roosevelt said:\n\n       Today a hope of many years' standing is in large part \n     fulfilled. The civilization of the past hundred years, with \n     its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more \n     to make life insecure.\n  That was in 1935. Think how insecure now.\n\n       Young people have come to wonder what will be their lot \n     when they came to old age. The man with a job has wondered \n     how long that job would last.\n       This Social Security measure gives at least some protection \n     to . . . millions of our citizens who will reap direct \n     benefits through unemployment compensation, through old-age \n     pensions and through increased services for the protection of \n     children and the prevention of ill health.\n\n  President Roosevelt continued:\n\n       We can never insure 100 percent of the population against \n     100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we \n     have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of \n     protection to the average citizen and to his family against \n     the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age.\n\n       The law established two social insurance programs on a \n     national scale to help meet the risks of old age and \n     unemployment: a Federal system of old age benefits for \n     retired workers and a Federal-State system of unemployment \n     insurance.\n  President Roosevelt saw the 1935 Social Security law as an economic \nfoundation. He said:\n\n       This law . . . represents a cornerstone in a structure \n     which is being built but is by no means complete. It is a \n     structure intended to lessen the force of possible future \n     depressions. It will act as a protection to future \n     administrations against the necessity of going deeply into \n     debt to furnish relief to the needy. The law will flatten out \n     the peaks and valleys of deflation and inflation. It is, in \n     short, a law that will take care of human needs and at the \n     same time provide the United States an economic structure of \n     vastly greater soundness.\n\n  President Roosevelt justly concluded:\n\n       If the Senate and House of Representatives in this long and \n     arduous session had done nothing more than pass this bill, \n     the session would be regarded as historic for all time.\n\n  President Roosevelt's prophecy that Congress would build on Social \nSecurity was soon proved true. The Old-Age Insurance Program had not \nyet come fully into operation when Congress enacted significant \nchanges. In 1939, Congress added benefits for dependents of retired \nworkers and surviving dependents of deceased workers, and Congress made \nthe first benefits payable in 1940 instead of 1942, as originally \nplanned.\n  In the 1950s, Congress broadened Social Security to cover many jobs \nthat previously had been excluded.\n  In 1956, Congress added disability insurance. Benefits were provided \nfor severely disabled workers aged 50 or older and for adult disabled \nchildren of deceased or retired workers.\n  Two years later, in 1958, Congress provided benefits for dependents \nof disabled workers similar to those already provided for dependents of \nretired workers.\n  In 1960, Congress removed the age-50 requirement for disabled worker \nbenefits.\n  And in 1967, Congress provided disability benefits for widows and \nwidowers aged 50 or older.\n  There used to be a yearly annual ritual in Congress to provide cost-\nof-living increases to Social Security beneficiaries. This sometimes \nhappened right before an election. In 1972, Congress did away with this \nuncertainty and provided for automatic cost-of-living increases in \nbenefits tied to increases in the consumer price index. The 1972 \namendments also increased benefits for workers who retired after full \nretirement age.\n  In 1977, Congress changed the method of benefit computation to ensure \nstable replacement rates over time. Earnings included in the \ncomputation were to be indexed to account for changes in the economy \nfrom the time they were earned.\n  In 1983, as a consequence of the Greenspan Commission, to strengthen \nand extend the life of Social Security, Congress made coverage \ncompulsory for employees of the Federal Government and nonprofit \norganizations. State and local governments were prohibited from opting \nout of the system once they had joined. The amendments also gradually \nincreased the age of eligibility for full retirement benefits from 65 \nto 67, beginning with persons who reach the age of 62 in the year 2000.\n  For certain higher income beneficiaries, benefits became subject to \nincome tax.\n  In 1996, Congress relaxed earnings limits for seniors who reached the \nfull retirement age.\n  In 1999, Congress reformed certain provisions under the disability \nprogram to create stronger incentives and better supports for \nindividuals to work.\n  And in 2000, Congress eliminated the earnings for seniors who have \nreached the full retirement age.\n  What we now know is Social Security touches almost every American. \nSocial Security covers 96 percent of American workers and their \nfamilies. In 2003, Social Security provided $471 billion in benefits to \n47 million people. One in six Americans collects Social Security \nbenefits today.\n\n  In my home State of Montana, 164,000 of our 927,000 residents, or \nabout 18 percent of all Montanans, receive Social Security benefits. \nNearly 7 percent of all Montana personal income comes from Social \nSecurity payments. Montana ranks fifth among the 50 States in terms of \nthe share of our State's income that comes from Social Security.\n  Social Security is, in effect, three programs: an earned retirement \nbenefit, a disability insurance policy, and a life insurance policy.\n  Most people think of Social Security as a retirement program, but 3 \nin 10 beneficiaries collect survivors' or disability insurance \nbenefits.\n  Of today's 20-year-olds, 28 percent will become disabled. That is \nquite startling when one stops to think about it. Of today's 20-year-\nolds, 28 percent will become disabled, and 17 percent will die before \nreaching retirement. Look around the room in any college classroom: 3 \nin 10 students will become disabled, and 2 in 10 will die before \nretirement. But if a young worker should experience a period of \ndisability, Social Security will provide for the worker and the \nworker's family. In the same vein, Social Security will provide for the \nworker's family if the worker experiences an untimely death. For a \nyoung married worker with two children, Social Security provides the \nequivalent of a $400,000 life insurance policy and a $350,000 \ndisability policy. Think of that. For a young married worker today with \ntwo children, Social Security provides the equivalent of a $400,000 \nlife insurance policy and a $350,000 disability policy. Only about 3 in \n10 workers have access to long-term disability benefits, aside from \nSocial Security.\n  Social Security provides retirement benefits for retirees who worked \nat least 10 years. President Roosevelt said:\n\n       There are other matters with which we must deal before we \n     shall give adequate protection to the individual against the \n     many\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     economic hazards. Old age is at once the most certain, and, \n     for many people, the most tragic of all hazards. There is no \n     tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old \n     without means of support.\n\n  Social Security provides the primary source of income for two-thirds \nof America's seniors. Stop and think about that a moment. Social \nSecurity provides the primary source of income for two-thirds of \nAmerica's seniors. For one-fifth of our seniors, it provides the only \nsource of income. For one-fifth of our seniors in our country, Social \nSecurity is the only source of income. The average retiree benefit is \n$822 a month, or about $10,500 a year in my State of Montana, and about \n$900 per month, or about $11,000, nationally.\n  This is hardly a king's ransom, but as President Roosevelt said on \nthe third anniversary of the law's enactment:\n\n       The act does not offer anyone, either individually or \n     collectively, an easy life--nor was it ever intended to do \n     so. None of the sums of money paid out to individuals in . . \n     . insurance will spell anything approaching abundance. But \n     they will furnish that minimum necessity to keep a foothold; \n     and that is the kind of protection Americans want.\n\n  Before Social Security, poverty and dependency threatened all who \ncould no longer work, but with its guarantee of benefits to seniors for \nlife, progressive benefit structure, spousal and survivor benefits, and \nannual cost-of-living adjustments, Social Security provides a solid \nfoundation of economic security for all workers and retirees.\n  Look at the effects of this chart. Because of Social Security, \npoverty among American seniors has fallen from roughly half of seniors \nin 1935 to roughly a third of seniors in 1959 to 1 out of 10 seniors \nnow. Just think of that. Before Social Security, half of America's \nseniors were in poverty. That is this bar off to the left. Gradually, \nfewer of America's seniors were living in poverty. Social Security \nbrought them out of poverty, and so today only 1 in 10 is living in \npoverty. Just think what would happen if they did not have those \ncurrent Social Security benefits. Think what would happen to future \nretirees who had benefits reduced by 50 percent, as would be \ncontemplated under the President's proposal.\n  Social Security provides a guarantee of economic security for \nAmerica's workers, for current workers and for retired workers. Social \nSecurity protects all Americans, whether they are fortunate and living \na long and healthy life or unfortunate and facing early disability or \ndeath.\n  Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, so the buying \npower of beneficiaries does not erode over time. Social Security \nbenefits increase with family size, and they are progressive to ensure \nthat even low wage earners have sufficient income. Beneficiaries cannot \noutlive their benefits. This is an insurance policy. It is a life \ninsurance policy. Seniors cannot outlive their benefits. Seniors keep \ngetting those monthly benefits as long as they live.\n  Social Security uses a common system to administer all three \nprograms--retirement, survivors, and disability--resulting in \nadministrative costs of less than 1 percent. Administrative costs of \nall three, since they are combined with the same administration, are \njust 1 percent. Think of the administrative and other costs associated \nwith other forms of retirement payments, particularly in the private \nsector, which we must have, which are important and critical. It is \nimportant also to note the factual difference of the administrative \ncosts of some systems compared with some others.\n  These unequaled benefits make Social Security invaluable for \nindividual workers, retirees, and all Americans.\n  In future statements I hope to go further into other aspects of \nSocial Security. It is somewhat complicated, but it is somewhat \nsimple--very important. I hope to address how the President's plan \nwould cut benefits, not increase benefits, not stabilize benefits but \ncut them, and what benefit cuts would mean for Americans. I hope to \naddress the concerns caused by the mounting debt and how the \nPresident's plan would make that mounting debt problem worse, not \nbetter but worse, much worse--much, much, much worse. I hope to address \nwhy we should be concerned about the savings and what changes we should \nbe considering to increase savings in America, both public and private \nsavings.\n  Yes, Social Security faces long-term challenges. We all know that. We \nshould work hard to address those. We should work together to \nstrengthen Social Security for the long term. We all know we must do \nthat. We want to do that, but we need to do it right. We should no \nlonger endanger the valuable legacy we have built over so many years. \nIt is important, to say the least.\n  Privatization plans would cut Social Security's funding, weaken the \nprogram, and make its problems worse, not better. Plans like option 2 \nof the President's Social Security Commission would cut benefits by \none-third or more for future retirees, even for those who choose not to \nhave a private account. That is important to note. Under the \nPresident's plan as we know it so far, Americans who do not choose to \nhave a private account would find their benefits out in the future cut \nby one-third or more, even if they do not want to participate in the \nprivate or personal accounts--whatever one wants to call them.\n  Those investing in those accounts--personal accounts or private \naccounts--will be hit twice. Those who do invest, who choose to opt to \ninvest, would be hit twice, as their benefits would be subject to a \nsubstantial privatization tax. I am not going to go into great detail, \nbut if one chooses to participate in the President's plan, their total \nbenefits when they retire are going to be less than they would be if \nthere is no change in Social Security, just as long as we find ways to \nkeep it going.\n  Cuts of this magnitude would leave many seniors in poverty, requiring \nmore taxpayer assistance, not less, and the President's privatization \nplan would cause the Government to borrow $5 trillion in additional \ndebt in the next 20 years. Five trillion dollars additional of publicly \nheld debt in the next 20 years. Today the publicly held debt is about \n$4 trillion or $5 trillion. It will practically double over the next 20 \nyears. We cannot do that. That does not make sense. This is not the \nlegacy we should be giving to our kids and grandkids.\n  Yes, clearly, we should address Social Security. We should stop using \nSocial Security surpluses for other Government purposes. We should save \nmore as a nation. We should address the Government's record budget \ndeficits by restoring fiscal discipline and avoiding massive new debt. \nWe should reinstate enforceable budget restrictions such as the pay-as-\nyou-go rules, and we should work to develop new and innovative ways to \nhelp Americans save separate and apart from Social Security.\n\n  We should honor the words of Congressman Joseph Monaghan of Montana, \nwho said in April of 1935:\n\n       When the sun of life begins to set upon the aged of our \n     country, the . . . Government should extend to them a relief \n     from the weary toils of the day and to bring relief, comfort, \n     and security to them when the burdens of life are hardest to \n     bear and when the darkening shadows of approaching night \n     begin to fall upon his path to make further toil impossible, \n     to make further travel insecure, a just reward which their \n     toil has merited; an adequate old-age pension and not a \n     pauper's dole.\n\n  We should also honor the words of President Roosevelt, who said to \nCongress in 1934:\n\n       We must dedicate ourselves anew to a recovery of the old \n     and sacred possessive rights for which mankind has constantly \n     struggled: homes, livelihood, and individual security. The \n     road to these values is the way of progress. Neither you nor \n     I will rest content until we have done our utmost to move \n     further on that road.\n\n  We should honor our fathers and our mothers. We should honor this \nimportant social insurance, honor this protection that keeps our \nfathers and mothers from these darkening shadows of approaching night. \nWe should do so not just for them, we should do so also because it will \nhelp their children. It will help the economy to go well for us. It \nwill help us to live better lives, all the days we are on this good \nland that the Lord has given us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I first commend my colleague from \nMontana for his statement about Social Security and his leadership on \nthat issue. He has been the leader in the Senate in\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\ntrying to keep us focused on the real importance of maintaining Social \nSecurity and avoiding a privatized proposal, and I commend him for it. \nIt is an honor for me to serve with him on the Finance Committee and \nfollow his leadership on this issue.\n  As we all know, Social Security and proposals to change Social \nSecurity are very much the priority today in Washington, and \nparticularly this President. The President just yesterday, I believe, \nannounced that he will take the next 2 months to do a 60-city tour or \nto at least have events in 60 cities to try to promote his suggestion \nor his proposal for privatizing Social Security. Of course, this is a \ndecision he has made about how to use the political capital that he saw \nhimself coming out of the last election with.\n  Social Security is clearly an issue that deserves attention. There \nwill be serious difficulties with Social Security. I believe 38 years \nfrom now, with current projections, the system will not be able to pay \nfull benefits. I favor trying to find something that can be done to \nhead that off. I do not believe the President's proposal is the right \nsolution, and I have spoken out on that before.\n\n\n                           First Things First\n\n  What I want to do today is speak very briefly on a couple of other \nissues that I believe are more urgent and more priority issues that we \nin the Congress should be addressing and that the President should be \naddressing. If we are looking to how to spend the next 60 days, let us \nfocus on first things first. I remember reading a book Peter Drucker \nwrote many years ago called ``The Effective Executive.'' According to \nPeter Drucker, one of the attributes of an effective executive was that \nhe or she would work on first things first.\n  In my view, first things first today in our circumstance is not \nchanging Social Security. First things first is dealing with our budget \ndeficits and dealing with our trade deficits. Unfortunately, I believe \nwe are failing to deal with either of those issues in a responsible \nway.\n  First I will talk about the budget deficit. In 2004, we had a record \ndeficit of $412 billion. That was a turnaround from the $128 billion \nsurplus we had 4 years ago. In 2005, this year, the deficit is \nprojected to grow to $427 billion, and clearly this is an unsustainable \ncourse. We need to look carefully at the decisions we are making in \nWashington and what those decisions will do with regard to this very \nlarge budget deficit.\n  The first step in addressing the budget deficit is to make some tough \nchoices in this year's budget. The process starts with the President's \nrecently released proposal, and it will conclude with Congress's \nactions when we actually appropriate funds.\n  I support the President's stated intention to cut the deficit in half \nby 2009, although it is also clear to me that we cannot do so if we \nadopt his proposed budget. The budget claims to get us to that goal, \nbut, in fact, it falls short because it excludes so many large-ticket \nitems.\n\n  The budget does not include the real costs of going forward with the \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated that cost will be roughly $383 billion over the next 10 \nyears. The President has put in his budget an estimate for $81 billion. \nWe are going to be passing a supplemental appropriation for $81 billion \njust for current operations in Iraq, to say nothing of the next 5 or 10 \nyears of cost.\n  The second item the President's budget does not include is anything \nfor these so-called private accounts that the President wants to have \nus establish in Social Security. Again, the estimate in the President's \nbudget is zero. The phased-in cost of the administration's Social \nSecurity plan during the first 10 years is projected at $754 billion, \nand over 20 years it is projected at $4.5 trillion. The Senator from \nMontana spoke about that issue.\n  The third item the budget does not include is anything to deal with \nthe alternative minimum tax. Taxpayers must pay the alternative minimum \ntax if they have too many deductions and credits and, therefore, \notherwise are not paying a sufficient percent of their income in taxes. \nIf we made the President's tax cuts permanent, we would go from roughly \n3 million alternative minimum tax payers, which we had last year, to \nroughly 40 million alternative minimum tax payers at the end of the \ndecade. That is a very expensive proposition. If the tax cuts are to be \nmade permanent, reform of the alternative minimum tax is going to cost \na very substantial amount of money: $774 billion is the 10-year cost of \nreforming the alternative minimum tax during the years 2006 to 2015.\n  The failure to deal with the short-term cost of our defense budget \nand the proposal to make recent tax relief permanent is going to leave \nfuture generations with no options except to drastically raise taxes or \nto drastically cut services and benefits. Most of this should be \navoidable, but first we need a realistic plan about how to move \nforward. It is clear that simply cutting discretionary spending \naccounts, as the President's budget proposes, is not the answer.\n  To put this in context, the administration estimates that the deficit \nof 2005 is $425 billion. That is about the same as our entire \nnondefense discretionary spending for 2005. So you can eliminate all of \nthese departments whose spending levels we are going to be arguing \nabout here over the next several months: the Energy Department, \nEducation Department, Transportation Department, Department of \nCommerce, Department of Homeland Security. You can eliminate the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and you still do not solve the problem \nof the deficit. No one is proposing to eliminate all of that, but I \nthink it gives you a sense of the magnitude of the problem when you \nlook at the fact that we cannot solve this problem strictly by cutting \ndomestic discretionary spending. That is the point.\n  As we all know, debt matters. There are three obvious reasons why \ndebt matters. First, debt prevents us from dealing with the costs \ninvolved with the aging of our population. Second, we need to find \nother countries to lend us money as long as we are going to keep \nrunning this kind of enormous debt.\n  We have a chart here that shows where we are getting the money we are \nborrowing every day, every week, every month. These are the top 10 \ncountries that hold our national debt. Over 60 percent of our debt is \npurchased by foreign government banks. The top 10 countries are Japan, \nand we owe them $715 billion; China, $191 billion; United Kingdom, $152 \nbillion; ``Caribbean banking centers,'' we owe $76 billion; South \nKorea, we owe $69 billion. This was as of November 2004, so all of \nthose figures are now larger than this chart reflects.\n  A third reason why debt matters is that high deficit levels will \neventually result in higher interest rates. All of us know that higher \ninterest rates depress economic activity, hurt consumers, and clearly \nit does not make sense for us to take action here to adopt budgets that \nhave the ultimate effect of driving up interest rates.\n  What we need is a real plan, one that can be supported by a majority \nof the Members of the Congress, one that can become law. We need a \nbudget that is honest. We need to provide voters with clear choices, \nletting them know what the real impact of different options is.\n  One of the areas we need to deal with honestly and not just to \ndemagog is the issue of taxes. I believe there is sufficient bipartisan \nsupport to make permanent many of the tax provisions that are now \nscheduled to expire in 2010. For example, the marriage penalty relief, \nchild tax credit, 10-percent income tax bracket--those are provisions \nthat were adopted at the urging of President Bush which enjoy broad \nsupport here in the Congress and around the country. We should find a \nway to make that a permanent part of the tax package that we have \nearlier adopted.\n  Even though the administration requested that we make all of the 2001 \nand 2003 tax cuts permanent, I do not believe there are sufficient \nvotes in the Senate to do that. There are not enough votes because \nthere are enough Senators who realize we do not have the resources to \ndo that. Overall, making all of the tax cuts permanent will put us an \nadditional half trillion dollars in debt over the next 10 years.\n\n  Here is the chart that shows what happens after 2010, if you go ahead \nand do what the President is urging and make all these tax cuts \npermanent. You can see essentially that 10-year cost, from 2006 to \n2015, is $1.6 trillion. This is unsustainable. We need something \nresponsible we can negotiate and\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\non which we can arrive at a consensus. We need a real plan for dealing \nwith our budget deficit.\n  Let me say a few words also about the trade deficit. As we know, the \ntrade deficit is the difference between what we sell to the rest of the \nworld in goods and services and what they sell to us. On February 10, \nthe Department of Commerce released the trade data for 2004. The trade \ndeficit in 2004 was $617.7 billion. That is a new record for trade \ndeficits for the United States. It is a new record for any country. \nThere is no other country in the world that has ever had such a trade \ndeficit. It was $121 billion more than the previous record of $496 \nbillion we set in 2003.\n  To emphasize the point a little more, it was a 24-percent increase in \n1 year, in spite of 3 straight years of declines in the value of the \ndollar.\n  Let me show a couple of charts here. This first one shows what has \nhappened to trade deficits starting in 1992. It went up a little, then \nsort of leveled off during the mid-1990s, and then it started up again \nin 1998 and it has been going up ever since and there is no end in \nsight. I believe this is a major problem. Let me give you the reasons \nwhy.\n  If you look at historical context, in the mid-1980s the Reagan \nadministration found itself in a similar circumstance. This is a more \ncomplicated chart, but what it tries to do is show the trade deficit, \nwhich is this red line, and also show the value of the dollar compared \nto other currencies. The trade deficit started up in the mid-1980s, in \nthe Reagan administration. It was a concern then. The Reagan \nadministration was not known for its policies of Government \nintervention, but the Secretary of the Treasury then understood that \nsomething had to be done to deal with this growing trade deficit. The \nresult was the 1985 Plaza Accord, which bound the governments of the \nthen G-7 countries to pursue specific actions related to currency \nvaluations, market access, deregulation, deficit spending, and \nworkforce investment. And the deficit, the trade deficit, came down. \nThe value of the dollar came down relative to other currencies and the \ntrade deficit came down.\n  What we have now, and this chart makes the point very emphatically, \nis the value of the dollar went up and in the last 3 years it has been \ncoming down, but the trade deficit continues to go up. This is an \nunsustainable situation, just as the budget deficit is an unsustainable \nsituation. This affects people throughout the country in very obvious \nways.\n  This chart shows the trade deficit. Again, the red line is going up \nas compared to manufacturing exports, which have been going down in the \nlast 4 or 5 years. So you have people losing their jobs. You have U.S. \ncompanies finding it impossible to export. Accordingly, we have a very \nserious issue with decline in manufacturing jobs in the United States. \nIt is a long-term decline. It seems to continue unabated. While the \ntrade deficit continues to grow, manufacturing jobs continue to drop.\n  These charts speak to a very significant problem I believe needs \nattention. Let me suggest four concrete actions we could take to \naddress the trade deficit.\n  First, we need to recognize the importance of research and technology \ndevelopment in our own country. Across the board, we need to have \ntargeted investments in critical emerging technologies. We need to see \nto it that we remain on the cutting edge of new technologies. \nUnfortunately the administration's budget actually decreases support \nfor science and technology and engineering research and development. In \nmy view, that is moving us in the exact wrong direction.\n  This chart shows the budgets, proposed budgets the administration has \ngiven us for all of these agencies that are very involved in science \nand technology. You can see, with the exception of one agency, NASA, \neveryone else is slated for a cut. That is moving us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  A second step we can take is to actually step up and begin enforcing \nour trade agreements in a meaningful way. I think we have assumed that \nother countries will play by the rules, and the more trade agreements \nwe could enter into, the better off we will be. That has not proven to \nbe the case. The administration has done little to make many of these \ncountries abide by their agreements. China is the most salient example. \nWe have a $162 billion trade deficit with that country today. It is up \n31 percent from 2004 over 2003. We have lost well over a million jobs \nto China in the last decade or 15 years. China continues to manipulate \nthe value of its currency, continues to subsidize its exports. I \nbelieve it is time the administration insists on better treatment. It \nneeds to start by pressing the Chinese to revalue their currency. We \nhave a circumstance now where everything the Chinese send to us is \nartificially undervalued and everything we send to them is artificially \novervalued, and that hurts us badly.\n\n  The third suggestion I have is we need to improve our education and \nworkforce training systems. There is no question we need to have people \nwho can fill these jobs if we are going to hope to attract and retain \nthese jobs. Again, I point to the President's budget and say that it is \nwrongheaded in the extreme in this regard. The administration proposes \nelimination of these 48 educational programs. I am not suggesting all \nof those are meritorious, but many of them are, and many of them are \nhelping local school districts and States to improve their education \nsystem.\n  I think there are many things that can be done. I have various \nrecommendations of bills to try to help. I hope we can seriously push \nback against the administration on these proposed cuts in education and \ntraining, job training funds.\n  The final point I would suggest is the final concrete action we can \ntake to deal with the trade deficit is to encourage foreign firms to \ncontribute to the U.S. economy, to come here and establish here and \ncreate jobs here to a much greater extent than we have in the past. \nWhat we need is a national strategy to do the very same thing our \nStates are doing and our local communities are doing, and that is they \nare working hard to attract business and to create jobs. We need an \naggressive effort on the national level to do the same. We need a \nconcerted effort to market the United States to other countries as a \nplace to do business, a good place to do business.\n  I am working on legislation that I will introduce soon that would \nincrease the U.S. Government's efforts in this regard to establish a \nvery visible, assertive entity where the primary mission would be to \npromote increased foreign investment in the United States.\n  Once we take these steps, the four I have outlined, then we at least \nwould have some strategy in place to increase domestic investment and \nto draw foreign investment to our country to a greater extent. Maybe \nthose actions could help shrink the trade deficit.\n  We should be working on our highest priority problems, our most \nurgent problems. It is my firm belief that the budget deficit and the \ntrade deficit are those problems.\n  Let me finish by saying we should not allow politics as usual to \nprevail in this 109th Congress. The decline in the value of the dollar \nand the decisions that we have seen in recent weeks by foreign banks to \nbegin shifting their reserves from dollars to other currencies, those \nare our signals that financial markets want responsible action by this \nGovernment to deal with these two problems, the budget deficit and the \ntrade deficit.\n  I ask unanimous consent an editorial from earlier this week in the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that editorial makes the point that \nthese issues deserve attention, and we cannot postpone action on these \nissues indefinitely. We in Congress and the administration need to get \nthe message that foreign governments and foreign banks are sending to \nus. We need to face up to the challenge. We need to begin addressing \nthe budget deficit and the trade deficit as first priority issues, and \nnot push them off while we continue to deal with other matters.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2005]\n\n                             Dollar Jitters\n\n       Last week brought a warning to economic policymakers on \n     both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. A rumor that South Korea's \n     central bank had decided to shift its reserves away from \n     dollars triggered a sharp fall in the\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n     greenback and a retreat on Wall Street. The fact that the \n     South Koreans later denied this rumor is only half-\n     comforting. Economic logic is pushing Asia's central banks to \n     quit propping up the dollar. If a hollow rumor can rattle the \n     currency, what would a real policy change do?\n       The dollar's vulnerability reflects the nation's trade \n     deficit. To sustain their appetite for foreign goods, \n     Americans need to convert their dollars into other \n     currencies, depressing the greenback's value. This didn't \n     stop the dollar from being strong in the 1990s, because the \n     trade deficit was smaller then and because foreign investors \n     were hungry for American stocks, bonds and other assets, \n     reflecting the U.S. economy's eviable performance. But now \n     foreign investors' appetite for dollars lags behind \n     Americans' demand for foreign goods and services. The gap is \n     being filled by Asian governments, whose central banks have \n     accumulated vast piles of U.S. bonds in an attempt to slow \n     the dollar's slide.\n       A year or so ago, a fashionable theory held that this Asian \n     government support could continue indefinitely. Asian \n     policymakers, according to this theory, would prop up the \n     dollar to keep their own currencies competitive. It's true \n     that export-led growth is a quasi-religion in East Asia and \n     that China's dictators fear their grip on power might falter \n     if they can't keep growth and job creation humming. But China \n     and its neighbors have proved themselves capable of fast \n     growth even in periods when they haven't been artificially \n     depressing their own currencies. So it seems dangerous to bet \n     that Asian central banks will think it worth the risk of \n     holding ever-expanding dollar portfolios that can falter on a \n     rumor.\n       The other optimistic theory is that while Asians may not \n     want to prop up the dollar, they are prisoners of their own \n     policy. By now they've bought so many dollars that if they \n     quit buying, the value of their existing reserves would tank. \n     But what if one central bank worries that others will stop \n     buying dollars first? Such fears could trigger a stampede for \n     the exit.\n       None of this is to say that a dollar crash is inevitable. \n     The dollar may fall gently, as it has over the past year or \n     so, or a renewed appetite for U.S. assets among private \n     investors could even stabilize its value. But the risk of a \n     currency crash grows every day. In 2003, the United States \n     had to attract $530 billion of foreign capital to finance its \n     purchases of foreign stuff; in 2004 it had to attract $650 \n     billion; this year, it may have to pull in as much as $800 \n     billion. Every year of vast borrowing increases borrowing in \n     later years; as Brad Setser of Oxford University notes, just \n     paying interest on the $800 billion borrowed in 2005 might \n     add $40 billion to the overall 2006 deficit.\n       To stabilize this house of cards, Congress and the \n     administration should pull the one lever they have: They \n     should reduce the nation's reliance on foreign capital by \n     cutting government borrowing. This isn't going to be possible \n     through spending cuts alone. It's going to take higher taxes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                  Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nConnecticut, for giving me an opportunity to speak, and also my \ncolleague, the Senator from Alabama.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I, Senator Dodd, on behalf of \nourselves, and Senators Enzi, Kennedy, Roberts, and Hatch, yesterday \nintroduced the Caring for Children Act of 2005 which reauthorizes the \nChild Care Development Block Grant Program. This is a program that is \nvery important to families across this country. I am pleased that our \ncommittee is progressing in a bipartisan way on the very important \npiece of legislation.\n  Today I want to talk about a piece of legislation I introduced \nearlier this week. It is called the Federal Consent Decree Fairness \nAct. It has to do with federalism, with democracy, with \nresponsibilities of State and local government. It has to do with our \neffort to try to restrain the growth of the cost of Medicaid so that we \ncan properly fund other programs such as higher education, elementary \nand secondary education, and research. I introduced that legislation, \nalong with Senator Pryor of Arkansas, who is the lead Democratic \nsponsor. Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl joined us at that time.\n  Since that time, 12 other Senators have asked to join us. I ask \nunanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors to \nS. 489, the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act: Senators McConnell, \nBennett, Cochran, Craig, Domenici, Hutchison, Inhofe, Lott, Roberts, \nSantorum, Smith, and Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I failed to mention an early sponsor and a principal \nsponsor, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska.\n  Senator Nelson of Nebraska is a former Governor. Senator Pryor is a \nformer attorney general. Senator Cornyn is a former attorney general. I \nam a former Governor. That explains part of our interest in this. \nCongressman Jim Cooper, by the way, a Democrat from Nashville, will be \nthe principal Democratic sponsor of this legislation in the House. It \nhas strong bipartisan support.\n  As I will show in a few minutes, it strongly supports the idea of \nlimiting what we call democracy by court decree. Limiting the idea of \nFederal courts running the Government has strong bipartisan appeal. It \nhas strong support from the left and the right, because democracy by \ncourt decree interferes with democracy. It interferes with the ability \nof voters to elect officials who are accountable, and then throw them \nout if they don't like what they are doing.\n  Consent decrees, which are judicial orders based on the consent of \nthe parties engaged in civil court action, can be an effective judicial \ntool when drawn narrowly, and with respect to State and local policy \nchoices. Congress passes legislation and sets conditions on grants that \nmust be followed by State and local governments. When they are not \nfollowed, it is important for citizens to be able to turn to the court \nto see that their rights and the rule of law are upheld. That is the \nheart of the idea of federalism.\n  Unfortunately, in many cases, rather than preserving the separation \nof powers between the Federal Government and the State government, \nconsent decrees have the opposite effect. What we are seeing in State \nafter State is government policy controlled by courts and judges \ninstead of by Governors, mayors, and legislators.\n  For example, in Maine in 2003, the Governor had to propose deep cuts \nto mental health services for children because consent decrees made it \nalmost impossible to restrain other parts of the budget.\n  In New York City, Latino parents are upset because schools are \nforcing their children into bilingual education programs when they want \nthem in a different kind of program to learn English. And why is that \nhappening? Because for the last 30 years, bilingual education in New \nYork has been mandated by a consent decree that the schools have no \nchoice but to obey.\n  In Los Angeles, a consent decree has forced the Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority to spend $110 million per year on improving city buses. That \nsounds like a good idea. But that is 47 percent of the Metropolitan \nTransit Authority's budget spent on just buses, leaving the remaining \n53 percent to pay for street and freeway improvements, rail systems, \ntransportation planning programs, and the reduction of debt. Meanwhile, \nridership on MTA buses increased only marginally in the first 6 years \nof judicial management, and residents of Los Angeles complain that \nother MTA services are suffering, and their elected officials are not \nable to do anything about it because the courts are running the transit \nauthority.\n  The State of Tennessee has also become a victim of democracy by court \ndecree. Tennessee, like every State, has to balance its budget. I can \nspeak from experience. I did it for 8 years. I know it involves some \ndifficult choices. Our Democratic Governor Bredesen of Tennessee is \nmaking some of those choices. But he can't do it because the Federal \nGovernment has refused to let him to do what he feels he needs to do to \nbalance the budget.\n  Late last year, it became apparent that the costs of the Medicaid \nprogram in Tennessee are rising at an unsustainable rate. The Medicaid \ncaseload has gone up 40 percent across this country in the last 5 \nyears. When you combine that with sharp increase in the rate of \ninflation for health care costs over the regular inflation rate, we get \na staggering impact, not only on the Federal Government but especially \non State Governors who are balancing their budgets. The inevitable \nresult of that is the Governors reach to find somewhere else to get the \nmoney to balance their budget. Where does it come from? It comes from \neducation. It comes from especially higher education. In the last 4 \nyears, Federal spending for K-12 education has gone up about 40 \npercent. In Tennessee, spending for K-12 education over those same 4 \nyears has gone up about 11 percent.\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\n  In other words, Federal spending is going up three times the rate of \nState spending. The reason is Medicaid is eating up the money, and the \nGovernor is unable to control the growth of Medicaid because the \nFederal court says it can decide better than the Governor can where \nthose dollars ought to be spent. For example, pre-K education is \nsomething on which Governor Bredesen wants to spend the money. He can't \ncharter a preschool program, an important program such as I suppose the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut is advocating nationally. His \nhands are tied. Governor Bredesen has tackled TennCare. He ran for \noffice and said, ``I wanted to be elected to fix the TennCare \nProgram.'' He has come up with a plan that would result in Medicaid \nspending in Tennessee rising only $75 million this year instead of the \n$650 million it will rise without those changes. But he is constrained \nby a series of four Federal court consent decrees entered into by his \npredecessors going back 25 years.\n  These consent decrees dictate policies on medical screening for \nchildren, requiring the States to provide patients with high-cost, \nbrand name prescription drugs, and affecting the ability of States to \nverify the eligibility of the patients they serve. But most \nimportantly, they deny the voters the opportunity to have a new \nGovernor and a new legislature look at all of their programs and make \nchoices about how and where to spend the money.\n  In the face of enormous pressures, the Federal courts are going to \nforce Tennessee to maintain programs that the Governor says he would \nrather not maintain because he would rather spend the money for \neducation.\n\n  Governor Bredesen is making painful, difficult decisions. He has \nproposed cutting 323,000 adults from TennCare and limiting the benefits \nfor the remaining 396,000 adults because he wants to strengthen \nTennessee's pre-K and K-12 programs, and have a first-rate system for \ncolleges and universities.\n  I might emphasize that the services the Governor hopes to limit are \nnot required by the Federal Government. They are optional services that \nStates may or may not offer, according to the Federal law, except they \nare not as optional as we might think. On January 29, Judge William \nHaynes, U.S. District Judge, declared he must approve any of those \nchanges. So we have a Federal court judge, not the Governor and \nlegislature, making those decisions.\n  The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act contains three main \nprovisions that address many of these concerns. First, it lays out a \nseries of guidelines that will guide Federal courts in approving future \nconsent decrees. Basically, these guidelines follow suggestions which \nthe U.S. Supreme Court made in the year 2004 in a decision in which it \nexpressed concern about the fact that old consent decrees were limiting \nthe actions of newly elected officials and interfering with democracy.\n  The bottom line of these guidelines is to narrow the consent decrees \nand encourage the courts to get the decision-making back in the hands \nof the elected officials as soon as possible.\n  Second, our legislation creates term limits for consent decrees. \nFundamentally, it says any new Governor may go into the court and ask \nthe judge to vacate or modify that consent decree; or a Governor or \nmayor may do that 4 years after the original date of the consent \ndecree.\n  Seventy-five of the 100 Senators in this body have served in State or \nlocal government before. I am sure they can understand the frustration \nof being elected to fix the schools, or improve the roads, or repair \nthe prisons, or restrain growth of Medicaid, or improve colleges, and \ndiscover they don't have the authority to do it because the Governor or \nmayor 15 years ago entered into a consent decree and the court approved \nit, and the newly elected official can't change it.\n  Finally, the bill shifts the burden of proof from the State and local \ngovernments to the plaintiffs in the case.\n  Under current law, State and local governments must prove that a \ndecree is no longer necessary to protect the plaintiffs' rights. In \nother words, they must prove a negative. Now the plaintiff will have to \nprove that the court interference with the decisions of elected \nofficials is still needed.\n  The court still retains full control of the case. The court still \nretains the ability to protect the rights of Americans. But the court \nwould have instructions to say that if the parties come to you and say, \n``Mr. Court, Ms. Court, we can't solve this problem, will you approve \nthis consent decree?'' The court will say, ``I will temporarily get \ninvolved in what is your responsibility, but I will do it under a \nnarrowly defined set of terms and very shortly I will make sure that it \ngets back in the hands of elected officials.''\n  I have in my remarks, which I will submit in complete form for the \nRecord, some of the comments of the Supreme Court in Frew v. Hawkins in \n2004. The Court took an extraordinary step in inviting the Congress to \npass legislation such as this and in suggesting to the Federal courts \nthat they might narrow their consent decrees and as soon as possible \nget these decisions back in the hands of elected officials.\n  In other words, the principle here is democracy and whether unelected \npeople or elected people will make the decisions.\n  This is an especially important piece of legislation at a time when \nwe are considering Medicaid. We are asking States to restrain the \ngrowth of Medicaid. We are still spending a lot of money. Over the next \n10 years, we propose to spend $1.2 trillion--new dollars. We are not \nrestraining spending much. But if the caseload is growing by 40 \npercent, and if the cost of health care is rising faster than the \nnormal cost of living, and if we still require Georgia, or Connecticut, \nor Alabama, or Tennessee, to pay for 43 percent of Medicaid, and we \nhaven't changed the eligibility requirements, and we don't give the \nStates much flexibility, and the Federal court tells the Governors they \ncan't do it, we are giving the States an impossible assignment. The \nonly result will be the gradual destruction of our system of higher \neducation, which is principally funded by State governments.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to seriously consider this legislation. \nI am glad to see 17 Senators of both parties have already signed on. I \nam glad a leading Democrat in the House, Congressman Jim Cooper, will \nbe sponsoring a version of this bill as well.\n  I will have printed in the Record a series of comments about a book, \n``Democracy By Decree,'' which is the scholarship on which this \nlegislation is based. This book is by Ross Sandler and David \nSchoenbrod, professors at the New York Law School. The book is \npublished by Yale University Press. It has been widely praised by \ncolumnists as evenhanded. Among those who praise the scholarship are \nformer Senator Bill Bradley, Ed Koch, Diane Ravitch, John Sexton, \npresident of the New York University and Dean of the NYU Law School, \nand Chris DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Policy Institute \nfor Public Policy Research. Not many pieces of scholarship have support \nfrom such a broad spectrum.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed after my remarks the complete \ncomments of those individuals I just mentioned, as well as a column by \nGeorge F. Will in Newsweek on November 28th, saying that ``Democracy By \nDecree'' is one of the most important books on governing in the last 10 \nyears. I ask unanimous consent also to have printed an article from the \nWall Street Journal on December 31, 2002, by Thomas J. Main, assistant \nprofessor at the School of Public Affairs of Baruch College. I ask \nunanimous consent that a review of the book by Ross Weiner in the Legal \nTimes also be printed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit A.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Alexander, I appreciate your remarks, having \nbeen a U.S. attorney involved in urging certain consent decrees and \nhaving been an attorney general and seeing it from the side of the \nState.\n  My question is this: What your legislation would do is provide a \nmechanism to guarantee a periodic review of a consent decree so it \nwould not continue indefinitely. There are many in this country that \nare well over 20 years in which judges are intimately involved in \ndetails of governing and the local people have to seek approval for any \nof the most minute changes.\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\n  This would not eliminate consent decrees. It would not eliminate \ntheir enforcement, but it creates a mechanism by which they are \nperiodically reviewed so as to determine whether they should be \nextended.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is absolutely right. Perhaps Congressman \nCooper had the best phrase. He said the purpose of this legislation is \nto keep democracy fresh.\n  The people are entitled to two things. One is to have their \nconstitutional and Federal rights enforced in the Federal courts. This \nwill continue under this legislation. But they are also entitled to \nhave democratically elected leaders that can make the policy decisions \nand do the governing, which is what we say to the rest of the world.\n  We are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, sacrificing lives and \nhundreds of billions of dollars to promote the idea that people have a \nright to elect their own officials, yet we have drifted into the \nsituation somewhere, as in the Tennessee case, where we have four prior \nconsent decrees that will leave in the Federal courts these decisions \nand the Governor cannot change them. Even though a previous Governor \nentered into them, the standards are such he cannot change them.\n  He has a right to go in there and say, Judge, I hope you will review \nit. The plaintiff, not the Governor, has to persuade the judge that it \nneeds to be continued. And if it does, the court may continue the \nconsent decree if he considers it to be useful.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to the Senator, I think that is a very thoughtful \nand important change he is proposing. We need to give it the most \nserious consideration. It would strike me that it does go to the heart \nof what democracy is. We created a legislative and executive branch \nelected by the people and empowered to deal with certain of these \nissues. It should be only for extraordinary things that a court would \nmaintain extended jurisdiction over the elected representatives.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  When the word ``judges'' is mentioned in this Chamber, we \nautomatically divide, especially during this season. That is why I am \nso glad Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator Nelson of Nebraska, and \nCongressman Cooper have joined in this. Former Senator Bill Bradley has \npraised the ideas found in ``Democracy by Decree.''\n  This is not a Democratic or Republican idea. Democracy is everyone's \nidea in this country. One reason it has such broad support is that it \nis not just the court's fault that this is happening; sometimes \nGovernors and mayors do not want to deal with the prison problem. They \ndo not want to deal with the Medicaid problem, so they unload it on the \ncourts. That hurts the people who should be helped. It deprives the \nvoters of their right to choose elected officials.\n  The bill has broad bipartisan support. I hope it continues to have. I \nam grateful to the Senator from Connecticut for giving me an \nopportunity to make my remarks today before he made his remarks.\n\n                               Exhibit A\n\n                     Praise for Democracy by Decree\n\n                 (By Ross Sandler and David Schoenbrod)\n\n       ``The first book that shows how courts can do their proper \n     job of protecting rights without allowing elected officials \n     off the hook for their proper job of making policy.''--Former \n     Senator Bill Bradley\n       ``A fascinating book for someone like me who regretted \n     agreeing to a court-approved consent decree limiting the \n     city's authority in programs involving prisons, welfare, \n     education, homeless shelters, etc.''--Ed Koch, former mayor, \n     New York City\n       ``A brilliant, well-written, and brave account of how \n     federal courts have distorted our political system by taking \n     control of complex institutions like schools and prisons--\n     sometimes for decades--instead of enforcing rights, which is \n     their proper domain.''--Diane Ravitch, New York University\n       ``With fascinating blow-by-blow accounts, Sandler and \n     Schoenbrod expose how advocates for one interest group \n     inevitably undermine the interests of others and thwart the \n     ability of those in responsibility to balance interests for \n     the common good.''--Philip K. Howard, author of The Death of \n     Common Sense\n       ``Democracy by Decree is an impressive and thoughtful \n     analysis of the current court-centered rights culture in \n     which it is too easy for elected officials to `pass the buck' \n     to courts while taking actions that are blatantly \n     unconstitutional.''--Nadine Strossen, president, American \n     Civil Liberties Union, and professor, New York Law School\n       ``Democracy by Decree shows how courts can protect rights \n     and still let mayors and governors do their job.''--John \n     Sexton, president of New York University and dean of New York \n     University School of Law\n       ``Sandler and Schoenbrod's account--really a discovery--of \n     the existence of a second government in our midst is \n     meticulous, nuanced, and alarming. By showing how unilateral \n     judicial government undermines both democracy and individual \n     rights, they have done a significant service to both.'' \n     Christopher DeMuth, president, American Enterprise Institute \n     for Public Policy Research\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Feb. 28, 2005]\n\n                       Judges and ``Soft Rights''\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       On Feb. 15 the New York Times carried this headline: Judge \n     Orders Billions in Aid to City Schools. The derangement of \n     American government, and the decay of democratic \n     sensibilities under rule by the judiciary, are apparent in \n     the fact that such headlines do not enrage, or even startle.\n       In a case that began 12 years ago, and will surely run at \n     least 12 more, Leland DeGrasse of the New York Supreme Court \n     has decreed that an extra $5.6 billion, a 43 percent increase \n     in the school budget, must be spent on the schools every \n     year--presumably until he decides that the schools are \n     delivering a ``sound basic'' education. And over the next \n     five years another $9.2 billion must be spent to improve \n     class sizes and facilities.\n       Why? Because the state constitution says, ``The legislature \n     shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of \n     free common schools, wherein all the children of the state \n     maybe educated'' and this has been interpreted to guarantee a \n     ``sound basic'' education. Those two adjectives are the \n     slender reeds supporting this latest excess by the imperial \n     judiciary.\n       In 1993 the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a self-generated \n     group, unelected and accountable to nobody, sued, charging \n     that the constitution's adjectives were not being fulfilled. \n     Between 1997 and 2003 spending on the city's schools rose \n     $4.8 billion--54.5 percent. But DeGrasse, who apparently \n     thinks he learned in law school how to fix urban education, \n     believes the canard that in primary and secondary education \n     there is a clear causal connection between financial inputs \n     and cognitive outputs--that the best schools are the ones on \n     which the most money is spent. Actually, New York ranks third \n     among the states in per-pupil spending ($11,218; the national \n     average is $7,734). The highest per-pupil spending is in \n     Washington, D.C., which probably has the nation's worst \n     schools.\n       DeGrasse's ruling is just the latest of thousands of such \n     instances of judicial overreaching involving schools, \n     prisons, hospitals, transportation, environmental policies \n     and other matters. Constitutional or, more often, statutory \n     language stipulates praiseworthy but vague goals to \n     be enforced by courts. Then ``public interest'' groups, \n     eager to wield the power of elected officials without the \n     tiresome matter of running for office, go to courts.\n       The courts, with an arrogance often tacitly encouraged by \n     elected officials eager to avoid difficult choices, wander \n     beyond their competence. They do not merely enforce \n     compliance with the law, they dictate in minute detail what \n     shall constitute compliance--e.g., the water temperature in \n     prison showers, the soap used to wash prison floors, the \n     frequency with which prison windows are washed. Really.\n       In 2003 two professors at the New York Law School, Ross \n     Sandler and David Soenbrod, published ``Democracy by Decree: \n     What Happens When Courts Run Government'' (Yale), perhaps one \n     of this decade's most important books on governance. They \n     explain how federal standards are attached to federal money \n     by Congress's heroically transmuting aspirations into rights-\n     enforceable claims. Congress has become a bestower of mass-\n     produced rights--to ``healthy'' air, to ``appropriate'' \n     education for the handicapped, etc.\n       These are what Sandler and Schoenbrad call ``soft rights'': \n     ``Traditional common law rights, such as the right against \n     trespass, are typically negative. They tell government what \n     it cannot do. Soft rights, such as the right to healthy air, \n     are typically positive. They tell government what it must \n     do.'' In practice, judges--unelected, unaccountable and \n     inexpert--often dictate what it must do.\n       Some political activists have decided that, the dismantling \n     of segregation proved that the primary means of social \n     improvement should be through judicially enforceable rights. \n     And many liberals, frustrated by the public's increasing \n     conservatism, are unwilling to have the patience required by \n     democracy--the politics of persuasion. They know that rights \n     claims can truncate debate and trump policy considerations \n     about the community's conflicting imperatives and priorities. \n     And ``public interest'' groups have become skilled at getting \n     themselves entitled to control a sphere of public policy. \n     They negotiate consent decrees, many of which have empowered \n     courts-as-legislatures to formulate public policies for 20 or \n     30 years. All of which confirms Sandler and Schoenbrod's \n     central point: Not all that lawyers do in their various \n     venues amounts to the rule of law, as a democracy ought to \n     understand that.\n       In responding to DeGrasse's hubris, New York might consider \n     Andrew Jackson's strategy. In 1832 the Supreme Court rendered \n     a decision favoring two imprisoned missionaries in Georgia, a \n     decision Jackson disagreed with, vehemently. He reportedly \n     said:\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\n     ``[Chief Justice] John Marshall has made his decision, now \n     let him enforce it.'' Marshall could not; the missionaries \n     remained in prison.\n       New York's Supreme Court can neither tax nor spend. The \n     state legislature is not a party to the suit, so it cannot be \n     held in contempt. Perhaps it should just ignore the court's \n     ruling as noise not relevant to the rule of law. Which \n     happens to be the case.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 31, 2002]\n\n                       Closed Doors, Open Season\n\n                          (By Thomas J. Main)\n\n       Ten prisoners in a Philadelphia prison sued Mayor Wilson \n     Goode in the early 1980s claiming that conditions there \n     violated their rights. The result was a consent decree, in \n     1986, that limited the number of prisoners who could be held \n     in the city's jails.\n       And the result of the decree itself? ``A blood-chilling \n     crime wave,'' write Ross Sandler and David Schoenbrod. In 18 \n     months, ``police rearrested 9,732 defendants released because \n     of the consent decree.'' They were charged with ``79 murders, \n     959 robberies, 2,215 drug dealing crimes, 701 burglaries, \n     2,748 thefts, 90 rapes 14 kidnappings, 1,113 assaults, 264 \n     gun-law violations and 127 drunk-driving incidents.'' This is \n     only one of the hair-raising stories in ``Democracy by \n     Decree,'' (Yale, 280 pages, $30) a critique of astonishing \n     efforts to govern society through the miracle of what the \n     authors call ``institutional reform litigation.''\n       The tactic is simple: A crusading lawyer notices that some \n     public entity--a prison, a hospital, an environmental or \n     child-welfare agency--is performing below expectations, as \n     the lawyer sees it. He then finds ``parties'' willing to say \n     they have been injured and searches for a legal hook--a \n     statute, regulation or right whose violation offers the basis \n     for a lawsuit.\n       And legal hooks abound. Congress regularly passes laws with \n     sweeping guarantees vaguely phrased. Did the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (1990) really require curb ramps at every \n     intersection within just five years? Did the Clean Air Act of \n     1970 really promise that the air will be entirely clean by \n     the end of the decade? (And when, precisely, is air \n     ``clean''?) Can schools immediately offer a free and \n     appropriate education to all children with learning \n     disabilities, as the Education for All Handicapped Children \n     Act (1975) seemed to require?\n       These may be worthy goals, if they are indeed required by \n     statute. But they are not easily achieved. Indeed, state and \n     local governments are likely to act on them as they act on \n     everything else: incrementally, tentatively and piecemeal. \n     Thus it is often possible for public-interest lawyers to make \n     a prima facie case for one violation or another. Not that \n     they need do much more than that. Many public officials--\n     rather than submit to trial and the risk, however slim, of \n     draconian punishment--settle such cases by entering into \n     consent decrees with plaintiffs.\n       Consent of the sued? Public officials would rather settle \n     than fight.\n       From this point on, as Messrs. Sandler and Schoenbrod show, \n     the powers of elected officials ``are eroded in favor of a \n     negotiating process between plaintiffs' attorneys, various \n     court-appointed functionaries, and lower echelon officials.'' \n     This controlling group, as the authors call it, ``works \n     behind closed doors'' to draft complicated decrees. Its \n     members bargain, log-roll and cut deals, and the judges \n     before whom the original suit was brought rarely intervene.\n       Under such circumstanes, the concerns of ordinary public \n     managers get short shrift. In Jose P. v. Ambach, for \n     instance, a consent decree dictated the terms of ``every \n     aspect of [New York's] special education; from staffing to \n     teaching and collecting data.'' With appendices, it filled \n     515 pages.\n       And once a consent decree is agreed on, it is very \n     difficult to change, even in the face of dramatic \n     developments. In 1971, for instance, the New York City \n     Housing Authority was accused of failing to give rent-\n     delinquent tenants due process. The city signed a consent \n     decree that imposed elaborate, court-supervised procedures \n     for eviction. Twenty years later, the crack-cocaine epidemic \n     hit public housing, and everyone--city officials and law-\n     abiding tenants alike--wanted to speed along the eviction of \n     drug-dealers.\n       The decree's controlling group, however, objected to \n     quicker procedures. Its members even disputed ``whether \n     living next door to a drug dealer actually increased the risk \n     of criminal violence.'' It took two years of legal wrangling \n     before the Housing Authority could make its changes, and \n     by then the tenants had hired new lawyers to fight \n     ``against the lawyers who theoretically were representing \n     them.''\n       It should be said that Messrs. Sandler and Schoenbrod do \n     not oppose all public-interest litigation. They note that \n     lawsuits have helped put an end to racial segregation and to \n     the abominable conditions in various prisons and mental \n     institutions. They accept court intervention in even less \n     dramatic cases, as long as some common-sensical reforms are \n     put in place, like opening controlling-group meetings to the \n     public and making it easier to change outdated provisions. \n     They note as well that the rights asserted by Congress are \n     too often ``aspirations rather than practical \n     possibilities.'' In any case, making minute policy \n     adjustments is best left to the political branches of \n     government, not the courts.\n       One of the book's most striking anecdotes illustrates this. \n     In the early 1990s, New York tried to install sidewalk \n     toilets, only to run into the problem of making them large \n     enough for wheelchairs--as required by regulators \n     interpreting federal law--without making them inadvertent \n     criminal dens. At a public meeting, the spokesmen for the \n     toilets' maker, whose designs were apparently not generous \n     enough, found themselves confronted by angry citizens in \n     wheelchairs. Then in walked another advocate, whose \n     disability, the authors write, ``was that he grew to be only \n     about three feet high.''\n       ``I don't care about wheelchair accessibility,'' this man \n     declared belligerently. ``I can't reach the higher toilet \n     seat in the wheelchair-accessible toilets. What about that?''\n       To this question, the law has no good answer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Legal Times, May 5, 2003]\n\n                     The Corrosive Consent Decrees \n\n                            (By Ross Weiner)\n\n       Democracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run \n     Government is a thought-provoking book about the fundamental \n     issues of democracy, federalism, and separation of powers. \n     Authors Ross Sandler and David Schoenbrod put forward a \n     forceful critique of the consent decrees that often result \n     from institutional reform litigation and have, over time, \n     reduced the power of democratically elected state and local \n     institutions to make public policy choices.\n       Yet Democracy by Decree is not a wholesale attack on class \n     actions or the consent decrees that often settle these cases. \n     The authors, who both teach at New York Law School, are \n     content to offer reform proposals, but do not advocate \n     removing the judiciary from its important place in protecting \n     the rights of aggrieved plaintiffs. But they do forcefully \n     attack the habit of using courts, and class actions in \n     particular, to make public policy decisions that are better \n     left to the democratically elected.\n       The authors argue that the courts are the proper forum for \n     remedial action or for limited prospective action to ensure \n     that constitutional rights are not violated, but that \n     institutional reform litigation creates many negative \n     unforeseen consequences when it encroaches upon the elected \n     branches of government by instituting widespread oversight of \n     public institutions.\n       Sandler and Schoenbrod trace the historical development of \n     institutional reform litigation to the civil rights movement. \n     They argue that the heroic achievements of civil rights era \n     attorneys in dismantling segregation inspired a generation of \n     attorneys to become ``public interest'' lawyers to fight for \n     social change. Many elected Southern officeholders at the \n     time actively worked to subvert the constitutional rights of \n     their African-American constituents, and this massive \n     resistance forced the judiciary to take over the management \n     of several public institutions to ensure that African-\n     Americans could freely exercise their constitutional rights. \n     They note that the difference between the attitudes of local \n     and state officeholders during the civil rights era and the \n     attitudes of later elected officials is often lost on these \n     public interest attorneys.\n       The authors argue that, in much of the recent institutional \n     reform litigation, the rights at issue and the behavior of \n     elected officials is less stark than that during the civil \n     rights era. While their policies may in fact violate \n     statutory rights, their intentions are far less nefarious. \n     Rather, this litigation often concerns statutory rights or \n     federal aspirations, while local elected officials attempt to \n     balance public policy choices with their constituencies' own \n     limited financial wherewithal. These officeholders often \n     support the underlying rights being enforced, but are simply \n     unable to muster the public resources to attain those \n     unfunded federal mandates. Such new rights often call for \n     government to provide something to its citizens, unlike a \n     more traditional right, which called for government to \n     refrain from taking something away from the citizenry.\n       The authors postulate that most of these officeholders are \n     a far cry from the Southern segregationists, but that \n     the public interest lawyers and the judiciary have devised \n     standard remedial actions that do not differentiate \n     between the attitudes of officeholders and the rights \n     being enforced.\n       Democracy by Decree provides many examples of cases that \n     illustrate the perils and unforeseen consequences of \n     institutional reform litigation. Jose P. v. Ambach, which \n     began in 1979, shows how the judicial process usurped special \n     education policy in New York City.\n       This case has its roots in the congressional passage of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act. The legislation \n     contained vague goals, but with no clear mechanism outlining \n     for states and localities the means to achieve the nebulous \n     ends outlined in the statute. The federal right to special \n     education created by this statute begat class action \n     litigation to enforce such a right when New York City could \n     not comply with all the goals outlined in the statute.\n       The litigation ultimately resulted in a court finding New \n     York City in violation of the statute, and affirming a very \n     broad consent decree among plaintiffs and city officials, \n     which mandated many changes to special education policy in \n     New York City. Over the decades in which this decree has been \n     in place, the court and the plaintiffs' attorneys have had \n     the authority to reject or approve all changes to the city's \n     special education program. This has shifted policy-making\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\n     power from open forums among the elected City Council and \n     city agencies to closed-door negotiations between attorneys.\n       The authors show how this has led to many unintended \n     consequences, including the locking into place of special \n     education policy designed more than two decades ago, which \n     now may be outdated; the reduction of money available for \n     students in nonspecial education classes; and the awarding to \n     plaintiffs' attorneys of a significant degree of control over \n     a large portion of the city's budget.\n       An intended consequence of these types of consent decrees \n     is to limit the variety of policy choices available to \n     elected officials. The authors contend that when public \n     interest attorneys were confronting massive resistance, this \n     was the correct choice for the judiciary. But when \n     confronting public officials who attempt to deal with such \n     issues by balancing the proper amount of funding for special \n     and nonspecial education programs, more flexibility is \n     required.\n       The authors argue that it is sometimes appropriate to \n     restrain the future actions of private citizens indefinitely \n     in private litigation, but in institutional reform \n     litigation--in the absence of an intent to impede the \n     constitutional rights of individuals--present day \n     officeholders should not be allowed to sign away the rights \n     of the people and their future representatives to make public \n     policy choices.\n       Sandler and Schoenbrod emphasize sympathetically that they, \n     too, were once public interest attorneys. And they avow their \n     admiration for the efforts of civil-rights lawyers to fight \n     segregation. Thus, the tone of the book feels similar to that \n     of a journalist paying homage to Bob Woodward and Carl \n     Bernstein, while attacking the type of journalism that may \n     have developed in the wake of Watergate. Such rhetorical \n     shields appear to be attempts to protect their work from \n     political criticism by public interest attorneys and the \n     lobbying groups they populate. Their homage to the roots of \n     public interest litigation does bolster the credibility of \n     Democracy by Decree, and it is to their merit that they do \n     not resort to the tired clichs often heard in the political \n     arena about judicial activism.\n       At its heart, Democracy by Decree is an ode to \n     representative government. The authors demonstrate that the \n     judiciary has an important role in protecting the rights of \n     citizens, but argue convincingly that when it comes to making \n     basic public policy choices, representative democracy may not \n     be perfect, but it is often better than any viable \n     alternative.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson, have joined Senator Pryor and me in \nintroducing this bill. Congressman Jim Cooper from Tennessee will be \nintroducing similar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  This is bipartisan legislation that will help slow down the practice \nof democracy by decree--Federal courts running State and local \ngovernments.\n  Consent decrees--judicial orders based on the consent of parties \nengaged in a civil court action--can be an effective judicial tool when \ndrawn narrowly and with respect for State and local policy choices. \nCongress passes laws and sets conditions on grants that must be \nfollowed by State and local governments, and when they are not followed \nit is important for citizens to be able to turn to the courts to see \nthat the rule of law is upheld. That is at the heart of the idea of \nfederalism.\n  Unfortunately, in many cases, rather than preserve the separation of \npowers between the Federal Government and State governments, consent \ndecrees have done just the opposite. What we are seeing in State after \nState is government policy controlled by courts and judges instead of \nby Governors, mayors, and legislatures.\n  In Maine, in 2003, the Governor had to propose deep cuts to mental \nhealth services for children because consent decrees made it almost \nimpossible to cut other parts of the budget.\n  In New York City, Latino parents are outraged because schools are \nforcing their children into bilingual education programs when the \nparents want them in all-English classes. Why? Because for the last 30 \nyears, bilingual education in New York has been mandated by a consent \ndecree that the schools have no choice but to obey.\n  In Los Angeles, a consent decree has forced the Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority to send $110 million per year on improving city buses. That \nis 47 percent of its budget just on buses, leaving the remaining 53 \npercent pay for street and freeway improvements, rail systems, \ntransportation planning programs, and the reduction of its debt. \nMeanwhile, ridership on MTA buses increased only marginally in the \nfirst 6 years of judicial management and residents of Los Angeles \ncomplain that other MTA services are suffering.\n  The State of Tennessee has also become a victim of democracy by \ndecree.\n  In Tennessee, like in every State, governments do not have the luxury \nwe have up here of being able to deficit spend. State governments need \nto balance the budget, and I can speak from experience when I say that \nis a process that involves making excruciating choices. In Tennessee, \nhowever, Governor Bredesen has had fewer choices to make because the \nFederal court has refused to let him do what he needs to do to balance \nthe budget.\n  Late last year, it became apparent that the rising cost of providing \nMedicaid--and in the case of Tennessee, we have a program called \nTennCare on a waiver from CMS would result in an additional $650 \nmillion in costs to the State of Tennessee in the upcoming 2006 budget. \nNow, Governor Bredesen has a plan that he says would result in costs \nonly rising $75 million in the next year, but he can not implement it \nbecause he is constrained by a series of consent decrees. These consent \ndecrees prescribe policies on medical screenings for children, require \nthe State to provide patients with high-cost, brand-name prescription \ndrugs, and affects the ability of the State to verify the eligibility \nof the patients it serves.\n  On the face of it, it sounds like these are all good things. Of \ncourse we want children to get screenings that will help prevent \nserious illness and of course we want to make sure patients have \nprescription drugs. The problem is that whereas the Federal Medicaid \nlaws say one thing, Federal judges are turning that into a whole series \nof requirements that States are then bound by for as long as a Federal \njudge decides it is necessary.\n  For example, regarding medical screenings for children: Medicaid \nlaw--section 1905(r)(5) of the Social Security Act requires that \nchildren receive ``such other necessary health care, diagnostic \nservices, treatment and other measures . . . to correct or ameliorate \ndefects and physical and mental illnesses under the State plan.'' Now, \nfrom that one line of Federal code, the court entered a consent decree \nthat established a deadline for Tennessee to improve its performance to \nensure that 80 percent of eligible beneficiaries were receiving this \nscreening.\n  Nonetheless, even in the face of enormous budget pressures, the \nFederal courts are going to force Tennessee to maintain the programs \nthat will keep it on track to meet that 80 percent goal. So Governor \nBredesen had to make a painful decision; he had to cut 323,000 adults \nfrom TennCare and limit benefits for the remaining 396,000 adults. \nLet's be clear here--these beneficiaries are people that the State of \nTennessee has decided to provide health care services to even though \nthe Federal Medicaid laws do not require the State to do so. These are \noptional populations and services, and Governor Bredesen was exercising \nhis option not to provide these services.\n  But hang on a minute. Maybe they are not as optional as we all \nthought. On January 29, 2005, Judge William J. Haynes, Jr., a U.S. \nDistrict Court Judge, declared that he must approve any changes to \nTennCare. So now, the Tennessee State Legislature is waiting for Judge \nHaynes to make a decision and give the State legislature permission to \nchange the State health insurance program and balance the budget.\n  In all of these cases, and in many more; we see courts and lawyers \nmaking decisions like this. Not just protecting rights, but running the \ngovernment. Courts are making policy choices that are supposed to be \nmade by elected Governors, mayors, legislators, city councilmen and \nwomen, school board members, and any number of other officials.\n  When courts run the government, that is no democracy. Federal courts \nare not accountable. They do not have to answer to an electorate for \nthe choices they make. This is not good government.\n  The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act contains three main \nprovisions that address many of these concerns.\n  First, this bill lays out a series of findings that will guide \nFederal courts in approving future consent decrees. The findings give \ncongressional endorsement to the Supreme Court's call\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nfor limiting decrees to make sure they are not unreasonably broad. The \nfindings also advocate the entry of consent decrees that take into \naccount the interests of State and local governments and give due \ndeference to their policy choices. Finally, the findings also make it \nclear that consent decrees should contain explicit and realistic \nstrategies for ending court supervision.\n  Second, the bill creates ``term limits'' for consent decrees. It \nprovides State and local governments with an opportunity to revisit the \nconsent decree after either 4 years or 6 months after the end of the \nterm of the State or local official who consents to the agreement. Four \nyears is a reasonable amount of time to evaluate the success of \njudicial management and to determine whether or not it is still \nwarranted. Alternatively, a provision allowing a decree to be revisited \nfollowing the election of new State and local officials will give these \nofficials the opportunity to bring fresh ideas to the table. I am sure \nthat many of my colleagues who served as State and local officials can \nattest to the frustration of coming into office and having your hands \ntied by an agreement that the last mayor, attorney general, or Governor \nmade.\n  Finally, this bill shifts the burden of proof from the State and \nlocal governments to the plaintiffs in the case. Under the current law, \nState and local governments must prove that a decree is no longer \nnecessary to protect plaintiffs' rights; that is, they must prove a \nnegative. They must also show that they have complied substantially \nwith all the terms of the existing decree. However, as I have already \nmentioned, the terms of these decrees often go far beyond simply \nupholding the plaintiffs' rights. By shifting the burden of proof, this \nbill requires the plaintiffs to show that judicial management is still \nnecessary. It allows parents like those concerned about the New York \nbilingual education programs to make the point that they do not think \nthey still need judicial management of this program.\n  Passage of my bill will not immediately end the consent decree \nproblem. We have separation of powers in our government, and there is \nonly so much Congress can do. However, what Congress can do, and what I \nhope to do with this legislation, is level the playing field so that \nState and local governments can have a fair shot at getting back the \nauthority that is rightfully theirs.\n  Judicial management has become a national concern. Federal courts are \nrunning police departments, school districts, foster care programs, \nState health insurance programs, and numerous other programs that are \nrightfully left to the responsibility of State and local elected \nofficials.\n  No less an authority than the Supreme Court has recognized the \noverreaching of the Federal courts. In 2004, the court handed down a \ndecision in the Frew v. Hawkins case. Although the court upheld the \nconsent decree in this case, its opinion recognized the dangers of \nconsent decrees and contained some guidance as to how to address these \nconcerns.\n  I think the Supreme Court's own words say it most effectively:\n\n       The state officials warn that enforcement of consent \n     decrees can undermine the sovereign interests and \n     accountability of state governments. . . . The concerns they \n     express are legitimate ones. If not limited to reasonable and \n     necessary implementations of federal law, remedies outlined \n     in consent decrees involving state officeholders may \n     improperly deprive future officials of their designated \n     legislative and executive powers. They may also lead to \n     federal court oversight of state programs for long periods of \n     time even absent an ongoing violation of federal law.\n\n  Referencing a previous Supreme Court decision involving consent \ndecrees, the Court went on to say:\n\n     `principles of federalism and simple common sense require the \n     [district] court to give significant weight' to the views of \n     government officials. . . . principles of federalism require \n     that state officials with front line responsibility for \n     administering the program be given latitude and substantial \n     discretion.\n       The federal court must exercise its equitable powers to \n     ensure that when the objects of the decree have been \n     attained, responsibility for discharging the State's \n     obligations is returned promptly to the State and its \n     officials. As public servants, the officials of the State \n     must be presumed to have a high degree of competence in \n     deciding how best to discharge their governmental \n     responsibilities. A State, in the ordinary course, depends \n     upon successor officials, both appointed and elected, to \n     bring new insights and solutions to problems of allocating \n     revenues and resources. The basic obligations of federal law \n     may remain the same, but the precise manner of their \n     discharge may not.\n\n  The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act comes at a time when \nPresident Bush has called on Congress to offer more flexibility to \nState governments to manage Medicaid. That flexibility has to in part \naddress the Federal courts' assumption of judicial control of these \nprograms. This bill is one way of doing that. In a broader sense too, \nthis bill is one small piece of the effort to promote federalism in the \nUnited States.\n  In recent years, it has become the trend to treat States as the \nwayward little brother of the Federal Government. That was never the \nintent of the Founding Fathers. State governments provide the basic \nnecessities of life that citizens demand. They are the laboratories \nthat can serve as models of good government that the rest of the \ncountry can follow. They are our partners, not our wards. It is time we \nbegin to treat them that way.\n  This bill is the first of what I hope will be many steps toward \nrestoring the relationship between the Federal Government and the State \nand local governments that do so much.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join Senators Alexander and Pryor in \nintroducing the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act. This important \nlegislation, by placing reasonable limits on the duration of judicial \nconsent decrees, will help restore democratic control over State and \nlocal institutions.\n  Lawsuits against public schools, welfare agencies, and other State \nand local government agencies and programs often end in judicial \nconsent decrees. Consent decrees are binding, legal agreements between \nplaintiffs and institutions specifying how a particular problem will be \nremedied.\n  Two years ago, two professors at the New York Law School, Ross \nSandler and David Schoenbrod, published an important book about the \neffect of consent decrees on our society: Democracy by Decree: What \nHappens When Courts Run Government.'' The professors' book describes \nhow unelected and unaccountable judges and attorneys control many State \nand local institutions by imposing rigid plans through consent decrees \nand how these decrees prevent newly elected officials from altering \npolicies in response to the changing wishes of voters. These decrees \nallow plaintiffs' lawyers and judges to assume the power to make policy \nand dictate in detail what shall constitute compliance with the decree. \nThey reflect a multitude of motives and often are based on \nconsiderations of the moment, yet they can bind public institutions for \ndecades.\n  While plaintiffs must allege violations of rights when filing their \ncases, the consent decrees that are produced by the litigation often \nhave little connection with the enforcement of those rights. Instead, \nthe decrees in some cases simply reflect the policy preferences of the \ncontrolling group behind the litigation, including the plaintiffs' \nattorneys and special interest groups.\n  One example from ``Democracy by Decree'' illustrates the nature of \nthis phenomenon. When Congress enacted the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, it created a Federal right to special \neducation. This new right required that all handicapped children \nreceive ``free appropriate public education.'' After the law's \nenactment, local school boards had difficulty complying with the new \nFederal standards. As a result, parents and children's advocates \nbrought many lawsuits in Federal courts, including a New York case that \nwas titled Jose P. v. Ambach.\n  The Jose P. case ended with a consent decree that dramatically \nshifted control over public education in New York. It transferred power \nover special education from the board of education and elected \nofficials to the Federal court. Judge Nickerson, the U.S. District \nCourt Judge assigned to Jose P., selected a ``special master'' and \nextended to him the enormous power to decide what was ``appropriate to \nprovide the requisite public education to handicapped children in New \nYork City.''\n  In an affidavit to Judge Nickerson, New York City School Chancellor\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nMacchiarola described how the litigation forced attention to a vast \nsuccession of special education and administrative issues, and diverted \nteachers' attention from the education of children. The special \nmaster's orders elevated speed of child placement above all other \neducational priorities. The mass processing of children with \ndisabilities forced by the order, in turn, directly conflicted with \nefforts to educate these children. Chancellor Macchiarola wrote:\n\n       I believe that however closely the judgment may have \n     approximated the best professional judgment at a particular \n     time, it is a mistake to elevate any set of practices and \n     procedures to the level of an inflexible mandate. Such an \n     approach robs the school system of the flexibility it needs \n     to adapt to changing circumstances, increasing practical \n     experience with alternative approaches to implementation, and \n     a constantly growing understanding of the nature and \n     dimensions of the educational issues we face.\n\n  In April 1984, New York City Mayor Ed Koch created the Beattie \nCommission to review the city's special education programs. Five years \nafter Judge Nickerson issued the Jose P. consent decree, the city's \nprograms had grown to serve 116,000 children at a cost of $850 million, \nyet it still did not meet the mandates of Jose P. The Beattie \nCommission found that special education had been transformed into a \nprogram for handling any child who for one reason or another performed \nat less than expected levels or who caused trouble in the classroom. \nEighty-nine percent of all referrals for evaluations were either for \npoor academic performance, bad behavior, or both. The program had begun \nto function as a quickly expanding and increasingly expensive general \neducation program.\n  The New York City Board of Education officials who worked under the \ndecree conceded that Jose P. caused a restructuring of special \neducation, but they emphasized that the scope of the judgment and the \ndetailed procedures that it required shifted attention from what was \ntruly best for the children to a focus on numerical compliance with \nrigid timelines.\n  In ``Democracy by Decree,'' Sandler and Schoenbrod explain:\n\n       The most notable fact after more than twenty years of court \n     supervision is the size of the special education program. For \n     the 1999-2000 school year, out of a school system of 1.1 \n     million children, 168,000 received special education--three \n     times the number when Jose P. was filed. Public school costs \n     for these services reached $2.7 billion, 25% of the entire \n     school budget. The board spends in excess of $26,000 per \n     student in special education, nearly three times more than \n     the resources devoted to students in regular education.\n       Jose P. failed to produce sound special education because \n     it was premised on a basic misunderstanding of institutional \n     change. The court set about to reform a single program in a \n     vast educational structure--a fool's errand because special \n     education could not be reformed without reforming the entire \n     system. What was needed was to overhaul the system, only part \n     of which was special education. The New York City board of \n     education could not stop the gaming of special education \n     unless it also stopped gaming in other areas such as \n     seniority, union perks, principal rights, custodial \n     authority, and inadequate programs of all kinds, from \n     athletics to grammar. What the court order did was cause the \n     board to focus effort on one area of institutional \n     performance without altering the culture of which it was a \n     part. That, and the very rigidity of the Jose P. decree and \n     the process it required, made it more difficult for new \n     mayors, new chancellors, or new boards of education to \n     improve the entire system.\n\n  In their handling of cases such as Jose P., the courts have moved \naway from enforcing rights and toward a managerial process of \noverseeing the pursuit of general goals.\n  The Jose P. order and its process could conceivably continue without \nend. The court never described what the board must do to terminate \nsupervision. Sandler and Schoenbrod plead that our conclusion\n\n     should not be to fix blame on the individuals in charge of \n     the case. They are superbly trained, well intentioned, and \n     widely recognized as outstandingly successful judges and \n     lawyers. Nor should that attention be fixed on questioning \n     the worthy objective of special education. Rather, the \n     failure of such competent people in pursuit of such a needed \n     objective should compel attention on whether we should \n     continue to rely so readily on courts to manage the complex \n     institutions of state and local governments.\n\n  Senator Alexander's bill is an important step in addressing the \nstructural failures behind cases like Jose P. I look forward to the \nbill's consideration in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the Senator departs the floor, I \ncommend my colleague from Tennessee for his comments. I will take a \nclose look at them myself.\n  As usual, the Senator from Tennessee makes an awful lot of sense. The \nquestion raised by our colleague from Alabama is an appropriate \nquestion. I underscore the last point he made, as well, this idea of \ndumping on the courts a lot of time to resolve matters which are thorny \nand difficult. It is a lot easier to do that.\n  We have learned painfully in the area of education, the area of \nequalization formulas, 47 States have enacted or required through the \ncourts to provide equalization of funding for elementary and secondary \neducation. I don't know of a single State that has done it yet because \nthe political community has passed the ball on, in a sense, to the \ncourts without addressing the issue in a fundamental way themselves. It \nis another example of Congress not coming to terms with some of the \ndifficult issues.\n  My colleague has pointed out the one dealing with Medicaid. I applaud \nhim for his comments. I intend to take a close look at his bill and may \njoin him. I thank him for his comments this morning.\n  Mr. President, I have been present for most of the votes the past 4 \nor 5 days but not engaged in the debate on the bankruptcy bill. The \nreason for my absence is because my wife and I were very blessed on \nTuesday morning, in the wee hours, to become parents again. So for the \npast 4 or 5 days if I looked a little sleepy to my colleagues it is \nbecause we have been up with a wonderful new infant. This child arrived \na little earlier than expected. I intended to be much more involved in \nthis debate than I have had the ability to. I apologize to my \ncolleagues and to others who have had a strong interest in this \nlegislation.\n  This morning I would like to take a few minutes and talk generally \nabout the bankruptcy bill, and also to propose a couple of amendments \nwhich I will describe briefly. I realize any votes on these amendments \nmay occur on Monday or Tuesday, depending on conversation with the \nmajority in terms of how they will handle these matters.\n  The fundamental premise behind the bankruptcy bill, as I understand \nit and in listening to my colleagues over the last 7 or 8 years who \nhave talked about this legislation, is that more and more consumers \nacross this great country of ours are living rather lavish lifestyles \nand then filing for bankruptcy to avoid paying the debts which they \nhave incurred as a result of their irresponsibility. This is one of the \nmajor arguments for this legislation--that bad actors are depriving \ncredit card issuers of money owed to them as a result of people \nlavishly using these credit cards to acquire whatever products or \nservices they want. This premise, I argue, is categorically and \ndemonstrably false.\n  Let me, first, begin with the first chart, if I may, which lays out \nthe statistics of what happens to an individual in America in the two \nyears before they file for bankruptcy. I hope it will give my \ncolleagues some sense of what actually is going on with these families. \nWho are these families? Are these people living lavish lifestyles, \naccumulating debts that they should have been more responsible about, \nand then trying to avoid their obligations by declaring bankruptcy?\n  Health Affairs, a respected organization in this field, did an \nanalysis of what happened in the 2 years prior for people who file for \nbankruptcy. The study revealed that sixty-one percent of those who \nfiled for bankruptcy during the previous 2 years had gone without \nneeded medical care, 50 percent did not fill doctors' prescriptions \nthey had been given, 30 percent had their utilities shut off, 22 \npercent went without adequate nutrition and food, and 7 percent moved \nelderly parents to cheaper care facilities across the country. These \nare hardly people who are leading what you would call a lavish \nlifestyle.\n  In fact, these are people who are desperately trying to hold their \nfamilies together, who cannot meet the kind of responsibilities despite \ntheir best efforts.\n  Credit card issuers, I point out, are earning enormous amounts of \nmoney in\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nincome from fees, penalties, and interest charges. As one expert said:\n\n       The idea that companies are losing their shirts on \n     bankruptcies is [just not true at all].\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared \nthis morning in the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 4, 2005]\n\n                  Credit Card Firms Won as Users Lost\n\n                         (By Peter G. Gosselin)\n\n       Washington.--In the eight years since they began pressing \n     for the tough bankruptcy bill being debated in the Senate, \n     America's big credit card companies have effectively \n     inoculated themselves from many of the problems that sparked \n     their call for the measure.\n       By charging customers different interest rates depending on \n     how likely they are to repay their debts and by adding \n     substantial fees for an array of items such as late payments \n     and foreign currency transactions, the major card companies \n     have managed to keep their profits rising steadily even as \n     personal bankruptcies have soared, industry figures show.\n       As a result, while they continue to press for legislation \n     that would make it harder for individuals to declare \n     bankruptcy, the companies have found ways to make money even \n     on cardholders who eventually go broke.\n       At the same time, under the companies' new systems, many \n     cardholders--especially low-income users--have ended up on a \n     financial treadmill, required to make ever-larger monthly \n     payments to keep their credit card balances from rising and \n     to avoid insolvency.\n       ``Most of the credit cards that end up in bankruptcy \n     proceedings have already made a profit for the companies that \n     issued them,'' said Robert R. Weed, a Virginia bankruptcy \n     lawyer and onetime aide to former Republican House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich.\n       ``That's because people are paying so many fees that \n     they've already paid more than was originally borrowed,'' he \n     said.\n       In addition, some experts say, the changes proposed in the \n     Senate bill would fundamentally alter long-standing American \n     legal policy on debt. Under bankruptcy laws as they have \n     existed for more than a century, creditors can seize almost \n     all of a bankrupt debtor's assets, but they cannot lay claim \n     to future earnings.\n       The proposed law, by preventing many debtors from seeking \n     bankruptcy protection, would compel financially insolvent \n     borrowers to continue trying to pay off the old debts almost \n     indefinitely.\n       ``Until now, the principle in this country has been that \n     people's future human capital is their own,'' said David A. \n     Moss, an economic historian at Harvard University. ``If a \n     person gets on a financial treadmill, they can declare \n     bankruptcy and have what can't be paid discharged. But that \n     would change with this bill.''\n       Debate about the bill continued Thursday, with the \n     Republican-controlled Senate refusing to limit consumer \n     interest rates to 30%. The vote was a bipartisan 74 to 24 to \n     kill a proposed amendment by Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.). \n     Senate passage of the bill is expected next week.\n       The House has not taken up the issue this year, although it \n     passed a version of the bill last year, as did the Senate. \n     Attempts to reconcile the two bills failed.\n       Industry officials have sought to minimize the role of \n     credit card companies in pushing for bankruptcy legislation \n     since 1998. They have argued that the bill introduced last \n     month by Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles \n     E. Grassley of Iowa and supported by President Bush would \n     affect about 5% of the roughly 1.6 million Americans who file \n     for bankruptcy each year.\n       They have portrayed the measure's principal target as high-\n     income individuals who are abusing the law to escape their \n     debts.\n       ``The bottom line is that there are people out there who \n     are able to pay their bills who are not paying,'' said Tracey \n     Mills, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Assn., which \n     represents most of the major credit card companies.\n       But consumer advocates, many academics and some judges and \n     court officials argue that the bill would sharply reduce the \n     number of Americans able to file for bankruptcy, even in \n     instances where doing so would buy them time to repay their \n     debts.\n       The critics argue that people unable to file would be at \n     the mercy of increasingly aggressive efforts by lenders--\n     especially credit card companies--to raise fees and boost \n     collections.\n       People like Josephine McCarthy, for instance, a 71-year-old \n     secretary at the Salem Baptist Church, less than a mile from \n     where the Senate bill is being debating.\n       According to papers in her recent bankruptcy, McCarthy \n     discovered at about the time of her husband's death in 2003 \n     that the couple had a $4,888 balance on a Providian Financial \n     Corp. Visa card and another $2,020 balance on a Providian \n     Mastercard.\n       Over the two years from 2002 until early 2004, when she \n     filed for bankruptcy, McCarthy charged an additional $218 on \n     the first card and made more than $3,000 in payments, the \n     court papers show. But instead of her balance going down, \n     finance charges--at what the bankruptcy judge termed a \n     ``whopping'' 29.99% rate, together with late fees, over-limit \n     fees and phone payments fees--pushed what she owed up to more \n     than $5,350.\n       In the case of the second card, the papers show that \n     McCarthy charged an extra $203 and made more than $2,000 in \n     payments, but again fees and finance charges pushed the \n     balance up.\n       McCarthy refused to comment on the case. A spokesman for \n     Providian could not be reached last night.\n       But court papers show that McCarthy eventually paid all the \n     bills in the case, including back taxes. The way she did it, \n     using provisions of bankruptcy law, illustrates one of the \n     problems with the proposed new law, critics say.\n       McCarthy had been making mortgage payments on two houses. \n     She wanted to sell one of the houses to pay off her debts, \n     but the house was entangled in legal difficulties. By \n     declaring bankruptcy, she was able to stop the clock on her \n     escalating credit card debts and give her lawyer time to \n     clear up the legal problem, enabling her to sell the house \n     and pay off the bills.\n       Under the proposed new law, McCarthy, who makes about \n     $55,000 a year, would have had a much harder time qualifying \n     for the bankruptcy protection that allowed her to pay \n     creditors.\n       ``The McCarthy case shows how hard-working people making \n     good incomes can end up in situations that they can't dig \n     themselves out of unless they file for bankruptcy,'' said \n     Weed, her lawyer.\n       Credit card companies have come in for harsh criticism in \n     recent years for their penalty fees and the ``risk-based \n     pricing'' under which they charge customers different \n     interest rates depending on their credit histories and their \n     likelihood of paying.\n       Consumer advocates have accused firms of not adequately \n     disclosing such controversial practices as universal default, \n     when a company can jack up a cardholder's annual percentage \n     rate, often to ``more than 30%, based on the cardholder's \n     performance with another creditor, not the card company.\n       Regulators and law enforcement officials have accused \n     companies of deceptive practices. In 2000, the U.S. Office of \n     the Comptroller of the Currency and the San Francisco \n     district attorney's office ordered Providian to pay $300 \n     million in restitution after customers complained that the \n     company didn't credit their payments on time and then imposed \n     late fees.\n       A stream of court cases involving credit card companies has \n     produced public outrage in various parts of the country.\n       In Cleveland, a municipal court judge tossed out a case \n     that Discover Bank brought against one of its cardholders \n     after examining the woman's credit card bill.\n       According to court papers, Ruth M. Owens, a 53-year-old \n     disabled woman, paid the company $3,492 over six years on a \n     $1,963 debt only to find that late fees and finance charges \n     had more than doubled the size of her remaining balance to \n     $5,564.\n       When the firm took her to court to collect, she wrote the \n     judge a note saying, ``I would like to inform you that I have \n     no money to make payments. I am on Social Security \n     Disability. . . . If my situation was different I would pay. \n     I just don't have it. I'm sorry.''\n       Judge Robert Triozzi ruled that Owens didn't have to pay, \n     saying she had ``clearly been the victim of [Discover's] \n     unreasonable, unconscionable and unjust business practices.''\n       Efforts to reach Owens were unsuccessful A spokeswoman for \n     Discover said she could not comment on the case.\n       Analysts said that lost in the uproar over particular \n     practices and cases is the fact that the credit card industry \n     has almost completely remade itself in the years since it \n     began pushing for passage of the bankruptcy bill--a makeover \n     that has left some analysts wondering why the industry needs \n     the changes in bankruptcy law.\n       ``The idea that companies are losing their shirts on \n     bankruptcies is a lot of bull,'' said Robert B. McKinley, \n     chief executive of CardWeb.com, a Frederick, Md., consulting \n     group that tracks the credit card industry. ``With these \n     rates and fees, the card industry is a gravy train right \n     now.''\n       Mills, the bankers association spokeswoman, said \n     bankruptcies affected all American households in the form of \n     higher costs and lower returns on investments.\n       As recently as the late 1980s, credit card companies \n     offered a one-size-fits-all card with a fixed interest rate \n     and an annual fee. Virtually all cards went to middle-class \n     borrowers with good credit histories; issuing cards to poor \n     or high-risk borrowers was almost unheard of.\n       But in the early 1990s, companies such as AT and General \n     Motors began issuing cards with variable rates and no fees, \n     increasing competition. And by the middle of the decade, card \n     companies were finding their traditional middle-class markets \n     saturated.\n       Their response: lend to riskier customers and make up for \n     the danger of more defaults by charging higher rates and then \n     new fees.\n       McKinley, the industry analyst, said the firms were helped \n     by a 1996 Supreme Court case that gave card companies new \n     protections against state regulation of fees.\n       ``That really opened the flood gates. It set off a fee \n     frenzy,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Taking the Bankruptcy Act goes back to the earliest days of \nour Republic. Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution mandates \nthat Congress pass laws dealing with bankruptcy. I believe our Founders \ndid so\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\nbecause they realized there was inherent, fundamental value to allowing \npeople who find themselves under difficult circumstances to be able to \nget out from underneath those circumstances, to discharge their \nresponsibilities to the best extent possible, and then to get back on \ntheir feet again. That is a social value from which all Americans \nbenefit.\n  Now, will there be people who should have been far more responsible? \nAbsolutely. But I happen to believe that the overwhelming majority of \npeople who are forced to file for bankruptcy do so most reluctantly, \nonly because there are no other avenues available to them which they \ncan deal with their problems. We have with a responsibility, to \nremember what our Founders envisioned in article I, section 8, which \ncalls upon Congress to pass bankruptcy legislation.\n  I would like to add at the outset of these remarks, if I can, some \ngeneral understanding of what is happening to American consumers and \ntheir indebtedness.\n  First of all, in terms of household savings, in 1993, the savings \nrate was 4.3 percent of the gross domestic product nationally. In 2003, \nit was at 1 percent of gross domestic product. In the third quarter of \n2004, savings rates were less than one-half of 1 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. The national savings rate is declining rapidly in \nthis country. At a time when we ought to be doing everything we can to \nencourage consumers to begin to save more, to participate in their own \nlong-term financial needs, we are going in the exact opposite direction \nof where we ought to be heading in this country.\n  Let me add, simultaneously, that according to the Federal Reserve \nBoard, the United States has over $2.1 trillion in consumer debt. \nConsumer debt is truly skyrocketing. Almost one-half of that $2.1 \ntrillion in consumer debt is revolving credit--to credit cards and home \nequity loans--nearly $800 billion of the $2.1 trillion.\n  Our nation's savings rates are less than one-half of 1 percent of our \ngross domestic product--down from over 4 percent just a few years ago. \nOur nation's consumer debt has skyrocketed to $2.1 trillion, $800 \nbillion of which is due to credit cards and home equity loans.\n  We are going in the absolute wrong direction. The questions we ought \nto be asking as we debate and discuss this bankruptcy bill is: Does \nthis legislation contribute in the 21st century to encouraging more \nsavings? Does it do anything at all to try to reduce consumer debt? \nDoes this bankruptcy bill do anything to reduce the number of \nbankruptcies and effect the underlying causes of bankruptcy.\n  Certainly, consumers bear responsibility in terms of how they handle \ntheir money and the obligations they incur to those who extend them \ncredit. However, there is a commensurate responsibility, I believe, on \nthe part of those who extend credit. Creditors must make sure they are \nextending credit in a responsible way, with prudent underwriting \nstandards. If they extend credit to those who can least afford it, \ncharging them incredibly high rates and packed with hidden fees and \ncosts, and with little or no expectation that they will have the \nability to repay the debts incurred, then it seems to me that their \ncharges of personal responsibility is wholly inappropriate.\n  If we are going to try to increase savings rates and reduce consumer \ndebt in this country, then we ought to ask ourselves whether or not \nthis bill before us contributes to those important goals.\n  Now, again, proponents of this legislation have wrapped themselves, \nif you will, in the flag of personal responsibility. The real purpose \nof the legislation, they argue, is to punish those who abuse our \nbankruptcy system, who raise costs to all consumers. The creditors are \nbeing forced, they argue, to raise prices on a variety of goods and \nservices because of so-called bad actors who abuse the Bankruptcy Code. \nThey would like us to believe that those bad actors are the real \nculprits behind why creditors, such as credit card issuers, are \ncharging these incredibly high rates, using hidden, undisclosed fees \nand engaging in deceptive predatory practices.\n  I would like to dispel, if I can, these myths. Nothing in this bill, \nin my view, is going to help consumers. Let me repeat that. Nothing in \nthis legislation will help consumers. The legislation, I would argue, \nwill only help creditors recover more money from debtors, most of whom \nhave been forced to declare bankruptcy because of emergency medical \nexpenses or due to the loss of a job or as a result of a divorce.\n  Let me put up the second chart, if I can, to make that point for my \ncolleagues and others who may be interested in this debate. We are \ntold, again, that 46 percent--almost half--of the 1.5 million \nbankruptcies taken annually are as a result of illness. Mr. President, \n46 percent as a result of illness, alone.\n  I mentioned briefly at the outset the reason I have not been as \nengaged in this debate over the last 4 days is because of the arrival \nof my new daughter in the wee hours of Tuesday morning. As I went to \nthe nursery to see my new daughter I looked across the hall of the \nhospital, located in Northern Virginia. I saw where the premature \ninfants were being cared for in incubators, and I saw the families with \ntheir premature infants. Many of the families did not strike me as \npeople living lavish lifestyles at all, struggling with a new infant \nwho is in a very fragile condition inside an incubator.\n  I do not need to tell anyone the costs associated with those type of \nmedical challenges. I suspect, unfortunately, that a lot of these \npeople do not have health insurance. As I watched them come in and out \nof that nursery to be with their newborn child in an incubator, I \nsuspected that many of them are going to have costs far beyond anything \nthey ever imagined. The idea, that somehow, we ought to penalize people \nbecause of a newborn in their life, who are going to have incredible \nincreased costs, seems to me to be terribly wrongheaded.\n  As I stated earlier, 46 percent, of the 1.5 million bankruptcies \nannually occur because of medical causes. Of the remaining 54 percent, \nwe know the majority of that 54 percent is due to job loss and divorce \nin the country--not the lavish lifestyles of bad actors that the credit \ncard companies would suggest.\n  This legislation will injure honest, hard-working Americans, in my \nview, who fall on hard times through no fault of their own.\n  Let's just take a few steps back, if we can. What is the reason we \nhave bankruptcy laws? The reason we have a Bankruptcy Code is because \nlife, sometimes, just deals people all across our country, regardless \nof who they are or where they come from, a bad hand. People get dealt a \nbad hand every now and then. And we happen to believe, as a society, it \nis important to give people a fresh start in our Nation, an opportunity \nto overcome the financial misfortunes that have struck them, such as \nthose families I have just described that I watched with premature \ninfants.\n  This principle is so fundamental to our Nation that our Constitution \nexpressly lists the establishment of uniform bankruptcy laws as a \ncongressional responsibility. It seems that the Framers understood that \nsociety is better off if we can find an orderly way to allow people to \npay off their debts to the best degree possible. It is critical to \nhelping people to get back on their feet as productive citizens. \nRegrettably, that principle seems to suffer, in my view, at the hands \nof this legislation.\n  Recent evidence supports the idea the vast majority of people who \nfile for bankruptcy do so because of some financial crisis beyond their \ncontrol that has plunged them into debt they cannot avoid.\n  A recent study, conducted in early 2005 by a team of researchers at \nHarvard University, confirmed that nearly half of all people who file \nfor bankruptcy protection do so because of medical or health reasons.\n  The evidence shows that abusive filings are the exception, not the \nrule. The median income of the average American family filing for \nchapter 7 bankruptcy--what do my colleagues think it might be? What is \nthe median income of the average family filing for bankruptcy, these \nlavish-lifestyle people out there? It is $20,000 a year. That is the \naverage annual income of a person filing for bankruptcy--hardly people \nliving lavish lifestyles. That is according to the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  The majority of the people who file for bankruptcy are single women \nwho\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nare heads of households, elderly people trying to cope with medical \ncosts, and people who have lost their jobs or families whose finances \nhave been complicated by divorce. For the most part we are talking \nabout working people or elderly Americans on fixed incomes who have \nfallen on hard times and who need the protection of the Bankruptcy Act \nto help put them and their lives back together.\n  It is also worth noting that based on the first three quarters of \n2004, the personal bankruptcy rate actually decreased by 2.6 percent. \nAccording to the American Bankruptcy Institute, there were actually \n50,000 fewer cases from September 2003 to September 2004 than there \nwere in the previous 12-month period, which, of course, begs the \nquestion: If bankruptcy rates are falling, why is this legislation \nnecessary?\n  There is no smoke and there is certainly no fire except for maybe the \nmillions of consumers who are being burned by abusive creditor \npractices.\n  The impact this legislation would have on single-parent households is \nof particular concern to me. Single parents have one of the hardest \njobs in America. Most work all day, prepare meals, keep house, help \nchildren with their homework, schedule doctor appointments, parent-\nteacher meetings, and extracurricular activities. Life is very hard for \nworking single parents, and often financial assistance they receive in \nthe form of alimony or child support is critical to keeping their \nfamilies from falling into poverty. I believe sincerely that this \nlegislation, if enacted, is going to frustrate the efforts of single-\nparent families to collect child support payments.\n  I understand that the proponents of this bill believe they have \ntreated single-parent families fairly. But what I worry about is the \nunintended but perfectly foreseeable consequence of allowing more debts \nto survive bankruptcy. Let me explain why and what is in this bill \ntoday.\n  For more than 100 years, the Bankruptcy Code has given women and \nchildren an absolute preference over all others who have claims on a \ndebtor's estate. Under the well-established rule, if a divorced person \nfiles for bankruptcy, the court doesn't require the person's ex-spouse \nor children to compete with creditors for the funds needed to pay child \nsupport and alimony. Instead, for 100 years, alimony and child support \nhave been taken out of the debtor's monthly income first, and if there \nis anything left over, it is made available to commercial creditors. If \nthere is nothing left over, the commercial or consumer debts are \ndischarged, and the debtor's only remaining obligation is to the ex-\nspouse and his or her children.\n  This legislation changes those rules for the first time in 100 years. \nFor the first time we are going to make credit card and other consumer \ndebts essentially nondischargeable so that while a divorced spouse \nwould still be obligated to pay alimony and child support, his or her \nother unsecured debts remain intact. The proponents of the bill will \nsay this does no harm to the divorced spouses or children because the \nex-spouses are still at the front of the collection process. But there \nis, in my view, a huge practical difference between being first in line \nand being the only one in line.\n  Under current law, nonsupport debts are often discharged and debtors \ncan focus entirely on meeting their obligations to their children and \ncurrent spouses. If this legislation becomes law, that will change for \nthe first time in 100 years. Debtors will not be able to focus on their \nchildren; they will, as a matter of law, have to divert limited \nfinancial resources to pay back consumer creditors. I believe this \nchange will inevitably lead to conflicts between commercial creditors \nand single parents who are owed support and alimony payments. Sure, \nthey are going to be first in line, but single parents will be \ncompeting with large creditors, creditors who have teams of lawyers who \nare hired to use every imaginable tactic to see to it that they get \ntheir money first. That is what they are going to do. I promise, it is \ngoing to happen.\n  I believe it is a mistake to make single parents compete with teams \nof lawyers from very well-heeled creditors for the money they need to \nclothe and feed and educate their children. That is a mistake, and we \nwill regret it.\n  I understand the perspective that says that all debts incurred should \nbe paid. I don't fundamentally disagree with that. But when debtors \nsimply cannot pay all of their debts, I believe that our laws should \nprotect the interests of children and families first. Under this \nlegislation, child support payments could very well be reduced in order \nto satisfy an unsecured commercial creditor. In my view, that change \nwill place the well-being of children at a disadvantage and elevate the \nstatus of the unsecured creditor. Low-income children and families will \nbe put at a practical disadvantage by this bill and will ultimately \nsuffer greater economic deprivation because they cannot afford to \ncompete with sophisticated creditors.\n  I have talked a bit about who will be hurt by this legislation. Let \nme take a few minutes to focus on the big winners, if the legislation \npasses. The big winner, of course, is the credit card industry. Let me \ndescribe the current state of the credit card industry. In a time when \naccess to credit is the easiest and cheapest, credit card companies are \nmaking more money than ever, bilking millions of American families \nby charging what would have been only a few years ago usurious rates \nand fees, engaging in a series of abusive and deceptive practices which \nwill have drastic long-term consequences. At the same time they are \ngetting more and more Americans deeper and deeper into debt.\n\n  I have cited these statistics previously: $2.1 trillion, almost half \nof that coming from credit cards and home equity loans--the same \ncreditors pushing bankruptcy legislation in Congress to make their \ndebts nondischargeable in the event of a bankruptcy. In effect, we are \nbecoming the collection agency for these companies. The old expression \nnever had a more apt example: the credit card industry wants to have \nits cake and eat it, too.\n  Credit card companies are charging consumers higher fees than ever \nbefore.\n  In 1980, credit card fees alone raised $2.6 billion. In the year \n2004, credit card fees alone raised over $24.4 billion--$2.6 billion 24 \nyears ago to $24.4 billion. Fees alone. Proponents of this legislation \nargue that because of increasing default rates, the supposed work of \nthose bad actors, the ones making $20,000 a year on average, credit \ncard companies are being forced to charge more fees.\n  In fact, the exact opposite is the truth. Consumer bankruptcies \nactually went down last year by nearly 3 percent, and default rates \nactually decreased.\n  A recent American Banker article cites industry expert Robert Hammer, \nchairman of R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers, who said that the biggest \nfactor in industrywide credit card industry improvement was the 20-\nbasis-point drop in chargeoffs from the year 2003. So I ask again: If \ndefault rates are decreasing, why is this legislation necessary?\n  The truth is, this is the best time in history to be in the credit \ncard business. Last year over 5 billion solicitations were offered to \nconsumers, which is nearly twice as many as only 8 years ago. Despite \nthe assertions that the credit card industry is struggling because of \nbad consumer behavior, credit card companies have more money than they \nknow what to do with. They are pumping out solicitations in search of \nnew people who will only acquire more and more debt.\n  Credit card companies are making record profits. Credit Card \nManagement reported in May 2003 that it was the most profitable year \never for credit cards. At a time when interests rates are at historic \nlows, credit card rates have not followed suit. The industry is engaged \nin a series of deceptive and abusive practices to take advantage of \nconsumers.\n  Let me take a few moment to describe a few of these practices. I am \nnot making this up. Credit card companies are finding more ways to \neffectively increase their income from rates and fees. Abusive \npractices such as misleading teaser rates which employ bait-and-switch \ntactics, hidden fees and penalties, and the universal default \nprovisions buried in the fine print are standard operating procedures \nin the credit card industry today.\n  One of these abuses, the so-called ``universal default'', which could \nmore accurately be described as a predatory\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nretroactive interest rate hike. This practice forces a credit card \nconsumer in good standing--one who is paying his or her credit card \nbills on time--to have his interest rates retroactively jacked up 25 to \n30 percent because of an unknown, irrelevant change in his or her \nspending patterns.\n  The idea that credit card companies can charge an initial interest \nrate that would have in the past been outlawed as usurious, and then \ndouble or triple that rate for any reason it so chooses is plain wrong, \nin my view. If a phone bill is inadvertently mailed to the wrong \naddress or you are disputing an amount of a bill and it is not paid on \ntime, does the mortgage rate on your house go up? Of course not. But it \ndoes with the credit card industry.\n  We should stop this practice. At a minimum--and I will offer an \namendment shortly--we should make any increase in the rates \nprospective, not retroactive.\n  Let me explain why. If you enter into a agreement with a credit card \ncompany, and the established rate is set at 15 percent. Despite the \nfact that you continue to make your monthly payments on time, without \nexception, you can have your interest rate unexplainably raised. This \ninexplicable rate hike can occur for whatever reason the creditor sees \nfit. You have an argument with your automobile company and you decide \nto withhold a car payment, or you are having a debate with the utility \ncompany, so you hold back on your utility bill--under the law today, \nthe credit card company can automatically increase your rates. And to \nadd insult to injury, this new rate retroactively applies for the goods \nyou have already purchased.\n  I think this practice is completely uncalled for. But if you are \ngoing to allow for rates to go up, at a minimum they ought to be \nprospective, on future purchases,\n  I would, frankly, like to eliminate it altogether, but I don't think \nenough people here would support that. At the very least, if you \nentered into a contract at 15 percent and if you are suddenly forced to \npay a higher interest rate, it ought to be on prospective purchases, \nnot to things that you may have bought 1 or 2 years ago. That is \npatently wrong, and I will offer an amendment to implement this policy.\n  There is a second practice: credit card companies are focusing on \ncustomers who pay their bills on time. Credit card issuers are now \nproviding incentives or rewards to customers for not paying their \nbills. They get a reward for not paying their bills. They offer up to 3 \npercent cash back on all credit card purchases, but only during the \nmonth when the credit card holder doesn't pay off his or her monthly \nbalance. We have this consumer debt mounting by the hour, and we have \ncredit card companies offering rewards to those who don't pay on time \nand they are cutting off the card for those who do. It is absolutely \nincredible.\n  That underscores how important it is to the credit card industry that \nconsumers get in debt and stay in debt. There are 51 million households \nthat carry balances on the credit cards at an average balance of \n$11,944. That is the average amount of debt families carry on their \ncredit cards. The current average interest rate is running at about 13 \npercent. This is at a time when we have the lowest interest rates at 3, \n4 percent and we have 13 percent credit card charges. Each of those \nfamilies is paying credit card interest, on average, of 15 percent a \nyear. Some are having their credit cards cancelled because they simply \npay all of their outstanding debt every month. Imagine that. You are \npaying your bills on time and the credit card company triples your \ninterest rate or cancels your card.\n  In fact, the credit card industry calls you a ``deadbeat'' if you pay \noff your entire balance every month. Why do they call you a deadbeat? \nThe credit card industry has a vested interest to keep you in debt. \nFailure to do so affects their bottom line. They don't like people to \npay off their monthly balances. You could lose your credit card for \ndoing that.\n  As I have said earlier, the real purpose of this legislation is to \nhelp credit card companies make more money. I am not opposed to them \nmaking their money, but I think we have a higher obligation here to see \nthat these companies are prevented from engaging in abusive and \npredatory practices that run contrary directly to stated national goals \nof increasing savings rates and reducing consumer debt.\n  I have given you some brief insight into some of the abusive \npractices of the credit card industry. I would now like to focus on \nwhat I believe to be the most egregious trend in the industry, which is \ntargeting our Nation's most vulnerable customers. One of the most \ntroubling developments is the hotly contested battle between credit \ncard issuers to sign up new customers, and the aggressive way they have \ntargeted people under the age of 21, particularly college students. \nSolicitations going to this age group have become incredibly intense. \nFirst, it is one of the few market segments in which every year 25 to \n30 percent of the undergraduates are fresh faces entering their first \nyear of college. Second, it is an age group in which brand loyalty can \nbe readily established. Most people hold on to their first credit card \nfor up to 15 years, which, by the way, is probably the amount of time \nit takes to dig out of the amount of debt they have incurred while in \ntheir teens.\n  Let me share this with my colleagues. It is somewhat amusing, but it \nis also rather sad. This is a letter that was sent to a 7-year-old \nchild of one of the people in my office. I have crossed out the family \nname. He has a 7-year-old son. He was amazed to find a brand new \nAmerican Express card being issued to his son. The card came as a \nresult--according to the offer--of this young elementary schooler's \n``excellent credit history.'' It says: You should know about this \nmilestone that you have achieved. With your excellent financial record, \nour decision was very simple. We want you as a card member. Imagine, a \n7-year-old. It reads: ``You have the flexibility of a no preset \nspending limit''--a 7-year-old. There are no limits on how much you can \nspend on this credit card. He has amply demonstrated his financial \nresponsibility, according to this letter. He has earned this \nrecognition to receive an American Express card at age 7. This type of \nsolicitation happens more and more every single day and yet we need to \nfocus on personal responsibility and not corporate responsibility.\n\n  There are 5 million solicitations that go out every year, many going \nto young children in our society. Obviously, we are talking not just \nabout 7-year-olds here but also to college-age persons. They are \nvulnerable, these younger people in our society. To extend them large \namounts of credit, with no limits, is an act of incredible \nirresponsibility. Again, I agree that consumers have a duty to be \nresponsible. I will take a back seat to no one in arguing that ought to \nbe the case. However, there needs to be a sense of balance about this. \nIf you are expecting the consumer to be responsible, the issuer of the \ncredit card also has to be responsible. They lack total responsibility \nwhen it comes to these solicitations.\n  I have an amendment that I will offer shortly that places new \nrequirements on credit card companies who solicit to persons under the \nage of 21. It requires if you are under the age of 21, either \ndemonstrate that you can pay--a lot of people under 21 can pay because \nthey hold jobs, they have made money, and they have saved. Or have \nsomebody cosign--a parent, guardian or other responsible party--the \napplication to get the credit card, Or lastly, the completion of \ncertified credit counseling course. Any one of those three, not all \nthree. It is a very simple and prudent requirement to ask for before \nissuing credit cards. This ought to be plain common sense, in my view.\n  We have an obligation to protect and educate our young people. The \nnext generation of American leaders deserves no less than reining in \nthe irresponsible practices of the credit card industry that just \npushes these cards out. In fact--and I will touch on this later--\nuniversities actually get money into their coffers if they will promote \nstudents signing up for credit cards. There are actually fees that come \nto the universities as a result of the indebtedness of their students. \nIt seems to me we ought to be thinking twice and thinking hard about \nthose practices. Credit card companies are running roughshod over \nmillions of Americans and their families. We should be passing \nlegislation that prevents these types of practices, not padding the \ncredit card industry's pockets, in my view.\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\n  The credit card issuers seem to have forgotten the correlation \nbetween high interest rates and unsecured debt. Traditionally, \nunsecured credit issued without collateral and relying only on the \nintegrity of the borrower has a higher default rate. As a result, \ncredit issuers are allowed to charge a higher interest rate in order to \nmake up for expected losses from those higher default rates.\n  However, this legislation begins to change this deal, changing the \nBankruptcy Code to make unsecured debt nondischargeable in the event of \na bankruptcy. Record fees, record abuses, record profits, and a record \nnumber of Americans are being taken advantage of. I urge my colleagues \nto reject this legislation.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 52\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to call up two amendments. I believe \nthe first, amendment No. 52, is at the desk. I ask that it be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.

Mr. President, I briefly mentioned this amendment before. \nThis amendment focuses on a abusive practice that I have to believe all \nof my colleagues would want to see done away with, this universal \ndefault practice. Let me explain what this means.\n  Under a universal default, which almost all these companies now \nengage in, it says that credit card companies have the right to raise \nfees and rates, whenever they want, for any reason I choose. That \nlanguage actually is included in some of the small print. Again, I \nbelieve that consumers have an important responsibility for the debts \nthey incur. However, I think it is patently unfair, that if you are \npaying your minimum monthly balance to the credit card company, and for \nwhatever reason you are not meeting your obligation to the car payment, \nthe house payment, or the utility bill that you be subject to a \nuniversal default clause. And while I think the practice should be \nbanned, if it is part of the credit card agreement, credit card \ncompanies are allowed to raise your rates even though you are meeting \nyour obligation to them.\n  This amendment simply restores some basic fairness in this \narrangement. You can raise interest rates--but only prospectively on \nnew purchases. However, it prohibits retroactively rate hikes, that is, \nraising the interest rate on purchases you may have made a week, a \nmonth, a year, or 2 years earlier.\n  Let me make the point again. I understand why the credit card \ncompanies would like to do this. Obviously, they make more money doing \nit. But I think we have an obligation to see to it that there is a \nsense of fairness about all of this.\n  That is what I am trying to do with this amendment. That is all this \namendment does. It just says here you cannot apply these rates \nretroactively. On future purchases, fine. Again, I think the practice \nof universal default is unfair. If I have a contract with my friend \nfrom Alabama at a certain rate and I am meeting my responsibilities to \nhim, he is lending money at 15 percent, and for whatever reason I have \na contract with my friend from Georgia, and we have a dispute about my \npayment obligations to you, my friend from Alabama then can \nautomatically raise my rate to 20 percent, 25 percent, or 30 percent \nbecause of my dispute with the Senator from Georgia.\n  The idea that a credit card company can charge an initial interest \nrate that would have in the past been outlawed as usurious and then \ndouble or triple that rate for any reason it chooses is just plain \nwrong, in my view.\n  If a phone bill is inadvertently mailed to the wrong address, you are \ndisputing the bill that is not paid on time, does the mortgage rate on \nyour\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\nhome go up? No, but apparently your credit card interest rate can.\n  Record number credit card companies have built-in universal default \nclauses in their agreements. ``Universal default complaints are \ndefinitely on the increase at a disturbing rate,'' says Paul Richard, \ndirector of the nonprofit Institute of Consumer Financial Education. \nMore than one-third of all major credit card issuers now say they act \non these clauses regularly. A recent survey found that a staggering 39 \npercent of credit card issuers apply this universal default rate to \nconsumers even if they have no late payment on their credit cards.\n  A recent New York Times article entitled ``Plastic Trap, Soaring \nInterest Rate Compounds Credit Card Payments for Millions'' illustrates \nthe point.\n\n       Ed Sweibel was whittling down his mound of credit card debt \n     at an interest rate of 9.2 percent. The MBNA company had a \n     happy and profitable customer. But this past summer when MBNA \n     suddenly doubled the rate on his account, Mr. Sweibel joined \n     the growing number of irate card holders stunned by lenders' \n     harsh tactics. Mr. Sweibel, 58 years old, a semiretired \n     software engineer in Gilbert, AZ, was not pleased his minimum \n     monthly payment jumped from $502 in June to $895 in July. But \n     what really made him angry, he said, was the sense he was \n     being punished despite having held up his end of the bargain \n     with MBNA. ``I paid the bills the minute the envelope hit the \n     desk. All of a sudden in July they swapped it to 18 percent, \n     no warning, no reason. It was like I was blindsided.''\n       Mr. Sweibel had stumbled into the new era of consumer \n     credit in which thousands of Americans are paying millions of \n     dollars each month in fees that they did not expect and that \n     strike them as unreasonable. Invoking clauses tucked into the \n     fine print, lenders are doubling or tripling interest rates \n     with little warning or explanation.\n\n  What truly astounds me is the fact that credit card companies view \nthe practice as completely legitimate. In fact, when in fine print they \ndisclose they engage in this practice, the language they use is \nincredibly brazen. One credit card issuer states in its standard \ndisclosure:\n\n       We may change the rates, fees, and terms of your account at \n     any time for any reason.\n\n  Rates, fees, and terms--is there anything left in the credit card \ncontract that a consumer can count on staying the same? I understand \nwhy they would want to do this, but, again, I do not understand why the \nCongress should continue to allow them to continue this practice.\n  As I pointed out at the outset of these remarks, I carry a copy of \nthe U.S. Constitution with me. In Article I, section 8 of the Federal \nConstitution--the Framers decided--that it is our job to write the \nBankruptcy Code. In the initial draft of the Constitution, the Framers \nthought this was a significant enough issue. It is hard to find any \nmore complicated or difficult issue than bankruptcy, and yet the \nFramers said do it.\n  Why did they do it? Again, the point I tried to make at the outset: \nThe Framers wanted to give people a chance to get back on their feet. \nIf we allow these credit card companies to constantly raise the bar--we \nwill force future generations into never ending indebtedness. In the \narticle I just read, Mr. Sweibel was trying to get rid of his debt and \nmeet his obligations. No matter how diligent he was in paying his \nbills, his credit card company jacks up his interest rate--almost \ndoubling it in one month because of a disagreement he had with some \nother obligation.\n  That is wrong. Again, I understand why the credit card companies may \nwant to get away with it, but we should not let them get away with it. \nWe have an obligation to people, to make sure that people play fair, \nplay by the rules, and act responsibly. It is irresponsible for a \ncredit card company to be able to double and triple the interest rates \non someone when they are meeting their obligations of that creditor. I \nthink it is wrong and unfair. If we do not put our foot down and say it \nis wrong and unfair, they are going to continue to get away with it, \nand we are never going to see consumers get beyond the mountain of debt \nthey are accumulating.\n  Almost one-half of the $2.1 trillion in debt is consumer credit-card-\nrelated debt. The savings rate is down to less than 1 percent in the \ncountry. Consumer debt is skyrocketing, and we are handing these credit \ncard companies a gift they could never have imagined when the Framers \nof the Constitution were around.\n  We should not be allowing credit card companies to use farcical \nexcuses to penalize unaware consumers who pay their bills on time.\n  If a credit card company wants to change the rules of the game, they \nshould not be allowed to reach back and set new terms and conditions to \npurchases made under previous agreements. This is just plain, basic \nfairness.\n  If for some reason a credit card issuer views a customer as an \nincreased credit risk, which is the purported justification for the \nuniversal default practice, then it can decide to only lend future \ncredit at a higher rate or with different terms. Also, consumers must \nbe given ample notice of this new credit decision so they can fully \nunderstand the changes in the new contract.\n  This amendment is a necessary addition to the bill. It will not solve \nall the problems, but it will solve a major one, the universal default \nclauses.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 52\n\n  I call up amendment No. 52 at this point, the one that was set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Mr. DODD. As I touched on briefly before, this amendment seeks to \nprotect the most vulnerable of our nation's consumers--persons under \nthe age of 21. According to Dr. Robert Manning, a professor at \nRochester Institute of Technology, one of the fastest growing groups of \nbankruptcy filers are people under the age of 25.\n  In fact, the number of bankruptcies among those under the age of 25 \nis more than 6 times that of only 5 years ago, according to the \nAmerican Bankruptcy Institute. One of the most troubling developments \nin the hotly contested battle of credit card issuers to sign up new \ncustomers has been the aggressive way in which they target people under \nthe age of 21. Solicitations to this group have become more intense for \na variety of reasons which I have mentioned already.\n  Obviously, we know about consumer loyalties. It is also an age group \nin which brand loyalty can be established. However, some credit card \nissuers have gone too far. Again, I am not opposed to people under the \nage of 21 having credit cards.\n  Credit cards, are a great asset to a lot of people. I am not opposed \nto them, but they must be issued and used responsibly.\n  I mentioned the letter earlier of the 7-year-old, which is just plain \nridiculous. What also worries me is what is happening with these \nyounger people on college campuses around the country.\n  Credit card issuers are deeply involved in the business of enticing \ncolleges and universities to help promote their products. Many colleges \nreceive as much as 1 percent of all student charges from credit card \nissuers in return for marketing or affinity agreements. Even those \ncolleges that do not enter into such agreements are making money.\n  Robert Bugai, the President of the College Marketing Intelligence, \ntold the American Banker that colleges charge up to $400 per day for \neach credit card company that sets up a table on campus. That can run \ninto tens of thousands of dollars by the end of just one semester.\n  A ``60 Minutes II'' piece a number of years ago vividly illustrated \nthe impact that credit card debt is having on college students. A crew \nfrom the show was on a major public university, and with the use of \nhidden cameras filmed vendors pushing free T-shirts, hats, and other \nenticements for credit applications. The ``60 Minutes'' program \nrevealed that the university was being paid $13 million over 10 years \nby a credit card company for the right to have a presence on campus and \nto use the university logo on its cards.\n  This public university was making money off its students who used \ncredit cards, the report said. As part of the agreement, the university \nreceives four-tenths of a percent of each purchase made with the cards. \nUnbelievably, this university has a vested interest in getting their \nstudents into as much debt as possible.\n  Again, we have kids who are going--the anecdotal stories of the debt \nthey are incurring is just staggering. We have watched it actually \nalmost double. Debt among this group has gone from around $1,800 a year \nto over $3,000 a year.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  Again, this amendment requires one of three things. Firstly, it \nrequires that one can prove that they have the financial resources to \nrepay debts incurred. That is simple enough. Or have someone cosign the \napplication, or just agree to take a short course in credit counseling. \nAny one of those three things and a person gets their card.\n  To push these cards out with no spending limits on them at all, \nknowing what is inevitably going to happen--bankruptcy--is \nirresponsible. Again, I understand why the credit card companies want \nto do it. I do not understand why we want to allow them to do it in \nsuch an unfettered way, knowing what we know now. If they were doing \nthis for the first time and we did not know the implications or the \neffects of their actions, I could understand maybe why some people \nwould be willing to go along with it. But we now know what is \nhappening. We are watching consumer debt among young people double over \nthe last several years.\n\n  Why would we not just say, look, prove you can pay your debts, prove \nyou have some financial means, have someone cosign with you, or be \nwilling to take a credit counseling course? These are not heavy burdens \nto make. It seems to me the very least we could do, again, acting \nresponsibly. If this bill says consumers must act more responsibly, \nshould we not commensurately ask the industry to act responsibly as \nwell?\n  When universities are collecting $13 million over 10 years in fees to \nallow a credit card company to be on their campus, and they are getting \nfour-tenths of 1 percent on every purchase made by a student on campus, \nthat is a university encouraging debt among its kids. That is just \nwrong, in my view.\n  So we are requiring a cosigner, proving a person has a source of \nincome, or take some counseling so the kids have some idea of what they \nare getting into.\n  Again, just some basic statistics, and I will wrap up. Our personal \nsavings rate is at an all-time low. The last quarter in the year 2004, \nless than one-half of 1 percent was the national annual savings rate. \nThat is down from\n4\\1/2\\ percent 10 years ago. It was at 1 percent last year. We are \ngoing in the wrong direction in terms of encouraging people to save. \nConsumer debt is now at $2.1 trillion, and almost half of that, $800 \nbillion, is credit card debt--$2 billion alone in the month of \nDecember. The consumer debt is mounting, and there needs to be a \ncommensurate sense of responsibility by these credit card companies. \nThey are making incredible profits with interest rates at 18, 25, 30 \npercent, when one can borrow money to buy a home for 4\\1/2\\ or 5 \npercent. Yet credit card companies are charging these incredibly high \nrates, making staggering profits.\n  The average income of a person taking the bankruptcy act is $20,000 a \nyear. The reason they are taking the bankruptcy act is because of \nmedical expenses, job loss, or divorce. These are not people living \nlavishly. Default rates are actually dropping. What is the \njustification and rationale for a bill that makes it easier for these \ncredit card companies to collect and prevents consumers from getting \nback on their feet again?\n  Particularly disturbing to me is this change, after 100 years of law, \nwhere we sought to protect single women raising children with child \nsupport and alimony payments by allowing the discharge of these other \nobligations and seeing to it that they would focus on meeting their \nfamily obligations. We are now going to have the credit card companies \ncompeting with these children and these families, and I do not even \nhave to say who is going to win that battle.\n  A team of lawyers representing very rich credit card companies are \nalways going to beat that family out there. They are going to get that \nfather, that husband, or that woman, to pay their unsecured debts to \nthat credit card company, and that child and that family will lose. \nWhy, after 100 years, are we changing the law protecting families and \nchildren? I think that is a huge mistake. I think it is going to come \nback to cause us a great deal of pain. This bill needs fundamental \nchange.\n  I wish people would take time and look at these things. I understand \nthere is a sentiment to reject all amendments, but we ought to ask \nthese companies to act more responsibly. We are not going to do it, but \nI think, in time, we are going to pay an awful price. When we ought to \nbe encouraging more personal savings, and when we ought to be reducing \nconsumer debt, we are getting more consumer debt and less and less \npersonal savings. We are allowing credit card companies to gouge \nconsumers and never let average people who get into trouble--and, \nagain, a lot of them, through no fault of their own--to get back on \ntheir feet again. That is what we ought to be trying to do.\n  When it is the appropriate time I will ask for votes on these \namendments. I realize it will not be until next week. I have taken a \nlot of time, and I express my appreciation to my friend from Alabama \nwho has been very patient, listening to me going on about this bill, \nand I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience as well in listening \nto this, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my congratulations to \nPapa Dodd on his new daughter, born this week to join her sister Grace. \nWe wish Jackie and the family well. I know how excited he has been over \nyoung Grace. I know how excited he is over this one. He said he lost a \nlot of sleep this week, he is a little tired, but he looked pretty \nvigorous to me in debate. I wish my sincerest best to you, and my wife \nMary sends her regards, too.\n  I am disappointed Senator Dodd is not supportive, as I understand it, \nof this bill. It is essentially the same bill we passed during the \n107th Congress, 83 to 15. It came out of committee with a strong \nbipartisan vote again this year. This is the fourth time it has come \nup. It passed one time 97 to 1 in the Senate. This is the fourth time \nit is up. I believe it will become law this year.\n  I want to say there are some things here that my good friend has \nstated that are just not correct. I hope really he will think about and \nreevaluate some of his conclusions on the legislation. I have to say, \nthere is a small group of leftists who are determined to block this \nbill. They seem to believe there is something wrong if a corporation, \neven a credit card company, gives money to an American citizen for them \nto want to be paid back, and if they don't pay it back, it is the \ncredit card company's fault. They lose their money and they are an evil \nforce here. This is really an odd argument, I suggest.\n  I also argue, flatly state, that I disagree with the statement that \nthe only purpose of this bill is to help the credit card companies make \nmoney. That is absolutely not correct. It is really offensive to \nsuggest that to the 83 Members of this Senate who have been working on \nthis bill for quite a number of years.\n  Let me say a couple of things that I believe are indisputable. Philip \nStrauss, attorney for San Francisco Child Support Services, for 28 \nyears enforcing child support obligations, testified before our \nJudiciary Committee, of which I am a member. I want to deal with some \nallegations that have been floated by--I think primarily it is the \nElizabeth Warren view of this bankruptcy bill. In an effort to smear \nthe bill and defeat the bill, they have conjured up this idea, somehow, \nthat children and spouses are going to be harmed by this bankruptcy \nbill. It is absolutely incorrect. It is abysmally wrong. Let me tell \nyou what this expert said.\n\n       It is my opinion and the opinion of every professional \n     support collector with whom I have discussed the issue that \n     the support amendments contained as part of the bill, \n     contained in section 211-219 of S. 256, the bankruptcy bill, \n     will revolutionize enforcement of support organizations \n     against debtors in bankruptcy.\n\n  Child support obligations will be revolutionized.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National Child Support \nEnforcement Association. Maybe some of those who have been saying this \nhurts children ought to interview the professionals--the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, both of which have important roles to play in collecting \nenforcement obligations for children--child support.\n  Mr. Philip Strauss, the attorney who spent 28 years in bankruptcy \ncourt collecting these debts for women and children against spouses and \ndeadbeat dads\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nwho bankrupt against their debts, had this to say. The provisions in \nthe bill are ``a wish list for child support attorneys.'' That is what \nhe has been looking for.\n  Under the current law, if we don't change it by passing this bill, \nthe law that will remain in effect has alimony and child support \npayments No. 7 on the list of priorities for paying nonsecurity debt--\nNo. 7 in the list. We moved it up to the top. Everybody who knows \nanything about this bill knows that women and children and their \nalimony and child support is going to be secured in a way it never has \nbeen before. It is offensive what Professor Warren is saying about this \nbill. This college professor keeps writing things that are not so. I \ndon't know how--I guess she has tenure.\n  She also is the one who has gone around this country and promoted the \nidea, and had a press conference a few weeks ago, to announce that \nmedical bills are the cause of everything. She says that all the people \nfiling, half the people plus, 54 percent of the people who file \nbankruptcy are in bankruptcy court because of medical bills.\n  What do we know about that as a fact? She had a survey that indicated \nthat. Do you know what we discovered, when you read the fine print of \nher survey? It includes gambling debts. It includes alcoholism and drug \nproblems.\n  This is what the United States Trustee Program found in a much more \nextensive survey. Hers I believe had 1,700 people. This one has 5,203 \ncases. U.S. trustees are involved in bankruptcy courts in 48 States. \nThey deal with these cases. They were asked to survey the filings in \ntheir districts to find out what you list on your filing as your debts, \nwho you owe. You actually list who it is. So, if it is a doctor bill, \nit is on there. If you don't put it on there you don't wipe out that \ndebt and you remain obligated to pay it, so everybody puts every debt \nthey have on the list so it can be wiped out when they file bankruptcy. \nWhat they found was, this professional study of 5,000 cases, not \ninterviewing debtors but looking at what they put on their form, they \nfound that only slightly more than 5 percent of the total unsecured \ndebt reported in those cases was medically related. Only 5 percent was \nmedically related. This is not 50 percent of the cases in bankruptcy \nbeing caused by medical--only 5 percent of them, of the total debt, was \nmedical.\n  It also revealed that 54 percent of the debtors, when they list all \ntheir debts, and they have a long list of them, listed no medical debts \nwhatsoever. And of the people who listed some medical debts, 90 percent \nof those who listed a medical debt listed a medical debt of less than \n$5,000.\n  For some people there is no doubt that medical debts are a cause for \nbankruptcy. I do not doubt that. But this idea that we ought not reform \nbankruptcy, that we ought to assume that there is no fraud and abuse in \nbankruptcy and the idea that everybody is in bankruptcy because of \nmedical debts is just not so.\n  It is just not; it is a fiction. We need to get it out of our heads.\n  There is another suggestion that poor people are going to have to pay \nback some of their debt. This is ``pressure on poor people,'' they say; \n``this is class warfare.'' Poor people now are going to have to pay \nback their debt, and they are going to be harmed. We discussed the \nproblem in bankruptcy.\n  The most offensive, clearly wrong thing about the current bankruptcy \nproblem in America is that people making $200,000 a year, if they run \nup a couple hundred thousand dollars in debt, those people do not have \nto pay a dime. They can wipe out the entire debt. Shouldn't they pay \nsome of it back? The average American citizen works hard to pay his or \nher debts back. They save; they do not take vacations; they do not buy \na new car, they buy an older car so they can pay their debt. Some \ndoctors, lawyers--we have examples of them--know how the bankruptcy \nworks. They do not want to pay their debt. They wipe them out when they \ncould easily have paid them back.\n  We reached a bipartisan consensus to have a means test which received \n83 votes on the floor of the Senate the last time. If you make below \nmedian income your State, then you don't have to pay anything back. \nEighty percent of the people make below median income. Some people who \nmake above median income have special expenses, and we allowed them to \ntake an exception. It really looks as though maybe only 10 to 13 \npercent of the people who file bankruptcy would be impacted by the \nmeans test.\n  The wealthy, why shouldn't they pay? I ask you, why should somebody \nnot pay the local hospital when they have plenty of money with which to \npay their debts?\n  What happens if you make median income and you don't have special \ncircumstances? What should happen? I think you ought to pay some of it \nback. That is what the American people think, and that is what this \nCongress thinks.\n  What would happen is this: They would move into chapter 13, the \nbankruptcy chapter, which allows for repayment of a portion of the \ndebt. The judge would look at the person's income, how much he believes \nthey can pay back over a period of no more than 5 years, and order them \nto pay back some portion of those debts. What is wrong with that?\n  I hear my colleagues complain about the bill saying: I don't mind \nrich people paying back. That is what the bill does. It creates a safe \nharbor, an absolute wall for lower income people, people making below \nmedian income in America. Eighty percent of the filers of bankruptcy \ndon't have to go into chapter 13. They don't have to pay a dime back.\n  Let's just say this: Chapter 13 is not so bad. It has a lot of \nsanctions. You can keep your car and ``cram down'' the value of that \ncar, hold on to your house better, and other things that sometimes are \nan advantage. A lot of States use chapter 13 a lot. In Alabama, almost \nhalf of the filers are chapter 13 filers.\n  Just because somebody is going into chapter 13 and pays some back \ndoes not mean they are being oppressed.\n  ``Oh, you know.'' Well, we are going to complain about credit cards \ntoday. A couple of days ago, it was about health insurance, we need to \nreform health insurance. If we reform health insurance, they argue, we \nwouldn't have bankruptcy.\n  If we don't fix credit cards and interest rates and truth in lending \nand banking issues--they are not part of the Judiciary Committee but \npart of the Banking Committee's financial lending portfolio of issues--\nwe have to deal with them. We can't deal with bankruptcy. This is a \nbankruptcy bill.\n  This bill would create a workable process for filing bankruptcy in \nFederal court, so fairness occurs based on the debt that people have \nincurred. If you want to deal with the debts being incurred and giving \nmore money, or have a welfare increase, whatever you want to do, let us \npropose that somewhere else to give people more money. But once they \nchoose to file bankruptcy, let us create a system that is fair.\n\n       Let us say that people who have higher incomes and can pay \n     back some of it, why don't they pay it back?\n\n  That is what I think we ought to do.\n  It has been suggested. We have a lot of complaints. Members of this \nbody like to talk about some minor child getting a credit card.\n  Let me say that any minor in America who gets a credit card and goes \ndown and runs up $5,000 worth of bills on that credit card does not \nhave to pay a dime. The company that wrongly sent them that credit card \neats the $5,000 loss because you can't sue a minor on such a debt. They \ncan't be made to pay it. Who is the loser, if they sent a credit card \nto some young person and they used it, but the credit card company \nitself? That is not the issue before us.\n  Let us fix this bankruptcy bill that allows too much abuse, too much \nlegal cost for people who go to court. Let us keep the legal fees down. \nLet us make the system fairer. Let us make sure the great protections \nof a fresh start for Americans is still alive and well. And for those \nmedian income and below, there is no change fundamentally in this bill \nwhatsoever except they have to have some financial counseling, some \ncredit counseling, and they can start all over again and wipe out all \nof their debt. But if they make above that and can pay some of it back, \nlet us have them pay some back.\n  I don't think that is unfair or unusual or upsetting to most people \nwho\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nconsidered the bill, and that is why we have had such good support for \nit.\n  There was some suggestion that we have seen some reduction in \nfilings. I hear 50,000--50,000 off a number of 1.6 million. About a \nlittle over 20 years ago, in 1980, there were 287,000 bankruptcy \nfilings a year. Now they hit 1.6 million, and there is the suggestion \nthat because it has dropped to 1.5, that somehow we ought not to fix \nthis system that we know from experience--and we have been watching it \nfor some time as a problem. Let us fix this problem. Whether it is 1.2 \nmillion in bankruptcy, 2 million in bankruptcy, we have a problem with \nthe system. Let us fix it.\n  Let us treat people fairly. If you can pay some of it back, you \nshouldn't get off scot-free. If you make below median income, you get \nto wipe out all of your debts and not pay a dime to the people you owe \nunless you intentionally and deliberately inflict harm on that.\n  It is the same law we have always had. Those debts are not \ndischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Department of Justice on the data they have obtained \nfrom the U.S. Trustees on the issue of medical debts, and I commend to \nmy colleagues the February 10, 2005, testimony of Philip Strauss before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee on the benefits of the bill to women and \nchildren which he states is indisputable and represents a wish list of \nitems of those who collect child support for women and children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This responds to your letter, dated \n     February 5, 2005, requesting information from the Executive \n     Office for United States Trustees (EOUST) concerning medical \n     debts of those who file for bankruptcy protection and the \n     recently published study in the Health Affairs journal \n     (``Market Watch: Illness and Injury As Contributors to \n     Bankruptcy'').\n       It is the practice of the U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) not \n     to comment on data collected and analyses performed by \n     outside researchers for reasons that include difficulties in \n     verifying their data and research methodologies. It is noted \n     in the cited study of 1,771 filers that very broad \n     definitions of ``medical bankruptcies'' are used. The authors \n     considered a ``Major Medical Bankruptcy'' to include cases in \n     which debtor reported any of the following: illness or injury \n     as a reason for filing bankruptcy, uncovered medical bills \n     exceeding $1,000 in the past two years, loss of two weeks of \n     work-related income due to illness or injury, or mortgage of \n     home to pay medical bills. The authors considered ``Any \n     Medical Bankruptcy'' to include cases containing any of the \n     factors above or birth or death in the debtor's family or \n     birth or death in the debtor's family or addiction or \n     uncontrolled gambling.\n       Enclosed in a description of related USTP data and a \n     summary of findings from analysis of a similar but larger \n     sample of bankruptcy cases (5,203) utilizing data from \n     official records during approximately the same time period as \n     the study cited above. It should be noted that reported \n     credit card debt also may reflect medical-related debts, but \n     are not shown in these findings.\n       In general, the data describing medical-related expenses \n     contained in official documents filed by chapter 7 debtors \n     reveal that slightly more than 5 percent of their general \n     unsecured debt is medical-related. The conclusion that almost \n     50 percent of consumer bankruptcies are ``medical related'' \n     requires a broad definition and generally is not \n     substantiated by the official documents filed by debtors.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your inquiry. If \n     we can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     contact this office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Summary of USTP Data and Findings on Medical Debt\n\n\n                               USTP Data\n\n       The USTP database contains 5,203 no asset chapter 7 cases \n     that were closed between 2000 and 2002. The database includes \n     cases filed in 48 States, Washington, DC and Puerto Rico \n     proportionate to chapter 7 filings in each location. The \n     database contains no cases from North Carolina and Alabama, \n     because those States are served by Bankruptcy Administrators. \n     Nearly all of these cases had been filed about 4 months prior \n     to closing.\n       On each petition we reviewed Schedule F of the petition to \n     see if any medical debts were listed. This would include \n     where the creditor was a doctor, hospital or other treatment \n     facility, medical collection agency, or if the debt was in \n     any way identifiable as being medical in origin.\n       This accounting would not have identified medical debts \n     charged on credit cards, placed with certain collection \n     agencies, or paid prior to the bankruptcy filings.\n\n\n                                findings\n\n     All Debtors (N = 5,203):\n       54 percent listed no medical debt.\n       Medical debt accounted for 5.5 percent of the total general \n     unsecured debt.\n       90.1 percent reported medical debts less than $5,000.\n       1 percent of cases accounted for 36.5 percent of medical \n     debt.\n       Less than 10 percent of all cases represent 80 percent of \n     all reported medical debt.\n     Cases Reporting Medical Debts (N = 2,391):\n       Among the debtors reporting medical debt, the average \n     medical debt was $4,978 per case.\n       78.4 percent reported medical debts below $5,000 (average \n     of $1,212 for this group).\n       21.6 percent reported 80.9 percent of the total medical \n     debt.\n       Medical debts accounted for 13.0 percent of the total \n     general unsecured debt for those reporting medical debt.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me say to my friend, the Senator from Alabama, how much I \nappreciate his eloquence on this bill and his very successful attempt \nto explain to the American people, as well as to us, what is at stake \nhere, and to knock down some myths that are being used to try to worry \npeople when, in fact, there is no reason for people to be worried about \nthis legislation.\n  Indeed, as has been reflected before, this bill will pass as it has \npreviously, and will pass by a large bipartisan majority, and for good \nreason.\n\n\n                              Free Speech\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to turn to another subject briefly.\n  The reason I changed the subject from bankruptcy to this is provoked \nby an op-ed piece that I read today, and that others in this body may \nhave read, published in the Washington Post. This article is called `` \n`Nuking' Free Speech,'' certainly an attention-grabbing headline.\n\n  As it turns out, reading the op-ed, it is what I can only describe as \na breathless statement made in writing by one of our distinguished \ncolleagues, claiming there are efforts to reinstate majority rule when \nit comes to the procedures that govern our advice and consent function; \nthat is, the procedures by which we evaluate Federal judges sent to the \nSenate for our consideration under our advice and consent function.\n  Somehow, the opponents of reinstating the 200-and-more year tradition \nof majority rule when it comes to confirming Federal judges have been \nable to convince the press and others that this represents a nuclear \noption. Hence, the title and, hence, the first sentence in this op-ed.\n  It says:\n\n       A ``nuclear option'' is targeting the Senate.\n\n  That is unfortunate because it suggests people who want to reinstate \nmajority rule when it comes to advice and consent on the President's \njudicial nominees are somehow doing something radical, something \ndangerous, something potentially catastrophic when, in fact, that is \nnot the case.\n  As many know, we have seen use of a tactic which has been labeled \nobstructionist, it is fair to call it; that is, the use of the \nfilibuster, to block the President's judicial nominees from getting an \nup-or-down vote. Indeed, it is that obstructionist procedure that has \nnever been used in the history of this country before the last \nCongress. If there is a nuclear tactic being used here, I submit it is \nthe use of that obstruction where a willful minority blocks a \nbipartisan majority from voting on the President's judicial nominees. \nThat radical change from Senate tradition over the 200-plus years this \nbody has existed is the radical change. For those who believe we ought \nto restore that tradition which has been taken down a very dangerous \nroad these last 2 years with obstruction, I submit we are doing nothing \nmore than trying to restore that Senate tradition and majority rule; \nand those who oppose reestablishing majority rule are the ones who are \ntaking a radical, a dangerous position.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia, the author of this op-ed, \nclaims\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nthat 20 men and women have been renominated by the President to the \nFederal bench where 7 of those were rejected last year. Plainly, that \nis false. How can it be said the Senate has rejected a nominee when we \nwere prevented from having an up-or-down vote? Clearly, that is not \ntrue.\n  This op-ed piece goes on to suggest that as a result of those who \nbelieve we ought to reestablish this 200-year-long tradition of \nmajority rule when it comes to confirming judicial nominees, this op-ed \ngoes on to say it starts with shutting off debate on judges, but it \nwill not end there. Ultimately, he says, if Senators are denied their \nright to free speech on judicial nominations, an attack on extended \ndebate on all other matters cannot be far behind.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia has been in the \nSenate a long time. Much of his service he is justly proud of. But one \nof the dangers of being in the Senate for a long time is that you go on \nrecord making statements which have the potential of contradicting \none's current statements. Indeed, that has been the case when it comes \nto the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  For example, the very procedure which he now decries as nuking free \nspeech, he himself championed in 1977, in 1979, in 1980, in 1987. \nHardly can it be true that today trying to reinstate majority rule as \nhe himself did on those four occasions on the dates of the years \nmentioned, hardly can that be nuking free speech. In fairness, he ought \nto concede what we are doing is nothing radical. Indeed, it is doing \nthe same thing he himself did four times earlier.\n  The other thing that is unfortunate about this claim made in this op-\ned is that it represents the latest in a continuing series of arguments \nbeing made in the Judiciary Committee. I am thinking now of the senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who asked the Attorney General, \nthen nominee, Alberto Gonzales, of his opinion on this ``nuclear \noption.'' Later we heard speeches in the Senate from the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and together the three \nSenators making speeches, raising fears of alarm about the so-called \nnuclear option have raised the concern, at least on my part, that if \nleft unresponded to, if the record is left uncorrected, people might \nindeed begin to believe what we are suggesting by restoring this 200-\nyear tradition of majority rule is radical when it is not.\n  One of the dangers of being here a while is you may have been on \nrecord directly and diametrically opposed to what one is saying today. \nThat is the case with the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  In 1979 on this same issue, he said:\n\n       This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand \n     of the past . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       Any Member of this body knows that the next Congress would \n     not heed that law . . .\n\n  He is talking about a hypothetical law where a Congress would pass a \nbill that says to change this you need a two-thirds majority \nrequirement.\n  He said:\n\n       Any Member of this body knows that the next Congress would \n     not heed that law and would proceed to change it and would \n     proceed to change it and would vote repeal of it by a \n     majority vote.\n\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia was correct in 1979. He is \nplainly incorrect today in claiming now that a 60-vote threshold is \nrequired in order to get an up-or-down vote on the President's judicial \nnominees.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, spoke on this \nsame matter in 1975--quite a time ago--when he served in this body as a \nmuch younger man. He said on this same subject:\n\n       The simple fact is the two-thirds majority required . . .\n\nunder the filibuster, under the cloture rules\n\n     is too difficult to obtain. Too much Senate business is too \n     often obstructed. The will of the majority is too easily \n     thwarted. And it is not the Senate, but the Nation's people \n     who suffer the consequences.\n\n  I agree with the senior Senator from Massachusetts, speaking in 1975. \nI disagree with the senior Senator speaking in 2005 on the same \nsubject. He made the case very clearly back then. It is the same case \nthat applies today. He said that the immediate issue is whether a \nsimple majority of the Senate is entitled to change the Senate rules. \nAlthough the procedural issues are complex, it is clear this question \nshould be settled by majority vote.\n  So it is clear from the record that what Senator Kennedy, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Schumer himself back in the year 2000 suggested, \nwhich was the majority should govern, should be the rule today. It \nshould be the rule when Republicans control the White House and control \nthe Senate. It should be the case were there a Democrat in the White \nHouse or the Democrats controlled the Senate. In other words, what we \nare talking about today is an important principle. And principles \nshould not change with political convenience, which apparently is the \ncase today.\n  For those who took the same position back then as I and others \nbelieve should be applied today, then somehow it is suggested that this \nmajority rule option--which is what I would prefer to call what they \nrefer to as the nuclear option or the constitutional option--that is \nall we are asking for, a return to that majority rule, which they \nchampioned years ago and which they, unfortunately, are obstructing \ntoday in suggesting that somehow it is a violation of our rules and of \nour precedents.\n  Unfortunately, we learn, those of us who run for office, those of us \nwho are engaged in the rough and tumble of debate in the political \narena, we know that an unresponded to allegation or attack is often an \nattack or an allegation believed. That is why it is so important, to \nset the record straight.\n  One of the concerns Senator Byrd expressed in this op-ed, if I can \nsort of get down to the bottom of it, is he thinks what we are \nsuggesting, the return to majority rule, is somehow going to stifle \ndebate. Well, the fact is, we have had more than 2 years, going on 3 \nyears, to debate the President's judicial nominees who have been \nfilibustered. Surely, any reasonable person would agree that 2 or 3 \nyears is enough debate on any nominee, when all we are asking for is \nsimply an up-or-down vote.\n  One other distinction I think is noteworthy. What we are talking \nabout is not restricting debate in any way on legislative business, \nwhich, of course, is exclusively within the purview of the Congress. \nAnd if we want to pass a rule that says we are not going to have an up-\nor-down vote on legislation unless 60 Senators agree that we should \nclose off debate, I think that is exclusively within our purview \nbecause it does not speak to the constitutional authority of power of \nany other branch of Government.\n  But when we say--and the President is given the constitutional \nresponsibility to nominate people to the Federal bench--that our advice \nand consent function cannot occur unless 60 Senators agree to close off \ndebate so we can have an up-or-down vote, that does not merely infringe \non our authority as the Senate, it infringes on the constitutional \npower of this President to nominate good and qualified people to the \nFederal bench, and then to have a debate, to have a searching inquiry \ninto their qualifications and background, but ultimately then to have a \nvote, if a majority stand ready to confirm these nominees.\n  Surely, everyone would agree that it would be wrong to say it takes a \n51-percent vote to elect a Democrat to office but it somehow should \ntake a 60-percent vote to elect a Republican to office. In a very odd \nsort of way, that is an analogy to what Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Schumer, and others on their side of the aisle have suggested.\n  Why in the world, after more than 200 years, when the practice has \nbeen not to filibuster judges but to allow an up-or-down vote when a \nbipartisan majority stand ready to vote on them, should the rules \nchange when this President is elected to the White House and when \nRepublicans have a majority in the Senate?\n  Well, of course, that is an unprincipled approach. It is merely a way \nof saying we have an argument for why we ought to be able to obstruct \nthis President from getting the nominees he wants voted on to the \nFederal bench. No one is suggesting, of course, that any Senator do \nanything other than vote their conscience. If any Senator feels there \nis just cause for them to vote against a nominee, then they should do \nso. And I trust they will. But no Senator and no group of Senators has \nthe authority to block a bipartisan\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\nmajority of this Senate from doing its solemn duty under the \nConstitution. Yet that is precisely what has happened time and time and \ntime again by an obstinate minority who last Congress filibustered 10 \ndifferent judges, preventing that up-or-down vote from occurring.\n  We have tried to work with our colleagues on the other side. I \nremember the Democratic leader, when asked whether his approach to \nleadership on this and other issues would change with the change of \nCongress and with his ascension to Democratic leader, said: I would \nrather dance than fight. What it suggested to me was he was going to be \namenable to working together. I know he is a tough advocate for his \nside of any argument, and as leader has a responsibility to his caucus \nto represent the views of his caucus. But it suggested to me perhaps we \nwould have a fresh start and a new attitude when it came to judicial \nfilibusters.\n  But, indeed, time and time again we have seen that is not apparently \nthe case. And while we have not yet had to go to a vote on the floor on \nthese judges who have been filibustered in the past, we will very soon. \nWe know also that in addition to these circuit court nominees, we are \nlikely to have a vacancy to the U.S. Supreme Court before very long, \nwhere, believe me, all this will have been merely a prelude to what \nwill be a vigorous debate, which will consume virtually everything else \nwe do, because people understand that those who are unsuccessful in \ngetting their views enacted into law through the political process know \nthat having judges who are confirmed who believe that a judge should be \nan umpire and enforce political decisions rather than make political \ndecisions from the bench represents a threat to their agenda.\n  But none of us have the right to use unconstitutional means, which \nthese filibusters are, to prevent the people of this body, to prevent \nthis President, from doing our constitutional duty. For them to suggest \ntrying to restore 200 years of tradition, trying to restore majority \nrule, doing the very things they themselves have advocated and done in \nthe past, is somehow a nuclear option is blatantly false.\n  So, unfortunately, it is necessary, for me and others to lay the \nrecord straight. I trust that fairminded people, looking at the record, \nlooking at the facts, will realize what we are suggesting is not a \nnuclear option. What we are suggesting is perhaps a constitutional \noption. What we are suggesting is a restoration of the majority rule \noption, but it is nothing radical, and it is, indeed, in keeping not \nonly with the traditions of the Senate but also in keeping with the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.\n  The Constitution is abundantly clear when supermajorities are \nrequired in order to perform a certain function. For example, to amend \nthe Constitution, it talks explicitly about the requirement of a two-\nthirds majority and ratification by three-quarters of the States. It is \nalso very clear that a supermajority is required to ratify treaties. \nBut nowhere within that document, that foundation of our laws, the \nConstitution, is it suggested that more than a majority rule is \nrequired in order to provide advice and consent when it comes to the \nPresident's judicial nominees.\n  I appreciate the opportunity and the patience of my friend, the \nSenator from Georgia, who I know is going to speak next, allowing me to \ncorrect the record and I hope better inform the American people and our \ncolleagues about exactly what is going on. What is going on is that we \nare required to do what the people of our respective States have sent \nus here to do, and that is to vote. We have a tradition of lengthy \ndebate and opportunity for any Senator to speak their mind on any \nsubject that they care to speak on, but ultimately we are obligated by \nour oath and by the Constitution that governs all Americans to have an \nup-or-down vote, especially when a bipartisan majority stands ready to \nconfirm, which is the case here. No Senator, no person, no collection \nof persons has any right to demand anything more.\n  Unfortunately, this has gone on for too long. Good and distinguished \nnominees of this President have not only been denied the opportunity to \nhave an up-or-down vote but unfortunately have been smeared as part of \nthe process far too often. I believe what we need is a fresh start. We \nneed a fair process, one that will apply to Democrats as well as \nRepublicans, and one that will reflect the kind of honor that should be \nreflected on this institution. Unfortunately, that has not been the \ncase. We have somehow allowed ourselves to veer off the path that the \nConstitution lays out for us. But we do have a chance, if necessary, if \nthe Democratic leadership is going to persist in this unconstitutional \nblockade and obstruction of the President's nominees, for us to correct \nwhat has gone on for too long. Indeed, I hope that will not be \nnecessary. Ultimately the decision is going to be theirs.\n  We have been patient. We have explained our position. We have \nlistened carefully to their arguments. We have listened to their \nobjections. Frankly, we find them to be firmly planted on both sides of \nthis issue.\n  I hope those listening and colleagues in the Chamber will now \nunderstand a little bit better about why it is so important for us to \nreinstate this more than 200-year tradition, indeed this constitutional \nmandate that binds all of us as Americans to majority rule restoration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Tillie Fowler\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, at this precise minute and this precise \nhour in Jacksonville, FL, countless friends and admirers are gathering \nto pay tribute to Tillie Fowler. It is only fitting and proper that in \nthis Chamber this Congress do the same.\n  For me personally, it is more than just the loss of a colleague. I \nserved with Tillie's dad, Culver Kidd, a State senator in Georgia for \nyears when I served in the legislature--colorful and distinguished, a \nleading citizen. Her brother Rusty is a warm and trusted friend. Her \ndaughter Tillie worked for me the first 4 years I served in the House \nof Representatives. I honor, admire, and respect her loving husband \nBuck who, together with Tillie, has meant so much to me personally in \nmy career.\n  I know the bible teaches us in the book and chapter of Ecclesiastes \nthat there is a time for everything, a time to live and a time to die. \nBut there are some times that it is so difficult to accept, the loss of \none so vibrant and so important, not only to their community but to \ntheir country. Such is the case with Tillie Fowler.\n  I know that her family, gathered today at this moment in \nJacksonville, FL, would want us in the Senate and in this Congress, in \nthis building today, to pay tribute to the legacy of Tillie Fowler: an \naccomplished attorney, a loving wife, a devoted mother, a committed \nservant of the people she represented, an honored Member of the United \nStates House of representatives, a lady who became the highest elected \nwoman in leadership in the Congress of the United States at the time \nshe ascended to the position of vice chairman of the Republican \nconference in the majority of the House, respected by both sides of the \naisle as the most formidable and knowledgeable member of the Armed \nServices Committee in the House, one who had the temperament and the \nability to calm the waves of partisanship and point to the direction \nthat we all knew we should go, and one that would also stop to help, \nregardless of the need of an individual.\n  In fact, on Tuesday of this week, just one day after she was \nstricken, I was to have had an appointment in my office in the Russell \noffice building with Tillie Fowler. Obviously, because of her illness, \nshe could not come. But the person she was going to introduce me to \ncould. Only a Tillie Fowler would have sent to me the new director of \nthe largest public and charitable hospital in Georgia and the largest \ntrauma center in our State because she was spending part of her time \ntrying to see to it that those that help others got help themselves.\n  It was an honor for me to serve in the House with Tillie Fowler. It \nis a privilege for me to stand here today in the Senate and pay tribute \nto our colleague. On behalf of all the Members of\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nthis Senate, we extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to her \nhusband Buck, her daughter Elizabeth, her daughter Tillie, and all of \nher extended family.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it was with great sadness that \nI learned of the passing of Tillie Fowler, a great friend, dedicated \npublic servant, and remarkable woman.\n  It is difficult to think about Florida politics without thinking \nabout Tillie Fowler. She was a woman with strong values, political \nacumen and honor. I was lucky to have known her and, more importantly, \nFlorida was lucky to have had her represent us in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  She is an inspiration to Floridians and all Americans, and she will \nbe greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation.

The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2081-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE MONEY FOLLOWS THE PERSON ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Money Follows \nthe Person Act of 2005, along with Senator Harkin.\n  My job as a Senator is to help protect and defend the freedoms of all \nAmericans. One of the most important freedoms we enjoy is the freedom \nto choose where we live. For example, many people overlook the \nimportance of being able to choose to live among family and friends and \nnot among strangers.\n  All too often this basic freedom is denied to older Americans and \nAmericans with disabilities. Currently, we are unnecessarily isolating \npeople with disabilities from their communities, friends, families and \nloved ones by placing them in institutional care facilities. Many of \nthese Americans should not be in a nursing home or institutional \nsetting. A disabled person can often be better served and integrated \ninto their community by living in community-based homes.\n  However, recent data indicates that 70 percent of Medicaid dollars \nare spent on institutional care and only 30 percent are spent on \ncommunity services for the disabled. This is because Medicaid currently \nrequires that States provide nursing home care for Americans with \ndisabilities, but does not require the same for community-based \nservices. Due to this inequity in Medicaid law many individuals with \ndisabilities and older Americans are forced to live in isolated \nsettings.\n  In order to preserve the freedoms of our friends and loved ones in \nthe disabled community, we must do something to reverse this trend. It \nis my privilege today to join my distinguished colleague from Iowa as a \ncosponsor of the Money Follows the Person Act of 2005. Under this \nlegislation, Oregon's effort to help an individual move out of an \ninstitutional facility and into a community home would be 100 percent \nfederally funded for one year. After that first year, the Federal \nGovernment would pay the state's normal Medicaid rate.\n  These incentives can help reintegrate countless older Americans and \nAmericans with disabilities into a setting where they can be more \nactive citizens. Americans everywhere realize the value of integrating \npersons with disabilities into their communities. It is unfair and \nunjust to needlessly isolate productive citizens from their \ncommunities, regardless of their condition. It is time we work to \nreintegrate disabled Americans back into our communities. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill \nand to support the freedom of choice for Americans with disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2081-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE ``DECADE OF ROMA INCLUSION''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last month, the Prime Ministers of \neight Central and Southern European countries met in Sofia, Bulgaria, \nfor their first meeting in what has been dubbed ``the Decade of Roma \nInclusion.'' This initiative is designed to spur governments to \nundertake intensive engagement in the field of education, employment, \nhealth and housing with respect to Europe's largest, most impoverished \nand marginalized ethnic minority, the Roma. The Open Society Institute, \nthe World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations \nDevelopment Program--all supporters of this initiative--hope that this \neffort will result in meaningful improvements over the course of a 10-\nyear period.\n  In December, a donors' conference pledged $42 million for a Roma \nEducation Fund. But the real goal is to get governments to give more \nhelp to their own people from their own budgets, as well as to make \nbetter use of the funds already available from organizations like the \nEU.\n  The fact is, Romani riots in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in 2002 and in \neastern Slovakia last year should be a wake up call for governments \nwith significant Romani communities. These countries cannot afford to \nignore the crushing impoverishment and crude bigotry that so many Roma \nface on a daily basis. The Decade of Romani Inclusion is all well and \ngood, and I commend the governments that are participating in this \ninitiative. But much more needs to be done to truly advance Romani \nintegration. It must start with a message of tolerance and inclusion \nfrom the highest levels of government.\n  Unfortunately, too often the voices that are heard are those \nspreading crude stereotypes and inter-ethnic hatred. I am particularly \nalarmed by what appears to be an increase in anti-roma statements in \nBulgaria.\n  Last summer, the head of one of Bulgaria's leading trade unions, \nKonstantin Trenchev, broadly characterized all Roma as criminals--and \nthen called for the establishment of vigilante guards to deal with \nthem. More recently, Ognian Saparev, a Member of Parliament from the \nBulgarian Socialist Party, dismissed the significance of reports that \nthe Mayor of Pazardzhik has trafficked Romani girls for the benefit of \nvisiting foreigner diplomats. Saparev reportedly claimed that the \nstatutory rape of these girls shouldn't be considered a crime because \nRomani girls are ``mature'' at age 14. Significantly, Saparev also \ngained headlines last year for publishing an inflammatory article about \nRoma in which he argued they should be forced to live in ghettos.\n  Even worse statements have come from Russia. Yevgenii Urlashov, a \ncity official in Yaroslavl, recently characterized all Roma as drug \ndealers and called for them to be deported. Not to be outdone, fellow \nmunicipal legislator, Sergei Krivnyuk, said, ``residents are ready to \nstart setting the Gypsies' houses on fire, and I want to head this \nprocess.''\n  Although nongovernmental human rights groups have condemned this \nanti-Romani rhetoric, other leaders in Bulgaria and Russia have largely \nremained silent. But it is critical that public leaders, from all walks \nof life, speak out against such hate mongering.\n  Speaking on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of \nAuschwitz, Polish President Kwasniewski noted that ``complete \nextermination\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nwas also [intended] to be the fate of the Roma community.'' It will not \ndo, 60 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, to stand by in silence \nwhile Roma are crudely caricatured as criminals, just as they were by \nthe Nazis. And we must not stand by in silence when a member of \nParliament dismisses the criminal act of trafficking of children, \nsimply because they are Romani.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2082-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BELARUS--OUTPOST OF TYRANNY\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, over the course of the last few months, \nwe have witnessed dramatic events in one of Europe's largest countries, \nUkraine. The Orange Revolution has clearly shown that people power can \nbring about peaceful democratic change some thought was not possible in \na former Soviet state. As a result, and with the support of the United \nStates, Europe and international organizations such as the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE, Ukraine is on the path to \nfreedom and democracy. Notwithstanding the formidable challenges that \nremain to overcome the legacy of the past, Ukraine now has a real \nchance at consolidating its democracy and further integrating into the \nEuro-Atlantic community.\n  Unfortunately, the news out of Belarus, Ukraine's neighboring fellow \neastern Slavic country to the north stands in stark contrast to the \nencouraging news coming out of Ukraine. Secretary Rice, in her \nconfirmation testimony, characterized Belarus, along with North Korea, \nIran, Cuba, Burma, and Zimbabwe as an outpost of tyranny and asserted \nthat America stands with oppressed people on every continent. Belarus, \nunder Alexander Lukashenka's now 10-year repressive rule, has the worst \nhuman rights record of any country in Europe. Lukashenka's regime has \nincreasingly violated human rights and freedoms and has made a mockery \nof commitments that Belarus freely undertook when it joined the OSCE in \n1992.\n  Nothing has changed for the better since last October's fundamentally \nflawed parliamentary elections and rigged referendum allowing \nLukashenka unlimited terms as president. In November, Lukashenka \nappointed Viktor Sheiman as head of the powerful Presidential \nAdministration, despite credible evidence linking Sheiman to the \ndisappearances of opposition leaders and a journalist in 1999 and 2000.\n  The harassment and persecution of civil society has intensified. A \ntop opposition figure, Mikhail Marinich, was sentenced in late December \non the charge of stealing, of all things, U.S. government property--in \nthis case, computers--despite the fact that the U.S. Embassy in Minsk \nmakes no claims against Marinich. Clearly, Lukashenka wants to \neliminate Marinich as a potential candidate for the 2006 presidential \nelections.\n  Other opposition leaders--Valery Levaneuski and Alyaksandr Vasilyeu--\ncontinue to serve terms in a minimum security colony after having been \nfound guilty of ``public slander'' of the Belarusian leader. Their \ncrime? Distributing leaflets urging people to take part in an \nunauthorized rally. The leaflets contained a satirical poem about \nLukashenka. Another example of Belarus' reluctance to promote human \nrights is the recent refusal to grant a visa to former OSCE \nParliamentary Assembly Chairman and Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian \nSeverin, who now serves as the UN Human Rights Commission's Special \nRapporteur on Belarus. The Belarusian regime has also clamped down on \nindependent NGOs and prodemocracy political parties with Kafkaesque \nlegal requirements and has mounted a full-fledged assault on \nindependent trade unions. Problems are being experienced by religious \ncommunities attempting to operate freely.\n  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, charged with monitoring and \nencouraging compliance by all 55 participating States with OSCE \nagreements, I call upon the Belarusian authorities to live up to their \nfreely-undertaken commitments with respect to democracy, human rights \nand the rule of law. Last October, President Bush signed into law the \nBelarus Democracy Act, which had been introduced in the Senate by then \nHelsinki Commission Chairman Senator Campbell and in the House by \ncommission co-chair Chris Smith, stating:\n\n       We welcome this legislation as a means to bolster friends \n     of freedom and to nurture the growth of democratic values, \n     habits, and institutions within Belarus. The fate of Belarus \n     will rest not with a dictator, but with the students, trade \n     unionists, civic and religious leaders, journalists, and all \n     citizens of Belarus claiming freedom for their nation.\n\n  It is essential that we in the Congress, together with the \nadministration and the OSCE, keep faith with the courageous people of \nBelarus struggling to ensure freedom and democratic values for their \nlong-suffering country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2082-2", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2082-S2083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               MS.

Nicole Wayant of \nTopeka, KS, and Cormac O'Connor of Prairie Village, KS, have just been \nnamed State Honorees in The 2005 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards \nprogram, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and \none middle-level student in each State, the District of Columbia and \nPuerto Rico.\n  Ms. Wayant is being recognized for creating a youth health council to \npromote the benefits of an active, healthy lifestyle among the students \nin her school district.\n  Mr. O'Connor is being recognized for implementing an \nintergenerational arts program that brought senior citizens and at-risk \nchildren together for classes in visual arts, movements, theater and \njazz.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that \nwe encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young \npeople have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, \nas individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure \nthe health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor are inspiring examples to \nall of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that \ntheir contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to \ninspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 10 \nyears, the program has become the Nation's largest youth recognition \neffort based solely on unity service, with more than 170,000 young \npeople participating since its inception.\n  Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along \nwith other 2005 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country, \nfor several days of special events, including a Congressional breakfast \non Capitol Hill. While here in Washington, ten will be named America's \ntop youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection \ncommittee.\n  I applaud Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor for their initiative in seeking \nto make their communities better places to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others. I also salute the other \nyoung people in my State who were named Distinguished Finalists by The \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer \nservice. They are Shawn Bryant of Leavenworth, KS, Brad Harris of Saint \nPaul, KS, Amanda Knox of Clifton, KS, and Creighton Olsen of Larned, \nKS,\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world and they \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, \nand\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nthat America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2083-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMEMORATING THE 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

A bill to amend section 691 of title 10, United States Code, \nto increase the end strengths of the Army and the Marine Corps for \nfiscal years after fiscal year 2005, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nJack Reed in introducing legislation to increase the size of the United \nStates Army by 30,000 troops and the United States Marine Corps by \n5,000 Marines.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Army \nChief of Staff General Peter Schoomaker testified that the current Army \nendstrength of 502,400 troops is adequate to fight the Global War on \nTerrorism if the Army National Guard and Army Reserve can sustain the \ncurrent active-duty force.\n  Our current over-dependence on Army National Guard and Army Reserve \nmobilization is irresponsible policy. This policy threatens to break \nthe United States Army and severely damage our national security.\n  America should not leverage its security interests upon a Reserve and \nNational Guard force that is already over-stressed and over-burdened. \nThere are 100,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard mobilized and \nserving on active duty. An additional 50,000 Army Reserve soldiers have \nbeen mobilized. Many of these reservists are in critical specialty \nareas and are completing 2 years on active-duty.\n  The Global War on Terrorism began almost 3\\1/2\\ years ago. Since \nthen, the active-duty Army has grown 5 percent, while the demands \nplaced on our soldiers have skyrocketed. LTG Richard Cody, Vice Chief \nof Staff of the Army, recently testified to Congress that almost 50 \npercent of the Army's available manpower is deployed.\n  The bulk of our active-duty combat soldiers are currently in a cycle \nof deployment that includes 1 year in Iraq or Afghanistan followed by 1 \nyear at home. The Marine Corps has shortened the cycle to 7 months \ndeployed and 7 months at home. However, these soldiers and Marines are \nno longer spending time with their families. Instead, their time at \nhome is spent training and preparing to redeploy.\n  These deployment cycles are just as demanding for our National Guard \nand Reserve personnel. GEN James Helmly, Commander of the Army Reserve, \nhas told the Pentagon leadership that current personnel and deployment \npolicy threatens to permanently damage the Army Reserve's recruitment \nand retention.\n  This policy is not sustainable. It must be changed. In order to \neffectively meet the global challenges of the 21st century, our efforts \nmust assure Americans that the Army and Marines have a sufficient \nnumber of full time, highly trained and fully qualified personnel to do \nthe job.\n  The Army has over 500,000 soldiers on active duty today. By the end \nof this year the Army will have over 510,000 soldiers. Later this year \nthe Marine Corps will have over 178,000 Marines on active duty. Yet the \nPentagon's Fiscal Year 2006 budget submission only pays for 482,400 \nsoldiers and 175,000 Marines.\n  The Department of Defense, DoD, has chosen not to fund known costs \nand instead has deferred an increase in Army endstrength to upcoming \nsupplemental appropriations requests. The leaders of our Armed Forces \nmust have realistic funding in order to conduct realistic wartime \nplanning and execution. The Congress and the American people expect DoD \nto tell us what our real National Security costs are.\n  In previous years, Senator Reed and I have introduced legislation to \nincrease the size of the Army. In 2003, our first effort to increase \nArmy endstrength by 10,000 troops was simply dismissed by the Pentagon.\n  Last year, our second effort to increase the size of the Army by \n30,000 soldiers resulted in compromise legislation to add 20,000 \nsoldiers to the Army and 3,000 Marines to the Marine Corps. The \nPentagon has essentially ignored this provision in last year's Defense \nAuthorization Bill by not funding the increased personnel in the Fiscal \nYear 2006 budget.\n  The legislation Senator Reed and I introduce today will establish a \nU.S. Army endstrength of 532,400, which is 30,000 soldiers higher than \ncurrent levels. It will also establish a U.S. Marine Corps endstrength \nof 183,000 or an additional 5,000 Marines. Our legislation requires DoD \nto make these new endstrength levels permanent and requires DoD to pay \nfor it in their annual budgets.\n  Our effort to increase the endstrength of the Army and the Marines is \nnot a choice between increased manpower versus critical \nrecapitalization, modernization, research, and military construction \nneeds. DoD must have both fully funded.\n  Article 1, section 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress \nthe power ``to provide the common defense . . . to raise and support \nArmies . . . to provide and maintain a navy . . . and to make laws \nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying out the foregoing \npowers.'' The Congress must exercise its responsibility to ensure that \nour Army and Marine Corps remain the best led, best trained, best \nequipped and most professional fighting force in the world. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 531. A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to exempt \ncertain identified varieties of tomatoes from agricultural marketing \norders; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join today with my colleague from \nPennsylvania to introduce the Agricultural Marketing Success Act, \nlegislation that would amend the Agricultural Marketing Act, AMAA, of \n1937 by permitting identified tomato varieties operating under an \nenhanced U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, inspection and audit \nprogram, the Identity Program, to be exempt from marketing order \nrestrictions. Additionally, my House colleague from Pennsylvania, \nRepresentative Sherwood is submitting similar legislation.\n  This legislation would terminate the restrictions imposed on the Ugly \nRipe tomato, which is owned and produced by a Pennsylvania tomato \ncompany, by the Florida Tomato Committee, FTC. The FTC sets standards \npertaining to the shape of round tomatoes grown South and East of the \nSuwannee River and shipped out of Florida from October 10 through June \n15 of each year.\n  The impetus for this legislation began three years ago when the FTC \ngranted the Ugly Ripe tomato an exemption from the grade standards, \npertaining to size and shape, which resulted in robust sales \nnationwide. However, in the fourth year or growing season, the FTC \ndenied an exemption claiming that the Ugly Ripe did not meet the \nappropriate shape.\n  Once the FTC made its decision not to allow an additional exemption \nfor the Ugly Ripe, I was surprised to see that Cherry tomatoes, Roma \ntomatoes, and Grape tomatoes did continue to receive their exemptions. \nTherefore, I, along with my colleagues from Pennsylvania, met with USDA \nSecretary Mike Johanns to discuss the matter and requested that he \nreview the actions taken by the FTC and to use his\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\nauthority under the AMAA of 1937 to overrule the recommendation of the \nFTC and grant an additional exemption, which will permit the product to \nbe shipped interstate during the growing season. We were assured by \nUSDA a timely response and subsequently we are offering this \nlegislation to expedite their focus on this important issue. We hope \nour congressional support assists the Secretary in making his decision.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation, which \nwould allow the growers of the Ugly Ripe an opportunity to market their \nproduct without conforming to an unreasonable standard. It is my hope \nthat this legislation will evoke necessary changes in shape \nrequirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 532.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat a NADBank guarantee is not considered a Federal guarantee for \npurposes of determining the tax-exempt status of bonds; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto improve the effectiveness of the North American Development Bank \n(NADBank), which supports water and other important environmental \nprojects along the border region. My bill enhances the capabilities of \nthe NADBank by clarifying IRS rules in order to expand the ways it can \nhelp our communities.\n  The NADBank was created with a mandate to improve the quality of life \nalong the border by financing environmental related projects, such as \nwastewater treatment. The tools it was given have been limited, and as \na result has restricted its effectiveness. To address this issue, the \nNADBank has evolved over the years with a wider array of products to \noffer. Legislation I sponsored in the Senate during the last Congress \nand which became law, for example, allows the NADBank to offer a new \ncombination of grants and loans.\n  We can do more to reform the NADBank and increase its effectiveness. \nOne tool the NADBank can offer is loan guarantees, which communities \ncould use for debt they issue. The guarantee would increase the credit \nrating of the debt and result in lower interest rates the issuer would \nneed to offer, thereby making a project more affordable. Under current \nlaw, however, the NADBank's guarantee is considered a Federal subsidy. \nA general principle of Federal tax law is that one cannot receive more \nthan one Federal subsidy. Since communities will always prefer to \nreceive the benefit of a tax-exempt municipal status for their bonds, \nthey never take advantage of the NADBank's loan guarantee. Due to this \nsituation, the NADBank has never used its ability to guarantee a bond.\n  It does not make sense to consider a guarantee from the NADBank, \nwhich is an international institution, as a United States federal \ngovernment guarantee. Not only does it not make sense, it also inhibits \nthe NADBank's ability to help border communities. My bill addresses \nthis issue by clarifying the tax code to ensure a NADBank guarantee is \nnot considered a federal subsidy. The NADBank guarantees will be \ntreated like those from the Federal Housing Administration, the \nVeterans' Administration, and the Federal National Mortgage Association \nand other government-sponsored entities. This will give our border \ncommunities an important new tool to use as they address their \ninfrastructure and environmental needs.\n  It is to everyone's benefit to develop ways to improve the quality of \nlife for our citizens. This is particularly important along our \nsouthern border, which faces numerous challenges. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this bill and continue our efforts to make the NADBank as \neffective as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/04/senate-section/article/S2085-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 72--PROVIDING FOR MEMBERS ON THE PART OF THE SENATE \nOF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS \n                             ON THE LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S.
