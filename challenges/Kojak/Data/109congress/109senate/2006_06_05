Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4437, the \nHouse immigration bill; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and that \nthe text of S. 2611, as passed by the Senate, be substituted in lieu \nthereof, the bill be read the third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may make an observation, as the Democratic leader \nknows, under the procedure that the\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nSenator requested unanimous consent on, it is our understanding that \nthe bill might well be blue slipped. We are looking for a way to get \nthe immigration issue to conference in a way that will guarantee the \nconference can go forward. It will be a contentious conference, in any \nevent, but to make sure the conference can go forward in a way that \nguarantees we do not get derailed by some parliamentary technicality.\n  I offer a different unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent the \nSenate proceed to Calendar No. 326, H.R. 4096; provided further that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate-\npassed immigration bill be inserted in lieu thereof.\n  Further, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the regular order is to go \nto conference with the House using one or the other legislative \ncompanion as the vehicle.\n  The House acted first, no question about that. I am proposing to go \nto conference with the House using their bill. Some may argue that the \nHouse will blue slip the bill and return it to the Senate because it \ncontains some tax-related provisions. That will be the decision of the \nHouse. But it does not have to be that case since the Constitution \nstates:\n\n       All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     amendments, as on other bills.\n\n  We will be using their immigration bill, which originated in the \nHouse. We await their decision.\n  Anyone trying to use this blue-slip argument is doing so to avoid a \nconference on the immigration bill.\n  Further reserving the right to object, if the Republican leadership \nwants to take up the House-passed tax bill for purposes of moving to a \nconference on the immigration bill, we have amendments we would offer \nto that, and they are all tax matters. The recent tax reconciliation \nbill provided only 1 year of AMT relief; that is, for this year--\npresented with the tax bill on the Senate floor. Democrats would want \nto offer amendments to extend relief for at least one additional year \nand perhaps two, so that programs have certainty on the taxes they face \nthe next couple years.\n  We would also want a number of important popular tax provisions which \nexpired at the end of 2005 to be included, including, for example, the \nresearch and development tax credit, deductibility of the State and \nlocal estate tax, which is so important to Nevada, tuition tax credit, \nimportant to people trying to put their children through college, tax \ncredits for employers who provide jobs to individuals, and welfare.\n  We would also be concerned about what is happening with the estate \ntax. Other tax provisions from the bill also expire at the end of 2010, \nas does the estate tax relief. We would want to make sure the present \ntax relating to estates be continued well past 2010. Also expiring at \nthe end of 2010 is a 10-percent bracket that increases child credit and \nmarriage penalty relief. That should not be placed behind estate tax.\n  We have unnecessary subsidies for big oil, expanding health care \ncoverage, and, finally, energy independence. We would offer amendments, \nall tax related, to this proposal that the majority wants to bring to \nthe Senate.\n  For those and other reasons, I respectfully object to my friend's \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I might say to my good friend, the Democratic leader, \nall of the amendments the Senator referred to could be offered to the \ndeath tax which we expect to be on later in the week.\n  The American people did not send us here to try to engage in some \nkind of effort to embarrass the other Chamber. They want us to \nlegislate. We spent multiple weeks on the immigration bill. Both the \nDemocratic and Republican leaders are aware of who the conferees are. \nIt is time to move forward. We should not engage in some kind of \nparliamentary maneuver that is going to be completely lost on the \nAmerican people as they wonder why in the world we did not get about \nthe business of having the conference on a very challenging bill, the \nimmigration bill.\n  By the way, I personally was unaware that the leader was going to \noffer this objection today. I think we ought to talk about it later in \nthe afternoon and see if we cannot arrive at some way that is mutually \nagreeable to both sides to go on and get to conference. The Senate has \nacted. The House has acted. It is time to have a conference. I hope we \ncan do that sooner rather than later.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the distinguished senior Senator from \nKentucky. There shouldn't be games played on the immigration bill, but \nlet's face facts: 90 percent of the Democrats voted for the bill and--I \ndon't know the exact percentage--65 or 70 percent of the Republicans \nvoted against the immigration bill; we know 75 to 80 percent of the \nRepublicans in the House do not like the immigration bill.\n  If there were ever a time to take an immigration bill to conference, \nit would be now; it would be to take immigration bills to conference, \nnot tax bills.\n  Now, I don't think the bill is blue slippable. I read the \nConstitution, the provision of the Constitution that says tax measures \nmust originate in the House. We are willing to take up the House bill.\n  I also say that I certainly in no way meant to surprise the \ndistinguished leader. We alerted staff we were going to offer this \nunanimous consent request. I am sorry about that.\n  Anyway, we have an immigration bill. That is what should be taken to \nconference. That is what we should deal with, the immigration bill. Any \nexcuse to get out of taking an immigration bill to conference and \ntrying to substitute in its place a tax bill simply is wrong.\n\n\n                         The State of the World\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, gas prices are over $3 a gallon. Fill-ups at \nthe tank, of course, cause emptiness at the bank. This administration, \nthe most friendly to oil Presidency in our history, refuses to buck big \noil with the auto manufacturers. Our citizens are literally choking on \nthe lack of alternative fuel. Few incentives for energy created by the \nSun, the wind or the Earth's geothermal reserves has this \nadministration endorsed.\n  Raging in Iraq is an intractable war. Our soldiers are fighting \nvaliantly. But we have Abu Ghraib and Haditha, for example, where it is \nalleged that 24 more civilians were killed by our own, and no policy \nfor winning the peace. However, Secretary Rumsfeld continues in his job \nwith the full backing of the President--not a reprimand, not a \nsuggestion that his Defense Secretary is at fault; a national debt that \nPresident Bush won't acknowledge, but our children, their children, and \ntheir children's children will have to acknowledge with generations of \ndebt created by President Bush's economic policies; Federal red ink as \nfar as one can see. America is becoming continually more dependent on \nloans from China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and even England; a world \nchanging as we speak as a result of global warming, a condition our \nPresident does not acknowledge, let alone attempt to reverse.\n  Today, more than 46 million Americans have absolutely no health \ninsurance. Millions more of our countrymen have inadequate health \ninsurance. This administration has come forward with nothing of \nsubstance to address this national emergency.\n  Seniors in Nevada and each of the 50 States are struggling to \nsurvive. Some physicians refuse to take Medicare patients. The \nPresident's Medicare prescription drug plan has been a gift to HMOs, \ninsurance companies, and drug companies and a nightmare for seniors.\n  Education for many of our graduating high school seniors has become a \ngoal too far. Student loans and Pell grants are not a priority for the \nBush administration. The ability to obtain a college education is \nbecoming more and more based on how much money your parents have \ninstead of how much academic potential our youth have.\n  Crime remains a national worry, but money from the Federal Government \nto our States for crime fighting and crime prevention is being \ndrastically cut. Successful anticrime programs\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\nsuch as the COPS Program are being eliminated by President Bush, much \nto the consternation of police officers across America.\n  A trade policy that is continually ruining America's favorable \nbalance of payments seems to be the watchword of the Bush \nadministration. This trade policy causes America to be less and less \nglobally competitive.\n  The scientific community cries for help. They believe dread diseases \nsuch as Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's, Parkinson's, and diabetes could be \nmoderated and prevented. But President Bush emphatically says no to \nallowing scientists to study and research the healing powers of stem \ncells. He refuses to keep hope alive for the suffering people for our \ngreat country.\n  In spite of the many serious problems we have discussed, what is the \nSenate going to debate this week? A new energy policy? No. Will we \ndebate the raging war in Iraq? No. Will we address our staggering \nnational debt? No. Will we address the seriousness of global warming? \nNo. Will we address the aging of America? No. Will we address America's \neducation dilemma? No. Will we address the rising crime statistics? No. \nWill we debate our country's trade imbalance? No. Will we debate stem \ncell research? No. But what we will spend most of the week on is a \nconstitutional amendment that will fail by a large margin, a \nconstitutional amendment on same-sex marriage. It failed to pick up a \nsimple majority when we recently voted on it. Remember, an amendment to \nthe Constitution requires 67 votes.\n\n  I believe marriage should be between a man and woman. But I also \nbelieve in our Federal system of government described to me in college \nas a central whole divided among self-governing parts. Those self-\ngoverning parts, the 50 States, have already, in State after State \nafter State, decided on their own and others are deciding it as we \nspeak. For example, in Nevada, the constitution was amended to prevent \nsame-sex marriage.\n  Congress and President Clinton passed a law that gave the States the \nguarantee that their individual laws regarding marriage would be \nrespected. The Defense of Marriage Act creates an exception to the full \nfaith and credit clause of the Constitution so that no State can force \nits laws of marriage on another. So why are we being directed by the \nPresident and this Republican majority to debate an amendment to the \nConstitution, a document inspired more than two centuries ago? Why \nwould we be asked to change this American masterpiece? Will it next be \nto constitutionally dictate the cause of divorce or military service or \neven what America's religion must be?\n  For me, it is clear that the reason for this debate is to divide \nsociety, to pit one against another. This is another one of the \nPresident's efforts to frighten, to distort, to distract and confuse \nAmerica. It is this administration's way of avoiding the tough, real \nproblems American citizens are confronted with each and every day: high \ngas prices, the war in Iraq, the national debt, health care, senior \ncitizens, education, crime, trade policy, stem cell research--each \nissue begging the President's attention, each issue being ignored. The \nvaluable time of the Senate will be spent on an issue that today is \nwithout hope of passing.\n  These issues about which I have spoken are not Democratic issues. \nThey are not Republican issues. There must be a bipartisan effort to \naddress America's ills. I will vote no on the motion to proceed as it \nis not a measure meant to bring America together. Rather, it is an \neffort to cover and conceal issues necessary to make America more \ncompetitive, caring, considerate, and stronger.\n  Together, America can be better and do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to oppose S.J. \nRes. 1, known as the marriage amendment. I do believe marriage is a \nsacred institution between a man and a woman. I believe the Congress of \nthe United States has acted responsibly on the Defense of Marriage Act. \nIn 1996, it passed this body with only 14 dissenting votes. I believe \nthat does protect the institution of marriage.\n  I believe former Senator Barry Goldwater said it comprehensively and \nsuccinctly when he said that government ought to be kept off our backs, \nout of our pocketbooks, and out of our bedrooms. This is a matter which \nought to be left to the States, and the States are taking care of it.\n  Nineteen States now have constitutional amendments protecting \nmarriage solely between a man and a woman. Twenty-six other States have \nstatutes designed to protect traditional marriage by defining marriage \nonly as a union between a man and a woman. Five States have no \nstatutory or constitutional protection for traditional marriage, only \nfive: Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode \nIsland. The voters in seven States--Alabama, Idaho, South Carolina, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin--will vote on \nconstitutional amendments this year. Another five State legislatures--\nColorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania--are \nconsidering sending constitutional amendments to voters in 2006 or \n2008, and ballot initiatives are currently underway in three States--\nArizona, Florida, and Illinois. Six States--California, New Jersey, \nConnecticut, Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont--have adopted a domestic \npartnership or civil union law, each without any mandate from the \ncourts, except for in Vermont, where the State supreme court did \nintervene.\n  There are many lawsuits pending to work on this issue within the \ncontext of States' rights. Nine States face lawsuits challenging \ntraditional marriage--California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, \nNebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington. In four of \nthose States--California, Maryland, New York, and Washington--trial \ncourts have found a right to same-sex marriage in State constitutional \nprovisions relating to equal protection and due process, in each case \nrelying in part on the Massachusetts decision. State supreme courts \nwill decide appeals of those decisions, presumably in 2006 or 2007.\n\n  There are also a number of Federal cases involving this issue. In \nNebraska, a Federal district court found unconstitutional a State \nconstitutional amendment passed by 70 percent of Nebraska voters. The \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit heard arguments on the \nState's appeal in February of this year. Federal district court \nchallenges to the Federal Defense of Marriage Act are pending in \nWashington and Oklahoma, and cases were previously filed in Florida.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has emphatically and \nrepeatedly declared that marriage is a matter for the State courts. The \nSupreme Court recognized ``domestic relations as `an area that has long \nbeen regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States' '' in \nZablocki vs. Redhail in 1978.\n  In 1859, going back a century and a half, in Barber vs. Barber, the \nSupreme Court of the United States expressly ``disclaim[ed] altogether \nany jurisdiction in the courts of the United States upon the subject of \ndivorce. . . .''\n  Less than 20 years later, in Penoyer vs. Neff, 1878, the Court \nreaffirmed that the States have the exclusive right to define the \nrequirements of marriage and said that ``[t]he State . . . has [the] \nabsolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the marriage \nrelation between its own citizens shall be treated, and the causes for \nwhich it may be dissolved.''\n  The matter of marriage is solely within the province of States, as \nare the divorce laws. What would be next if this amendment is passed \ndealing with the States? Rules on child custody cases? Adoption \nregulations? Or probate laws to determine who is entitled to inherit \nproperty? Like these other issues, this is a quintessential matter for \nState control.\n  It is important to note that in the Defense of Marriage Act, there is \na specific provision that States need not\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\ngrant full faith and credit. The law specifies as follows:\n\n       No State shall be required to give effect to any public \n     act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State \n     respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex \n     that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other \n     State or a right or claim arising for such relationship.\n\n  So we have the law emphatically set out that the courts have \nconsistently held and the Supreme Court of the United States itself for \nmore than a century and a half has said that marriage is a matter for \nthe States. We know that when Massachusetts or any State acts to the \ncontrary, that the action of Massachusetts will not be entitled to full \nfaith and credit. We know that there are many lawsuits now litigating \nthis matter, so that the relationship of marriage is being adequately \nhandled by the States. If it should become necessary for the \nconsideration at a later date of a constitutional amendment to be \nconsidered, there would be ample time to do so.\n  It is important to note the avalanche of statements by highly \nrespected people in the tradition of what former Senator Goldwater \nsaid, that we ought to keep the government off our backs, out of our \npocketbooks, and out of our bedrooms, as a matter of privacy and as a \nmatter of tolerance--two very highly placed values in our society.\n  During the 2000 election campaign, Vice President Cheney had this to \nsay:\n\n       The fact of the matter is that we live in a free society, \n     and freedom means freedom for everybody . . . It is really no \n     one else's business in terms of trying to regulate or \n     prohibit behavior in that regard . . . I think states are \n     likely to come to different conclusions, and that's \n     appropriate.\n\n  That was the Vice President.\n  The distinguished conservative academic professor James Q. Wilson had \nthis to say:\n\n       The states should . . . decide about gay marriages . . . \n     Though I oppose gay marriage, voters in some states may \n     approve it. If they do, we will have a chance to learn what \n     it means in practice, with the costs and benefits falling on \n     people who have accepted it. Moreover, . . . since feelings \n     run high on this matter, it would be a mistake to let it be \n     decided as the right to abortion was decided. If there were \n     the gay marriage equivalent of Roe v. Wade or a \n     constitutional ban on it, we would infect the nation with the \n     divisive anger that followed Roe and our earlier attempt at \n     alcohol prohibition.\n\n  Professor Richard Epstein, University of Chicago Law School, had this \nto say in the Cato Institute's article, ``Live and Let Live'':\n\n       The question is whether ``the majority of the public \n     [should] impose its will on a minority within its midst in \n     the absence of any need for collective decision. The claim \n     for same-sex marriage is no weaker than any other claim of \n     individual rights on personal and religious matters . . . The \n     path to social peace lies in the willingness on all sides to \n     follow a principle of live-and-let-live on deep moral \n     disputes. Defenders of the illiberal Marriage Amendment \n     should look to their churches, not Congress and the states, \n     to maintain the sanctity of the marriage.\n\n  Professor Dale Carpenter at the University of Minnesota Law School, \npublishing in the Cato Institute Policy Analysis, had this to say:\n\n       An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a solution in \n     search of a problem . . . A constitutional amendment defining \n     marriage would be a radical intrusion on the nation's \n     founding commitment to federalism in an area traditionally \n     reserved for state regulation, [that is] family law.\n       There has been no showing that federalism has been \n     unworkable in the area of family law.\n\n  Richard Posner, the distinguished Federal judge in the Seventh \nCircuit said the solution for gay marriage ``is to submit it to social \nexperimentation. A great advantage of our Federal system is that it \nenables large-scale social experiments.''\n  The distinguished columnist, Andrew Sullivan, writing as the \nColumnist for the New Republic on the National Review Online, said the \nmarriage amendment ``tramples on any notion of federalism, . . . \negregiously violates States' rights, and . . . seeks to impose a \nuniform settlement on an entire country in perpetuity. The amendment is \nmore typical of the excesses of modern liberalism than anything vaguely \nconservative.''\n  George Will of the Washington Post put it succinctly, saying that the \nmarriage amendment ``is unwise for two reasons. Constitutionalizing \nsocial policy is generally a misuse of fundamental law. And it would be \nespecially imprudent to end State responsibility for marriage law at a \nmoment when we require evidence of the sort that can be generated by \nallowing the States to be laboratories of social policy.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest that the evidence and judgments against this \nmarriage amendment are powerful and overwhelming in terms of our \ntraditional view of tolerance, our traditional view of privacy. The \nfundamental concept of federalism reserves all power to the States and \nthe individuals that are not specifically granted to the Federal \nGovernment. This is especially so in a context like marriage, which is \na quintessential issue for determination by the States, like adoption, \nlike divorce, like child custody, like probate--these are all matters \nfor the State.\n  I brought this matter to the floor with the calculation that the \nJudiciary Committee ought not to bottle up matters, because the \nConstitution says these issues are to be decided by the Senate and not \nby the Judiciary Committee. We have an unfortunate precedent of the \nJudiciary Committee bottling up legislation, a precedent which the \nJudiciary Committee today will not follow. We will report such matters \nout, even where the individual Members voting may not agree with them. \nThat is a view that I have personally held as long ago as 1987 when I \nvoted to send Judge Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court to the floor \nof the Senate, even though I strongly objected to his confirmation as a \nSupreme Court Justice. But it seemed to me then, as it seems to me now, \nthat the Constitution requires that decision to be made by the full \nSenate.\n  In 1957, the Senate Judiciary Committee had no rules. The chairman of \nthe committee, James Eastland, wanted to bottle up civil rights \nlegislation, and he explained the inactivity of the Judiciary Committee \nas follows:\n\n       Well, a committee that has no rules, the Senate rules \n     govern. The Senate rules provide that to file a cloture \n     petition must be signed by 16 Senators. So we had an \n     unlimited debate in the Judiciary Committee. We had 15 \n     members, so there wasn't any way anyone could file a cloture \n     petition.\n\n  Accordingly, the civil rights bill was defeated by filibuster in \ncommittee.\n  After President Eisenhower introduced the bill that later became the \nCivil Rights Act of 1960, it eventually became was clear that Chairman \nEastland again would not release the civil rights bill from the \nJudiciary Committee. In order to get the bill to the floor, the civil \nrights bill was offered on the Senate floor on February 15, 1960, as an \namendment to a minor bill concerning the leasing of a surplus U.S. Army \nbuilding to a school district in Missouri. It is curious that the lease \nof a school building in Missouri would be the jurisdictional base for \nthe Civil Rights Act.\n  In 1964, in order to avoid Chairman Eastland's tactics, the Senate \nvoted 54 to 37 to bypass the Judiciary Committee altogether and place \nthe House bill directly on the Senate calendar. In the action when the \nJudiciary Committee voted S.J. Res. 1 out of committee last month, my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, noted that, unless we reported \nthe resolution out of Committee, it was going to be brought to the \nfloor under rule XIV, which is the leader's prerogative. Senator Leahy \nstated that he felt it preferable that the Judiciary Committee act in \nour traditional way and vote. I thanked him at the time and I thank him \nnow.\n  My view is that the matters ought not to be bottled up in committee, \nand the precedent cited about Chairman James Eastland, going back 40 \nyears ago, is ample precedent that matters ought to come to the Senate \nfloor.\n  It is my hope that this will not be a lengthy debate. We have \nconsidered this matter before and it carried votes only in the forties, \nfar short of the 60 necessary for cloture, and far short of the 67 \nnecessary to pass a constitutional amendment.\n  In the context where we have many pressing and important matters, it \nis my hope that our colleagues will come to the floor, debate the issue \nso that the Senate can work its will and we can proceed to other \nimportant matters for the United States Senate.\n  The chairman of the Constitutional Law Subcommittee, Senator Sam \nBrownback, will be in charge of managing the amendment for those who \nfavor. Senator Leahy and I can handle the management for those in \nopposition. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nColorado in the Chamber. I am about to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest to help start the lineup of people. Was he looking for a chance \nto speak?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, yes, I would like the opportunity to \nspeak. I would like to start off the debate, as far as Members are \nconcerned, if I might. Senator Brownback will be coming in on a later \nflight. I will help manage the floor, if that is OK with the chairman, \nfor those in favor until Senator Brownback arrives.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may comment, I thank the Senator from Colorado. \nThat would be fine for him to manage until Senator Brownback arrives.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the distinguished Senator from Colorado be recognized for \nwhatever remarks he wishes to make, and then that Senators Johnson and \nDorgan be recognized for such comments as they wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the amendment \npresently before us. There has been a lot of speculation in the paper \nabout whether this is on the schedule because of partisan politics. Of \ncourse, it is. The Republican leader has decided that today our \nNation's most pressing priority is a concern over committed \nrelationships between same sex couples. We have very little time left \nin this session that we are devoting to an amendment, which will go \nnowhere, when so many of us are trying to focus on solutions to high \ngas prices, something that hurts people in your State and mine; or the \nrising cost of health care, certainly a matter of great interest in my \nState; the ongoing situation in Iraq, a place where the Bush-Cheney \nadministration told us we would be welcomed as liberators and suggested \nwe would be out of there quickly. We have now been there almost as long \nas World War II, and the ending to World War II was far more obvious \nthan the ending in Iraq; or strengthening our national security. We are \nnot going to talk about any of those things. I think that is a \ntestament to the misplaced priorities of the Republican leadership. \nNews reports have clearly revealed how this proposed constitutional \namendment is being used to satisfy the most extreme right-wing \nsupporters of Republican politicians. I do not believe that Americans \nare well served by this strategy, a strategy that would divide rather \nthan unite Americans.\n  The Constitution is too important to be used for such a partisan \npolitical purpose. It is too important to make us dividers and not \nuniters. I agreed with First Lady Laura Bush when she recently told Fox \nNews that this proposed amendment should not ``be used as a campaign \ntool, obviously.'' Even so, obviously, that is exactly what Karl Rove \nand others in the Bush-Cheney administration are doing. That is why we \nonly vote on such partisan measures in the run-up to an election. \nApparently, high campaign season has arrived on the Republican leader's \ncalendar. Right on the heels of this campaign season bid to amend our \nConstitution, they are readying yet another constitutional amendment \nfor the floor.\n  Many people have aptly noted that this amendment would write \ndiscrimination into our Nation's Constitution. I agree. That is exactly \nwhat we are being asked to spend our time doing this week.\n  The Republican leadership's strenuous efforts to move this proposed \namendment to the Senate floor for debate shows how important it is to \nthe Republican leadership of the Senate to cater to the extreme right-\nwing and special interest groups agitating for a fight over this issue. \nThey intend to stir up an election year fight and use it as a \n``campaign tool'' and a ``political strategy.''\n  Right now, we should be addressing America's top priorities, \nincluding ways to make America safer, the war in Iraq, rising gas \nprices, rising health care and health insurance costs, stem cell \nresearch, or fixing FEMA, an organization that has fallen into almost \nincomprehensible misuse during this administration, and assisting our \nveterans whose privacy has been compromised by the neglect of the \nadministration's Veterans' Administration. Maybe we can talk about the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, which is something that \naffects every State in this country.\n  Instead, the President's political strategists and Senate allies are \ndoing their best to divide and distract the American people and the \nSenate from fixing real problems by pressing forward with this \ncontroversial proposed constitutional amendment.\n  As a nation, we are currently facing so many pressing issues, \nincluding the continuing sectarian violence in Iraq that is spiraling \nout of control, with the United States unable to stop it; the stunning \ninvestigations of this administration, indictments and convictions for \ngovernment corruption; or a complicated drug program that has been \ndropped into the laps of our seniors. We now find it so complicated \nthat it penalizes our seniors. It appears the only ones doing well \nunder the program are the pharmaceutical companies. How about a \nburgeoning national debt, where a family of four owes well over \n$100,000 just for the debt run-up by the Bush-Cheney administration? \nEvery time I stop at a gas station and fill up my car, all I hear from \npeople is: When is the Congress going to do something about these \nhistorically high gas prices? Of course, the largest theft of private \ninformation maintained by the Government was stolen under the Bush-\nCheney administration's watch, but we are not asked to debate that \nproblem. We even tried to find some corrective legislation to protect \nnot only our veterans, but now we find we need to protect tens of \nthousands of Active-Duty personnel from the negligence of this \nadministration. We are not asked to do anything to protect those \nveterans. No, we have to talk about this constitutional amendment.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee has been conducting hearings, but we have yet \nto get to the bottom of the Bush-Cheney administration's warrantless \nwiretapping and other programs utilized to gather information on \nAmericans, such as the e-mails on the Web sites we visit and even our \nconversations among families.\n  We need to make reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Voting \nRights Act a priority in the coming months of this season. We still see \npeople that are not allowed to vote in this country because of the \ncolor of their skin. We ought to be doing something to reauthorize the \nVoting Rights Act. If we want to hold ourselves up as a moral mirror to \nthe rest of the world, let's talk about things that affect a large part \nof the population of America.\n  But no, on the Senate floor, we don't talk about these things, even \nthough we are here to protect the rights of Americans--all Americans--\nno matter what color they might be. But instead we are being made to \nturn again to a divisive measure that will do nothing to correct the \nweakness in our homeland security, that will do nothing to enact a \nbudget the Republican Congress was supposed to, by law, enact months \nago. We will do nothing to stem the rising gas prices. We will do \nnothing to respond to the most pressing issues facing hard-working \nAmericans.\n  Some may remember proponents of the Federal marriage amendment in \n2004--coincidentally the last election year--could not assemble a \nmajority of Senators to even move to consider the proposed amendment, \neven though the Republicans controlled the Senate. Remember that in \n2004, we were warned immediate action was required to protect the \nfragile institution of marriage, which was said to be under immediate \nthreat. Of course, the real threats to marriage include adultery and \nunfaithfulness, desertion, pressures on a marriage that comes from \neconomic stresses, unhappiness, and spousal abuse. Does anybody want to \ndebate those on this floor? No. Would somebody like to put forward a \nconstitutional amendment to tell States they cannot be allowed to have \ndivorce laws? No. What about telling States what ages people can marry? \nNo. That would be interfering with the rights of States. We will do the \nwhole enchilada and tell them we will take over their State \nlegislatures.\n  Having been told the heavens are falling, we find in the past 2 \nyears, no\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\nStates have been forced to recognize same-sex marriages. In fact, \nseveral States voted to amend their State Constitutions to define \nmarriage. The Defense of Marriage Act, which we passed, defines \nmarriage as the union between a man and a woman for Federal purposes \nand prevents any States from being forced to recognize another State's \napproval of same-sex marriage. That is the law of the land. That \nbipartisan law has been upheld three times in Federal court. It is \nunder no threat of being overturned. So when the last election year \nrolled around, we were told there was a crisis, but there never was a \ncrisis then, nor is there now an imminent crisis that demands the \ndiversion of Congress's attention from all of these other urgent \nproblems or that justifies an alteration of our founding document to \nsay that States are no longer the ones in control of marriage. We will \nset a Federal law to tell the States of Tennessee and Vermont and every \nother State, we are taking over. Your legislatures can go home.\n  But unlike the Republican leadership of this Congress and the Bush-\nCheney administration, I trust our 50 States to define marriage and the \nrules of marriage as they always have. I trust our States a lot more \nthan the Republican leadership of this Congress or of the \nadministration.\n  I am sure we will continue to hear a lot of rhetoric about ``judicial \nactivism'' as the reason why we need to dramatically alter the U.S. \nConstitution. Even the President in his weekly radio address invoked \nthe notion of ``rogue judges'' that flaunt the law as a justification \nfor this drastic measure. This politically convenient criticism is \nsurprising. It is surprising, considering the fact that the majority of \nthose Federal judges he is so worried about were all appointed by \nRepublican Presidents. He doesn't even trust the judges the Republicans \nappointed. In fact, any judicial decision that was a dramatic departure \nfrom the status quo on this issue would certainly be appealed to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, where seven of the nine Justices on the Supreme \nCourt were appointed by Republican Presidents. Does anyone believe \nChief Justice Roberts is going to preside over a U.S. Supreme Court \nthat will override the law in this regard? And any State can define \nmarriage in their Constitution. When the Republican-controlled Supreme \nCourt of Massachusetts ruled that you could have same sex marriage, \nthey made it very clear that the State, of course, could amend their \nConstitution to change that.\n  In fact, the proposed Federal marriage amendment, now renamed the \nMarriage Protection Amendment, would itself produce a wide range of \nlitigation that judges--the very boogeymen that proponents of the \nproposed amendment demonize, would be required to resolve. It would be \nthe judges--these judges--these judges that the President and the \nRepublican leadership, all of these Republican judges they seem to \nfear, they are the ones who will be forced to resolve the ambiguities \nand meanings of these words if they are added to our Constitution.\n  The proposed language we are being required to consider is \nexceedingly confusing and subject to interpretation. It is inevitably \ngoing to create uncertainty. For example, who would be bound by the \nprovisions of the Marriage Protection Amendment? State actors, private \ncitizens or religious organizations? What would constitute the legal \nincidents of marriage? Can a legislature pass a civil unions law that \nmirrors its marriage law, so long as they do not call it marriage? Can \nthe people of a State put protections for civil unions in their State \nConstitution? What State actors are forbidden from construing their own \nConstitutions? Are we saying that a State supreme court could not \nconstrue its own Constitution or is it the State executive branch \nofficials that couldn't do it as well? We had hearings on these precise \nlanguage questions, and they were not resolved.\n\n  I am particularly concerned about the fate of the Vermont civil \nunions that have been formed under the color of State law. Despite an \ninitially wrenching debate, our State law remains on the books after 5 \nyears. There has been no ensuing crisis in the lives of Vermont \nfamilies. In fact, we have one of the lowest divorce rates in the \ncountry. But it is not clear to me why this constitutional amendment \nwould render Vermont's law invalid.\n  I started this afternoon by alluding to my agreement with the recent \nstatements of the First Lady that the Constitution should not be used \nfor political purposes. I agree with her statement, as I agreed with \nher sense that the President's ``bring it on'' language from the early \ndays of the Iraq occupation was not helpful, and certainly was actually \nfrightening to families who had somebody serving in the gulf. Starting \nthis last weekend we have seen that suddenly the President is involving \nhimself in this effort and is now prepared to endorse a specific \nconstitutional amendment on this divisive topic. I have written \nPresident Bush on more than one occasion to ask, OK, if you are going \nto endorse it, what language? What language would you propose?\n  In fact, my most recent letter was last month, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2006.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Senate may consider Senate Joint \n     Resolution 1, the so-called ``Marriage Protection \n     Amendment,'' during the week of June 5, 2006. I have written \n     to you on several occasions, most recently on October 27, \n     2005, requesting your views on specific proposals to amend \n     the Constitution to define marriage but you have not \n     responded.\n       Two years ago, you publicly acknowledged that ``states \n     ought to be able to have the right to pass laws that enable \n     people to be able to have rights like others.'' The proposed \n     constitutional amendment would prohibit ``the legal \n     incidents'' of marriage from being conferred upon same sex \n     couples. How is that language consistent with your position \n     that states should be able to pass laws giving committed same \n     sex couples the same legal rights as others?\n       Many feel that adopting this proposal would amount to \n     ``writing discrimination into the Constitution.'' Do you \n     support amending the United States Constitution with the \n     language of Senate Joint Resolution 1, a copy of which is \n     attached to this letter?\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Not surprisingly, those letters have gone unanswered. In \nfact, the administration didn't even send a representative to any of \nthe committee hearings that the Judiciary Committee had on this \namendment, nor did the administration comment on the specifics of the \ncurrent proposal or respond to questions about its language. The \ngeneral endorsement of the Bush-Cheney administration has been more in \nthe nature of a political campaign, more of a signal than of substance. \nWe could use a lot more substance up here and a few less signals.\n  The President's recent statements on Saturday and at the rally today, \nadjacent to the White House, remain general and vague. After the last \ncampaign and his reelection, the President indicated that he had no \nintention of including such an amendment among his administration's top \npriorities. He had no intention of pressing Congress to approve it. \nSuddenly, we are away from that election, we are approaching another \nelection. Golly gee whiz, what has changed? What has changed in that \ntime? Well, his standing in the public opinion polls, for one; or the \nagitation of the right-wing elements of his base, which he always \nresponds to.\n  I remember a time when leaving States in control of issues of family \nlaw was an easy decision for Members of both sides of the aisle to \nmake. It is disappointing that Senators would endorse this broadly \ndrafted amendment, which so clearly violates the traditions of \nFederalism and local control that many in this body have claimed to \nrespect and cherish.\n  As prominent conservative and former Congressman Bob Barr put it, \n``Marriage is a quintessential State issue. The Defense of Marriage Act \ngoes as far as is necessary in codifying the Federal legal status and \nparameters of marriage. A constitutional amendment is both unnecessary \nand needlessly intrusive and punitive.''\n  This reminds me of last year when we were called into emergency \nsession\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\nafter highly competent courts had thoroughly reviewed the medical \ndecisions in the Terry Schiavo case. They spent months, even years, \ndoing that. But we were called into emergency session, and the \nPresident flew back from his vacation so we could pass in a couple of \nhours something to overturn all those courts. We even had diagnoses \nmade from the floor of the Senate that she was not in a vegetative \nstate. This is a family tragedy. We should have left it alone instead \nof grandstanding--grandstanding--on a political issue where we are not \nabout to change anything. The American people saw through that \ngrandstanding. They realized this is something to be left to a family \ngoing through a terrible tragedy. As we know, she was in a vegetative \nstate; an irreversible vegetative state.\n  So I couldn't help but wonder: What has happened to conservatives who \nwould oppose the Federal Government's intrusion on the prerogatives of \nthe States? Where are those Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nstood up and said: Certain things are reserved to the States and we \nshouldn't intrude? The States have traditionally set the laws of \nmarriage. That has been a foundational principle in laws pertaining to \nour families from the beginning of this country. Why this sudden need \nto change that? Oh, I forgot. We have elections this fall, so we have \nto have an electioneering issue. The States determine what age you must \nbe in order to marry, whether you have to have your parents' permission \nand so on. The States have done that. They have done it quite well, and \nwe ought to let them continue doing it.\n  Most States are going to say marriage is between a man and a woman, \nas they always have. My own State of Vermont, because of our \nConstitution, was given a question: Would we support gay marriage in \nVermont? My State of Vermont said no. Instead, we have civil unions, \nwhich give gay couples legal rights of inheritance and hospital \nvisitation and other prerogatives. We made a pretty sensible decision. \nBut in Judiciary Committee hearings, there is strong disagreement that \nthis constitutional amendment could override Vermont's very sensible \ndecision.\n  But even beyond that, beyond any parochial thought, as a Senator, I \nam deeply concerned that this proposal is writing discrimination into \nthe Constitution. For the first time--for the first time in our \nNation's history, we would be amending the Constitution to narrow \nindividual rights and to federalize an issue of family law. Well, the \nsenior Senator from Vermont is a conservative when it comes to the \nConstitution and to conserving the Constitution.\n  How will this measure affect American families who currently exist in \nthis country whose members seek the protection of civil unions and the \nacknowledgment of their committed relationships? How will it affect \nchild support enforcement or even inheritance and insurance benefits? I \nhope those who claim to care about families will turn away from wedge \npolitics and scapegoating and discrimination. Instead, we should join \ntogether to work on the many pressing issues already piling up on \nCongress's agenda--issues we don't take time for, such as health care, \ngas prices, pensions, Iraq, paying for college education, and raising \nthe minimum wage. Are we so afraid to tackle these real issues which \naffect all Americans, that we can only attempt to bring up issues that \ncan be used in this fall's elections?\n\n  Last month, President Bush spoke eloquently about this country and \nour values when he spoke about immigration, and I praised the President \nfor his speech. He emphasized something I wish this White House and the \nRepublican leadership in the Congress would keep in mind in connection \nwith their efforts to demonize gay and lesbian Americans. The President \nsaid:\n\n       We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to \n     anger, or playing on anyone's fears or exploiting the issue \n     of--\n\n  And here I insert ``marriage'' for ``immigration''--\n\n     for political gain.\n\n  President Bush continued by saying:\n\n       We must always remember that real lives will be affected by \n     our debates and decisions, and that every human being has \n     dignity and value. . . .\n\n  I agree. My religion taught that, and I believe that every human \nbeing has dignity and value. Mean-spirited rhetoric does not serve this \nNation or its diverse population. Our Nation would be better served if \nwe refrained from divisiveness that is wielded like a weapon in order \nto score political and emotional points before an election.\n  As an American who has been married 44 years, I am a great fan of the \ninstitution of marriage. I believe it is important to encourage and to \nsanction committed relationships, and I respect the people of my State \nfor the careful manner in which they resolved this matter by \nrecognizing civil unions. They recognized, as my predecessor, the \nsenior Senator from Vermont, Robert Stafford, a wonderful \nquintessential New England Republican, did when he spoke of well over \n60 years of marriage. He spoke about how the love of his wonderful wife \nHelen, made him a better person, and how their committed relationship \nmade him better.\n  Lower the rhetoric. Those who want to score points for this fall are \ndenigrating people of committed relationships. Senator Stafford was \nright when he said that people who love make each other better people. \nDon't we all benefit from that? We have in Vermont. I know I would not \nhave accomplished any of the things I have accomplished in life without \nthe strong support and love of my wife, Marcelle. We have done this for \n44 years.\n  Let's look inward, each of us, to ourselves. Let's make sure we are \nliving our lives the way we should before we tell the rest of the \ncountry how to live theirs. And let's be real--the actions in Vermont \ndo nothing to diminish or threaten marriages in Vermont or any other \nState.\n  For these reasons, I will continue to oppose measures such as this \nproposed constitutional amendment. I continue to urge that we solve the \nproblems facing this Nation and stop the political pandering for this \nfall's elections. Let's get on and do something real. Let each of us be \na person who is not going to try to control the lives of everyone else \nin this country. The distinguished chairman quoted Senator Goldwater in \nthat respect. He was right. The Senate is wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that our \nspeaking sequence be alternated between those who speak in favor of the \namendment and those who speak against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I don't want to, does \nthe Senator have the name of who is going to go between Senator Johnson \nand Senator Dorgan?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No, I don't. We have already agreed to it. I don't want \nto amend that. I think we would plan to meet that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Following that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I was going to say following those, we can alternate back \nand forth.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is the way we normally have done it. I \nthink it works best. The Senator from Colorado certainly is respecting \nthat tradition, and I would agree with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to start what I hope will be a \nconstructive debate on my amendment, S.J. Res. 1, known as the marriage \nprotection amendment. I think at this point in the debate it is \nimportant that we carefully review what is said in the amendment and \nwhat the intent of the amendment is. It reads:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That is the first sentence. The second sentence says:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  Now, what does that mean. Let's break it down. And that is what this \nchart does that I have before us. It says simply that we are going to \nhave a uniting, uniform definition of marriage throughout the United \nStates. And then the second sentence, it guarantees that the courts \ncannot force States or\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\nthe Federal Government to grant any of the rights, benefits, or other \nincidents of marriage to any union other than that of a man and woman. \nLegislatures and the people will continue to have the power to grant \nwhatever rights or benefits they choose through the democratic process.\n  Definition of marriage: This first sentence prohibits courts and \nlegislatures from changing the definition of marriage. The second \nsentence further prohibits the courts from creating civil unions or \ndomestic partnerships or granting the right or benefits of marriage. \nBut it doesn't interfere with private contracts between a business or a \nprivate entity of some type.\n  The legislatures can do the following things. They can create civil \nunions or domestic partnerships. They can grant the rights and benefits \nof marriage--the second sentence of this amendment--and again it \ndoesn't affect employment benefits offered by private businesses. What \nwe are trying to protect is the State legislatures from having their \nlegislation and the people's legislation within their State overturned \nby an unelected branch of Government, the courts.\n  Before making my formal comments and going any further, I would like \nto express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues who have cosponsored \nthis amendment. It has taken countless hours of study and discussion to \nget to this point, and each of our 31 cosponsors has shown courage and \ncommitment to protecting marriage.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the majority leader \nfor his commitment and leadership. Without the support of the Senate \nleadership, the public may never have had an opportunity to address \nthis vitally important issue in a democratic body.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Specter, who has ably reported it out of \nthe committee to the floor for debate.\n  Marriage, the union between a man and a woman, has been the \nfoundation of every civilization in human history. The definition of \nmarriage crosses all bounds of race, religion, culture, political \nparty, ideology, and ethnicity. Marriage is embraced and intuitively \nunderstood to be what it is. Marriage is a union between a man and a \nwoman.\n  As an expression of this cultural value, the definition of marriage \nis incorporated into the very fabric of civil policy. It is the root \nfrom which families and communities are grown. Marriage is one bond on \nwhich all other bonds are built.\n  Marriage is not some controversial ideology being forced upon an \nunwilling population by the Government. It is, in fact, the opposite. \nMarriage is the ideal held by the people, and the Government has long \nreflected this. The broadly embraced union of a woman and a man is \nunderstood to be the ideal union from which people live and children \nbest blossom and thrive.\n  As we have heard in hours of testimony, in eight hearings, in \nnumerous Senate committees over the last several years, marriage is a \npretty good thing. A good marriage facilitates a more stable community, \nallows kids to grow up with fewer difficulties, increases the lifespan \nand quality of life of those involved, reduces the likelihood of \nincidences of chemical abuse and violent crime, and contributes to the \noverall health of the family. It is no wonder so many single adults \nlong to be married, to raise kids, and to have families.\n  Today, there are numerous efforts to redefine marriage to be \nsomething that it is not. Marriage is and it always has been a union \nbetween a man and a woman.\n  I believe the Framers of the Constitution felt that this would never \nbe an issue, and if they had, it would have been included in the U.S. \nConstitution. Like the vast majority of Americans, it would have never \noccurred to me that the definition of marriage or marriage itself would \nbe the source of controversy. Not too long ago, it would have been \nwholly inconceivable that this definition, this institution of marriage \nwould be challenged, redefined, or attacked. But here we are today \nbecause of it. Make no mistake about it, traditional marriage is under \nassault. I say assault because the move to redefine marriage has taken \nplace not through the democratic process such as State legislatures and \nthe Congress or ballot issues around the Nation; this assault has taken \nplace in our courts and often in direct conflict with the will of the \npeople, State statutes, Federal statutes, and even State constitutions.\n  Activists and lawyers have devised a strategy to use the courts to \nredefine marriage. This strategy is a clear effort to override public \nopinion and the longstanding composition of traditional marriage and to \nforce same-sex marriage on society.\n  Over the course of the last 15 years, traditional marriage laws have \nbeen challenged in courts across the Nation. Alaska, Arizona, \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West \nVirginia have all seen traditional marriage challenged in court.\n  As we speak, nine States face lawsuits challenging traditional \nmarriage laws--California, Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New \nJersey, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington. Marriage is under attack \nall across the country. If it hasn't already, an attack on marriage is \ncoming to a State near you.\n  The first success in the activists' coordinated legal strategy was in \nVermont in 1999. The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that all the rights \nand benefits of civil marriage must be extended to same sex couples. \nUnder threat of court-imposed same sex marriage, the Vermont \nlegislature created same-sex ``civil unions.''\n  The second, and to date the most widely covered success in the effort \nto destroy traditional marriage, came more recently in the state of \nMassachusetts where four judges ruled in the Goodridge case that \nmarriage itself must be redefined to include same-sex couples, and that \ntraditional marriage laws were a ``stain'' on the State constitution \nthat must be ``eradicated.'' This edict came despite the fact that the \npopulace of Massachusetts opposed this redefinition of marriage and \ndespite the fact that no law had ever been democratically passed to \nauthorize such a radical shift in public policy.\n  Proponents of same-sex marriage have shopped carefully for the right \nvenues, exploited the legal system, and today stand ready to overturn \nany and all democratically crafted Federal or State statute that would \nstand between them and a new definition of humanity's oldest \ninstitution.\n  The question of process is very important in this debate--it is in \nfact the very heart of this debate. While recent court decisions handed \ndown by activist judges may not respect the traditional definition of \nmarriage, these decisions also highlight a lack of respect for the \ndemocratic process. No State legislature has passed legislation to \nredefine the Institution of marriage--not one. Any redefinition of \nmarriage has been driven entirely by the body of government that \nremains unaccountable and unelected--the courts.\n  Some of my colleagues do not feel we should be talking about marriage \nin the Senate. I say we must. Our Government is a three branch \ngovernment. The Congress is the branch that represents the people most \ndirectly. We have a duty to, at the very least, discuss the state of \nmarriage in America. If we do not take this up, we abdicate our \nresponsibility. We will allow the courts sole dominion on the state and \nfuture of marriage. This Senate, the world's most deliberative body, \nmust provide a democratic response to the courts.\n  Legislatures across the country have joined the Congress in recent \nyears in affirming a 1996 law called the Defense of Marriage Act, or \nDOMA. DOMA is a limited law designed to address two distinct issue: No. \n1, forced interstate recognition, and No. 2, the definition of marriage \nfor the purposes Federal law. This bipartisan legislation passed with \nthe support of more than three-quarters of the House of Representatives \nand with the support of 85 Senators before being signed into law by \nthen President Bill Clinton.\n  To date, 45 States have also passed laws to protect traditional \nmarriage, including 19 States that have constitutional amendments \nprotecting traditional marriage as solely between a man and a woman. \nVoters in seven\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\nStates--Alabama, Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, \nVirginia, and Wisconsin--will vote on constitutional amendments this \nyear. Another five State legislatures--Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, \nMassachusetts, and Pennsylvania--are considering sending constitutional \namendments to voters in 2006 or 2008, and ballot initiatives are \ncurrently underway in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois.\n\n  These state DOMAs and constitutional amendments, combined with \nFederal DOMA, should have settled the question as to the democratic \nexpression of the will of the American public. However, Federal and \nState DOMAs, as well as State constitutional amendments--all reflecting \nthe will of the people--are being challenged in the courts.\n  The Federal DOMA is itself under attack. Activists have challenged \nDOMA's interstate recognition provision in the Ninth Circuit. The \nsecond part of DOMA, the part defining marriage for Federal purposes, \nwas also challenged in the Ninth Circuit, as well as in Federal cases \npending in Oklahoma and Washington State. Plaintiffs in each case argue \nthat the U.S. Constitution's equal protection and due process clauses \nrequire the recognition of same-sex marriages, and that efforts to \nlimit marriage to the union of a man and a woman for purposes of \nfederal law are unconstitutional.\n  Because DOMA only clarifies that the Constitution's Full Faith and \nCredit clause should not be read to require interstate recognition, \nDOMA will not prevent an activist judge from finding that the equal \nprotection or due process clauses require it. In other words, DOMA does \nnot prevent any court from recognizing out-of-State marriages; it \nmerely removes one of several rationales that a court could use to do \nso. DOMA is not, nor was it designed to be, a comprehensive solution to \njudicial activism on same-sex marriage.\n  Likewise, State constitutional amendments are under attack in Federal \ncourt. For example, in Nebraska, a Federal district court in 2005 found \nunconstitutional a State constitutional amendment passed by 70 percent \nof Nebraska voters. While this cases is on appeal to the Eight \nCircuit--and we hope the decision will be correctly overturned--I find \nit chilling that the will of an entire State, expressed democratically, \nmay be undone by a Federal judge in an unelected position and tenured \nfor life.\n  State constitutional amendments are also under attack in State court. \nJust last month, a Georgia judge found unconstitutional a State \nconstitutional marriage amendment that was approved by 76 percent of \nthe voters. Immediately after it was passed by an overwhelming majority \nof voters in 2004, activists launched an attack in the courts. The \nresult--the amendment being thrown out on procedural grounds--is yet \nanother success for the handful of activists seeking to suppress the \nwill of the people through the courts.\n  The national effort to redefine marriage has also been buoyed by \ndecisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court. In June 2003, the Court \ninferred that a right to same-sex marriage could be found in the U.S. \nConstitution in Lawrence v. Texas. A variety of experts, including \nJustice Scalia and Harvard Professor Lawrence Tribe, forecast that this \ndecision points to the end of traditional marriage laws--including \nFederal and State DOMAs. The Massachusetts court relied heavily on the \nLawrence decision to strike down that State's traditional marriage law \nin the Goodridge case.\n  When Goodridge took effect in May of 2004, same-sex couples became \nentitled to Massachusetts marriage licenses. In anticipation of \nGoodridge, a handful of local officials in New York, California, and \nOregon began issuing licenses to same sex couples in February and \nMarch. To date, through the combined efforts of lawless local officials \nand those licenses issued in Massachusetts, couples from at least 46 \nStates have received licenses in those jurisdictions and returned to \ntheir home States. These 46-plus States are state and Federal DOMA \nchallenges just waiting happen.\n  More of these cases are expected and we will be left with an \nunworkable patchwork marriage laws, crafted by judges and forced on to \non State from another, outside the democratic process, regardless of \nthe will of the voters.\n  As a result of this coordinated campaign to redefine marriage through \nthe courts, we stand here today, compelled by respect for the \ndemocratic process, to publicly debate an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. Again, this amendment simply reads:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The first sentence is straightforward: it defines marriage as an \ninstitution solely between one man and one woman--just as it has been \ndefined for thousands of years in hundreds of cultures around the \nworld.\n  The second sentence simply ensures that the people or their elected \nrepresentatives, not judges, can decide whether to confer the legal \nincidents of marriage on people. Citizens remain free to act through \ntheir legislatures to bestow whatever benefits to same-sex couples that \nthey choose. It is aimed squarely at the problem of judicial activism.\n  Just as important as what it does do, is what it does not do. I have \nsaid it time and time again and I say here again today for the record--\nthe amendment does not seek to prohibit, in any way, the lawful, \ndemocratic creation of civil unions or domestic partnerships. It does \nnot prohibit private employers from offering benefits to same-sex \ncouples. It denies no existing rights.\n  What our amendment does is to define and protect traditional marriage \nat the highest level--the U.S. Constitution. Importantly, the \nconsideration of this amendment in the Senate represents the discussion \nof marriage in America in a democratic body of elected official. I am \nnot willing to surrender this issue to the courts.\n  I also feel it is important to make clear that on the question of \nfederalism and States' rights I stand where I always have. While an \nindisputable definition of marriage will be a part of our Constitution, \nall other questions will be left to the State.\n  Gregory Coleman, former solicitor general of the State of Texas \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution \nand made the following statement on this matter:\n\n       Some have objected to a proposed constitutional amendment \n     on federalism grounds. These concerns are misplaced. The \n     relationship between the States and the Federal government is \n     defined by the Constitution and a fortiori, a constitutional \n     amendment cannot violate principles of federalism and State's \n     rights. A Federal constitutional amendment is perhaps the \n     most democratic of all processes--because it requires \n     ratification by three-fourths of the States--and simply does \n     not raise federalism concerns. The real danger of State's \n     rights comes from the recognition of un-enumerated \n     constitutional rights in which the States have had no \n     participation.\n\n  I share those sentiments and cannot express them any more clearly. We \nstand today at the threshold of the most democratic, most federalist \nprocess in all our Government. As designed by the Framers of the U.S. \nConstitution, the amendment process is neither an exclusive Federal nor \nan exclusively State action: It is a shared responsibility of both.\n  Contrary to assertions of those who believe my amendment infringes on \nthe rights of the States my amendment actually protects States' rights. \nForty-five States have spoken with laws or constitutional amendments \ndesigned to protect traditional marriage. Unfortunately, same-sex \nadvocates have, through the courts, systematically and successfully \ntrampled on laws democratically enacted in the States. My amendment \ntakes the issue out of the hands of a handful of activist judges and \nputs it squarely back in the hands of the States.\n  Now is the time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility and send a \nconstitutional amendment to the States.\n  Marriage, the union between a man and a woman, has been the \nfoundation of every civilization in human history. This definition of \nmarriage crosses all bounds of race, religion, culture, political \nparty, ideology and ethnicity. It is not about politics or \ndiscrimination, it is about marriage and democracy.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Constitution is being amended to reflect a \nnew definition of marriage--not by democratically elected Members of \nCongress but\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\nby unaccountable and unelected judges. If we fail to define marriage, \nthe courts will not hesitate to do it for us.\n  I, for one, believe that the institution of marriage and the \nprinciples of democracy are too precious to surrender to the whims of a \nhandful of unelected, activist judges.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Marriage Protection \nAmendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I find it simply astonishing that with \nthe very limited time we have remaining in this congressional session \nthis Senate finds itself failing to spend its time debating education, \naffordable health care, veterans, gas and energy prices, job creation, \nor the exploding Federal budget deficit and instead, as part of what \ncan only be viewed as an extraordinarily cynical political charade, we \nwill devote our time to debate the marriage protection amendment, an \namendment to our national Constitution that has been overwhelmingly \ndefeated in the past and which continues to be opposed from groups \nranging from liberal to the far right libertarian, as well as by \nreligious organizations, including my own ELCA Lutheran Church.\n  Could it be that there are those who do not want to talk about the \nreal issues facing American families because their inaction has \nresulted in collapsing poll numbers and declining public support and \nthey now feel a desperate need to change the subject?\n  The lengths that some people will go to pander on this issue is, \nfrankly, shameful. There are ads currently running in my State claiming \nthat I must not care about children having a mother and a father. How \nfoolish. How sad. My wife Barbara, a social worker, and I will \ncelebrate our 37th wedding anniversary tomorrow. We have three \nwonderful children and three beloved young grandchildren. Barbara and I \nare both former Sunday school teachers, and we have each in our own way \ndevoted our careers to public service which advances the interests of \nfamilies and particularly of children--and decent wages and farm \nincomes, affordable health care, affordable housing, high quality and \naffordable education, a truly profamily Tax Code, opposition to budget \ndeficits which will have to be paid by our children and our \ngrandchildren, advancing the cause of adoptions, advancing the programs \nwhich serve the needs of low-income expectant mothers and their early \nchildhood needs. Ironically, these are all efforts which have largely \nbeen opposed by those who today tout the need for a marriage protection \namendment.\n  How cynical is that?\n  I oppose gay marriage--and I voted in favor of the Defense of \nMarriage Act enacted years ago by this Congress. But marriage law in \nits details have been left to the respective States since the very \nbeginning of our Nation, and there is no need today to speculate about \nwhat future courts may or may not do. There is no need today to strip \nthese rights away from the States and to deny States the right even to \ninterpret their own constitutions.\n  My State of South Dakota has already enacted antigay marriage law and \nhas taken up a possible State constitutional amendment to that effect. \nBut that is where the debate ought to take place--in South Dakota and \nother States, not here in DC.\n  I must add that this debate reminds me somewhat of an old children's \nfable where a child noted that the emperor has no clothes when all the \nadults around him were reluctant to similarly point out the obvious.\n  Very frankly, the sanctity of my 37-year marriage is less at risk \nfrom gays than from ordinary heterosexuals who are behind high divorce \nrates, domestic abuse, and irresponsible refusal to provide for child \nsupport. Gay individuals seeking some legal structure in which to \nmaintain a stable and loving relationship as opposed to promiscuity is \nless of a threat to my wife and I than public policy out of this \nCongress which works against the real needs of South Dakota families--\ninvolving decent wages, childcare, health insurance, and affordable \nhousing.\n  How wonderful would it be if we were here today talking about \nstrategies that could strengthen our families and our communities, that \nwould focus on the real needs of children rather than using them as a \npawn in a cynical election-year charade.\n  The American Constitution ought to be rarely amended--as all the \ngenerations of American leaders who served in this body understood. \nWhen it is amended, it ought to expand opportunity and freedom, and it \nought to be consistent with being profamily in a real and serious way. \nThere is a place for debate over gay marriage, but in South Dakota that \ndebate ought to take place in Pierre and through public debate on the \nState constitution. All roads should not lead to Washington, DC.\n  This Senate should once again resoundingly and in a thoughtful, \nbipartisan manner reject the pending amendment to our Nation's most \nsacred civil document, our United States Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand there is a previous \nagreement that Senator Durbin was to speak at this point in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Dorgan was \nto be recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will yield the floor when he arrives \nat a timely point. I want to get started on this debate. Time is short \nand the issues are important.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment. I \nchair the Constitution Subcommittee from which it came through. I am \nalso on the Judiciary Committee from which it came through.\n  This is a critically important topic. It is about, fundamentally, two \nissues.\n  No. 1, it is about who is going to define marriage in America--not \nwhether marriage is going to be defined. It is about who is going to \ndefine marriage in America. Is it going to be defined by the courts \nthat have started this debate or is it going to be defined by \nlegislatures and legislative bodies across the country?\n  That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, and at the very center of this, is how we will raise our next \ngeneration of children.\n  That is fundamental to this debate--how we raise that next generation \nof children. We are going to talk a lot about that.\n  I have a number of statistics that we are going to share. It hinges \non what happens in that first debate. Who is going to define it? \nDefined by the legislature? Defined by the Judiciary? And No. 2, what \nhappens to the children? It was the central question of Senator \nMoynihan while he was in this body before he passed away, that we \nshould always be concerned about centrally how you raise that next \ngeneration of Americans. That is a core, that is a principle, that is \nsomething you always have to keep your eye on, and that hinges in this \ndebate.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota on the floor who has recognition \nunder the previous agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback.\n  Mr. President, we come on a Monday to the floor of the Senate to \ndiscuss public policy and important issues. And today the majority \nleader has brought to us a proposed constitutional amendment. It is the \nfirst of what I believe will be two constitutional amendments that will \nbe considered by the Senate for the next 7 or 10 days. That is not \nunusual. In fact, I had someone go back and check to see how many \nproposed amendments to the United States Constitution have been offered \nhere on the floor of the Senate or in the U.S. House, or at least \noffered in bill forms. I discovered that in recent Congresses that \nthere were I believe something like 76 proposed amendments to the \nConstitution. In another year, there were 67 proposed amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  The Constitution has not been amended except for the first 10 \namendments which were the Bill of Rights. Outside of the Bill of \nRights, the Constitution has been amended 17 times in nearly 220 \nyears--17 times in more than two centuries.\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\n  The reason for that is most people believe that we ought to amend the \nConstitution only rarely, and then only when it is urgently necessary \nand only when it is the last resort. We have had a lot of different \nproposals to change the Constitution. There was a proposal to change \nthe Constitution to provide that the Presidents of the United States \nfor one term shall come from the North and then shall be succeeded by a \nPresident who comes from the South. That was a proposed amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  Fortunately, for our country, not many of these ideas over all of \nthese many, many years have been adopted by the U.S. Congress and by \nState legislatures, which is required in order to amend the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  The Constitution for this country was written by 55 white men. It was \nin a room in Philadelphia. In that room in Philadelphia, if you go to \nvisit today, you will see the chair that George Washington sat in at \nthe front of the room. George Washington chaired the Constitutional \nConvention. You will see where Ben Franklin sat, where Madison sat, \nwhere Mason sat. Those 55 men wrote a Constitution in a hot \nPhiladelphia summer period and presented it then to the country. It was \nreally a quite remarkable Constitution. It begins: ``We the People.''\n  In the writing of the Constitution, they created a framework for this \nnew kind of government which has become over the last two centuries the \nmost successful democracy or representative government in the history \nof humankind. We have lived only a blink of that history. And, yet, \nduring that period this is the most successful democracy on the face of \nthe Earth.\n  Two-hundred years after the writing of the Constitution, there was a \ncelebration in that same room. I was one of the fortunate ones to go to \nthat celebration representing one of the 55. These 55 people were men \nand women and minorities. It wasn't 55 men as existed in that room when \nthey wrote the Constitution. The 55 people who celebrated in that room \nthe 200th birthday of the Constitution--it was really quite a \nremarkable event. I sat in that room thinking about the history, \nthinking about George Washington sitting at the front in that chair \nwith the piece of wood that is decorated as the sun on the back of that \nchair.\n  I thought to myself: What a remarkable thing it was for me, coming \nfrom a town of 300 people, from ranching and wheat country in \nsouthwestern North Dakota, from a high school with a senior class of \nnine students, and here I am sitting in the room where George \nWashington presided over the writing of the Constitution for this new \ncountry of ours.\n  I tell that story only because it is important for us to understand \nthe circumstances of amending the Constitution.\n  Today, we have on the floor of the Senate a proposal to amend the \nConstitution with a constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay \nmarriage.\n  Next week, we will have a constitutional amendment that would prevent \ndesecrating the American flag or give the States the ability to prevent \nflag desecration.\n  On the issue of gay marriage, I voted as a Member of the U.S. Senate \nfor a 1996 act called the Defense of Marriage Act. I did that because \nit creates for Federal law a definition of what marriage is. It defines \nmarriage as a union between a man and a woman, husband and wife. That \nis Federal law. I supported that. I was happy to support that. That is \nwhat I believe.\n  I don't believe we should be altering the U.S. Constitution. I don't \nbelieve we should be amending the basic framework of our democracy on \nthis subject. The current law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which the \nFederal Government passed in 1996, still stands today.\n  I see no reason to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n  This past week in my State an organization called Focus on the Family \nran a newspaper advertisement taking up the large part of a page in \ndaily newspapers. It says: Senator Dorgan does not believe that a child \nneeds both a father and a mother.\n  They also ran the same language in radio ads in my State.\n  Now this organization--I am not familiar with them--must think there \nare 9 commandments. There are actually 10 commandments. This must be an \norganization that has forgotten the commandment that says: Thou shall \nnot bear false witness. My hope is they might go back and review that. \nThere is nothing in my record that suggests I don't care whether a \nchild has a mother and a father.\n  This is a legitimate discussion we are having about a constitutional \namendment. The issue of gay marriage is an important and legitimate \nissue to discuss. But one would think it is also worthy of \norganizations on both sides to be truthful in that discussion. That, \nregrettably, at least in this case that I have cited, has not been the \ncase.\n  This issue of amending the U.S. Constitution is clearly before the \nSenate because it is an even-numbered year. The even-numbered year is \none in which the late Claude Pepper used to say the American people \nhave the miracle of grabbing the American steering wheel and deciding \nwhich direction they want to nudge our great country. It is, after all, \nthe American people who are in charge and the American people who will \nmake decisions about the direction of our country.\n  This is an even-numbered year. We understand why this issue is before \nthe Senate. It is about an election this fall. I am not saying it is an \nunimportant issue; I am saying that the notion of having to amend the \nbasic framework of our government, amending the Constitution, that is a \npolitical debate aimed at this fall, not this week.\n  But let me talk just for a moment not about the issue of gay \nmarriage. We have addressed that. I supported addressing it in the \nDefense of Marriage Act. I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, voted \nfor a definition that a marriage is between a husband and wife, a man \nand woman. That has already been done.\n  So let me talk about what we could be doing today and tomorrow and in \nthe next week and a half or 2 weeks instead of the agenda given us by \nthe majority leader. There are some people pretty dispirited about this \nCongress. Because the polling says this Congress is not very well \nthought of, we conclude the American people are kind of dispirited \nabout the agenda, about what we are doing. We have a lot of trouble.\n  We have federal debt up to our neck, and there is more to come. The \nPresident is offering us budgets with the largest deficit proposals in \nhistory--this from a President who described himself as a conservative. \nBut that is not what his budgets are about.\n  We have the highest trade debt in annual deficits in the history of \nthis country, dangerous trade deficits, $702 billion last year. Add the \nincrease to the national debt from a budget standpoint to the trade \ndebt, and we are $1.4 trillion out of balance. Let me say that again: \nWe are out of balance $1.4 trillion in a year. Does anyone seem to care \nabout that? Is there the urgency to deal with that as we have for \nconstitutional amendments? I don't think so.\n  Fiscal policy, trade policy, foreign policy--we have serious foreign \npolicy issues and problems. Health care: add up the challenges we face \nand ask yourself: What are we doing about these challenges? Do we have \nthese issues on the floor of the Senate? Not that I can see.\n  It won't be very long--in fact, it is happening now--that we have \npeople who are now paying for prescription drug coverage, a monthly \npremium, but who no longer get prescription drug coverage because of \nwhat has been legislatively defined as a doughnut hole. In other words, \nthey lose coverage for a significant period of time, but they should \nstill pay the premiums. Maybe we should have that on the floor of the \nSenate and fix that.\n  We could fix that easily. There is a study that shows we could fix \nthat by simply removing the perverse provision in that act that \nprohibits the Federal Government from negotiating lower drug prices \nwith the pharmaceutical industry. We could fix that so-called doughnut \nhole, or fix the problem of people having no health care prescription \ndrug coverage through Medicare at the same time they are required every \nmonth to pay premiums. Would that be an advisable thing to do? I think \nit would.\n  We are going to also be debating the death tax. I heard on the \nopening portion of the Senate that the death tax is\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\ngoing to be repealed. It may be a surprise to those who are still \nalive, but there is no death tax. There is no death tax. The term \n``death tax'' is a creation of a pollster who took this nugget of a \ncreation, took it to a political party and said: I have something \nreally interesting, and it polls off the charts. Tell people there is a \ndeath tax and come out for its repeal.\n  There is no death tax. There is a tax on inherited wealth. When the \nhusband or wife dies, the other spouse owns everything with no tax \nconsequences at all. There is a 100-percent exemption. So for the first \nspouse there must be a universal exemption. In addition to that, there \nis now a $2 million exemption on an estate for one spouse. In addition \nto that, the majority party says it is urgent that we get rid of the \nso-called death tax, the bulk of which would help those who are the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  So if Donald Trump--just to use a name because he likes having his \nname used on everything--if Donald Trump were to die, God forbid, at \nsome point when he dies, a substantial portion of his estate will have \nbeen created through the appreciation of his assets--and has not been \ntaxed. The same would be true of most of the richest Americans.\n  The second richest American is Warren Buffett, quite a remarkable man \nfrom Omaha, NE. He is really special. He says: Look, if there is a \nclass war going on, my class is winning--speaking of the wealthiest. He \ndoesn't believe there should be a provision brought to the Senate to \nget rid of the estate tax. He does not believe that is fair. He does \nnot believe it is the right thing to do.\n  But we are up to our necks in debt, we have massive fiscal policy \nbudget deficits, the highest trade deficits in history, and what is the \npriority? The majority party, we were told this afternoon, the priority \nis we have to get to the Senate a provision to provide very significant \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Unbelievable.\n  Someone from the outside would look at that and ask: Is this a joke? \nAre you really serious as legislators? No wonder people take a look at \nthis Congress and say: What are you thinking about? What on Earth do \nyou have on your minds?\n\n  I talk about the dispirited feelings people have about this Congress. \nThe polls are pretty clear. But I also think there is a great reservoir \nof hope in this country. So let me talk a little bit about the hope, \nthe hope that maybe we can address things in the coming months that \nreally matter to the people of this country in a way that really \naffects their future. I am not suggesting that which we will discuss \nhere does not matter. I am just saying there are a whole series of \nthings that confront us that are challenging, difficult issues.\n  A woman called me during my last campaign. During the campaign she \nwas in a hospital. A friend of hers called me on her behalf. Her friend \nsaid: She is in her nineties. She has been a friend of yours and a \nsupporter of yours. You have never met her, she never met you, but she \nalways liked what you have done. Would you call her in the hospital? I \nsaid, of course I would.\n  I called the hospital and talked to this woman. She had elected to \ndie. She had been on kidney dialysis. She said: I have lived a great \nlife, but I decided I just don't want to continue with the kidney \ndialysis, so I will die here. I will be here a couple more weeks, maybe \na week, and eventually--I have made this decision, I am at peace with \nit. I have had a great life. She said--this is about 3 weeks before the \nelection--she said to me: Byron, before I came to the hospital, \nhowever, when I made this decision, I put up all the yard signs, put up \nyard signs on both sides of my property with your name on it, and then \nI voted absentee. She said: By the way, if there is some technical \nrequirement that you be alive on election day, don't tell people that I \nam not alive.\n  This woman had a great spirit about wanting to be involved, even at \nthe end of her life, wanting to be involved in this country's political \nsystem.\n  John F. Kennedy used to say that every mother kind of hopes her child \nmight grow up to be President as long as they don't have to be active \nin politics. But politics is an honorable profession. It is the way we \nmake decisions in America. All the American people ask of this Senate, \nall they ask of policymakers and decisionmakers is to focus on things \nthat matter most. What is ahead of us? What do we do about it?\n  We need, in this political system, to justify the faith the American \npeople have always had in this system. That faith is shaken now, but we \nneed to take action to justify that faith. What do we stand for? What \nneeds to be done? What is required to be done? What things are required \nto be done to put our country back on track?\n  There was a great little book written by Robert Fulghum, ``All I \nReally Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten.'' Some may have read \nthat book, ``All I Really Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten.'' \nPlay fair, follow the rules, don't hit, wash hands, flush--the book \nwent on and on. ``All I Really Need To Know I Learned In \nKindergarten,'' I was thinking about that with respect to all we really \nneed to know in the Senate, about the concern of the American citizens, \nabout their future.\n  Let me describe our agenda more simply. Perhaps if I were to write a \nbook like that, not so much kindergarten but all we really need to \nknow, let me describe what I think we ought to be doing.\n  First of all, we ought to pay our bills. You cannot spend money you \ndon't have on things you don't need. We are choking on debt in this \ncountry. Especially this Congress and at the White House, pay our \nbills. Take care of our kids. That has to do with education and health \ncare and much more. Honor our parents, Medicare, Social Security, and \nother issues. Reward work. Clean up our mess. I guess that is the \nenvironment. Defend freedom.\n  Let me talk a little bit about a couple of these areas, all we really \nneed to know. What about the issue of paying our bills? We have one \nmore chapter of the same, tired book brought to the Senate. Instead of \npaying our bills, this chapter says we collect $20-$30 billion a year \nfrom the tax on inherited wealth. Let's not worry about the fact we are \nchoking on debt. Let's just get rid of that tax in a way that benefits \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  We have already had a vote on the proposition of whether the transfer \nof a family farm or other family business ought to be taxed with an \nestate tax. I offered that amendment twice. Twice. And on January 1, \n2003, the transfer of all family farms and all family businesses to \nlineal descendants or the kids who want to run them would have been \npermanently exempt, 3 years ago. We already had that vote, so don't \nraise that issue. Incidentally, the majority voted against that--twice. \nWe had that vote and made that decision, regrettably.\n  The question is: Pay our bills. Are we going to do that? Are we going \nto keep finding ways to provide emergency appropriations for the \nmonthly costs in Iraq and Afghanistan and other related issues and pay \nfor none of it? The only people we ask to deal with that issue are the \nsoldiers we send to Afghanistan and Iraq. We don't ask the American \npeople to believe we ought to pay for it. We have been asked to provide \nroughly $440 billion in emergency funding, every dollar of which is \nborrowed from future generations.\n  Pay our bills. What about our kids and grandkids? Are they the ones \nwho will pay the bills? Is that responsible? All we really need to know \nis the lesson, pay our bills.\n  How about taking care of our kids? Health care, education, poverty. \nWe have a lot of things to work on there. We have all of these issues \nwith respect to kids without health care, these issues about adequately \nfunding education in this country. Is there anything more important to \nanyone than their children? Is there anyone here who believes they \ndon't want to do everything they can to leave a country or leave a \nworld that is better for their children than it was for them? Whatever \nis in second place to the kids is a long ways behind.\n  Can we manifest an agenda in the Senate that puts children first, \nthat takes care of our children and doesn't have them pay debts we \ndon't have the courage to pay? Can we decide their education is of the \nutmost importance? Can we decide there is no child that ought to show \nup at a hospital or a doctor's office whose medical care is a\n\n[[Page S5413]]\n\nfunction of how much money their parents have in their pocketbook? Can \nwe make those decisions?\n  Yes, pay our bills and take care of our kids. How about those for two \nshort lessons?\n  How about honor our parents? Medicare and Social Security. In the \nlast century, people are living much longer. We went, in 100 years, \nfrom an average life expectancy of 48 years to 78 years now. Think of \nthat. We added 30 years to the average life expectancy in this country \nin one century. That is pretty unbelievable. Now, that has caused some \nstrains on Social Security and Medicare. That is not surprising. That \nis called success. All of the strains in Medicare and Social Security \nare born of success. People are living longer, better, and healthier \nlives.\n  What is the solution to that? Some say the solution to that is to \nprivatize Social Security, take it apart. The President led an effort \nlast year--he ran a lot of gas through Air Force One--he went all over \nAmerica saying we ought to privatize Social Security.\n  It wasn't the first time for him. He did that in 1978, when he ran \nfor Congress in Texas. In 1978, he said Social Security would be broke \nin 10 years. He was wrong then. He was wrong last year. Now at least we \ndon't have that discussion in front of us. It does require us, from \ntime to time, to make adjustments in Social Security or Medicare but \nnot under the guise of taking it apart because you never liked it.\n  How about fair prices for prescription drugs? Maybe honoring our \nparents would be deciding that whether you are on Social Security or \nMedicare or not quite at that age, that you shouldn't have to pay the \nhighest price in the world for prescription drugs. Maybe changing the \nlaw so that we would allow people to reimport FDA-approved drugs from \nother countries at a fraction of the price would be honoring our \nparents. Standing up for Medicare and standing up for Social Security \nand the values they have brought to our country, maybe that is honoring \nour parents.\n  How about rewarding work? Paying our bills, taking care of our kids, \nhonoring our parents, how about rewarding work? This Congress four \ntimes has said we want to continue providing tax cuts to companies that \nclose their American manufacturing plants and ship the jobs overseas. \nThat is perverse, but that is exactly what has happened in the Senate. \nFour times I have offered an amendment to say let's shut down the tax \nbreak that says to an American businessman or woman: Close your \nAmerican factory, fire your workers, and move the jobs overseas, you \nget a big, fat $1.2 billion-a-year tax break. And we can't close it.\n  We have lost nearly 3 million jobs in the last 4 or 5 years, shipped \noverseas. Alan Blinder, a respected former Vice Chair of the Federal \nReserve Board, a mainstream economist, says all U.S. manufacturing \njobs, some 14 million, are at risk to outsourcing. But more than that, \nwe have a total of 42 to 56 million jobs, including service jobs, that \nare susceptible to being outsourced to other countries--China, \nIndonesia, Bangladesh, and others--and even those who do not leave our \ncountry in search of 33 cents-an-hour labor by kids or others who don't \nhave rights, even those who don't leave will see a lesser standard of \nliving or depressed wages because they will be in competition with \npeople in other parts of the world who will work for far less.\n  So the question for our workers is: Who is going to stand up for \nthem? Does it matter that we fought for a century for the things that \nmatter to them--the right to organize, the right to work in a safe work \nplant, child labor laws, a minimum wage, decent health care, decent \nretirement programs? Does it matter to them that we now have a \ncircumstance where we say to American companies: Here is the green \nlight to search for cheap labor elsewhere. You can get rid of all the \nthings that are troublesome to you.\n  How about cleaning up our mess? Would that be a value that would make \nsome sense? Dare we talk about the environment, about our mess with \nrespect to energy? We suck 84 million barrels a day out of this Earth. \nWe put straws in the Earth called drilling rigs. We suck 84 million \nbarrels a day out of the Earth of oil, and we in this little country of \nthe United States use one-fourth of it. Twenty-one million barrels a \nday of that oil comes from Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Kuwait, Venezuela \nand other areas of the world that are troubled. Does it make sense for \nus to be that dependent on those troubled areas of the world? Should we \ncare about the environmental consequences of energy? Should we care \nabout the dependence on energy, all of those issues? The answer is: \nYes, clean up our mess. What about defend freedom? There are a lot of \nways to defend freedom. We have troops in harm's way today that defend \nour freedom. They don't ask questions. They put on a uniform and go. \nPart of defending freedom is also keeping our promise to veterans. \nThose who come home, those who come home losing an leg or arm and go \nthrough the system at Bethesda or Walter Reed, they are still soldiers, \nbut then, ultimately, when they are released, what happens is they \nbecome veterans. Is the money made available by this Chamber to provide \nfor veterans health care sufficient? Will we continue to be a billion \nand a half dollars short because we have other priorities?\n  Defending freedom is a lot of things. It is about honoring soldiers, \nespecially honoring soldiers. It is about keeping our promise to \nveterans. Defending freedom is not about wiretapping the American \npeople. Defending freedom is a lot of things. It is important. It also \nhas to be part of any agenda that we describe. There are a lot of \nfreedoms that I am proud are a part of our political system--women's \nrights, workers rights, civil rights.\n  The decision of this Congress to decide what we want to work on is \none that will be evaluated by the American people. What do they want us \nto work on? I said when I started, I don't suggest that the issue of \ngay marriage is an irrelevant issue or unimportant. I do suggest that \nwe have dealt with that issue in the Defense of Marriage Act. We did it \nin 1996. I also believe the reason it is on the floor today, relative \nto all the other things that I have described, all the other things \nthat we should be tackling--paying our bills, taking care of our kids, \nhonoring our parents, rewarding work, cleaning up our mess, defending \nfreedom, all of those issues--the reason this issue is on the floor is \nabout November. That will be true for some long while now.\n  The American people will have a chance to evaluate that. \nInterestingly enough, when that Constitution says, ``We the people,'' \nit means the power of one. For the American people, it comes down to \nthe power of one, one person casting one vote on one day. All of the \npower, all of the political power in America exists right there. They \nhave the chance to describe what they want for this country, what their \nhopes and dreams are. There is a town square still, and in that town \nsquare there needs to be a discussion, a conversation in America about \nthe glue that keeps this country together. What is this country? What \nkind of glue exists that keeps Americans together as Americans, talking \nin the town square about how to shape the country, how to preserve and \nprotect it?\n\n  What we have done and where we have been is extraordinary. This \ncountry was born of the blood of patriots, not people given to be \nworried about themselves. They gave everything of themselves. This \ncountry survived a Civil War. We beat back the forces of Nazism and \nimperial soldiers of Japan. We survived the depression. We learned how \nto fly airplanes. We left the ground and flew around the world. We \nbuilt rockets. We walked on the moon. We cured smallpox and polio. We \ncreated the telephone and television and computer. What we have done is \nbreathtaking and quite extraordinary. We did that because our country \nhas always been interested in the challenge, in what is ahead, what is \naround the corner.\n  Thomas Wolfe, in his book ``You Can't Go Home Again,'' talked about \nthe American people being filled with an almost quenchless hope, an \nindestructible belief, a boundless optimism that somehow, some way, \nsomething good was about to happen. That still exists in the soul of \nthis country. Something good is about to happen. My hope is that those \nof us who work in this body will not be so quick to believe that that \nsomething good is the need to amend the Constitution this week, next \nweek, next month, and the month after.\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\n  Not too long ago in a congressional session, we had something like 63 \ndifferent proposals filed to amend the basic framework of our \ndemocracy. We have amended it 17 times in 200 years, one of which was \nto prohibit alcohol. That got repealed. We have amended the \nConstitution rarely. Yet we have people who come routinely to the floor \nof the Senate to say: Change the Constitution. I see very few people \nhere who look like George Washington or Franklin or Mason or Madison or \nThomas Jefferson. Jefferson was not at the Constitutional Convention. \nHe was abroad at the time.\n  By suggesting I don't see people who look like them, I don't suggest \nthat people here aren't good-looking people. I am saying go back and \nread what they did, understand what they constructed. Understand what \nexists in the Constitution and why. Understand what the first 10 \namendments intended to be for this country. Then ask yourself how \nprepared are you to decide we should add several more amendments to the \nConstitution, maybe two this week and next week? How about three or \nfour more? There are others filed. Is the Constitution a rough draft? \nIs the work of Franklin and Madison and Mason and Washington a rough \ndraft for those who believe that the mood of the moment is to continue \nto amend and amend?\n  I know there are those who think this is similar to passing a law. It \nis not. It is whatever the emotion of the moment is ought to persuade \nus to do that. That is not the case either.\n  A couple weeks ago, I was in Philadelphia and there is a place called \nthe Constitutional Center. All 55 men who wrote the Constitution are \nmemorialized in statue in a room, and they are life size, made to their \nexact measurements. It is pretty remarkable to walk among them and then \nto think about what they created. They were an extraordinary group. I \ndoubt very much whether such a group exists today. Perhaps it was \ndivine providence that gave us at that moment that talent to create \nthat Constitution that has created this country. I have been fairly \nwell criticized for a long while for not being willing or anxious to \namend the U.S. States Constitution unless it was the last resort, the \nonly resort to respond to something that urgent. I have not found that \nin most cases and have in most cases opposed those who wish to amend \nthe Constitution.\n  I don't intend to cast aspersions on those who believe this is an \nimportant issue. I believe strongly this is the wrong issue to be on \nthe floor of the Senate today. I believe strongly there are so many \nother issues that we ought to be dealing with today. But having said \nall that, we will, in one way or another, decide as the Senate about \nthese two constitutional amendments and about the question of whether \nour country should continue to have a tax on inherited wealth. We will \nget through this. My hope is that at least some of the suggestions I \nhave made about paying our bills, about taking care of our kids, \nhonoring our parents, cleaning up our mess and doing the things that \ndefend freedom and honor work, maybe those are the things we might get \nto soon. I hope so. In that case, I think the American people could \ntake some hope and believe that Congress has sunk its teeth into that \nwhich matters a great deal to our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor speaking about the constitutional amendment.\n  Before we left on Memorial Day, we dealt with a very important issue, \nand that was immigration. Immigration is now in conference committee. \nIt is a key topic. It is my hope that by the end of this week or next \nwe will deal with the budget and budget reforms. We need to get to a \nbalanced budget. I believe we need to do it in 5 years. Others have \nsaid we need to cut the deficit in half in 5, if we can. We are dealing \nwith that issue. I hope we can have support from our colleagues on the \nother side to move forward on those budget issues to get our budget in \nbalance. We have had the issues of Katrina. The Presiding Officer knows \nso much about that; the war in Iraq. We can get there, but we will have \nto show some determination. I hope we get bipartisan support on that.\n  I also remind my colleagues that there hardly could be a more \nimportant issue than the foundational structure of how we build society \nand how societies have been built for thousands of years. They have \nbeen built around the institution of marriage, of a man and a woman \nbonded together for life. Out of that, families develop and grow and \nprosper. Children are raised, and that is the next generation. The next \ngeneration after that is brought forth and the generation preceding \nthem is cared for or nurtured. That has been our fundamental structure. \nIt hasn't been a structure of Government where we say we will have a \nwhole bunch of Government out here to take care of people. Basically, \nwhat we say is: We will have a whole bunch of families out here to take \ncare of people. And when that doesn't work, we will have Government \nsupport the structure and support the people who fall through the \ncracks. We will try to help as much as we can. We will try to help \nfamilies as much as we can, and that is why we try to offer help for \nmarriages. That is why we try to give advantages to marriages, so that \nthat is the best structure that we know of that has been created to \nraise children, the next generation.\n  The problem we have in front of us is the institution of marriage has \nbeen weakened, and the effort to redefine it on this vast social \nexperiment that we have going on, redefining marriage differently than \nit has ever been defined before, this effort of this vast social \nexperiment, the early data that we see from other places, harms the \ninstitution of the family, the raising of the next generation. And it \nis harmful to the future of the Republic.\n  I think we can hardly have a more foundational debate regarding \nthings of importance than the marriage amendment. I remind my \ncolleagues that there is nothing controversial that we are debating. I \nwill put up a chart that people have already seen. We need to remind \npeople of the wording. The wording on this amendment is:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  This is hardly profound science. This is a statement and people \nunderstand it. It is clear. We have held nine hearings in the Senate on \nit. The next sentence is:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the Constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  In other words, the courts cannot define marriage differently. \nLegislative bodies can look at it differently. The courts cannot. It \nsays the legislature, the people's body, has to be involved in deciding \nthe institution of marriage.\n  Some say this is something that was brought up by Congress in an \nelection year because we are concerned about elections. But I can \ncertainly say for this Senator, and everybody I know supporting this \namendment, that is not the case. I view this as foundational to this \nsociety, to the future of the Republic. I think I am in pretty good \ncompany.\n  I will show you the next chart on this particular issue and the \nnumber of States that have taken up the issue of fundamentally deciding \nwhat marriage should look like. 45 out of 50 States have either adopted \nconstitutional amendments or passed laws protecting traditional \nmarriages. That means we are already beyond the three-fourths number of \nStates that have defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman. To \namend the Constitution, you have to have two-thirds of the House, two-\nthirds of the Senate, and three-fourths of the State. We are already \nover three-fourths of the States. It is kind of a reverse \nconstitutional amendment because 45 States have acted and said marriage \nis a union of a man and a woman, and we think it is so important that \nwe are going to act ahead of time. We are going to go at this now so \nthat the courts cannot beat us to the punch.\n  But the problem is that those are State legislatures, and they can be \ntrumped by a Federal court, which has already happened, and their State \nconstitution can be ruled null and void and unconstitutional. So you \nhave 45 of the 50 States already speaking on this and saying marriage \nis the union of a man and a woman, feeling that it is so important that \nthey want to act before\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\nCongress, before the Constitution can be amended. They think it is that \nimportant. They have already moved forward before this body has \nenacted.\n  Nineteen States have constitutional amendments protecting the \ndefinition of marriage as a man and a woman; 26 others have statutes. \nOnly five have not acted to protect that law statutorily or \nconstitutionally. I will show you the next chart. You cannot say this \nkind of barely passed or that it is a small majority or that people \ndon't care about this issue. I will show you a chart of how the vote \ntotal has been going across the States, across the country, in every \nregion of America. When a constitutional amendment in a State defining \nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman has come up in front of the \npeople, the people have passed it. They have passed it, and it is not \nby 51 to 49. It is not just in the Midwest or the South; it is in the \nEast, it is in the West, it is everywhere. Look at the chart, starting \nfrom the earliest one in 1998 to the latest, in my State of Kansas, in \n2005. Look at the margins they have passed it by. You have a low of 57 \npercent in Oregon on the west coast. Still, that is a strong majority. \nMy guess is that a number of people in this body on their first \nelection were not elected with more than 57 percent of the vote. And \nyou have the highs of 86 percent in Mississippi, 79 percent in my \nState, and in North Dakota 73 percent of the vote.\n  It is not a small group of people saying, yes, it does matter to me; \nit is a strong majority of the public across the entire country that is \nsaying we need to define this institution before the courts come in and \ndo this vast social experiment of redefining the family unit we build \nfamilies around. We need to get this defined. The average ballot in \nsupport is 71.5 percent. That is the best public opinion polling you \ncan get--how people vote when they go to the booth in region after \nregion, defining what marriage is. They know what they believe marriage \nis. If we had Senators who would vote as their States have voted, we \nwould have 90 votes for a constitutional amendment, defining marriage \nas the union of a man and a woman. That is how their States have voted, \neither by a constitutional ballot or within their legislature, in the \nlaws that they have passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider the language being used here. \nThere has been strong and vitriolic language thrown out. I don't \nappreciate that on any side of it, whether it is supporting the \nconstitutional amendment or against it. People are trying to make \nfundamental policy for the country on a fundamental issue, and that is \nmarriage.\n  It is not bigotry to define marriage as the union of a man and a \nwoman. If that were the case, then you have 45 of 50 States that have \ndone that. You have major religious institutions, Pope Benedict of the \nCatholic Church, and you have many other church leaders saying that \nmarriage is the union of a man and a woman. You have different racial \ngroups that are saying marriage is a union of a man and a woman. They \nare not bigoted individuals. They are simply seeking good public policy \nand the best place to raise a family, recognizing that the law is a \nteacher. If the law says you can redefine marriage any way you want to, \nthe law teaches you can have marriage any way you want. If you define \nthat marriage downward, you harm an institution that already is in \ngreat difficulty in this country. I will cover that much more later. \nLet's watch our language. We are trying to deal with a serious matter \nfor the future of the Republic.\n\n  On Saturday, I was at a wedding in Topeka at which my daughter was \nthe maid of honor. I don't think I am too partial in telling my \ncolleagues that she was beautiful, radiant--not to compete with the \nbride, but she was beautiful, and I was very proud of her. It reminded \nme of that time-honored institution we are talking about--marriage, the \nunion of a man and a woman. As I sat next to my wife, with our children \nnext to us, other than my daughter who was in the wedding, I thought \nwhat a wonderful institution, what a way that we want to have this \ncountry built around, with grandparents and parents and children and \nsiblings bonded together for life.\n  And do you know what. Families fight. There gets to be difficulties \nin families. But they stay together and support each other. It is the \ndurability of that structure that helps build people. Families \nencourage each other. You push one another and say you ought to do \nthis, and you can do that; and when somebody starts to fall, you pick \nthem up. Even when you get mad, you don't go away--some people do. But \nyou say, all right, it is family. We hang in here and we have to do \nthat. That is what families do. That is why they are durable and good, \nand that is why we want to support them, because of what a family is. \nIt is that durable set of relationships that are thick and that bind us \ntogether. We are reminded when we go to a wedding ceremony and we say \nhere is a young couple getting married, and they are beautiful young \npeople and they are radiant and excited and nervous; they probably \ndon't have any clue of what they are getting into. As my wife and I \nsaid afterwards, we didn't know anything about marriage when we walked \ninto it. Twenty-four years later, we know a little bit more about it. \nWe know the promise and the beauty of it. We have children from it. We \nhave been gifted with five children. You know the importance of it, of \nstaying in there and supporting that family.\n  We know the values transmission that occurs in a marriage, what the \nparents say to their children and what they live in front of their \nchildren. We know the values transmission that takes place from \ngrandparents, if they are surviving, to children, passing on those \ntraditions and thoughts. It is a beautiful institution; it is one that \nwe pass on the values from to the next generation.\n  It is an institution that is in trouble. We have had a lot of \ndissolutions of marriage in this country, as a result of any number of \nfactors. Maybe it is the speed at which we live. We all say in our \nhearts we know the best thing is to have that marriage endure. We know \nthe best thing is for the marriage to endure and to raise good, healthy \nchildren. We know the best thing is for that marriage to nurture and \ngrow those children. We know that in our hearts. You don't have to have \na law passed to tell you that.\n  We also know this institution is in trouble, and if you redefine it, \nyou are going to create further problems for a fundamental institution. \nWhat you are going to do is you will take out a lot of the breath that \nis left in the institution, and you will move in another direction.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be happy to after my final point. Other \ncountries that have redefined marriage have seen an enormous loss in \nthe institution. Other countries that have defined this differently and \nhave been there for a period of time have found a loss in the \ninstitution of marriage and the number of people willing to get \nmarried--to the point that most children are born out of wedlock, not \nborn in these bonded relationships. That is the future of what takes \nplace when you redefine a fundamental institution that everybody agrees \nis a union between a man and a woman. When the law teaches it is \ndifferent, you will move the people away from that, and we will have \nfewer marriages in America. That is not what we need nor want.\n  I am happy to yield to the primary cosponsor of the constitutional \namendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his remarks. During \nseveral hearings we both participated in, we have heard about how a \nhealthy marriage benefits children, how it benefits a community and the \nfoundation of society. Don't you feel that if we don't preserve the \ndefinition of marriage, somehow or other we make marriage less \nrelevant, and when you make it less relevant, then I think it is easier \nto have higher divorce rates and easier to have a dysfunctional family \nbecause the real importance of a family is lost.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reclaiming my time, I thank my colleague for the \nquestion. I not only think that--and it strikes me that is natural to \npresume--that is the experience taking place in other countries. As I \nsaid, I will have some charts on this tomorrow that I will bring \nforward and showcase to people. The experience in Europe and the \nScandinavian countries is not encouraging in what we have seen taking \nplace with the institution of marriage. Those are places that have \nredefined marriage over a period of time now.\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\nThey have said marriage can be between same-sex couples. You have \ncounties in Norway where over 80 percent of the first-born children are \nborn out of wedlock and two-thirds of the second children are. The \ninstitution no longer means much of anything. It is defined away.\n  You can say: OK, that is fine because you can raise good children in \nthat setting. You can raise good children in a single family setting or \nwith two people living together. But from all the social data, we know \nthat is not the best place. We know that you are asking for a lot of \nproblems if you define marriage away or let it be defined away by the \ncourts. If we are going to do this, if it is going to be allowed, at \nleast let's have the people involved in this discussion and not have it \ndone by the courts, which is where we are headed right now. This is \ngoing to be done by the courts.\n  I want to put another chart up to show that particular point about \nhow many courts are taking up this issue of marriage. Here you see in \nall the States and all these States' legislatures they are saying \nmarriage is the union of a man and a woman. In 45 of 50 States, \nmarriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman. What has \nhappened in the legal framework? We have seen this in other areas in \nthis country where the people speak and then the activists--a small \ngroup--take this matter and say we are not going to go through the \nlegislative body and work with the people and try to change the hearts \nand minds of the people. We are going to go through the courts.\n  So what is happening in the courts on this? Nine States face lawsuits \nchallenging traditional marriage laws--nine States. In four of those \nnine States, judges have already followed Massachusetts and found a \nright of same-sex marriage in the State constitutions--four of those \nnine, already. In April of 2005--and there were a number of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle the last time this came up 2 \nyears ago who said, Well, when the courts start ruling against this, \nwhen the Federal courts start ruling against this, then I will look at \nthe need for a constitutional amendment at the Federal level. All \nright, we got it, unfortunately. I wish we didn't. But in April of \n2005, a Federal court in the district of Nebraska held that the State's \namendment, which was approved by 70 percent of Nebraskans--70 percent, \nwhich is about the same number that support Nebraska football; it is \nhigher, I suppose, than that--but 70 percent of Nebraska voters voted \nfor that constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of a \nman and a woman, and the Federal court struck it down and said it was \nunconstitutional. This is a Federal court saying that a State marriage \nlaw in the State's Constitution, that went to the people, supported by \n70 percent of the people by a vote, is unconstitutional. All right. Now \nwe have the Federal courts. And Federal courts challenges to the \nFederal DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which the prior speaker, the \nSenator from North Dakota, was talking about, we now have Federal \nchallenges to that, and more is coming, more is coming. So for my \ncolleagues to say, well, it is not a particularly important topic, and \nwe have other things we need to deal with, that is not what the States \nsay. The States say this is an important topic, and they are staring \ndown the barrel of Federal courts defining it away, as the first \nFederal court that has ruled on this has already done, in saying \nmarriage is not the union of a man and a woman. It is not. Somebody is \ngoing to define this--which was point one I was raising at the outset--\nsomebody is going to define this and I believe it should be legislative \nbodies and the people.\n  No. 2, this is about the institution of marriage and how you raise \nthe next generation. That is something I think we need to cover in some \ndepth. We had a great debate here on this floor about immigration the 2 \nweeks prior to going on break and it was a great debate. Immigration is \nan important policy issue in this country and it is facing us now. We \nhave a huge problem. The system is not working. We had a great debate. \nWe need to have a great debate about marriage, about this fundamental \ninstitution, because we need to think and look and see where this \ninstitution is going. It is in a great deal of difficulty.\n  I want to cover this, particularly from the context of a group which \nhas just issued a paper on it. There is an important group of \nprestigious American academics from top universities who have just \nreleased what I think is a groundbreaking statement of principles to \nguide the public debate on the marriage issue, and we have needed a \ndebate about marriage because the percentage of people getting married \nhas fallen, the number of divorces has risen greatly, and approximately \nhalf of our children under the age of 18 will spend a significant \nportion of their childhood in a single parent household. We have \nwelfare policies in this country that penalize people for getting \nmarried. It is bad policy. And now the lowest income individuals in the \nUnited States are the least likely to get married. So I guess you could \nsay that policy has worked. It is a horrific idea. Reagan probably had \nthis right when he said, ``If you want more of something, subsidize it; \nif you want less of something, tax it.'' We have subsidized the \nsituation of not getting married if you are in a low-income strata, and \nthat is indeed what has happened in this country.\n  This group of academics has just issued from Princeton ``Ten \nPrinciples on Marriage and the Public Good.'' It is produced by top \nscholars in history, economics, psychiatry, law, sociology and \nphilosophy, and presents research on why the defense of marriage is in \nthe public interest. Now, remember, what we are talking about is in the \npublic interest. This is what we need as a Nation. What do we need to \ndo? What is in the public interest? And they are clearly saying that it \nis in the public interest to support marriage as the union of a man and \na woman and have more of it, not less, and to have stronger unions, not \nweaker ones, and to have an institution that is supported by law, not \ndefined out of existence by law. They say this:\n\n       In recent years, marriage has weakened, with serious \n     negative consequences for society as a whole. Four \n     developments are especially troubling: Divorce, illegitimacy, \n     cohabitation, and same-sex marriage. Marriage protects \n     children, men and women, and the common good. The health of \n     marriage is particularly important in a free society, which \n     depends upon citizens to govern their private lives and rear \n     their children responsibly, so as to limit the scope, size, \n     and power of the State.\n\n  It is families that buttress the State and also limit the scope, \nsize, and power of the State.\n\n       The Nation's retreat from marriage has been particularly \n     consequential for our society's most vulnerable communities: \n     Minorities and the poor pay a disproportionately heavy price \n     when marriage declines in their communities. Marriage also \n     offers men and women as spouses a good they can have in no \n     other way: a mutual and complete giving of the self. Thus, \n     marriage understood as the enduring union of husband and wife \n     is both a good in itself and also advances the public \n     interest.\n       We affirm the following ten principles--\n\n  This is this Princeton group of scholars.\n\n       That summarize the value of marriage--a choice that most \n     people want to make, and that society should endorse and \n     support.\n\n  They then list these 10 principles of marriage and the public good.\n\n       Marriage is a personal union, intended for the whole of \n     life, of husband and wife.\n       Marriage is a profound human good, elevating and perfecting \n     our social and sexual nature.\n       Ordinarily, both men and women who marry are better off as \n     a result.\n       Marriage protects and promotes the well-being of children.\n       Marriage sustains civil society and promotes the common \n     good.\n       Marriage is a wealth-creating institution, increasing human \n     and social capital.\n       When marriage weakens, the equality gap widens, as children \n     suffer from the disadvantages of growing up in homes without \n     committed mothers and fathers.\n       A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political \n     liberty and foster limited government.\n       The laws that govern marriage matter significantly.\n       And No. 10, ``civil marriage'' and ``religious marriage'' \n     cannot be rigidly or completely divorced from one another.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Creating a marriage culture is not the job for government. \n     Families, religious communities, and civic institutions, \n     along with intellectual, moral, religious, and artistic \n     leaders, point the way. But law and public policy will either \n     reinforce and support these goals or undermine them. We call \n     upon our nation's leaders, and our fellow citizens, to \n     support public policies that strengthen marriage as a social \n     institution, including:\n       Protect the public understanding of marriage as the union \n     of one man and one woman as husband and wife.\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\n       Investigate divorce law reforms.\n       End marriage penalties for low-income families.\n       Protect and expand pro-child and pro-family provisions in \n     our Tax Code.\n       Protect the interests of children from the fertility \n     industry.\n\n  I ask that this important statement of principles from top American \nscholars be considered carefully by my colleagues. I hope it will help \nguide our debate on this issue.\n  I want to talk a bit about that in the sense that we are having a \nprofound impact on society and we have had this shift in the importance \nand status of marriage that has happened during one generation--\nbasically my generation. We had a very strong marriage culture going \ninto the 1960s, with very low divorce rates in the United States. There \nwere undoubtedly situations that people married into that were bad, \nthat were abusive prior to that period of time, and there certainly are \ntoday as well. But I don't think anybody could argue that today we have \ntoo many situations where too many children are in too weak of a \nhousehold structure, lacking the concentration of adults in their \nlives, that this fundamental breakdown of the family has allowed in \nmany cases to happen. And then you have that huge, enormous impact on \nthat next generation of children.\n  That is why this group of intellectuals has come together and said, \nLook, for the future of society, for the future of our culture, we need \na strong marriage institution. Don't weaken it and don't redefine it \naway from what it is and harm it further.\n  I want to talk briefly about the effects on Massachusetts and the \neffect the change of laws in Massachusetts has had on this particular \nmarriage debate. In terms of the societal effects of regularizing same-\nsex unions, some have pointed out that the legalizing of same-sex \nunions in some States--and this has happened in Massachusetts and in \nVermont--has not destroyed the society of those States. So they are \ntaking the counterargument on this and saying, What is the problem \nhere? Why not just define it any way you want to and if people of the \nsame gender want to get married, that is fine, and it is not going to \nhurt my marriage. That is the way the debate will come up. I am not \narguing that short-term changes like this will have detectable effects \nimmediately where you can say, OK, you are going to define it one way \nthis year and the next year you are going to see the number of \nheterosexual unions decline, and you are going to see major impacts on \nthe marriage institution. It can take and does take years for the full \neffects of a change like this to show up because, remember, what you \nare doing is you are sewing into the culture, you are changing the \nculture.\n  When you redefine an institution like marriage, you are changing the \nculture. You are saying, OK, we have had a foundational institution in \nthis culture: It is marriage. It is a union of a man and a woman bonded \ntogether for life. It is where we raise our families, where we raise \nthe next generation and bring them up; that is a foundational \nstructure. Now we are redefining that and saying, Well, it doesn't need \nto be a man and a woman. That is a cultural shift, and cultural shifts \ntake years to show up, but they will show up, and they have enormous \nimpact.\n  We have seen small changes taking place already in places like \nMassachusetts. State marriage licenses now contain places for ``Partner \nA'' and ``Partner B,'' rather than husband and wife. Perhaps soon the \nterms ``husband'' and ``wife'' will be eradicated, and as for the terms \n``mother'' and ``father'' one can only imagine what will happen to the \ndefinitions of those institutions.\n  Those cultural signals are not going to strengthen the American \nfamily. This issue has been thoroughly discussed and debated. I want to \ncomplete this point--and I will have more charts to show on this--of \nwhat takes place over a period of two to three decades when you \nredefine an institution like marriage. In fact, I want to show, and \nactually I believe we have a chart on that today, and I am going to \npull that up here a little bit later on to show what has happened in \nother countries when they have redefined the institution, if we can \nfind that chart. I want to come back to that.\n\n  Before I get to that, though, I want to point out how much we have \ndiscussed this issue. Some may suggest, Well, we are rushing this to \nthe floor. I can't believe they would, but some might say, Well, it is \njust being rushed to the floor and we really don't understand the \nramifications of this particular constitutional amendment, and argue \nfrom that perspective. I want to point out that we have had nine \nhearings on this subject from 2003, 2004, and 2005. We have held \nhearings with dozens of experts on this topic. We have held hearings \nabout the impact of changing the definition of marriage. We have held \nhearings with legal experts and scholars of what does this two-sentence \nconstitutional amendment mean. We have held hearings from lots of \ndifferent angles on this.\n  One thing has certainly become clear in these hearings: Traditional \nmarriage promotes stability in society and government has a vital \ninterest in encouraging and providing the conditions to maintain as \nmany traditional marriages as possible.\n  Once the process of redefining marriage begins, it is but a short \nstep to the dissolution of marriage as an institution all together. I \ndon't think that is the way we want to go, and it is certainly not the \nway we want to go for our children.\n  There is also a point about when you redefine marriage, what takes \nplace in institutions that want to stay with a traditional definition \nof marriage. There now is a growing body of thought that institutions \nwill not be allowed to define marriage as the union of a man and a \nwoman.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article that I think is a very interesting and important one done by \nMaggie Gallagher that looks at the loss of religious freedom when you \nredefine marriage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, May 15, 2006]\n\n  Banned in Boston--The Coming Conflict Between Same-sex Marriage and \n                           Religious Liberty\n\n                         (By Maggie Gallagher)\n\n       Catholic Charities of Boston made the announcement on March \n     10: It was getting out of the adoption business. ``We have \n     encountered a dilemma we cannot resolve. . . . The issue is \n     adoption to same-sex couples.''\n       It was shocking news. Catholic Charities of Boston, one of \n     the nation's oldest adoption agencies, had long specialized \n     in finding good homes for hard to place kids. ``Catholic \n     Charities was always at the top of the list,'' Paula \n     Wisnewski, director of adoption for the Home for the Home for \n     Little Wanderers, told the Boston Globe. ``It's a shame, \n     because it is certainly going to mean that fewer children \n     from foster care are going to find permanent homes.'' Marylou \n     Sudders, president of the Massachusetts Society for the \n     Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said simply, ``This is a \n     tragedy for kids.''\n       How did this tragedy happen?\n       It's a complicated story. Massachusetts law prohibited \n     ``orientation discrimination'' over a decade ago. Then in \n     November 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court \n     ordered gay marriage. The majority ruled that only animus \n     against gay people could explain why anyone would want to \n     treat opposite-sex and same-sex couples differently. That \n     same year, partly in response to growing pressure for gay \n     marriage and adoption both here and in Europe, a Vatican \n     statement made clear that placing children with same-sex \n     couples violates Catholic teaching.\n       Then in October 2005, the Boston Globe broke the news: \n     Boston Catholic Charities had placed a small number of \n     children with same-sex couples. Sean Cardinal O'Malley, who \n     has authority over Catholic Charities of Boston, responded by \n     stating that the agency would no longer do so.\n       Seven members of the Boston Catholic Charities board (about \n     one-sixth of the membership) resigned in protest. Joe \n     Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, which \n     lobbies for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equal \n     rights, issued a thundering denunciation of the Catholic \n     hierarchy: ``These bishops are putting an ugly political \n     agenda before the needs of very vulnerable children. Every \n     one of the nation's leading children's welfare groups agrees \n     that a parent's sexual orientation is irrelevant to his or \n     her ability to raise a child. What these bishops are doing is \n     shameful, wrong, and has nothing to do whatsoever with \n     faith.''\n       But getting square with the church didn't end Catholic \n     Charities' woes. To operate in Massachusetts, an adoption \n     agency must be licensed by the state. And to get a license, \n     an agency must pledge to obey state laws barring \n     discrimination--including the decade-old ban on orientation \n     discrimination. With the legalization of gay marriage in the \n     state, discrimination against same-sex couples would be \n     outlawed, too.\n       Cardinal O'Malley asked Governor Mitt Romney for a \n     religious exemption from the\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n     ban on orientation. Governor Romney reluctantly responded \n     that he lacked legal authority to grant one unilaterally, by \n     executive order. So the governor and archbishop turned to the \n     state legislature, requesting a conscience exemption that \n     would allow Catholic Charities to continue to help kids in a \n     manner consistent with Catholic teaching.\n       To date, not a single other Massachusetts political leader \n     appears willing to consider even the narrowest religious \n     exemption. Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey, the Republican \n     candidate for governor in this fall's election, refused to \n     budge: ``I believe that any institution that wants to provide \n     services that are regulated by the state has to abide by the \n     laws of the state,'' Healey told the Boston Globe on March 2, \n     ``and our antidiscrimination laws are some of our most \n     important.'' equality in this country.'' Marc Stern is the \n     general counsel for the center-left American Jewish \n     Congress. Robin Wilson of the University of Maryland law \n     school is undecided on gay marriage. Jonathan Turley of \n     George Washington law school has supported legalizing not \n     only gay marriage but also polygamy.\n       Reading through these and the other scholars' papers, I \n     noticed an odd feature. Generally speaking the scholars most \n     opposed to gay marriage were somewhat less likely than others \n     to foresee large conflicts--perhaps because they tended to \n     find it ``inconceivable,'' as Doug Kmiec of Pepperdine law \n     school put it, that ``a successful analogy will be drawn in \n     the public mind between irrational, and morally repugnant, \n     racial discrimination and the rational, and at least morally \n     debatable, differentiation of traditional and same-sex \n     marriage.'' That's a key consideration. For if orientation is \n     like race, then people who oppose gay marriage will be \n     treated under law like bigots who opposed interracial \n     marriage. Sure, we don't arrest people for being racists, but \n     the law does intervene in powerful ways to punish and \n     discourage racial discrimination, not only by government but \n     also by private entities. Doug Laycock, a religious liberty \n     expert at the University of Texas law school, similarly told \n     me we are a ``long way'' from equating orientation with race \n     in the law.\n       By contrast, the scholars who favor gay marriage found it \n     relatively easy to foresee looming legal pressures on faith-\n     based organizations opposed to gay marriage, perhaps because \n     many of these scholars live in social and intellectual \n     circles where the shift Kmiec regards as inconceivable has \n     already happened. They have less trouble imagining that \n     people and groups who oppose gay marriage will soon be \n     treated by society and the law the way we treat racists \n     because that's pretty close to the world in which they live \n     now.\n\n\n                     the (gay) public intellectual\n\n       Of all the scholars who attended, perhaps the most \n     surprising is Chai Feldblum. She is a Georgetown law \n     professor who is highly sought after on civil rights issues, \n     especially gay civil rights. She has drafted many federal \n     bills to prohibit orientation discrimination and innumerable \n     amicus briefs in constitutional cases seeking equality for \n     gay people. I ask her why she decided to make time for a \n     conference on the impact of same-sex marriage on religious \n     liberty.\n       ``Not because I was caught up in the panic,'' she laughs. \n     She'd been thinking through the moral implications of \n     nondiscrimination rules in the law, a lonely undertaking for \n     a gay rights advocate. ``Gay rights supporters often try to \n     present these laws as purely neutral and having no moral \n     implications. But not all discrimination is bad,'' Feldblum \n     points out. In employment law, for instance, ``we allow \n     discrimination against people who sexually abuse children, \n     and we don't say `the only question is can they type' even if \n     they can type really quickly.''\n       To get to the point where the law prohibits discrimination, \n     Feldblum says, ``there have to be two things: one, a majority \n     of the society believing the characteristic on which the \n     person is being discriminated against is not morally \n     problematic, and, two, enough of a sense of outrage to push \n     past the normal American contract-based approach, where the \n     government doesn't tell you what you can do. There has to be \n     enough outrage to bypass that basic default mode in America. \n     Unlike some of my compatriots in the gay rights movement, I \n     think we advance the cause of gay equality if we make clear \n     there are moral assessments that underlie antidiscrimination \n     laws.''\n       But there was a second reason Feldblum made time for this \n     particular conference. She was raised an Orthodox Jew. She \n     wanted to demonstrate respect for religious people and their \n     concerns, to show that the gay community is not monolithic in \n     this regard.\n       ``It seemed to me the height of disingenuousness, \n     absurdity, and indeed disrespect to tell someone it is okay \n     to `be' gay, but not necessarily okay to engage in gay sex. \n     What do they think being gay means?'' she writes in her \n     Becket paper. ``I have the same reaction to courts and \n     legislatures that blithely assume a religious person can \n     easily disengage her religious belief and self-identity from \n     her religious practice and religious behavior. What do they \n     think being religious means?''\n       To Feldblum the emerging conflicts between free exercise of \n     religion and sexual liberty are real: ``What we pass a law \n     that says you may not discriminate on the basis of sexual \n     orientation, we are burdening those who have an alternative \n     moral assessment of gay men and lesbians.'' Most of the time, \n     the need to protect the dignity of gay people will justify \n     burdening religious belief, she argues. But that does not \n     make it right to pretend these burdens do not exist in the \n     first place, or that the religious people the law is \n     burdening don't matter.\n       ``You have to stop, think, and justify the burden each \n     time,'' says Feldblum. She pauses. ``Respect doesn't mean \n     that the religious person should prevail in the right to \n     discriminate--it just means demonstrating a respectful \n     awareness of the religious position.''\n       Feldblum believes this sincerely and with passion, and \n     clearly (as she reminds me) against the vast majority of \n     opinion of her own community. And yet when push comes to \n     shove, when religious liberty and sexual liberty conflict, \n     she admits, ``I'm having a hard time coming up with any case \n     in which religious liberty should win.''\n       She pauses over cases like the one at Tufts University,\n       Interestingly, Stern points out, a single ``derogatory or \n     demeaning'' remark not seeking sexual gratification or \n     threatening a person's job security does not constitute \n     harassment under ordinary federal and state sexual harassment \n     law originally intended to protect women in the workplace. \n     Moreover, Stern says, ``our entire free speech regime depends \n     on the principle that no adult has a right to expect the law \n     will protect him from being exposed to disagreeable speech.''\n       Except, apparently in New Jersey, where a state attorney \n     general's opinion concluded, ``[C]learly speech which \n     violates a nondiscrimination policy is not protected.'' \n     ``This was so `clear' to the writer,'' notes Stern, ``that \n     she cited not a single case or law review article in \n     support.'' Ultimately, the school withdrew its reprimand from \n     Daniel's employment file after receiving negative publicity \n     and the threat of a lawsuit from the Foundation for \n     Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).\n       Sexual harassment law as an instrument for suppressing \n     religious speech? A few days after I interviewed Stern, an \n     Alliance Defense Fund press release dropped into my mail box: \n     ``OSU Librarian Slapped with `Sexual Harassment' Charge for \n     Recommending Conservative Books for Freshmen.'' One of the \n     books the Ohio State librarian (a pacifist Quaker who drives \n     a horse and buggy to work) recommended was It Takes a Family \n     by Senator Rick Santorum. Three professors alleged that the \n     mere appearance of such a book on a freshman reading list \n     made them feel ``unsafe.'' The faculty voted to pursue the \n     sexual harassment allegation, and the process quickly \n     resulted in the charge being dropped.\n       In the end the investigation of the librarian was more of a \n     nuisance--you might call it harassment--than anything else. \n     But the imbalance in terms of free speech remains clear: \n     People who favor gay rights face no penalty for speaking \n     their views, but can inflict a risk of litigation, \n     investigation, and formal and informal career penalties on \n     others whose views they dislike. Meanwhile, people who think \n     gay marriage is wrong cannot know for sure where the line is \n     now or where it will be redrawn in the near future. ``Soft'' \n     coercion produces no martyrs to disturb anyone's conscience, \n     yet it is highly effective in chilling the speech of ordinary \n     people.\n       Finally, I ask Stern the big question on everyone's mind. \n     Religious groups that take government funding will almost \n     certainly be required to play by the nondiscrimination rules, \n     but what about groups that, while receiving no government \n     grants, are tax-exempt? Can a group--a church or religious \n     charity, say--that opposes gay marriage keep its tax \n     exemption if gay marriage becomes the law? ``That,'' says \n     Stern, ``is the 18 trillion dollar question.''\n       Twenty years ago it would have been inconceivable that a \n     Christian or Jewish organization that opposed gay marriage \n     might be treated as racist in the public square. Today? It's \n     just not clear.\n       ``In Massachusetts I'd be very worried,'' Stern says \n     finally. The churches themselves might have a First Amendment \n     defense if a state government or state courts tried to \n     withdraw their exemption, he says, but ``the parachurch \n     institutions are very much at risk and may be put out of \n     business because of the licensing issues, or for these other \n     reasons--it's very unclear. None of us nonprofits can \n     function without [state] tax exemption. As a practical \n     matter, any large charity needs that real estate tax \n     exemption.''\n       He blames religious conservatives for adopting the wrong \n     political strategy on gay issues. ``Live and let live,'' he \n     tells me, is the only thing around the world that works. But \n     I ask him point blank what he would say to people who dismiss \n     the threat to free exercise of religion as evangelical \n     hysteria. ``It's not hysteria, this is very real,'' he tells \n     me, ``Boston Catholic Charities shows that.''\n       Fundamentally, Stern sees this as a ``religious war'' \n     between people for whom an egalitarian secular ethic is the \n     only rational option and people who can make room for an \n     ethic based on faith in a God who commands. There are very \n     few signs of a willingness to compromise on either side, he \n     notes.\n       ``You look around the world and even the right to preach is \n     in doubt,'' he tells me. ``In the United States we are not \n     foreseeably in that position. Fundamentally speech is still \n     safe in the United States. Beyond speech, nothing is safe.''\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\n                       The Health Care Law Expert\n\n       Robin Wilson is an expert in both family law and health \n     care law. So when Anthony Picarello approached her about \n     thinking through the impact gay marriage may have on \n     religious institutions, she had a ready model at hand: the \n     struggles over conscience exemptions in the health care field \n     after Roe v. Wade elevated abortion to a constitutional \n     right.\n       Wilson predicts ``a concerted effort to take same-sex \n     marriage from a negative right to be free of state \n     interference to a positive entitlement to assistance by \n     others. Although Roe and Griswold established only the right \n     to noninterference by the state in a woman's abortion and \n     contraceptive decisions, family planning advocates have \n     worked strenuously to force individual institutions to \n     provide controversial services, and to force individual \n     health care providers to participate in them.''\n       ``This litigation after Roe,'' she says, ``provides a \n     convincing prediction about the trajectory that \n     litigation forced to marry same sex couples. What about \n     the other potential conflicts? Are they real? ``There are \n     already tensions,'' he tells me. ``I think there is a kind \n     of collision course here that is inevitable.''\n       For a man in the conciliation business, Hayes doesn't sound \n     optimistic. ``I think it's'' a serious question that will \n     grow more difficult. I think we will have more and more \n     tension between efforts by the state to protect gay rights \n     and the need to protect religious freedom. This will have an \n     impact on religious individuals as well as perhaps religious \n     organizations in areas such as housing; the workplace, \n     hiring.''\n       I ask him whether his concerns are shared by the wide \n     spectrum of religious and civil rights groups he deals with. \n     ``Everyone's talking about it, thinking about it,'' Haynes \n     tells, me. ``There are a lot of different ideas about where \n     we are going to end up, but everyone thinks it is the battle \n     of our times.''\n\n\n                           The Marriage Line\n\n       How much of the coming threat to religious liberty actually \n     stems from same sex marriage? These experts' comments make \n     clear that it is not only gay marriage, but also the set of \n     ideas that leads to gay marriage--the insistence on one \n     specific vision of gay rights--that has placed church and \n     state on a collision course. Once sexual orientation is \n     conceptualized as a protected status on a par with race, \n     traditional religions that condemn homosexual conduct will \n     face increasing legal pressures regardless of what courts and \n     Congress do about marriage itself.\n       Nevertheless, marriage is a particularly potent legal \n     ``bright line.'' Support for marriage is firmly established \n     in our legal tradition and in our public policy. After it \n     became apparent, that no religious exemption would be \n     available for Catholic Charities in Massachusetts, the church \n     looked hard for legal avenues to continue helping kids \n     without violating Catholic principles. If the stumbling block \n     bad been Catholic Charities' unwillingness to place children \n     with single people--or with gay singles--marriage might have \n     provided a legal ``safe harbor'': Catholic Charities might \n     have been able to specialize in placing children with married \n     couples and thus avoid collision with state laws banning \n     orientation discrimination. After Goodridge, however, \n     ``marriage'' includes gay marriage, so no such haven would \n     have been available in Massachusetts.\n       Precisely because support for marriage is public policy, \n     once marriage includes gay couples, groups who oppose gay \n     marriage are likely to be judged in violation of public \n     policy, triggering a host of negative consequences, including \n     the loss of tax-exempt status. Because marriage is not a \n     private act, but a protected public status, the legalization \n     of gay marriage sends a strong signal that orientation is now \n     on a par with race in the nondiscrimination game. And when we \n     get gay marriage because courts have declared it a \n     constitutional right, the signal is stronger still.\n       The method and the mechanism for achieving protected status \n     may be different for orientation and for race. Even the \n     Massachusetts supreme court, for example, declined to rule \n     explicitly that orientation is a protected class, subject to \n     strict scrutiny. But in Massachusetts, the end result may be \n     similar. If state courts declare gay marriage a \n     constitutional right, they are likely to see support for gay \n     marriage as state public policy.\n       On the cultural level, the declaration by a court that only \n     animus explains why anyone would treat two men differently \n     from a husband and wife represents an unfolding civil rights \n     logic that has real consequences. As Boston Globe columnist \n     Ellen Goodman put it, ``But if you give one church permission \n     to discriminate against gays, what's next? Permission to \n     discriminate against blacks/or Jews who want to adopt?''\n\n\n                                End Game\n\n       On April 15, the Boston Globe ran a story about three other \n     Catholic adoption agencies, in Worcester, Fall River, and \n     Springfield, that do not do gay adoptions. The story noted \n     that, for now, these agencies will not be punished for their \n     refusal. Constantia Papanikolaou, general counsel for the \n     state Department of Early Education and Care, said her agency \n     is holding off taking any action because the governor has \n     proposed legislation that would provide a religious exemption \n     for adoption agencies. ``We're going to wait and see how the \n     legislation plays out:,'' Papanikolaou said.\n       The reprieve is likely to be short-lived. Observers, \n     universally say the religious exemption has no chance of \n     passage, and in a few months, Mitt Romney will no longer be \n     governor. What then? The Boston Globe story provides a clue: \n     ``Gary Buseck, legal director of the Gay & Lesbian Advocates \n     & Defenders in Boston, said his group realizes that \n     Massachusetts will have a new governor next year, and it \n     expects that he or she will aggressively enforce the state's \n     antidiscrimination laws.''\n       Marc Stern is looking more and more like a reluctant \n     prophet: ``It's going to be a train wreck,'' he told me in \n     the offices of the American Jewish Congress high above \n     Manhattan. ``A very' dangerous train wreck. I don't see \n     anyone trying to stem the train wreck, or slow down the \n     trains. Both sides are really looking for Armageddon, and \n     they frankly both want to win. I prefer to avoid Armageddon, \n     if possible.''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the reason I want to have that printed \nin the Record is for people to be able to see there is another side to \nthis. When you redefine marriage and say it can now be between two \npeople of the same gender, what happens when an institution says that \nwe do not agree with that? Let's say a particular church says we do not \nagree with that; we believe that marriage is a union of a man and a \nwoman. They can then actually be at risk legally in their state for \nhaving that definition and that will be seen as discriminatory, to the \npoint you saw Catholic Charities doing adoptions in Boston having to \nleave because they were forced to recognize same-sex union adoptions \nand to provide those services. They said they disagree with this as a \nmatter of their religious tenets. So now they are no longer able to do \nadoptions in Massachusetts.\n  What happened to their religious freedom? That will be the same sort \nof path this will take. People will lose religious freedom if they hold \na different view. If they say: We believe marriage is a union of a man \nand a woman, it is a basic tenet of our faith--which it is for many \npeople and many faiths; this is a basic tenet, that marriage is a union \nof a man and a woman--now you are going to find that somehow \ndiscriminatory? Bigotry? They are going to be sued if they only \nrecognize marriage as a union of a man and a woman.\n  I hope my colleagues who want to vote against this start to think \nabout that because this is the trajectory many of these things have \ntaken when they get on this track.\n  I promised my colleagues I would show what happened in other \ncountries when they took on the issue of redefining marriage. We have \nother countries that have done this. The point I want to make is \nmarriage is a fundamental institution. We need to support it and grow \nit. If you redefine marriage, this is not the way to support and grow \nmarriage. This is not the way to support and grow marriage.\n  Some will say there will just be more marriages that will take place. \nThat is not the experience in other countries, particularly in northern \nEurope. They have redefined marriage, and it has not happened that way. \nYou get fewer marriages and you get more children born out of wedlock. \nIf you say, OK, we get more children born out of wedlock, the problem \nis you put children in a less than optimal environment. This goes \nagainst the Moynihan principle: You should always look at what you do \nto the next generation, and you should be as supportive as you can to \nthe next generation.\n  This chart shows, for the Netherlands, out-of-wedlock births and the \ncampaign for same-sex marriage in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is a \nparticularly interesting case because they had a very stable marital \nenvironment for a long period of time. In all of Europe, it was one of \nthe most stable marital environments in which children were born in \nwedlock, up until a very recent period of time. Up until 1980 you still \nhave less than 5 percent of children born out of wedlock. One of the \nlowest rates in all of Europe was in the Netherlands. Then, when they \nstarted to have this debate on same-sex marriage, a lot of things \nchanged in the Netherlands, the same way as happens here.\n  It goes in the court system. A small group of activists go in the \ncourt system and say: We can't change the overall body politic, but we \nwill go into the courts and we will use the courts to change society \nthat way. So we will get at them through the courts, the same play as \nhappening here.\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\n  In 1980 we have 5 percent of the total births out of wedlock. Then \nthe first court cases start hitting in the late 1980s and you are at or \naround a little above 10 percent, the first court cases hitting on \nsame-sex unions.\n  You can just see that pattern skyrocket, the percentage of total \nbirths of children born out of wedlock from when you start redefining. \nYou are speaking this into the culture and saying to the culture: \nMarriage isn't only the marriage of a man and a woman, it can be two \nmen, two women, whatever we want to define it to be. We need to do \nthis. It is something that is discriminatory otherwise.\n  You can just see that thing take off, the number of children born out \nof wedlock.\n  Again, if you say: That is just a consequence of it, I guess that is \nthe way it is, the problem is, that is not the way it was, nor is it \nthe way it needs to be, nor is it the way it should be for our children \nin the next generation. We should be strongly concerned about how that \nnext generation is raised and the nurturing environment they are raised \nin. Recognizing people are going to have trouble in marriages--they \nare, but we still don't want to take that optimal design away. We want \nto encourage that optimal design. We know that is the place where it \nworks the best.\n  I want to show a chart to make a couple of points. Ever since \nproposals for same-sex marriage began to be debated, the out-of-wedlock \nbirth rate in the Netherlands has soared. Same-sex marriage has \nincreased the culture separation of marriage from parenthood in the \nNetherlands.\n  Scandinavia is the area in the world that has the longest track \nrecord of same-sex unions. They have embraced it for the longest period \nof time. These are the countries, then, where we have the most \ndeveloped data. This is the law being used to change the culture.\n  I think I am paraphrasing Senator Moynihan--he was a great cultural \ncommentator--a comment he made in one of his books. He wrote that the \ncentral conservative truth is that culture is more important than \ngovernment. In other words, what your culture says it honors and \ndishonors is more important than government. That was central \nconservative truth.\n  The central liberal truth is, you can use laws to change culture. \nHere you see the effort to use a law to change culture taking place. \nThe system of marriage like same-sex registration partners established \nin the late 1980s has contributed significantly to the ongoing decline \nof marriage in this region. The rates for both first and second and \nlater births to cohabiting couples have risen substantially. Instead of \narguing that same-sex marriage encourages marriage among heterosexual \nparents, it is used as evidence that marriage is outdated. Where gay \nmarriage finds acceptance, marriage has virtually ceased to exist in \nsome areas.\n  We have a chart where 80 percent of the first-born children, as I \nmentioned, were born out of wedlock. Is that the trajectory we want to \ngo on? Is that where we want this society to go? Is that the sort of \ncountry we want to have in the future? Is that where we are willing to \ngo?\n  I think people are going to argue a whole bunch of different ideas. \nThere is going to be a lot of blustering about this, but the basic \nquestion is pretty simple. Do you believe and do you support that \nmarriage is a union of a man and a woman? Do you think that is the \nfoundation of society or not? People are going to yell and scream a lot \nof things about some form of bigotry, or that this is being done for \npolitical purposes, Or this or that, or they are going to try to say: \nIt doesn't hurt my marriage. I am just saying we have basic social data \non this vast social experiment of redefining marriage. We know where it \nheads.\n\n  I think if any of us really search in our own hearts we are pretty \ncomfortable that if you redefine this institution you are unlikely to \nget more of it. You are more likely to get less of it.\n  I hope people will ask the next question. Is this the best place to \nraise the next generation? Is this the best message to send on how to \nraise that next generation? I ask people to ask their own hearts--look \nat the data. We have the data on it, but ask in their own hearts \nbecause this is a big, deep, serious one. This is an important one.\n  I respect my colleagues who have a different position. I respect \npeople in the United States who have a different position on this \nparticular issue. There are good people on all sides of this issue. But \nthe data is what it is. People, if they just ask in their own hearts, \nthey know the right answer to this particular topic, as tough as it \nmight be. But this is an important one. It will be defined by us or by \nthe courts.\n  I will have additional information to present at a later date, but I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand some of my other \ncolleagues will be coming to the floor. I urge them to get to the floor \nto make statements. Tomorrow there will be more individuals coming in. \nIt will probably get crowded. So if people want to make an opening \nstatement, this will be an excellent time to do it.\n  While we are waiting for individuals to come to the floor, I want to \nshare some of the information we put together on this institution of \nmarriage so we can use the time profitably while we have this debate on \nthe floor.\n  I want to talk about the issue of what happens to children in this \ninstitution of marriage. I believe I am saying some of the things my \ngrandparents would say: Well, of course that is true, this kind of \nbasic thought or idea that you get in a society. But I think there are \nthings that need to be reiterated.\n  Now we have social data in the United States to say what happens when \nyou walk away from a fundamental institution, and one like marriage, \nthat it has as much trouble as it has.\n  I want to point to the number of children born out of wedlock in the \nUnited States and where we have been going with this data. In the \n1930s, 4 percent; 1950s up to 5.3 percent, now up to 34.6 percent.\n  We have roughly a third of the children in the United States born to \nsingle moms. It is not that you cannot have a good child-rearing \nsituation there, but, as we will show later on, it just gets much more \ndifficult to raise that child. It is important that child be raised \nbetween a loving couple.\n  I want to show the next chart, if we could, on this particular point. \nDevelopmental problems are less common in two-parent families. This is \nsomething I want to share. It is the sort of thing my parents would be \nlooking at and saying: Of course, we know that is the case. But now we \nhave the social data on it. You have single-parent families in the \ngreen, you have two-parent families in red. You see the lower half of \nclass academically--it is twice as likely to be in that single-parent \nhousehold; developmental delays, 10 percent more likely; emotional or \nbehavior problems, more than twice as likely to have problems in that \nparticular category as well, in that single-parent household.\n  I want to show the next chart and show this: Nearly 80 percent of all \nchildren suffering long-term poverty come from broken or never-married \nfamilies. I will cover this in more detail tomorrow because this is a \nproduct--partially, if not a majority product--of government policies \non welfare.\n  That penalizes people for getting married if they are in the welfare \nsystem.\n  As you can see, nearly 80 percent of children suffering long-term \npoverty come from broken and never-married families. One of the two \nbest ways known out of poverty in the United States is to get a job and \nget married. I will develop that thought more tomorrow. We are actual \ntrying some innovative experiments here in Washington, DC, on what can \nbe done and should be done to remove the marriage penalty from our \nwelfare policies and programs.\n  I see my colleague from Texas has joined us. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Kansas \ngiving me a chance to speak on the marriage\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\namendment. I know there is no one who cares more deeply or who has \nfought harder on this cause than the Senator from Kansas. I am glad to \njoin him on the Senate floor.\n  It has been kind of interesting to hear some of the comments that \nhave been made by the majority leader's stated intent to go to the \nmarriage amendment again this week and the kind of comments that some \nhave made about that decision. One of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle was on one of the Sunday morning interview shows, ``Meet \nthe Press,'' where he said:\n\n       You know, I think about this--the world is going to Hades \n     in a hand basket. We are desperately concerned about the \n     circumstance relating to avian flu. We don't have enough \n     vaccines, we don't have enough police officers, and we're \n     going to debate for the next 3 weeks, I am told, gay \n     marriage, a flag amendment, and God knows what else. I can't \n     believe the American people can't see through this. We \n     already have a law, the Defense of Marriage Act. We have all \n     voted--not where I voted and others voted. Look, marriage is \n     between a man and a woman, and States must respect that. \n     Nobody has violated that law. There has been no challenge to \n     the law. Why do we need a Constitutional amendment? Marriage \n     is between a man and a woman. What is the game going on here?\n  First of all, I would suggest to my colleague who made those \nstatements this last Sunday that protection of traditional marriage is \nimportant. This is not an issue which we have raised gratuitously or \nout of thin air. This is a fight which really has been brought to the \nAmerican people by those who would seek to use the courts to advance \ntheir agenda to call marriage between one man and one woman some form \nof discrimination or violation of their civil rights.\n  So this is not an issue which we have taken up without provocation or \nwithout cause but one which I believe is a legitimate and important \nresponse to the challenges we have seen in the courts across our \ncountry, including most famously in Massachusetts but elsewhere in \naddition.\n  Just to correct the misimpression of my colleague whose statements I \njust quoted, there are challenges to the Federal Defense of Marriage \nAct pending in a Federal district court in both Oklahoma and \nWashington.\n  It is simply wrong to suggest that we are introducing this issue \nwithout provocation or without cause, and it is simply erroneous to say \nthere have been no developments in the courts across our land that \ncause good people of good faith some legitimate concern about what the \nfuture of our marriage laws might be.\n  Tomorrow, we will vote on an amendment to the Constitution that would \ndefine marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Constitutional \namendments should obviously not be brought for light or insignificant \nreasons but, rather, to preserve some of the most fundamental \nprinciples of our way of life--and those principles deserving of the \nultimate legal protection.\n  The institution of marriage, notwithstanding some of the comments of \nsome, I believe is one of those fundamental principles deserving the \nultimate legal protection. It is arguably the fundamental building \nblock of our society. Throughout human history, traditional marriage \nbetween a woman and a man has been viewed as the ideal. It is the ideal \nenvironment in which to raise children. It is the ideal environment in \nwhich to promote families, the most important institution in our \nsociety. And, in my view, it should be protected and preserved.\n  I am not the only one who feels that way. The Federal Defense of \nMarriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman that \nthe Senator mentioned in the Sunday morning talk show, passed the U.S. \nSenate by a vote of 85 to 14 in 1996, obviously indicating that this is \nnot a partisan issue. It is not a sort of vocal minority that is saying \nthis is something we need to do. It got overwhelming support in 1996.\n  Moreover, legislators in 45 of 50 States have adopted State \nlegislation generally known as defense of marriage acts. In recent \nyears, the American people across the Nation have gone to the polls to \nsupport State constitutional amendments designed to protect marriage \nand have done so with overwhelming numbers. Voters in my State adopted \na constitutional amendment in 2004 with 76 percent support. In fact, in \nthe 19 States that have considered State constitutional amendments, all \nhave passed, and with an average support of 71.5 percent. This year, \nseven more States will consider constitutional amendments preserving \ntraditional marriage.\n\n  You might legitimately ask, given all of this activity at the State \nlevel, why is there a need for a Federal constitutional amendment? \nIndeed, even with the Federal Government passing the Defense of \nMarriage Act in 1996, why do we need the added protection? The fact is, \ndespite the overwhelming will of the American people, traditional \nmarriage has been undermined by activist judges and continues to face \nchallenge after challenge after challenge in State and Federal courts \nthroughout the Nation.\n  It is important to look back at what first signaled that traditional \nmarriage was in jeopardy in the courts. It goes back to the decision of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, Lawrence v. Texas. The most remarkable thing \nabout that decision is not the result but how the Court came to the \nresult it reached. There is the case that struck down the antisodomy \nlaws in Texas law.\n  Indeed, it was widely anticipated that the Court would overrule the \ndecision in Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld the antisodomy law in \nGeorgia. But in this case, the Court not only struck down this \nantisodomy law on equal protection basis--Justice Kennedy, writing for \nthe majority, created a new constitutional right, which raised the \nspecter of legal challenges to traditional marriage laws. That new \nconstitutional right created in that decision was one that said you are \nfree in one's intimate sexual and personal relationships such that the \nConstitution now prohibits any sort of restriction by legislation or \nofficial policy on those intimate relationships between adults.\n  At the time, Justice Scalia rightly noted that the opinion ``leaves \non pretty shaky grounds State laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex \ncouples.''\n  Within months of that decision, the Federal constitutional decision \nin Lawrence v. Texas was used by the Massachusetts Supreme Court as the \nbasis to interpret its State constitution to require same-sex marriage, \nwriting that ``no amount of tinkering with language will eradicate the \nstain of traditional marriage.''\n  This almost seems surreal to me. The last thing I thought I would end \nup doing coming to Washington and to the Senate is that I would be \nstanding here on the Senate floor having to defend the institution of \ntraditional marriage. I thought some things were a given and there \nwould be other issues that we would be arguing about and fighting about \nand debating about--the great issues of the day. But we are here \nbecause of the provocation of not only overly broad decisions made by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court but essentially State courts now finding the \nlicense in other courts to say that traditional marriage laws are \nsomehow unlawful discrimination.\n  It is also important to note why this should be handled at the \nFederal level.\n  I already mentioned that State voters, when given an opportunity, had \nreadily passed State constitutional amendments, or Texas legislators, \nas in my State, readily would pass a statute. But we all know that \nunder our Federal scheme of government, State laws, including State \nconstitutional provisions, cannot withstand a decision by a Federal \ncourt, that the U.S. Constitution will not allow those State \nprovisions, either of statute or constitution, to stand if indeed it is \nfound to be in violation of the United States Constitution. That is the \nvery real threat here which has already been realized in Nebraska's \nFederal court and which now is pending in at least two other courts.\n  In the 108th Congress, as chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights, I chaired three \nhearings on the subject of marriage. These included a hearing focusing \non the statutes of the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which I \nmentioned a moment ago; another studied whether an amendment to the \nConstitution was necessary at all; and a third that addressed the \nspecific amendment language that had been introduced in the Senate and \nwhich is now the subject of the pending resolution. Through that \nprocess, we learned\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\ntime and time again from legal experts across the political spectrum \nthat the only way for Congress to permanently protect and preserve \nmarriage against judicial activism is through an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I think it is also important for people to understand, even when \nCongress passes by the appropriate supermajorities a resolution like \nthis to amend the Constitution, that it also then has to go to the \nStates, and three-quarters of the States have to ratify that resolution \nas well before it becomes a constitutional provision.\n  Some have said that this issue is not sufficiently important to \njustify an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But I would point out \nthat the 27th amendment to the U.S. Constitution adopted in 1992 \nprovides that ``no compensation for Members of Congress shall take \neffect until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'' In \nother words, Congress can't give itself a pay raise without having to \nactually stand for election during an intervening period of time. I \nwould humbly suggest that protecting the institution of marriage is at \nleast as important as the pay provisions governing Congress.\n  People can decide for themselves where it matches up on the spectrum, \nbut it is at least as important as that. To suggest that somehow the \nConstitution is so sacrosanct that we cannot offer amendments to the \nConstitution is to deny government of the people, by the people, and \nfor the people. This is our Constitution. It is the people's \nprerogative to say whether we will amend the Constitution, and if so, \nwhat goes in that provision.\n  We already know there are some judges who are using their \ninterpretive power under the Constitution to rewrite it or to amend it \nunder the guise of interpretation. So the question is not whether it \nwill be amended; the question is, Who will amend it? I believe we the \npeople should reserve our rights to determine the laws that govern our \nsociety and that govern our families.\n  Through the hearing process I mentioned a moment ago, I came to \nbelieve that a constitutional amendment was entirely appropriate. We \nknow 2 years ago the Senate failed to overcome a filibuster against \nproceeding to the amendment by a vote of 48 to 50. That was \nunfortunate. Now we have another chance, yet some question whether we \nshould take advantage of that opportunity, even accusing supporters of \nsome type of political expediency in even raising this issue.\n  The simple answer is that the institution of marriage continues to be \nunder assault by an organized, coordinated campaign of legal activists \nseeking to quietly but methodically undermine this institution through \nlawsuits filed around the country. Since the 2004 vote, State courts in \nWashington State, New York, California, Maryland, and Oregon have found \ntraditional marriage laws to be unconstitutional. As I mentioned a \nmoment ago, a Nebraska judge has struck down a State constitutional \namendment on the same basis, claiming that somehow, after more than 200 \nyears of our Constitution's existence, during which time we all assumed \ntraditional marriage laws were sacrosanct, that somehow all of a sudden \nthese judges have divined that, no, the Founding Fathers really \nintended to find that traditional marriage laws were discriminatory and \nunconstitutional. It would be laughable if it were not so serious.\n  At the present time, nine States face challenges of their traditional \nmarriage laws. Some challenges are in State court, and some are based \non Federal constitutional claims. Even others challenge the Defense of \nMarriage Act.\n  Last week, I read in the New York Times that New York's marriage laws \nare now before that State's highest court, as well. Numerous other \nlawsuits have been filed and will continue to be filed across the \nNation even as voters take to the polls in support of laws protecting \nmarriage.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate faces an important and necessary question: Do we \nbelieve that traditional marriage is important enough to deserve full \nlegal protection? In my view, the answer to that simple question is a \nsimple yes. Marriage must be protected by the Constitution, and the \nAmerican people should preserve their right to choose for themselves \nhow to define our society and not have invalidation of traditional \nmarriage forced on them by activist courts.\n  This amendment language would provide that protection and that \nreassurance. It would define marriage as the union of a man and a woman \nand would protect the American people against judicial activism and \nbeing forced to live in a country with laws that do not reflect their \nwill. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and to move this \nimportant amendment to the Senate for full consideration.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to address a couple other issues \non this marriage amendment and at the same time urge my colleagues who \nwant to speak on this particular amendment to come to the Senate so we \ncan have as fulsome debate as possible. If any Member comes to the \nfloor, I will yield to them so they can get a chance to put their \ninformation forward.\n  There has been a developing body of thought, and I think this is a \nvery important one to look at, the issue of religious freedom that \ndevelops from redefining marriage. I have entered into the Record \nalready an article by Maggie Gallagher catching quite a bit of interest \nbecause it is of particular concern. I will develop this more fully.\n  It is becoming increasingly apparent that same-sex marriage poses a \nsignificant threat to religious liberties. Scholars on both the left \nand the right agree that same-sex marriage has raised the specter of \nthe massive and protracted battle over religious freedom. Where courts \nimpose the same-sex marriage regime as a constitutionally guaranteed \nright, a multitude of new religious liberty conflicts will inevitably \narise at every point where the law touches marriage and is applied to \nindividuals, businesses, nonprofits, and even churches and synagogues. \nUnfortunately, and especially in the era of Employment Division v. \nSmith, once a court has recognized the right to same-sex marriage, \nreligious organizations are unlikely to find much relief in free \nexercise claims because of this decision of Employment Division v. \nSmith.\n\n  Same-sex marriage proponents argue that sexual orientation is like \nrace and that opponents of same-sex marriage are, therefore, like \nbigots who oppose interracial marriage. Once same-sex marriage becomes \nlaw, that understanding is likely to become controlling.\n  Legally, same-sex marriage will be taken by courts as proof that a \npublic policy in support of same-sex marriage exists, so in States with \nsame-sex marriage, religiously affiliated schools, adoption agencies, \npsychological clinics, social workers, marital counselors, et cetera, \nwill be forced to choose between violating their own deeply held \nbeliefs and giving up government contracts, tax-exempt status, or being \ndenied the right to operate at all. If a religious social service \nagency refuses to offer counseling designed to preserve the marriage of \na same-sex marriage couple, it could lose its tax-exempt status. \nReligious schools would either have to tolerate conduct they believed \nto be sinful or face a cutoff of Federal funds. It is already \nhappening, as we have seen in Massachusetts with Boston's Catholic \nCharities being forced out of the adoption business entirely rather \nthan violating church teachings on marriage and family.\n  Free speech could also be under threat as sexual harassment in the \nworkplace principles are used by nervous corporate lawyers to draw \nspeech prohibitions on the marriage issue. Fear of litigation will \nbreed self-censorship. One expert predicts ``a concerted effort to take \nsame-sex marriage from a negative right to be free of state \ninterference to a positive entitlement to assistance by others.''\n  Some people say the answer is conscious exemption, but no legislative \nexemption can offer the same protection to traditional religious groups \nas a\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\nconstitutional amendment. As one of the religious scholars has pointed \nout, even to attempt to create legislative protections would be a \nstaggeringly difficult and complex project. And what the legislature \ngives, it can take away later. That is what has been happening all over \nEurope. Protecting marriage now will spare us many intense religious \nliberty conflicts down the road.\n  The lesson in this is clear. There is a lot more at stake in the \nbattle over same-sex marriage than the marriage issue itself, important \nas that is. Our Nation's long tradition of religious liberty faces its \ngreatest threat in a generation or more such that the very ability of \nreligiously affiliated organizations to exist and operate is under \nthreat.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a serious look at this issue and \npeople can look at it and say: Wait a minute, it will not really \ndevelop that you will have this take place. But that is what took place \nin Massachusetts, where you had a Boston-based group, Catholic \nCharities, that does adoptions, but within the Catholic Church they \nsay: We do not agree with same-sex adoptions, as far as same-sex \nmarriage adopting children, and we are not going to provide that \nservice to same-sex couples because of the beliefs of our organization, \nthe tenets of our faith. Then they were run out of Boston and out of \nMassachusetts, rather than be forced to practice something that was \nagainst the tenets of their faith.\n  I don't think that is a route we want people to go or be forced to \ngo, to give up the tenets of their faith in order to do something so \nbasic as adoption, or in this case something so basic as performing \nmarriages, like the one I attended on Saturday that was at a church. \nAre we going to say that churches which will not do same-sex couple \nunions cannot perform marriages at all because if they just perform \nthem for heterosexual couples and not for homosexual couples, that is \nbigotry, that is against a fundamental right of people of same-sex \nunions, so if they are going to do any marriages, they must do all \nmarriages?\n  People need to think about the profound implications of recognizing \nthis right as it moves on through the courts and the court system. I \ndon't think that is the intent people particularly have or want to have \nor that we should have.\n  I had printed in the Record an article entitled ``Banned in Boston. \nThe coming conflict between same-sex marriage and religious liberty.'' \nThat was wherein a scholar by the name of Maggie Gallagher, in quite an \nextensive article, an article that you start to recognize when we \nredefine a fundamental institution such as marriage--you get into \nissues and problems such as this which will take place.\n  A couple of Members are arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act is \nsufficient. I don't think that at all does the job of defining and \nsupporting the institution, the fundamental institution of marriage and \nprotecting that.\n  First, it is a statute. It is not a constitutional amendment. As \nsuch, as a Federal statute, it can be overruled and overturned by a \ncourt. We need to be able to have this at the constitutional level, \nwhere it is deciding fundamental constitutions or the ones being raised \nnot at a statutory level. Define that and develop that a little bit \nmore somewhat later.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I understand Senator McConnell will be \nclosing today's session. I wanted to finish with a point I made earlier \ntoday. I have talked about other countries and what took place when \nthey redefined the institution of marriage. And it has a great deal of \ndifficulty for this society. It results in fewer marriages. There was a \nletter released 2 years ago that was addressed to parliamentarians \naround the world debating same-sex marriage. It was done by a group of \nfive Dutch scholars. This is one of the countries I have cited that has \nredefined marriage, saying that it can be same-sex unions. They were \nraising concerns about gay marriages and the negative effect on the \ninstitution of marriage in the Netherlands. It was published July 8, \n2004, in a leading Dutch newspaper:\n\n       There are good reasons to believe the decline in Dutch \n     marriage may be connected to the successful public campaign \n     for the opening of marriage to same-sex couples in The \n     Netherlands.\n\n  The letter signatories came from several academic disciplines, \nincluding social sciences, philosophy, and law. The scholars cautioned \nagainst attributing all of the recent decline in marriage to same-sex \nunions.\n\n       There are undoubtedly other factors which have contributed \n     to the decline of the institution of marriage in our country. \n     Further scientific research is needed . . .\n\n  They concluded:\n\n       At the same time, we wish to note that enough evidence of \n     marital decline already exists to raise serious concerns \n     about the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in \n     its traditional form.\n\n  The reason I cite this is that there are going to be a number of \npeople saying all you can find are going to be conservative scholars to \nsay that this has had a negative impact on the Netherlands. That is not \nthe case. They are saying things having a negative impact there. They \nnoted in recent years there is statistical evidence of Dutch marital \ndecline including ``a spectacular rise in the number of illegitimate \nbirths.'' That is their words. By creating a social and legal \nseparation between the ideas of marriage and parenting, these scholars \nwarn that same-sex marriages may make young people in the Netherlands \nfeel less obligated to marry before having children. Publication of the \nletter of warning was accompanied by a front page news interview. In \nthe interview, a Dutch law professor said that ``the reputation of \nmarriage as an institution in Holland is in serious decline.'' ``The \nDutch need to have a national debate on how to restore traditional \nmarriage. The decision to legalize same-sex marriage, in my view, has \nbeen an important contributing factor to the decline in the reputation \nof marriage.''\n  One of the letters is from a Dutch citizen who heads a research unit \non culture and communications at Nottingham Trent University. He has \ndone a comparative study of family life and sexual attitudes in the \nNetherlands and Britain. He is also acquainted with research on \nAmerican marriage. He believes that gay marriage has contributed to the \ndecline in the reputation of Dutch marriage. It is ``difficult to \nimagine'' that the Dutch campaign for gay marriage did not have serious \nsocial consequences, and he cites an intensive media campaign based on \nthe claim that marriage and parenthood are unrelated.\n  The Dutch scholars are not the only ones to assert that the \ninstitution of marriage has been weakened by legal and social \nrecognition of same-sex unions. In January of this year, a French \nGovernment commission examining possible changes in French law \nrecommended against legalizing same-sex marriage. It is not my custom \nto cite the French in the U.S. Senate. I often disagree if I do cite \nthem. But listen to what they were recommending. This commission came \nout against legalizing same-sex marriage based on its examination of \nthe impact of legalized same-sex marriage in Netherlands, Belgium, \nCanada, and Spain, the four countries where it is legal, as well as \nEuropean countries. We have a French commission that looked at where \nthese laws have taken other countries already. The French have not gone \nthere yet. They are saying, let's study this, which I think would be a \nwise thing for us to do. Let's look and see what has happened in other \ncountries, as the French have done. Their report--the parliamentarian \nreport on the family and the rights of children--came out against a \nright to marriage for same-sex couples. This is certainly no \nconservative think tank group saying this. This is the French \nGovernment. The commission came to this conclusion when it considered \nthe consequences for the child's development and the construction of \nhis or her identity of creating a fictitious affiliation by law, two \nfathers and two mothers--this is their statement--which is biologically \nneither real or plausible. They were heard on this point and they \nfailed to persuade a majority of the commission\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\nto support recognizing the rights of a child or marriage for same-sex \ncouples.\n  That is a French commission examining other European countries that \nhave legalized same-sex unions saying this is not good for France or \nfor the raising of the next generation.\n  In addition to these sources, some of the most influential \nsociologists in Europe agree that same-sex marriage undermines the \ntraditional institution of marriage, even if they welcome the change. \nSo, in other words, they are saying we might welcome the change, but \nthis is going to hurt marriage. They agree that same-sex marriage \ndoesn't reinforce marriage, as many of its proponents argue but, \nrather, upends marriage and helps foster acceptance for a variety of \nother forms, such as single parenting, cohabitation, and multiple \npartner unions, which only serve to weaken traditional marriage. This \nis what happens when you move away from your standard of marriage being \nthe union of a man and a woman. It weakens the institution and moves in \na lot of other types of arrangements.\n  Britain's Anthony Giddens, one of the most influential sociologists \nin all of Europe, wrote that modern marriage is being emptied of any \nmeaning beyond the emotional bonding of adults, something he quotes as \nthe ``pure relationship.'' This notion of the pure relationship is \nbeing widely used by European social scientists to explain why so many \nparents now avoid marriage. Having a child is an experiment in an adult \nrelationship that could possibly lead to marriage, rather than a reason \nto get married in the first place. It is clear that the institution of \nmarriage has been defined down. It is simply a shared affection between \ntwo adults.\n  This is precisely how the advocates of same-sex marriage define \nmarriage--no intrinsic connection to marriage. European sociologists \nsay that a whole host of changes, like single parenting, cohabitation, \nand multiple partner unions, point to the unraveling of marriage as an \ninstitution designed to keep mothers and fathers together and for the \nsake of their children.\n  German sociologists, Ulrich Beck and Elizabether Beck-Gernsheim, also \nhighly contend that raising rates of parental cohabitation and out-of-\nwedlock births indicate that marriage, while seemingly alive, is in \nfact dying. The old notions of marriage and family are giving way to \ndomestic situations in which individuals make up their own rules. \nIndividual choice hollows out the old institutions, such as marriage \nand family, that used to guide our choices. These authors actually \nembrace and celebrate the instability of the brave new family system, \nholding that family disillusion teaches children a hard, but necessary, \nlesson about our new social world.\n  Is that the sort of message we want to send? It is the message that \nis coming through the courts if we don't define this legislatively. The \nwork of Norwegian sociologist Keri Moxnes, frequently used by European \nsocial scientists, is to put the movement in context. Moxnes welcomes \nsame-sex marriage not as a way of ratifying marriage itself but as an \ninnovation that affirms and advances marriage's ongoing decline. She \ndefines marriage as being an increasingly empty institution.\n  Is that the message we want to send? In the U.S, many sociologists \nare of the same opinion. One argues that these wrenching social changes \ndisrupt conventional sexual and domestic relations and undermine \ntraditional marriages, but also believes that all of these are signs of \nthe decline of the traditional family. From same-sex unions, to births, \nto cohabiting parents, to mothers who are single by choice, release \nindividuals from the constraint of traditional marriage.\n  I want to conclude on that point to reaffirm what is really taking \nplace here, and that is the redefining of a fundamental institution. We \ncan say this is somehow a politicized debate, that it is not important. \nBut from what we are seeing in countries that have taken up this \ndebate, it is clearly important. It goes to the heart of the \nfundamental institution of marriage and weakens it further. It is an \ninstitution that we want to support, and this move destroys it further, \ntakes it down further. That has been the research results that have \ntaken place in Europe.\n  This is a big debate. It is a big and important problem and issue. We \nshould not kid ourselves about what this is about by saying we don't \nreally need to do this now. If we don't do it and it is redefined by \nthe courts, that is the track we are on--tearing down this institution \naround which we have built families. Is that what the American people \nwant to do? We have seen them vote in 45 States saying, no, we want \nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman.\n  We should not kid ourselves. This is seriously about the future of \nthe culture of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nAmerican who has made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. \nLCpl William Leusink died on May 22 when he struck an improvised \nexplosive device while on a dismounted patrol in the Al Anbar Province \nin Iraq. Lance Corporal Leusink was a marine who was assigned to the \nMarine Corps Base in Kaneohe Bay, HI. He was 21 years old.\n  I would ask that all Americans join me today, and add to the more \nthan 1,100 Iowans who attended his funeral, in remembering and honoring \nLance Corporal Leusink. The loss of this courageous and patriotic \nAmerican is felt throughout Iowa and in particular the town of Maurice \nwhere he grew up and graduated from Sioux Center High School. My \nthoughts and prayers are with Lance Corporal Leusink's wife, Miranda, \nhis parents, Bill and Elaine, his brother and two sisters as well as \nall those other family and friends who are grieving the loss of this \nyoung man.\n  Lance Corporal Leusink, who I understand was known as ``B. Jay'' \namong family and friends, will be remembered for his faith, \nathleticism, and patriotism. His faith was especially important to him. \nJust as he often took with him to the football field his favorite \nverse, Phillipians 4:13, written on tape, it was this faith that led \nhim to enlist to serve his country.\n  Pastor Wayne Sneller of the First Reformed Church of Maurice said, \n``B. Jay always wanted to be a Marine and to serve his country. He \nbelieved in what he was doing and knew that the Lord was going to be \nwith him.''\n  In an e-mail to the pastor, Lance Corporal Leusink had written, ``I \nknow where I am going. I enlisted for a reason, and that was to make a \ndifference.''\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Lance Corporal Leusink for his \nsacrifice. I am greatly saddened by his passing but deeply proud and \ngrateful for what he gave for America. His loss remains tragic but he \ndied a true patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5425-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VA RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to highlight the wonderful \nwork being conducted by VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research Program. \nVA research programs continue to lead in developing innovative and \neffective methods of treatment that have been its trademark since World \nWar II. From its inception, the VA research program has made landmark \ncontributions to the welfare of veterans and the entirety of the \nNation.\n  Past VA research projects have resulted in the first successful liver \ntransplant performed in the United States, development of the cardiac \npacemaker, and pioneered the technologies that led to the CT and MRI \nscans. VA research also played a vital role in treating tuberculosis, \nrehabilitating blind veterans, and more recently, launched the largest \never clinical trial of psychotherapy to treat PTSD.\n  In 2004, VA research took on leadership of a $60 million nation wide \nstudy--funded by the National Institute on Aging and other partners--to \nidentify brain changes linked with Alzheimer's disease. VA research \nalso established a major center of excellence, in partnership with \nBrown University and MIT, to develop state-of-the-art prosthetics for \nveteran amputees. For the last 60 years, VA research has been extremely \ncompetitive with its private sector counterparts.\n  I would like to recognize a few research projects that can \npotentially benefit veterans living in remote and rural areas across \nthe country, including veterans living in my home State of Hawaii, \nwhere the geography creates challenges in accessing care. One study, \nTelemedicine and Anger Management Groups for PTSD Veterans in the \nHawaiian Islands, builds on preliminary research supporting the use of \ntechnology for improving access to mental health care for veterans \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD. The study focuses \non the effectiveness of conducting anger management group therapy \ntreatment through video-teleconferencing.\n  I also applaud the Pacific Islands Division of the National Center \nfor PTSD in Honolulu. Their efforts have improved access to PTSD \ntreatment in remote areas and contributed to the knowledge and \nunderstanding of cultural factors related to PTSD. I commend the \nPacific Islands Division for its collaboration with the Department of \nDefense. I hope that VA and DOD continue to work together on future \nresearch projects aimed at providing better treatment for \nservicemembers and veterans alike.\n  In 2004, VA Research Currents, a publication that highlights the \nexcellent work of the VA research community, reported on a study which \nfound that men who walked less than a quarter of a mile each day were, \non average, nearly twice as likely to develop dementia compared to \nthose that walked more than 2 miles a day.\n  This research project was led by Robert D. Abbott, Ph.D, of the \nUniversity of Virginia; senior author Helen Petrovitch, M.D.; and \ncoauthor G. Webster Ross, M.D., of the Honolulu VA Medical Center. \nAccording to the researchers, the findings suggest that promotion of an \nactive lifestyle could promote better health later on in life.\n  The last study I would like to discuss examines the correlation \nbetween drinking coffee and preventing Parkinson's disease. It has been \nsaid that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this \ncase, VA researchers and their colleagues found that consuming at least \n28 ounces of coffee can lower the risk of Parkinson's disease. Lead \nauthor G. Webster Ross, M.D., along with colleagues from the Kuakini \nMedical Center, used participant dietary nutritional data from the \nHonolulu Heart Program for their findings. The study helped scientists \nbetter understand the mechanisms of Parkinson's disease and found a \nstrong correlation between coffee drinkers and low rates of Parkinson's \ndisease. Dr. Ross did note, however, that it was too early to recommend \ndrinking coffee to prevent Parkinson's disease.\n  To ensure that VA can continue these studies and tremendous \nsuccesses, VA research must be given the funds to do the job. VA \nresearch funding must be at a level that takes into account not only \ninflation but new challenges as well. Most importantly, adequately \nfunding VA research helps to ensure that VA remains an attractive \noption to our best and brightest in medicine. Chairman Craig and I, \nalong with 60 of our colleagues, have recommended $432 million in \nfunding for VA research next year, notwithstanding that this number is \njust to maintain current services and avoid any personnel or project \ncuts.\n  Just last week, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on \nthe VA research program, hearing firsthand the challenges researchers \nface in not only finding new methods of treatment but in funding, too. \nI came away from the hearing with a better understanding of the VA \nresearch program's needs, as well as the challenges we in Congress can \nhelp them overcome.\n  That is why I, along with 61 of my colleagues, have recommended an \naddition to the VA research budget and not a decrease. Less funding for \nVA research at this point in time will have negative consequences down \nthe road, when VA inherits the servicemen and women currently serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Let us not fail in our responsibilities of \nproviding adequate funding so VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research \nProgram can continue to innovate and save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5425-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5425-S5426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       ANNIVERSARY PROCLAMATION FOR SISTERS OF MERCY IN ST. LOUIS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, June 27, 2006 marks the 150th \nanniversary of the arrival of the Sisters of Mercy in St. Louis, MO. \nFounded in Dublin, Ireland, in 1831 by Mother Catherine McAuley, the \nSisters have dedicated themselves to serving the sick, poor, and \nuneducated, particularly women and children.\n  In 1856, at the request of St. Louis Archbishop Peter J. Kenrick, six \nSisters of Mercy journeyed by train and boat from New York to St. \nLouis, arriving on June 27, 1856, to open St. Francis Xavier Parish \nSchool. During their first year in St. Louis, in addition to opening \nthis new school, the Sisters visited the sick, poor, and jailed; \nstarted a Sunday school program for African-American women and girls; \nbegan an industrial school for children with one parent; and opened an \norphanage. Despite many challenges including lack of money, food and \nclothing, the Sisters persevered with determination and faith. They \nexpanded their ministry during the Civil War, visiting war prisoners at \nthe hospital and jail.\n  Growing enrollment at St. Francis Xavier School necessitated the \nopening of a new school in 1871. The Sisters of Mercy have continued \nthe focus on education in St. Louis. Over the past 150 years since \ntheir arrival in St. Louis, more than 177 Sisters of Mercy have served \nin more than 20 parish elementary schools and 5 high schools in \nMissouri. These schools include Christ the King School in University \nCity, Mercy High School in University City, St. Joan of Arc School in \nSouth St. Louis, Annunciation School in Webster Groves, and Mercy \nJunior College in Webster Groves.\n  Recognizing the ever-growing health care needs of the community, in \n1871 the Sisters converted the old St. Francis Xavier School to an \ninfirmary. The hospital struggled financially because many patients \nwere unable to pay, but the Sisters never turned patients away due to \nlack of funds. Instead, Sisters even sacrificed their mattresses and \nbedding to accommodate patients. To meet the increased need for their \nhealth care services, the Sisters moved the hospital to two other St. \nLouis sites before relocating to its current location on South New \nBallas Road in 1963.\n  While better known for their work in education and health care, the \nSisters have served the people of the St. Louis metropolitan area in \nnumerous other ministries including working with immigrants, providing \nspiritual direction, hosting groups at their conference and retreat \ncenter, and serving the poor.\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n  Since their 1856 arrival, the Sisters of Mercy have continuously \nserved the residents of St. Louis and its surrounding areas. They \novercame many obstacles to carry on their services and today we \nrecognize their dedication with our deepest gratitude and respect.

INC.\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today to speak in honor of the \n150th anniversary of Stupp Bros., Inc., from the great State of \nMissouri. Five generations of the Stupp family in Missouri have devoted \nthemselves to the success and innovation of this homegrown St. Louis \nbusiness. On this milestone in the history of Stupp Bros., Inc., I \ncommend the company leaders and employees for their contributions to \nthe worldwide business community.\n  In 1856, the city of St. Louis was a tremendous boomtown and the \nbustling inland port at the seat of the Mississippi River for pioneers \nheading westward. Thousands of immigrants flocked to the city from \nItaly, Ireland, and Germany in search of a better life for their \nfamilies. One German immigrant named Johann Stupp settled in St. Louis. \nThere he founded J. Stupp and Bro., Blacksmiths, a shop focused \nprimarily on repairing tools and machinery parts.\n  Like many Missourians at the time, Stupp became deeply involved in \nthe Union effort as the Civil War unfolded. During the conflict, Stupp \nassisted the work of James Eads in crafting a fleet of ironclad \ngunboats for use in battle by the Union Army. Shortly following the \nwar, the blacksmith shop faced hard times. Yet with the aid of his sons \nGeorge, Peter, and Julius, Stupp rebuilt the business as Stupp Bros. \nSouth St. Louis Iron Works, receiving a charter of incorporation from \nthe State of Missouri for building and repairing iron and steel \nstructural work.\n  After Johann Stupp passed away in 1915, the Stupp brothers continued \nto manage the company with great success. Recognizing the fast changing \nand ever-modernizing world in which they lived, the Stupp brothers \nreorganized the company's services to keep up with the needs of a \nrapidly growing United States. Like their father during the Civil War, \nthe Stupp brothers supported World War I by fabricating parts for \nLiberty ships. In World War II, the Stupp Bros. received the Army Navy \nE-Award for its construction of 176 LCTs, which landed allied troops on \nbeaches throughout the world in the defense of freedom.\n  During much of the 20th century and still today, the Stupp Bros. \nfamily of companies has provided bridge fabrication, structural steel \nfor commercial buildings, custom-made piping for oil and gas, steel \nline pipe coatings, and community banking services. Some of their \naccomplishments have been designing carrying structures for the \nDepartment of Defense to protect missiles from attack, building two \nstraddle-carrier transporters to assist the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, NASA, for the ``moon shot,'' and completing a 796 \nmile natural gas pipeline spanning from northwest Texas to Illinois.\n  Despite its impressive contributions to the country during both war \nand peace time, the mark of Stupp Bros. is nowhere greater than in the \ncity of St. Louis. As the Kiel Center took shape in 1933, Stupp Bros. \nprovided the steel for its construction. Later in 1978, the Stupp Bros. \nfabricated over 7,000 tons of steel for the First National Bank \nhighrise building in the downtown area. Perhaps of most interest to me, \ngiven my particular fondness for the St. Louis Cardinals, is that Stupp \nBros. fashioned the floodlighting and electronic scoreboard for \nSportsman's Park, the original Busch Stadium.\n  Recognizing its responsibility to the community, Stupp Bridge has \nalso been a civic contributor to the greater community. In 1951, the \ncompany launched a charitable trust to be known as Stupp Bros. Bridge \nand Iron Co. Foundation Trust. Over the last 50 years, the foundation \nhas generously provided millions of dollars in contributions to local \nand national charities. One of its most notable actions is the \nestablishment of a scholarship program which supports the college \neducation for the son or daughter of a Stupp employee.\n  The story of Stupp Bros., Inc, is one of American determination, \ninnovation, and service. For 150 years, the company has been a staple \namong the St. Louis business and industry community. Today, under the \nleadership of Robert P. Stupp, John P. Stupp, Jr., and R. Philip Stupp, \nJr., Stupp Bros. continues to leave its mark upon the landscape of our \nState. On behalf of all Missourians, I extend my best wishes and \nwarmest regards to the Stupp Bros., Inc., family of companies, and \nespecially to their dedicated employees and company leaders for their \n150 years in the great State of Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5426-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN HONOR OF WENDY BUEHLER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize Wendy \nBuehler, president of Life Skills, on the anniversary of her 25th year \nof leadership and service to individuals with developmental \ndisabilities.\n  Life Skills, a nonprofit charitable group, has served Missourians \nwith disabilities since 1964. Today they continue to connect \nindividuals with disabilities to the greater community of St. Louis. \nOver 1,400 children and adults have been assisted by Life Skills, \nenabling them to live in their own homes, seek and hold jobs, and make \nlasting ties to the city of St. Louis.\n  For over three decades, Wendy Buehler has provided leadership and \nservice to Life Skills. Starting out as a direct support staff person, \nshe has steadily provided compassion and leadership, leading to her \ncurrent role as president of the organization. Wendy Buehler has \nremained committed to providing supported employment services so people \nwith developmental disabilities have the skills necessary to secure and \nretain meaningful and competitive employment.\n  Wendy Buehler's commitment to helping individuals with disabilities \nlive quality and independent lives provides a lasting service for all \nof Missouri. Having a disability can pose many challenges for \nindividuals to live independently as part of the greater community. \nWendy Buehler has worked to ensure Missourians with disabilities have \nthe resources they need to live their lives as healthy and as \nindependently as possible.\n  Today I recognize Wendy Buehler for her dedication and commitment to \nthe disability community of the State of Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5426-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5426-S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HUGH PATTERSON\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the life and \nthe courage of Hugh Patterson, who died last week at the age of 91. Mr. \nPatterson was the publisher of the Arkansas Gazette in 1957 when the \nArkansas National Guard was called up to prevent nine young Blacks from \nenrolling at Central High School in Little Rock. This hugely divisive \nissue not only had to be reported on in the Gazette, it had to be \nevaluated on the editorial page. Mr. Patterson's initial reaction was \nthe right one; support desegregation. He later recalled that he said, \n``Well, of course, it's got to be recognized that the Supreme Court \ndecision was the only decision that could have been made. We have to \nrecognize that this is a transitional time in terms of public policy \nand it will, perhaps, take some time for that to be realized, but \nthere's just no option to this. It's a fundamental matter.'' Mr. \nPatterson was the paper's first publisher, responsible for policy as \nwell as business, but he was not the only one making major editorial \ndecisions. He had to help convince the owner, his father-in-law, J.N. \nHeiskell, and he did.\n  The reaction to the newspaper's stand for desegregation was severe. \nThere were boycotts against advertisers and mobs out to prevent \ndelivery trucks from delivering papers. Circulation fell. The financial \nlosses were significant, and harmful on a larger scale because Mr. \nPatterson's philosophy was that profits should be put back into the \npaper, which he saw as a public service to the State. The Gazette won \ntwo Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage in 1957 and they were well \ndeserved. As today's Democrat-Gazette\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nsaid last week, ``Dante reserved a special place in his Inferno for \nthose who would stay neutral in times of moral crisis. No one need \nbother looking for the Arkansas Gazette there. Fully aware that his \npaper had much to lose, Hugh Patterson never hesitated to stake it all \non what he knew to be right.''\n  Mr. Patterson grew up in Pine Bluff and learned the printing \nbusiness. After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, he \njoined the Gazette in 1946. He became publisher in 1948 and stayed in \nthat job for 38 years. There was much more to his career there than the \nevents of 1957, and to fill in those details I ask that his obituary \nfrom the Democrat-Gazette be printed after my remarks. Arkansas is much \nthe better for his voice in a time of crisis and his many other \ncontributions at the helm of the Gazette for so many years.\n  The material follows.\n\n           [From the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, May 30, 2006]\n\n   Hugh Patterson, Chief of Arkansas Gazette for 38 years, Dies at 91\n\n                           (By Noel E. Oman)\n\n       Hugh B. Patterson Jr., the longtime publisher of the former \n     Arkansas Gazette, died Monday. He was 91.\n       Patterson was publisher of the Gazette from November 1948 \n     until December 1986, when the newspaper was sold to Gannett \n     Co. Inc. Patterson's 38 years directing the ``oldest \n     newspaper west of the Mississippi'' began in the era of the \n     mechanical typesetting machine and lasted into the age of \n     computer-generated print.\n       His tenure coincided with Little Rock's public school \n     desegregation crisis in 1957. The Gazette won two Pulitzer \n     Prizes in 1958, one to the newspaper for public service and \n     the other to Executive Editor Harry S. Ashmore for editorial \n     writing.\n       ``This first thing I think of, as you might guess, is the \n     1957 school crisis, and the Gazette's performance through \n     that period,'' said Roy Reed, professor emeritus of \n     journalism at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. \n     Reed was a reporter at the Gazette for eight years, later \n     joining The New York Times as a national and foreign \n     correspondent.\n       ``It's not fully appreciated outside of a very small group \n     the role Hugh Patterson had. He was absolutely vital to \n     leading the paper to the position it held: Obey the law and \n     the court decision,'' Reed said.\n       Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Publisher Walter E. Hussman Jr. \n     said Monday that Patterson should be remembered for his \n     leadership of the Gazette ``during its greatest years,'' in \n     the late 1950s.\n       ``It was a difficult time, and he certainly responded,'' \n     Hussman said.\n       Al Neuharth, who founded USA Today and helped build the \n     Gannett newspaper empire that purchased the Gazette, said he \n     was sorry to hear of Patterson's death.\n       ``He was considered by all of us who knew him as a real \n     Southern gentleman, real dedicated newspaper person and I \n     considered him a good friend,'' Neuharth said. ``He did a lot \n     for the state of Arkansas.''\n       Patterson was born on Feb. 8, 1915, in Cotton Plant, Miss. \n     He came to Arkansas with his family in 1917. He was educated \n     in the public schools of Pine Bluff and at Henderson State \n     Teachers College, now Henderson State University, in \n     Arkadelphia. He also did special studies in graphic arts and \n     advertising in Washington, D.C., and New York.\n       He married the former Louise Heiskell of Little Rock on \n     March 29, 1944. His wife was the daughter of J.N. Heiskell, \n     who was president and editor of the Gazette from 1902 until \n     his death in 1972. The Pattersons had two sons, Carrick H. \n     Patterson and Ralph B. Patterson, both of Little Rock.\n       Ralph Patterson said Monday that his father emphasized \n     putting profits back into the newspaper. ``That was very \n     important to him: That the paper not be a cash cow, but a \n     public service to the state.''\n       Before World War II, Patterson worked primarily in the \n     commercial printing business in Pine Bluff, Little Rock, New \n     York and Washington. His first job in the field was at Adams \n     Lithographic and Printing Co. of Pine Bluff when ``I was \n     about 14 or 15, I suppose,'' Patterson recalled in a 2000 \n     interview with Roy Reed, who is also director of the Arkansas \n     Gazette Project at the University of Arkansas. The project is \n     an effort to collect and preserve the newspaper's history.\n       ``The Depression was coming on and they had to cut down on \n     staff some... so I melted type metal and washed the platen \n     presses, and I was the shipping clerk,'' Patterson said.\n       After dropping out of Henderson State because his family \n     didn't have enough money, Patterson purchased his first car, \n     a 1931 Chevrolet for $75, on credit, and traveled the roads \n     of south Arkansas and north Louisiana selling printing \n     supplies for the Smith Co., another Pine Bluff printing firm, \n     according to the Reed interview.\n       In 1936, he moved to Little Rock to work for Democrat \n     Printing and Lithograph Co., where he earned $20 a week.\n       Patterson served in the Army Air Corps in World War II, for \n     the most part, in Mobile, Ala., where he specialized in \n     supply and maintenance management. He left the service with \n     the rank of major.\n       Patterson pondered forming a management consulting company \n     when the war ended. But during a weekend trip to Little Rock, \n     he had dinner with his father-in-law, who appreciated his \n     printing background.\n       Heiskell, whose son had died in the war, had a proposition.\n       ``Mr. Heiskell said, `You are the only one with related \n     experience and as soon as you can get out, I'd like for you \n     to come to the paper,''' Patterson recalled in the Reed \n     interview.\n       Patterson joined the Gazette as national advertising \n     manager in 1946. Two years later, Heiskell made him the \n     newspaper's first publisher, responsible for policy as well \n     as the business. Before that, the Gazette had a business \n     manager to run the business and an editor who was responsible \n     for newspaper policy.\n       James O. Powell, the Gazette's editorial page editor from \n     1959-1986, said Patterson recruited him from the Tampa \n     Tribune. ``He was an excellent publisher, a good businessman, \n     who knew the newspaper industry well indeed,'' Powell said. \n     Patterson ``knew well the pursuit of the public interest \n     using the newspaper.''\n       On the business side, Patterson consolidated the ownership \n     of the Gazette under the Heiskell family and successfully \n     fought off an attempt by financier Witt Stephens, who owned \n     Gazette stock, to obtain a controlling interest, a move that \n     Patterson enjoyed retelling to Reed.\n       ``He thought I was a yokel,'' Patterson recalled, laughing. \n     ``I suppose that was the best poker hand I ever played.''\n       Patterson, relying on his experience in commercial \n     printing, also developed financial controls that showed the \n     relationship between costs and revenue, which he found few in \n     the industry knew.\n       ``It was absolutely new,'' Patterson told Reed. ``And so I \n     developed this thing, and I wrote a paper on it, and it was \n     adopted by the Institute of Newspaper Controllers and Finance \n     Officers.''\n       The Gazette's controller, Jack Olsen, a former Internal \n     Revenue Service accountant, fine-tuned Patterson's accounting \n     system. Olsen eventually went to work for the St. Petersburg \n     Times, The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune, using the \n     budgeting process Patterson developed.\n       Patterson also organized the newspaper into more sections, \n     added stock tables, more news services and beefed up the \n     Sunday newspaper with the addition of color comics and Parade \n     Magazine.\n       On policy, it was Patterson who set the Gazette on the \n     course that won it the Pulitzer.\n       Patterson was a regional chairman of the National Council \n     for Public Schools when he was interviewed by a reporter for \n     The Associated Press about implementing the May 17, 1954, \n     U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, \n     which found that segregation in schools was inherently \n     unequal and in violation of the Constitution.\n       ``I said, 'Well, of course, it's got to be recognized that \n     the Supreme Court decision was the only decision that could \n     have been made,'' Patterson recalled. ``We have to recognize \n     that this is a transitional time in terms of public policy \n     and it will, perhaps, take some time for that to be realized, \n     but there's just no option to this. It's a fundamental \n     matter.'''\n       A wire service story containing those quotes appeared in \n     the Gazette. Upon returning to Arkansas, Executive Editor \n     Ashmore wondered whether Heiskell would fire Patterson, \n     Patterson said. About a week later, the subject came up with \n     Heiskell, who was over at the Patterson home to visit his \n     grandchildren. Patterson said he told him, ``Well, you know, \n     deep down we're talking about your grandchildren's \n     generation. And we feel that we can't misrepresent these \n     issues to them. We can't bring them up feeling that what is \n     inevitable is not true.''\n       ``That was the last time it was ever discussed,'' Patterson \n     told Reed. ``And when Ashmore heard about that, for the first \n     time, he was able to deal more realistically with the \n     question textually in the editorials.''\n       Jim Johnson, a former associate justice of the Arkansas \n     Supreme Court and the Democratic Party nominee for governor \n     in 1966--and no favorite of the Arkansas Gazette's editorial \n     page--said his battles with the Gazette over segregation \n     amounted to a ``political vendetta.'' But he said he always \n     respected and admired Patterson's civility and tenacity.\n       ``He was a master at his craft and a worthy, worthy \n     adversary. He was keenly effective. You had to admire it. As \n     my daddy would say, he learned me something.''\n       Arkansas Times columnist and former Gazette employee Ernie \n     Dumas said Patterson never really got credit for his role in \n     1957 and 1958, critical years for the Gazette and the state.\n       ``Everybody has also attributed the heroism and courage to \n     Heiskell and Ashmore. Hugh played a very strong role in \n     bringing Harry and Heiskell around, that despite the peril to \n     the Gazette, they should take a stand against Orval Faubus.''\n       By the mid-1980s, Patterson and the Gazette began feeling \n     pressure from the Arkansas Democrat, a newspaper that the \n     Walter E. Hussman family had acquired in 1974 and converted \n     from an afternoon daily to a morning newspaper to compete \n     head-to-head with the Gazette. In the early 1980s, he met \n     with representatives of Times-Mirror Corp. and the New York \n     Times Co. in an effort to sell the paper to a company that \n     could allow the Gazette to continue publishing.\n       Unable to find a suitor, the Gazette filed a federal \n     lawsuit accusing the Democrat of\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\n     predatory practices. The Democrat contended that it resorted \n     to innovative but legal business practices because the \n     Gazette was the dominant paper. In March 1986, a jury found \n     in favor of the Democrat.\n       Patterson sold the Gazette to the Gannett Co. a short time \n     later, and often professed unhappiness with the changes the \n     national chain made to the state's ``gray lady.''\n       On Oct. 18, 1991, Gannett shut down the Gazette and sold \n     the Gazette's assets and name to Little Rock Newspapers Inc., \n     now called Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Inc. The company is a \n     corporate subsidiary of WEHCO Media Inc. whose chief \n     executive officer, Walter E. Hussman Jr., is publisher of the \n     Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which began publishing under that \n     name on Oct. 19, 1991.\n       Throughout his newspaper career, Patterson was active in \n     civic affairs. He was a member of the Little Rock Planning \n     Commission for 20 years. In 1957, Patterson helped initiate \n     the city manager form of government for Little Rock. He also \n     helped create the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, now \n     known as Metroplan.\n       Patterson was awarded the Freedom House Freedom Award in \n     1958 and the Arkansas Council of the National Conference of \n     Christians and Jews Humanitarian Award in 1987. Also in 1987, \n     Patterson was named Arkansas Journalist of the Year by the \n     University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Patterson also served \n     as president of the Southern Newspaper Publishers \n     Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5428-1", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO PASTOR BRIAN KEITH SINCLAIR\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nPastor Brian Keith Sinclair of Hartford, CT. Pastor Sinclair is the \nfounder and visionary of Triumphant World Outreach Ministries, which \nwill be celebrating its fourth anniversary on June 10.\n  Triumphant is an outreach organization that seeks to give inner-city \nyouth, teens, and young adults a sense of hope for the future. The \norganization declares in its mission statement an intention to ``reach \nthe lost at any cost.'' Triumphant offers a number of programs and \nservices for those youth and their parents who choose to participate, \nintended to keep young people off the streets, away from the \ndestructive forces of drug use and violence that ensnare far too many \nyoung people. Since the ministry opened in 2002, countless youths have \ntaken advantage of its homework clubs and job placement services and \nenjoyed its various artistic and dance programs. The ministry also \narranges many recreational activities and outings for the youth, \nincluding trips to amusement parks, fishing lessons, and minor league \nbaseball games.\n  In 2002, Pastor Sinclair delivered a sermon to the South \nCongregational Church in Hartford entitled ``Now Perform the Doing of \nIt.'' In the sermon Pastor Sinclair stressed to his audience that the \ntime to reach out to young people is now, that those who are at risk \ncan't wait to be helped. Anyone who has taken a look at what Pastor \nSinclair has done over the past few years will tell you that Pastor \nSinclair has applied this sense of urgency to all the work he has done.\n  In recent years, Pastor Sinclair has expanded his community service \nefforts at a breathtaking pace. He has launched various initiatives in \nmajor cities and towns throughout Connecticut. He serves as the \ndirector of the Hands for Change program in New Jersey, which also has \nsatellite programs in Massachusetts and New York. Recently, Triumphant \nannounced plans to expand its program in Hartford to the city's Park \nStreet Frog Hollow neighborhood.\n  Pastor Sinclair and the rest of the staff at Triumphant are shining \nexamples of how through hard work and selflessness, a small group of \npeople can pull together to strengthen their community. When I think \nabout how Triumphant will be celebrating its fourth anniversary, all I \ncan really do is hope that it will be around for many more years to \ncome. When I look back at what Pastor Brian Keith Sinclair has done for \ncommunities throughout the great State of Connecticut, I can't help but \nbe filled with a deep sense of gratitude and hope for the future. It is \ntruly an honor to say thank you, Pastor Sinclair, Connecticut is a \nbetter place because of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5428-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5428-3", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5428-4", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 5253.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Arizona \n     relative to urging the United States Congress to enact an \n     agricultural commuter worker permit program; to the Committee \n     on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2018\n\n       Whereas, agriculture along the southern United States \n     border is often seasonal and concentrated within tight time \n     frames in which highly perishable crops must be produced and \n     harvested in a timely manner or the entire crop could be \n     lost; and\n       Whereas, farmers along the southern border face calamities \n     of weather, pests and market conditions along with stringent \n     requirements to provide a safe and wholesome supply of food \n     for the citizens of the United States and the world; and\n       Whereas, agriculture requires a stable and reliable source \n     of labor in order to produce enough food to meet the needs of \n     our citizens so the United States does not become dependent \n     on foreign nations for our food supply; and\n       Whereas, the total economic impact of Arizona agriculture \n     for 2004 was approximately $9.2 billion, providing an \n     integral economic contribution throughout our state; and\n       Whereas, agriculture requires access to a stable and \n     reliable pool of foreign workers due to an aging and \n     increasingly educated native born workforce and employees \n     leaving agricultural work for other industries; and\n       Whereas, current agricultural work visa programs fail to \n     provide timely access to necessary labor; and\n       Whereas, an agricultural commuter worker permit program can \n     complement both border security and workplace enforcement \n     while allowing a natural flow of labor: and\n       Whereas, an agricultural commuter worker permit program \n     will help abate many of the social and human costs in terms \n     of crime and deaths in the desert; and\n       Whereas, an agricultural commuter worker permit program \n     will allow willing agricultural workers to commute from their \n     country of origin to work in the United States while \n     maintaining their country of origin residency.

That the United States Congress include an agricultural \n     commuter worker permit program as part of immigration reform \n     legislation that allows foreign workers to commute across the \n     border daily to work in the United States if they have passed \n     criminal and security background checks and a medical \n     examination and if they possess tamper-resistant biometric \n     authorization cards.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to memorializing the United States Congress \n     to adopt and transmit to the states for ratification an \n     amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ensure that \n     apportionment is based on citizens and not non-citizens; to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 105\n\n       Whereas, Reapportionment based on the counting of non-\n     citizens in the federal census is adversely affecting the \n     United States Congress and the American political process. \n     Since 1960, Michigan and other Midwestern states have had to \n     sacrifice congressional representation to the faster-growing \n     states of Florida, California, and Texas. The redistributions \n     of congressional seats in the 1970 and 1980 censuses were \n     almost completely due to internal migration; citizens moving \n     from the Northeastern and Midwestern states to the South and \n     West. However, since 1990, immigration has been driving \n     reapportionment. During that decade the number of non-\n     citizens grew by almost 680,000 annually. By March 2005 there \n     were nearly 22 million non-citizens in this country, \n     comprising 7.4 percent of the total population; and\n       Whereas, Immigration is having a significant effect on the \n     distribution of congressional seats for several reasons. \n     First, seats are apportioned based on each state's total \n     population relative to the rest of the country, including \n     legal immigrants and illegal non-citizens. Second, Congress \n     permits a significant number of legal immigrants to enter \n     this country and permits hordes of illegals to brazenly flout \n     our immigration laws by crossing our porous borders \n     unchallenged. According to the 2000 census, there were more \n     than 18 million non-citizens in the United States, equaling \n     the population of almost 29 congressional districts. Further, \n     non-citizens are not equally distributed throughout the \n     nation. In 2000, over 9 million non-citizens lived in 3 \n     states and nearly 70 percent resided in 6 states; and\n       Whereas, The impact of non-citizens on apportionment is \n     tremendous. In 2000, the presence of non-citizens caused \n     Michigan and 8 other states to lose congressional seats. \n     Moreover, Michigan was one of 4 states to lose seats directly \n     to the illegal immigrant havens of California, Texas, New \n     York, and Florida. It is important to realize that Michigan \n     did not lose a congressional seat because its population was \n     in decline. Instead, legal and illegal immigration caused the \n     population of other states to grow at an even faster pace; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to adopt and transmit to the states for \n     ratification an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would \n     ensure that apportionment is based on citizens, and not non-\n     citizens; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-346.

Res. 499\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     taxpayers of the United States between $1,500,000 and \n     $3,000,000 in his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2006, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2006, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/06/05/senate-section/article/S5432-2", "month": "06", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5432-S5433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.
