Mr. President, the Congress is continuing to work to pass \nlegislation to give Terri Schiavo another chance at life. Let me update \nall of our colleagues on where we are right now.\n  On Saturday, yesterday, we reached a bipartisan, bicameral agreement \non a legislative solution. At that point, we initiated a procedural \nprocess to act on the bill, a process which brought both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate back today to complete action on this \ncritically important matter.\n  Shortly, we will stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair. \nThis action will allow the Senate to come back into session at a \nmoment's notice to consider the legislation. The Senate will remain \nhere throughout the afternoon and, if necessary, late into the evening \nin order to act immediately on this bill once it is ready.\n  Because Terri Schiavo is being denied lifesaving nutrition this very \nmoment, time is of the essence.\n  Let me summarize again for everyone what the agreed-upon legislation \ndoes. Under this bill, Terri Schiavo will have another chance. She will \nhave another opportunity to live. The bill allows Terri's case to be \nheard in Federal court. More specifically, it allows a Federal district \njudge to consider a claim on behalf of Terri Schiavo for alleged \nviolations of constitutional rights or Federal laws relating to the \nwithholding of food, water, or medical treatment necessary to sustain \nher life.\n  I am heartened by the way Congress is uniting in a bipartisan, \nbicameral way in this unique situation. Now is the time for us to act. \nTerri deserves it. I remain committed as leader to pass legislation to \ngive Terri Schiavo one more chance at life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3099-7", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 686 introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 686) for the relief of the parents of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Judicial Discretion Under the Schiavo Relief Bill\n\n       Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to seek clarification from \n     the majority leader about one aspect of this bill, the issue \n     of whether Congress has mandated that a Federal court issue a \n     stay pending determination of the case.\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n       Mr. FRIST. I would be pleased to help clarify this issue.\n       Mr. LEVIN. Section 5 of the original version of the \n     Martinez bill conferred jurisdiction on a Federal court to \n     hear a case like this, and then stated that the Federal court \n     ``shall'' issue a stay of State court proceedings pending \n     determination of the Federal case. I was opposed to that \n     provision because I believe Congress should not mandate that \n     a Federal judge issue a stay. Under longstanding law and \n     practice, the decision to issue a stay is a matter of \n     discretion for the Federal judge based on the facts of the \n     case. The majority leader and the other bill sponsors \n     accepted my suggestion that the word ``shall'' in section 5 \n     be changed to ``may.''\n       The version of the bill we are now considering strikes \n     section 5 altogether. Although nothing in the text of the new \n     bill mandates a stay, the omission of this section, which in \n     the earlier Senate-passed bill made a stay permissive, might \n     be read to mean that Congress intends to mandate a stay. I \n     believe that reading is incorrect. The absence of any state \n     provision in the new bill simply means that Congress relies \n     on current law. Under current law, a judge may decide whether \n     or not a stay is appropriate.\n       Does the majority leader share my understanding of the \n     bill?\n       Mr. FRIST. I share the understanding of the Senator from \n     Michigan, as does the junior Senator from Florida who is the \n     chief sponsor of this bill. Nothing in the current bill or \n     its legislative history mandates a stay. I would assume, \n     however, the Federal court would grant a stay based on the \n     facts of this case because Mrs. Schiavo would need to be \n     alive in order for the court to make its determination. \n     Nevertheless, this bill does not change current law under \n     which a stay is discretionary.\n       Mr. LEVIN. In light of that assurance, I do not object to \n     the unanimous consent agreement under which the bill will be \n     considered by the Senate. I do not make the same assumption \n     as the majority leader makes about what a Federal court will \n     do. Because the discretion of the Federal court is left \n     unrestricted in this bill, I will not exercise my right to \n     block its consideration.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the tenth amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution provides:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  This is a principle of Federalism which, I believe, is not being \nfollowed by Congress in enacting this legislation.\n  That the misfortunes of life vested upon Theresa Marie Schiavo are a \nhuman tragedy, no one can deny. I said my prayers, as did many \nAmericans, as we attended religious services this Palm Sunday.\n  I believe it unwise for the Congress to take from the State of \nFlorida its constitutional responsibility to resolve the issues in this \ncase.\n  The Florida State court system has adjudicated the issues to date. \nThis bill, in effect, challenges the integrity and capabilities of the \nState courts in Florida.\n  That the Federal system of courts can move properly and fairly \najudicate the equities among the diverse parties in this particular \ncase is a conclusion with which I cannot agree.\n  Greater wisdom is not always reposed in the branches of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Apart from constitutional issues, I am concerned for the institution \nof the Senate, a body in which I have been privileged to serve for over \na quarter of a century.\n\n  I view service in the Senate as that of a trustee--preserve this \nvenerable body, its traditions and time-tested precedents, for future \ngenerations. It is one of a kind in their troubled world.\n  The drafters of this bill endeavored to write in provisions to \nprevent this unique law--a private relief bill is the term used in our \nprocedures--from becoming a ``precedent for future legislation'' \n(section 7).\n  I do not believe the legislation can, or will, block further \npetitions from our citizens. Who can say there are not other tragic \nsituations across our land today; who can predict what the future may \ninflict by way of personal hardship upon our citizens?\n  I fear the door has opened and Congress, which by constitutional \nmandate is entrusted to pass laws for the Nation, will again and again \nbe petitioned to deal with personal situations which are the \nresponsibility of the several States.\n  I respect the views of those who drafted and moved this bill swiftly, \nwith limited debate, through the Senate. I value the sanctity of life \nno less fervently than they, for I had the great fortune of being the \nson of a doctor who devoted his entire life to healing and caring for \nthe sick and injured. My father's principles have been my compass for \nmy life.\n  It is not easy to be in opposition to this legislation, but I have a \nduty to state my views in keeping with my oath to support the \nConstitution as I interpret it.\n\n\n                     in defense of senate tradition\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, opponents of free speech and debate claim \nthat, during my tenure as majority leader in the United States Senate, \nI established precedents that now justify a proposal for a misguided \nattempt to end debate on a judicial nomination by a simple majority \nvote, rather than by a three-fifths vote of all Senators duly chosen \nand sworn as required by paragraph two of Senate rule XXII. Their \nclaims are false.\n  Proponents of the so-called nuclear option cite several instances in \nwhich they inaccurately allege that I ``blazed a procedural path'' \ntoward an inappropriate change in Senate rules. They are dead wrong. \nDead wrong. They draw analogies where none exist and create cock-eyed \ncomparisons that fail to withstand even the slightest intellectual \nscrutiny.\n  Simply put, no action of mine ever denied a minority of the Senate a \nright to full debate on the final disposition of a measure or matter \npending before the Senate. Not in 1977, not in 1979, not in 1980, or in \n1987--the dates cited by critics as grounds for the nuclear option. The \nCongressional Research Service confirms that only six amendments have \nbeen adopted since the cloture rule was enacted in 1917, and ``each of \nthese changes was made within the framework of the existing or \n`entrenched' rules of the Senate, including rule XXII.''\n  In none of the instances cited by those who threaten to invoke the \nnuclear option did my participation in any action deny the minority in \nthe Senate, regardless of party, its right to debate the real matter at \nhand.\n  Let us examine each of these so-called precedents in greater detail.\n  October 3, 1977--Enforcing Senate Rule XXII Against Improper Post-\nCloture Delay: In 1977, the Senate invoked cloture on S. 2104, \ndescribed as ``a bill to establish a comprehensive natural gas \npolicy.'' Shortly thereafter, two Senators began a postcloture \n``filibuster by amendment,'' after a supermajority of the Senate had \nalready chosen to invoke cloture (under the Senate rules) and had made \nclear its desire to bring debate on the bill to close. Though the \nSenate had voted to invoke cloture by an overwhelming vote of 77 to 17, \ntwo Senators nonetheless continued to offer amendments, to request \nquorum calls, and to offer amendments to amendments to preserve and \nextend time on the bill post-cloture. Their efforts, as confirmed by \nthe Chair, ran directly contrary to the purpose of rule XXII, which is \nto limit debate.\n  The tactics employed were sufficiently egregious that the Senate \nspent 13 days and 1 night debating the bill, which included 121 \nrollcalls and 34 live quorums. Cloture having been invoked by an \noverwhelming vote, I then made the point of order that:\n\n     when the Senate is operating under cloture, the Chair is \n     required to take the initiative under rule XXII to rule out \n     of order all amendments which are dilatory or which on their \n     face are out of order.\n\n  Critics have alleged that my actions in this instance ``cut off \ndebate'' and somehow constitute a precedent for ending a filibuster of \na judicial nominee by 51 votes before cloture has been invoked. But \nthat argument is erroneous.\n  The Senate was operating postcloture. The Senate had voted 77 to 17 \nto end debate. I didn't do that; the Senate took that action.\n  If anything, my actions clarified that rule XXII means what it says. \nThe text of rule XXII provides explicitly that, once cloture is \ninvoked, ``no dilatory motion, or dilatory amendment, or amendment not \ngermane shall be in order.'' Therefore, once Members have voted to \ninvoke cloture, dilatory amendments or actions are simply out of order. \nSenators still retain their hour of postcloture debate. Senators still \nhave the right of appeal.\n  Some have falsely alleged that I even acted to impede debate on that \nappeal,\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nbut they are mistaken yet again: Under the provisions of rule XXII, \nappeals from rulings of the Chair were not and are not debatable \npostcloture.\n  Nothing that was done in 1977 changed rule XXII or sent a shock wave \nthrough the Senate. Nothing that was done restricted the right of \nSenators to wage a filibuster against a nominee or legislation before \ncloture is invoked. No action taken affected the fundamental right of \nSenators to debate the natural gas deregulation bill; they had already \ndebated the bill and, of their own volition, had decided to end their \ndebate by an overwhelming vote. Instead, I sought to end dilatory \ntactics postcloture, when such tactics were, and remain today, \nprohibited by the plain text of paragraph two of rule XXII. I simply \nsought a ruling from the Chair to enforce Senate rule XXII.\n  In fact, when, in 1977, my point of order was sustained, the Chair in \nso doing noted that the point of order was consistent with the purpose \nof rule XXII, which ``is to require action by the Senate on a pending \nmeasure following cloture within a period of reasonable dispatch.'' \nWhen the Chair's ruling in support of my point of order was thereafter \nappealed, that appeal was tabled in the Senate by another overwhelming \nvote of 79 to 14.\n  No Member of the minority in the Senate lost his right to debate the \nnatural gas deregulation bill. Their ability to debate the bill was not \ntampered with or impeded in any way. Each Senator retained the right to \ndebate, under the Senate rules, the bill both precloture and in the \nhour that was provided to each Senator under rule XXII postcloture.\n  Thus, contrary to current assertions, in 1977, a strong, bipartisan, \nsupermajority of the Senate, supported by, among others, Minority \nLeader Howard Baker and myself, endorsed this necessary effort to halt \npostcloture dilatory tactics consistent with Rule XXII of the Standing \nRules of the Senate. That is completely unlike the so-called nuclear \noption that is currently being discussed by some in the Senate. I \nsought to enforce rule XXII; not to destroy it.\n  January 15, 1979--Enforcing Rule XXII Against Improper Post-Cloture \nDelay: At the beginning of the new Congress in 1979, I, as Senate \nmajority leader, introduced a resolution to make various changes to \nSenate rule XXII, the bulk of which addressed circumstances \npostcloture. Recently, on March 10, 2005, a Senator spoke on the Senate \nfloor and stated that this resolution serves as a precedent for the \nnuclear option. However, my resolution served to enforce rule XXII, not \nto destroy it. My introduction of S. Res. 9 was influenced by the \npostcloture dilatory tactics that were suffered by the Senate during \nits consideration of the natural gas deregulation bill during the \npreceding Congress.\n  My efforts in that regard were supported, on a bipartisan basis, by \nMinority Leader Howard Baker who stated in response to my introduction \nof S. Res. 9:\n\n       I point out, as I am sure most of our colleagues are aware \n     and will recall, that in the case of the most recent post-\n     cloture filibuster, it was the majority leader and the \n     minority leader, with the distinguished occupant of the \n     chair, the Vice President, in the chair at the time, who \n     managed to establish a line and series of precedents that \n     created the possibility to at least accelerate the \n     disposition of the controversy and conflict.\n       The point of the matter is that this is not, nor has it \n     been, a matter that is purely partisan in its character. . . \n     .\n\n  He added:\n\n       I share with the majority leader the belief that the post-\n     cloture filibuster, a creature of fairly young age and recent \n     development, is one that the Senate has not focused on \n     adequately. I am prepared to do that and I want to do that.\n\n  As the minority leader in the Senate recognized at the time, the text \nof rule XXII provides explicitly that, once cloture is invoked, ``no \ndilatory motion, or dilatory amendment, or amendment not germane shall \nbe in order.'' Therefore, once Members vote to invoke cloture, dilatory \namendments or actions are impermissible. No proposal of mine in 1979 \nrestricted the right of Senators to filibuster a nominee or a piece of \nlegislation prior to the invocation of cloture, consistent with Rule \nXXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate. And the position I took at \nthe time enjoyed support on both sides of the aisle.\n  November 9, 1979--Strengthening Rule XVI Against Legislation on \nAppropriations Bills: Opponents of free speech and debate in the Senate \ncite a third event as a supposed basis for their proposed ``nuclear \noption.'' In November 1979, during consideration of a Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill, Senator Stennis raised a point of order \nthat an amendment to change the rate of pay for military personnel, \nwhich had been offered by Senator Armstrong, constituted legislation on \nan appropriations bill and was therefore out of order under the express \nterms of Senate rule XVI. Legislative amendments to appropriations \nbills violate Senate rule XVI. However, by precedent, the ``defense of \ngermaneness'' arose. According to this practice, which evolved outside \nthe text of rule XVI, if the House has acted first to ``open the door'' \nto legislate on an appropriations measure, a Senator could respond with \na legislative amendment, provided that it is germane to some House \nlegislative language. If a point of order were made that an amendment \nconstituted legislation, a ruling by the Chair on that question would \nbe preempted by a vote on the germaneness of the amendment to the House \nlanguage. This practice was justified only if the House had included \nlegislative language in its bill. But this practice made a mockery of \nthe rule if the House had not included any legislative language.\n  When Senator Stennis raised the point of order that the Armstrong \namendment constituted legislation on an appropriations bill, Senator \nArmstrong asserted the defense of germaneness, meaning that his \namendment was germane because it was relevant to the House bill. At \nthat point, I made the following point of order:\n\n       I make the point of order that this is a misuse of the \n     precedents of the Senate, since there is no House language to \n     which this amendment could be germane and that, therefore, \n     the Chair is required to rule on the point of order as to its \n     being legislation on an appropriation bill and cannot submit \n     this question of germaneness to the Senate.\n\n  I was concerned that, as a threshold matter, the amendment should not \nbe considered because there was no House language to which the proposed \namendment could possibly be germane. The Chair noted that while this \nwas a case of first impression, my point was ``well taken,'' and he \nsustained my point of order. Senator Armstrong then appealed the ruling \nof the Chair, and I moved to table that appeal. My motion was adopted \nby the Senate.\n  Critics claim that my actions in this instance were contrary to the \nplain language of rule XVI, because rule XVI at paragraph four states, \n``all questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule, when \nraised, shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided without \ndebate.'' But their assertion that I acted in a manner contrary to rule \nXVI is false.\n  My point of order went not to the issue of legislating on an \nappropriations bill, but to a different issue: The concept of ``defense \nof germaneness.'' Nowhere in rule XVI is there a reference to the \nconcept of ``defense of germaneness.'' The source and subsequent \napplication of defense of germaneness and its threshold test is not \nrooted in any Senate rule. Instead, it dates back to a precedent, which \nis identified by Riddick's Senate Procedure as a ``theory,'' which was \n``enunciated'' by Vice President Marshall in 1916, that, \n``Notwithstanding the rule of the Senate . . . when the House of \nRepresentatives opens the door and proceeds to enter upon a field of \ngeneral legislation . . . the Chair is going to rule, but of course the \nSenate can reverse the ruling of the Chair, that the House having \nopened the door the Senate of the United States can walk through the \ndoor and pursue the field.''\n  Second, my efforts were to avoid the misuse of precedent and thereby \nenforce the express provisions of Senate rule XVI, which prohibits \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. It is only by precedent that \ngermaneness justified a legislative amendment on an appropriations \nbill, and only if the House opened the door. My goal was to preserve \nproper precedent and strengthen rule XVI; not to weaken it, as the \nnuclear option would do to rule XXII. My actions did not establish any \nprecedent to destroy the right of extended debate in the Senate. In \nfact, the Senate's action affected only the ability to offer certain \namendments to particular legislation, and, even then, the Senate \nminority's rights to appeal a ruling of the Chair were fully preserved.\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n  March 5, 1980--Enhancing the Right of Debate of Nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar: Critics of extended debate also reference a motion \nI made in 1980 to proceed directly to a nomination on the Executive \nCalendar. They claim that this created a precedent making a motion to \nproceed to any nomination on the Executive Calendar nondebatable. It \ndid no such thing.\n  At the time, a nondebatable motion to go into executive session \nautomatically put the Senate on the first treaty on the Executive \nCalendar. This meant that moving to the Executive Calendar required \nconsideration of treaties before nominations, simply because the \nSenate's Executive Calendar prints both treaties and nominations in the \norder in which they are reported out of their respective committees of \njurisdiction, and treaties are then printed in the first section of the \nCalendar.\n  But the placement of treaties and nominations on the Senate Calendar \nwas not and is not based on any great precedent or legal requirement \nthat would elevate treaties to a position of prominence greater than \nnominations. Instead, the placement of treaties and nominations on the \nSenate Executive Calendar is simply the result of a clerical printing \nconvention. There has never been a logical reason for the Senate to \ndistinguish between a motion to proceed to a nomination and a motion to \nproceed to the first treaty. Because there is no substantive reason \nthat the Senate should have to go to treaties before being able to \nconsider a nomination, it seemed logical that the Senate should be able \nto proceed directly to a nomination on the Executive Calendar.\n  My motion to proceed directly to the first nomination, rather than a \ntreaty, did not inhibit or frustrate Senate debate in any way. The \nChair explicitly confirmed that it did not contravene any precedent or \nStanding Rule of the Senate. Moreover, it also did not restrict the \nability of the Senate to filibuster the nomination itself. In fact, \ndisposition of the nomination remained, as it is today, fully debatable \nin several respects. A nomination remains fully debatable when it comes \nbefore the Senate, and motions to proceed from one nomination to \nanother are also fully debatable when the Senate is in executive \nsession.\n  May 13, 1987--Enforcing Rule IV Against Improper Debate of a Motion \nTo Approve the Journal: In 1987, a Republican minority led a filibuster \nseeking to prevent the Senate from considering a defense authorization \nbill. Prior to moving to the bill, I sought unanimous consent that the \nJournal of the preceding day ``be approved to date,'' a routine request \nin the course of Senate business. The Journal is the official record of \nthe proceedings of the Senate, and under Senate rule IV, the Journal of \nthe preceding day must be read following the prayer by the Chaplain \nunless, by nondebatable motion, the reading of the Journal is waived.\n\n  In this instance, Senator Dole objected to my request that the \nJournal be approved by unanimous consent, and the question of whether \nthe Journal should be approved was put to a vote. Under Senate rule \nXII, if a Senator declines to vote during a rollcall, he or she must, \nat the time his or her name is called, give a reason for not voting. In \nan unusual occurrence, Senator Warner advised the Chair that he \n``decline[d] to vote for the reason that I have not read the Journal.'' \nRule XII requires that if a Senator declines to vote, the Presiding \nOfficer must put a nondebatable question to the Senate on whether it is \n``permissible for the Senator to decline his right to vote on the \nissue.''\n  The Chair called for the vote to determine whether Senator Warner \nshould be excused from voting on the Journal. However, before that vote \nwas completed, Senator Dan Quayle stated that he, too, declined to \nvote, because he said, ``I do not believe a Senator should be compelled \nto vote.'' The Chair asked the clerk to call the roll on whether to \nexcuse Senator Quayle from voting, when Senator Symms stated that he, \ntoo, declined to vote for the same reason. At this point, there were \nfour Senate votes pending. if additional Senators in the Chamber \nsimilarly chose to decline to vote, seriatim, the process could have \ncontinued forever.\n  Recognizing that, just a bit over a year previously, the Senate had \ndeliberately amended rule IV to make the motion to approve the Journal \na nondebatable motion, I made a point of order that the requests of the \nSenators to decline to vote were not in order. I stated:\n\n     that in amending rule IV, the Senate intended that a majority \n     of the Senate could resolve the question of the reading of \n     the Journal. I make my point of order that a request of a \n     Senator to be excused from voting on a motion to approve the \n     Journal is, therefore, out of order and that the Chair \n     proceed immediately, without further delay, to announce the \n     vote on the motion to approve the Journal.\n\n  Through a series of subsequent motions and votes, I prevailed in \nrectifying what I observed at the time was an extraordinary situation \nillustrated by a series of, in essence, ``votes within a vote.''\n  Contrary to erroneous allegations by some, my actions in this regard \ndid not set a precedent that ``changed Senate procedure to run contrary \nto the plain text of a Standing Senate Rule.'' In fact, the action I \ntook achieved exactly the opposite result: It ensured that Senate \nprocedure would conform more closely to both the intent and the plain \ntext of Senate rule IV.\n  At the time, one Senator mistakenly stated that the Chair could not \nentertain a unanimous consent request to suspend the application of \nrule XII in this instance. But that is an incorrect understanding by a \nSenator who was referring to rule XII, paragraph 1--where Senators \ncannot seek to be added to a vote that they missed, and the Chair may \nnot do it or entertain a request to do so, a rule that was not in \nquestion and has always been strictly enforced by the Chair--not rule \nXII, paragraph 2, which was in dispute at the time.\n  Again, the actions I took were to enforce both rules IV and XII. \nShould I, instead, have endorsed a procedure whereby one Senator after \nanother could simply decline to vote and put each Senator's reasons for \ndeclining to vote to another vote? Should Senators have been permitted, \none after another, to decline to vote, then force a vote on each one's \nreason for not voting, on what is a nondebatable question in a \nnondebatable posture? Had I not raised a point of order against this \nabusive practice, it could have been used in innumerable future \ncircumstances, and the Senate would not be able to complete a vote on \nany measure or matter, ever. It would, again, have made a mockery of \nthe Senate's rules. Keep in mind that, if the tactic were ever \nlegitimized, it could be employed to prevent a judicial nominee from \never receiving a vote.\n  It should be further noted that the point of order I made applies \nonly to proceedings on motions to approve the Journal. Both the \nPresiding Officer and I confirmed this specifically in response to a \nquestion from Senator Alan Simpson. As I then stated:\n\n     where Senators decline to vote on other rollcall votes in \n     other situations--this point of order does not go to those. \n     This point of order only goes to the unusual situation, the \n     extraordinary circumstances, in which the Senate found itself \n     today, when it was trying to act on a motion to approve the \n     Journal to date, and when three Senators in succession stood \n     to say, ``Mr. President, I decline to vote on this rollcall \n     for the following reasons.''\n\n  Elsewhere, I also expressly stated that, ``for the legislative \nhistory,'' the precedential value of my point of order was ``confined \nonly to that situation in which the Senate is trying to complete a vote \non a motion to approve the Journal to date . . . It is confined to that \nvery narrow purpose.''\n  The Senate's decision on that day was fully consistent with the text \nof rules IV and XII, which provides expressly that the question of \nwhether a Senator could decline to vote, ``shall be decided without \ndebate.'' The decision, once again, further enforced the existing rules \nof the Senate. This stands in stark contrast to the proposed nuclear \noption, which would contravene, by a simple majority vote, the express \ntext of rule XXII, which applies to ``any measure, motion, or other \nmatter pending before the Senate,'' and which requires an affirmative \nvote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn.\n  Let me state, once again, that no action of mine cited by the \nproponents of the nuclear options has ever denied a minority in the \nSenate its right to full debate on the final disposition of a measure \nor matter pending before the Senate.\n  The steps discussed here have all gone toward strengthening or \nenforcing\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\nSenate rules, or clarifying the application of Senate precedents--not \nundermining them. The Senate has been the last fortress of minority \nrights and freedom of speech in this Republic for more than two \ncenturies. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before ignoring \nthat history and tradition in favor of the political priority of the \nmovement.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The bill (S. 686) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RELIEF OF THE PARENTS OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO.\n\n       The United States District Court for the Middle District of \n     Florida shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine, and \n     render judgment on a suit or claim by or on behalf of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo for the alleged violation of any right of \n     Theresa Marie Schiavo under the Constitution or laws of the \n     United States relating to the withholding or withdrawal of \n     food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her \n     life.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROCEDURE.\n\n       Any parent of Theresa Marie Schiavo shall have standing to \n     bring a suit under this Act. The suit may be brought against \n     any other person who was a party to State court proceedings \n     relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or \n     medical treatment necessary to sustain the life of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo, or who may act pursuant to a State court order \n     authorizing or directing the withholding or withdrawal of \n     food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her \n     life. In such a suit, the District Court shall determine de \n     novo any claim of a violation of any right of Theresa Marie \n     Schiavo within the scope of this Act, notwithstanding any \n     prior State court determination and regardless of whether \n     such a claim has previously been raised, considered, or \n     decided in State court proceedings. The District Court shall \n     entertain and determine the suit without any delay or \n     abstention in favor of State court proceedings, and \n     regardless of whether remedies available in the State courts \n     have been exhausted.\n\n     SEC. 3. RELIEF.\n\n       After a determination of the merits of a suit brought under \n     this Act, the District Court shall issue such declaratory and \n     injunctive relief as may be necessary to protect the rights \n     of Theresa Marie Schiavo under the Constitution and laws of \n     the United States relating to the withholding or withdrawal \n     of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain \n     her life.\n\n     SEC. 4. TIME FOR FILING.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other time limitation, any suit or \n     claim under this Act shall be timely if filed within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. NO CHANGE OF SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to create \n     substantive rights not otherwise secured by the Constitution \n     and laws of the United States or of the several States.\n\n     SEC. 6. NO EFFECT ON ASSISTING SUICIDE.\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed to confer additional \n     jurisdiction on any court to consider any claim related--\n       (1) to assisting suicide, or\n       (2) a State law regarding assisting suicide.\n\n     SEC. 7. NO PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE LEGISLATION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall constitute a precedent with \n     respect to future legislation, including the provision of \n     private relief bills.\n\n     SEC. 8. NO EFFECT ON THE PATIENT SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF \n                   1990.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect the rights of any person \n     under the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990.\n\n     SEC. 9. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Congress that the 109th Congress \n     should consider policies regarding the status and legal \n     rights of incapacitated individuals who are incapable of \n     making decisions concerning the provision, withholding, or \n     withdrawal of foods, fluid, or medical care.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the bill we \njust passed that will give Terri Schiavo another chance. The bill we \npassed this afternoon centers on the sanctity of human life. It is \nbipartisan; it is bicameral. The House of Representatives is \nconsidering the exact same bill today. After the Senate and House pass \nthis legislation, the President will immediately sign it into law.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about what this bill actually \ndoes. Let me point out several things.\n  Simply put, it allows Terri's case to be held in Federal court. The \nlegislation permits a Federal district judge to consider a claim on \nbehalf of Terri for alleged violations of constitutional rights or \nFederal laws relating to the withholding of food, water, or medical \ntreatment necessary to sustain life.\n  The bill guarantees a process to help Terri but does not guarantee a \nparticular outcome. Once a new case is filed, a Federal district judge \ncan issue a stay at any time 24 hours a day. A stay would allow Terri \nto be fed once again. The judge has discretion on that particular \ndecision. However, I would expect that a Federal judge would grant the \nstay under these circumstances because Terri would need to live in \norder for the court to consider the case. If a new suit goes forward, \nthe Federal judge must conduct what is called de novo review of the \ncase. De novo review means the judge must look at the case anew. The \njudge need not rely on or defer to the decision of previous judges.\n  The judge also may make new findings of fact, and from a practical \nstandpoint this means that in a new case the judge can reevaluate and \nreassess Terri's medical condition.\n  I would like to make a few other points about the bill.\n  First, it is a unique bill passed under unique circumstances that \nshould not serve as a precedent for future legislation.\n  Second, this bill would not impede any State's existing laws \nregarding assisted suicide.\n  Finally, in this bill Congress acknowledges that we should take a \ncloser look in the future at the legal rights of incapacitated \nindividuals.\n  While this bill will create a new Federal cause of action, I still \nencourage the Florida Legislature to act on Terri's behalf. This new \nFederal law will help Terri, but it should not be her only remaining \noption.\n  Remember, Terri is alive. Terri is not in a coma. Although there is a \nrange of opinions, neurologists who have examined her insist today that \nshe is not in a persistent vegetative state. She breathes on her own \njust like you and me. She is not on a respirator. She is not on life \nsupport of any type. She does not have a terminal condition.\n  Moreover, she has a mom and a dad and siblings, her closest blood \nrelatives, who love her, who say she is responsive to them, who want \nher to live, and who will financially support her. These are the facts.\n  We in the Senate recognize that it is extraordinary that we, as a \nbody, act. But these are extraordinary circumstances that center on the \nmost fundamental of human values and virtues--the sanctity of human \nlife.\n  The level of cooperation and thoughtful consideration surrounding \nthis legislative effort on behalf of my colleagues has truly been \nremarkable. I thank Senate minority leader Harry Reid for his \nleadership on this issue. He and I have been in close contact \nthroughout this process. I also thank my Democratic colleagues who \nexpressed their concerns but have allowed us to move forward. In \nparticular, I thank Senators Mel Martinez, Rick Santorum, Tom Harkin, \nand Kent Conrad for their dedication in shepherding this legislation. \nThis is bipartisan, bicameral legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3103-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3103-S3104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, on January 30, 2005, America lost a \npioneer and leader in civil rights, human rights and mental health. \nAmong his many accomplishments, Mr. K. Patrick Okura served as \npresident of the Japanese American Citizens League, JACL, between 1962 \nand 1964 and led the JACL into a new era of civil rights activism. Pat \nwas also an active board member of the Asian Pacific American Heritage \nCouncil and dedicated himself to nurturing the growth of the Asian \nPacific American community. In addition, Pat had a long and \ndistinguished career in mental health and helped found the Asian \nAmerican Psychological Association.\n  On February 11, 2005, a memorial service was held for Pat in \nBethesda, MD. At this memorial service, an eloquent eulogy was \npresented by the current president of the JACL, Mr. John Tateishi, \nhighlighting Pat's accomplishments, describing his character, and \nexpressing sadness at his passing.\n  I feel much the same way as Mr. Tateishi does about Pat's passing. I \nwould like to share his thoughts with you. Today, I ask that a copy of \nMr. Tateishi's eulogy for Pat Okura to be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                      Eulogy for K. Patrick Okura\n\n       If the true measure of a man is seen in his actions rather \n     than in the words he speaks, then Pat Okura is a giant among \n     us today. He was someone who believed passionately in \n     equality and the rights of individuals, and more importantly, \n     he spent a lifetime fighting for those things he believed in \n     so strongly.\n       Some 30 years ago, when we were all so much younger, Pat \n     and I talked long into the night at a JACL convention, and it \n     was then that I first got to know something about this \n     remarkable man. He told me about the things that had shaped \n     his life: his days at UCLA, meeting and marrying his lovely \n     wife Lily, those miserable days imprisoned and living as \n     newlyweds in a horse stall at the Santa Anita race track, \n     life at Boys Town in Omaha, and the post-war years. And apart \n     from his life with Lily, he told me the one event that shaped \n     his view of the world more than any other was the injustice \n     of the internment. As a result, he spent the rest of his life \n     fighting against racism and social injustice and always tried \n     to ensure justice in this world, especially for those who \n     were the least able to fight for themselves.\n       The one thing that is legendary about Pat was his love of \n     mentoring young people. He would always tell the stories of \n     his life, not to talk about himself, but to impart wisdom \n     from those experiences, to use the stories of his life as a \n     way to teach and guide the young people who came to him for \n     his help. He loved to counsel, advise, to mentor the young, \n     and he always, without hesitation, extended a helping hand. \n     There are countless numbers of us who have benefited from his \n     generosity and kindness. That was one of the hallmarks of his \n     life.\n       In 1962, Pat was elected as the National President of JACL, \n     and during his term of office, he led the JACL into a new era \n     of civil rights. A year after winning election as the \n     organization's president, he convened a meeting of the JACL's \n     National Board in Washington D.C., the first time the Board \n     had ever met anywhere other than at its national headquarters \n     in its 64 year history. He did so to urge the JACL Board to \n     support the now historic March on Washington, led by the \n     Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n       In order to put that into context, it should be noted that \n     in 1963, the notion of civil rights was not yet part of the \n     popular lexicon of the American vernacular. At that time, it \n     was viewed as a radical movement by upstart blacks and \n     radical students from the north, and the idea of civil rights \n     for non-whites created discomfort in the hearts of many in \n     this country. Certainly, for the JACL, moderate at best, \n     being part of the civil rights movement was a radical idea.\n       So in 1963, when Pat passionately cajoled the JACL National \n     Board into supporting the march and proudly marched with Dr. \n     King in the Nation's Capitol, he moved the JACL into a new \n     era--from an organization that looked inward to its own \n     community to one that reached out to any individuals or \n     groups in this country victimized by social injustice.\n       We in the JACL have been fortunate to have known Pat as a \n     friend, a colleague, and a leader. For a brief moment, he was \n     given to us, and we are proud to have had him as one of us to \n     have been a part of his life. He will be sorely missed, and \n     his passing leaves a gaping void that cannot easily be \n     filled. Legends among us are passing, and how do we possibly \n     replace them? The likes of Patrick Okura simply cannot be \n     replaced. He was too remarkable.\n       Lily, on this day of mourning, we thank you for sharing Pat \n     with us. Our thoughts are with you as we celebrate the \n     incredible life of a wonderful human being and a good \n     friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3104-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SENATE PASSAGE OF THE TERRI SCHIAVO BILL\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I believe in the dignity and value \nof life at all stages and I strongly supported the legislation to help \nTerri Schiavo. Doctors have said that Terri is not in a persistent \nvegetative state and there is a lot of evidence that she would improve \nif she can get the care her family wants to give her.\n  It is not uncommon in cases where there has been a miscarriage of \njustice for the Congress to pass private bills. Our actions are \nconsistent with the will of the people of Florida who have been \nrepeatedly frustrated by the State courts. We have a chance to allow \nthis young woman to live under the nurturing of her parents and to \nimprove her condition.\n  On Sunday, March 20, the Senate passed the Terri Schiavo bill. The \nHouse passed the bill early on Monday, March 21, by a vote of 203-58 \nand President Bush signed the bill into law less than an hour later.\n  The legislation will allow Federal courts to hear a claim on behalf \nof Terri Schiavo by her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, alleging a \nviolation of their daughter's rights under the Constitution or Federal \nlaw relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or \nmedical treatment necessary to sustain her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3104-4", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3104-S3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SIDNEY A. GOODMAN\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it broke my heart to miss my good \nfriend Sidney Goodman's birthday today. So I wanted to memorialize this \ngreat occasion in a way that would be remembered. As I told Sidney in a \nletter, if he hadn't made something out of me, I would be there to \ncelebrate with him instead of working here in Washington.\n  Thomas Jefferson said that, ``The test of every generation is giving \na better world to its children than it got from its parents.'' By that \nstandard, Sidney is one of the greatest of the Greatest Generation.\n  As you well know, it is not the years of life but the life in years \nthat counts. Sidney has lived many years and lived them to the hilt. He \nhas poured so much love and energy into those around him, including me. \nI hope he can receive all the richly deserved honor bestowed on him on \nthis special day. He is 1 in 5 billion.\n  Sidney A. Goodman is the quintessential entrepreneur, with heart.\n  His charisma instantly draws people, and his expectations encourage \nthem to become the very best they can be. His uncanny business sense \nmakes him the consummate deal maker and natural leader. His honesty, \nintegrity and warmth have cultivated thousands of business \nrelationships that have become genuine friendships.\n  These abilities enabled him to set the foundation of what would \nbecome the Goodman Group, one of the Nation's most unique and \ninnovative privately held companies, in which he is still actively \ninvolved today. The Goodman Group is made up of: Sage Company, which \nhas communities in 11 States\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\nand has been a national leader in developing and managing commercial \nproperties, residential and senior living communities, and health care \nfacilities since the 1970s. Sage is actually an acronym for Sidney \nAlbert Goodman Enterprises; John B. Goodman Limited Partnership, a \ndevelopment and design company; Sage Travel, a full-service travel \nagency.\n  Sidney started this organization from a single real estate holding \nwhich he acquired in 1952. At that time, he had a Hamms beer \ndistributorship, which was very successful. However, when Hamms was \npurchased in 1970, he preferred to run his own business. So, like any \ngood entrepreneur, he sold it back to them and focused on developing \nhis real estate business, Sage Company.\n  Through his business dealings, Sidney has been a mentor to hundreds \nof people over the years. He attentively listens to their challenges \nand offers guidance based on knowledge that can only be gained through \nexperience. He does more than simply ask people to carry out an action; \nhe explains why, based on wisdom that can only be attained from decades \nas a successful businessman.\n  Sidney is generous with his knowledge, the most valuable asset anyone \ncan have, because he genuinely cares about people. Whether they are an \nassistant or a company president, he sincerely wants to know about \ntheir life, their hopes, and dreams. He loves to give people the \nopportunity to challenge themselves and expand their horizons. And when \nthey think they can't succeed, he is there to tell them they can. And \nthey do.\n  While Sidney is undoubtedly a very successful businessman, it is this \nconcern for every individual that makes him an exceptional human being.\n  I am proud to be Sidney Goodman's friend and I wish him a happy and \nblessed birthday celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3105-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its clerks, announced that it has passed the \nfollowing bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 3.

RELIEF OF THE PARENTS OF THERESA MARIE SCHIAVO\n\n       The United States District Court for the Middle District of \n     Florida shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine, and \n     render judgment on a suit or claim by or on behalf of Theresa \n     Marie Schiavo for the alleged violation of any right of \n     Theresa Marie Schiavo under the Constitution or laws of the \n     United States relating to the withholding or withdrawal of \n     food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her \n     life.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to regulate the unauthorized installation of computer \nsoftware, to require clear disclosure to\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\ncomputer users of certain computer software features that may pose a \nthreat to user privacy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the SPYBLOCK \nbill, along with my good friend Senator Wyden of Oregon.\n  The SPYBLOCK bill will help reduce one of the most damaging practices \nin the online world today--spyware, or computer software downloaded \nonto a computer without the user's permission or awareness--that then \nis often used to illicitly gather personal information, assist in \nidentity theft, track a user's keystrokes or monitor browsing behavior.\n  It is hard to overstate the potential damage that Spyware can do in \ncyberspace if it is allowed to grow unchecked. It could cripple e-\ncommerce, because consumers would be afraid to make their financial or \nother personal data available on-line. It could damage the activities \nof businesses large and small, by making their data or computer systems \nvulnerable to attack and abuse. It could fuel the growth of whole new \ncategories of cybercriminals. The recent data theft incidents at \nChoicePoint, Bank of America, and others only underscore the need for a \nmuch more proactive policing of cyberspace.\n  The SPYBLOCK bill will give Federal enforcement authorities \nadditional tools to curb spyware. It also bans adware programs that \nconceal their operation or purpose from users, because every consumer \nshould have a reasonable opportunity to consent to the installation of \nsoftware that generates pop-up ads on his or her computer.\n  We have worked hard on this bill, and consulted extensively with \nindustry and consumer groups to ensure all perspectives on this growing \nproblem were heard. The issues are not new to the members of the \nCommerce Committee either, as this bill is very similiar to one we \nmarked up toward the end of the last Congress.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Commerce \nCommittee and the full Senate to ensure prompt passage of this \nimportant measure. I thank my colleague Senator Wyden again for his \nwork on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Software \n     Principles Yielding Better Levels of Consumer Knowledge Act'' \n     or the ``SPY BLOCK Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

PROHIBITED PRACTICES RELATED TO SOFTWARE INSTALLATION \n                   IN GENERAL.\n\n       (a) Surreptitious Installation.--\n       (1) In general.--It is unlawful for a person who is not an \n     authorized user of a protected computer to cause the \n     installation of software on the computer in a manner that--\n       (A) conceals from the user of the computer the fact that \n     the software is being installed; or\n       (B) prevents the user of the computer from having an \n     opportunity to knowingly grant or withhold consent to the \n     installation.\n       (2) Exception.--This subsection does not apply to--\n       (A) the installation of software that falls within the \n     scope of a previous grant of authorization by an authorized \n     user;\n       (B) the installation of an upgrade to a software program \n     that has already been installed on the computer with the \n     authorization of an authorized user;\n       (C) the installation of software before the first retail \n     sale and delivery of the computer; or\n       (D) the installation of software that ceases to operate \n     when the user of the computer exits the software or service \n     through which the user accesses the Internet, if the software \n     so installed does not begin to operate again when the user \n     accesses the Internet via that computer in the future.\n       (b) Misleading Inducements To Install.--It is unlawful for \n     a person who is not an authorized user of a protected \n     computer to induce an authorized user of the computer to \n     consent to the installation of software on the computer by \n     means of a materially false or misleading representation \n     concerning--\n       (1) the identity of an operator of an Internet website or \n     online service at which the software is made available for \n     download from the Internet;\n       (2) the identity of the author, publisher, or authorized \n     distributor of the software;\n       (3) the nature or function of the software; or\n       (4) the consequences of not installing the software.\n       (c) Preventing Reasonable Efforts To Uninstall.--\n       (1) In general.--It is unlawful for a person who is not an \n     authorized user of a protected computer to cause the \n     installation of software on the computer if the software \n     cannot subsequently be uninstalled or disabled by an \n     authorized user through a program removal function that is \n     usual and customary with the user's operating system, or \n     otherwise as clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the user.\n       (2) Limitations.--\n       (A) Authority to uninstall.--Software that enables an \n     authorized user of a computer, such as a parent, employer, or \n     system administrator, to choose to prevent another user of \n     the same computer from uninstalling or disabling the software \n     shall not be considered to prevent reasonable efforts to \n     uninstall or disable the software within the meaning of this \n     subsection if at least 1 authorized user retains the ability \n     to uninstall or disable the software.\n       (B) Construction.--This subsection shall not be construed \n     to require individual features or functions of a software \n     program, upgrades to a previously installed software program, \n     or software programs that were installed on a bundled basis \n     with other software or with hardware to be capable of being \n     uninstalled or disabled separately from such software or \n     hardware.\n\n     SEC. 3. INSTALLING SURREPTITIOUS INFORMATION COLLECTION \n                   FEATURES ON A USER'S COMPUTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is unlawful for a person who is not an \n     authorized user of a protected computer to--\n       (1) cause the installation on that computer of software \n     that includes a surreptitious information collection feature; \n     or\n       (2) use software installed in violation of paragraph (1) to \n     collect information about a user of the computer or the use \n     of a protected computer by that user.\n       (b) Authorization Status.--This section shall not be \n     interpreted to prohibit a person from causing the \n     installation of software that collects and transmits only \n     information that is reasonably needed to determine whether or \n     not the user of a protected computer is licensed or \n     authorized to use the software.\n       (c) Surreptitious Information Collection Feature Defined.--\n     For purposes of this section, the term ``surreptitious \n     information collection feature'' means a feature of software \n     that--\n       (1) collects information about a user of a protected \n     computer or the use of a protected computer by that user, and \n     transmits such information to any other person or computer--\n       (A) on an automatic basis or at the direction of person \n     other than an authorized user of the computer, such that no \n     authorized user knowingly triggers or controls the collection \n     and transmission;\n       (B) in a manner that is not transparent to an authorized \n     user at or near the time of the collection and transmission, \n     such that no authorized user is likely to be aware of it when \n     information collection and transmission are occurring; and\n       (C) for purposes other than--\n       (i) facilitating the proper technical functioning of a \n     capability, function, or service that an authorized user of \n     the computer has knowingly used, executed, or enabled; or\n       (ii) enabling the provider of an online service knowingly \n     used or subscribed to by an authorized user of the computer \n     to monitor or record the user's usage of the service, or to \n     customize or otherwise affect the provision of the service to \n     the user based on such usage; and\n       (2) begins to collect and transmit such information without \n     prior notification that--\n       (A) clearly and conspicuously discloses to an authorized \n     user of the computer the type of information the software \n     will collect and the types of ways the information may be \n     used and distributed; and\n       (B) is provided at a time and in a manner such that an \n     authorized user of the computer has an opportunity, after \n     reviewing the information contained in the notice, to prevent \n     either--\n       (i) the installation of the software; or\n       (ii) the beginning of the operation of the information \n     collection and transmission capability described in paragraph \n     (1).\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 92\n\n       Whereas the Declaration of Independence announced that one \n     of the chief causes of the American Revolution was that King \n     George had ``combined with others to subject us to a \n     jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged \n     by our laws'';\n       Whereas the Supreme court has recently relied on the \n     judgments, laws, or pronouncements of foreign institutions to \n     support its interpretations of the laws of the United States, \n     most recently in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 316 n.21 \n     (2002), Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 573 (2003), and \n     Roper v. Simmons, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 1198-99 (2005);\n       Whereas the Supreme Court has stated previously in Printz \n     v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 921 n.11 (1997), that ``We \n     think such comparative analysis inappropriate to the task of \n     interpreting a constitution . . .'';\n       Whereas the ability of Americans to live their lives within \n     clear legal boundaries is the foundation of the rule of law, \n     and essential to freedom;\n       Whereas it is the appropriate judicial role to faithfully \n     interpret the expression of the popular will through the \n     Constitution and laws enacted by duly elected representatives \n     of the American people and under our system of checks and \n     balances;\n       Whereas Americans should not have to look for guidance on \n     how to live their lives from the often contradictory \n     decisions of any of hundreds of other foreign organizations; \n     and\n       Whereas inappropriate judicial reliance on foreign \n     judgments, laws, or pronouncements threatens the sovereignty \n     of the United States, the separation of powers, and the \n     President's and the Senate's treaty-making authority: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that judicial \n     interpretations regarding the meaning of the Constitution of \n     the United States should not be based in whole or in part on \n     judgments, laws, or pronouncements of foreign institutions \n     unless such foreign judgments, laws, or pronouncements inform \n     an understanding of the original meaning of the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to express concern over a trend \nthat some legal scholars and observers say may be developing in our \ncourts--a trend regarding the potential influence of foreign \ngovernments and foreign courts in the application and enforcement of \nU.S. law.\n  If this trend is real, then I fear that, bit by bit, case by case, \nthe American people may be slowly losing control over the meaning of \nour laws and of our Constitution. If this trend continues, foreign \ngovernments may even begin to dictate what our laws and our \nConstitution mean, and what our policies in America should be.\n  In a series of cases over the past few years, our courts have begun \nto tell us that our criminal laws and criminal policies are informed, \nnot only by our Constitution and by the policy preferences and \nlegislative enactments of the American people through their elected \nrepresentatives, but also by the rulings of foreign courts.\n  It is hard to believe--but in a series of recent cases, the U.S. \nSupreme Court has actually rejected its own prior precedents, in part \nbecause of a foreign government or court has expressed its disagreement \nwith those precedents.\n  With your indulgence, I will offer just a few of the most recent \nexamples.\n  Until recently, the U.S. Supreme Court had long held that the death \npenalty may be imposed on individuals regardless of their I.Q. The \nCourt had traditionally left that issue untouched, as a question for \nthe American people, in each of their States, to decide. That was what \nthe Court said in a case called Penry v. Lynaugh (1989). Yet because \nsome foreign governments have frowned upon that ruling, the U.S. \nSupreme Court has now seen fit to take that issue away from the \nAmerican people. In 2002, in a case called Atkins v. Virginia, the U.S. \nSupreme Court held that the Commonwealth of Virginia could no longer \napply its criminal justice system and its death penalty to an \nindividual who had been duly convicted of abduction, armed robbery, and \ncapital murder, because of testimony that the defendant was ``mildly \nmentally retarded.'' The reason given for the complete reversal in the \nCourt's position? In part because the Court was concerned about ``the \nworld community'' and the views of the European Union.\n  Take another example. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that the \nAmerican people, in each of their States, have the discretion to decide \nwhether certain kinds of conduct that has been considered immoral under \nour longstanding legal traditions should or should not remain illegal. \nIn Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), the Court held that it is up the American \npeople to decide whether criminal laws against sodomy should be \ncontinued or abandoned. Yet once again, because some foreign \ngovernments have frowned upon that ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas seen fit to take that issue away from the American people. In 2003, \nin a case called Lawrence v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \nthe State of Texas could no longer decide whether its criminal justice \nsystem may fully reflect the moral values of the people of Texas. The \nreason given for the complete reversal? This time, the Court explained, \nit was in part because it was concerned about the European Court of \nHuman Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\n  Here's yet another example, from just a few weeks ago. Until this \nmonth, the U.S. Supreme Court had always held that 16- and 17-year-\nolds--like John Lee Malvo, the 17-year-old who terrorized the \nWashington area in a sniper spree that left 10 people dead--may be \nsubject to the death penalty, if that is indeed the will of the people. \nThe Court said as much in a case called Stanford v. Kentucky (1989). \nYet because some foreign governments have frowned upon that ruling as \nwell, the U.S. Supreme Court, on March 1 of this year, saw fit yet \nagain to take this issue away from the American people. In Roper v. \nSimmons, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State of Missouri could \nno longer apply its death penalty to 16- and 17-year-olds convicted of \nmurder, no matter how brutal and depraved the act, and no matter how \nunrepentant the criminal. The reason given for this most recent \ncomplete reversal? In part because of treaties the U.S. has never even \nratified, like the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \nChild, and because many foreign countries disagree with the people of \nMissouri.\n  The trend may be continuing. Next Monday, March 28, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt will consider the question whether foreign nationals duly \nconvicted of the most heinous crimes are nevertheless entitled to a new \ntrial--for reasons that those individuals did not even bother to \nmention at their first trial. As in the previous examples, the Supreme \nCourt has actually already answered this question. In Breard v. Greene \n(1998), the Court made clear that criminal defendants, like all parties \nin litigation, may not sit on their rights and then bring up those \nrights later to stall the imposition of their criminal sentences. That \nbasic principle of our legal system, the Court explained, is not \nundermined just because the accused happens to be a foreign national \nsubject to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Even this basic \nprinciple of American law may soon be reversed, however. Many legal \nexperts predict that, in the upcoming case of Medellin v. Dretke, the \nCourt may overturn itself yet again, for no other reason than that the \nInternational Court of Justice happens to disagree with our \nlongstanding laws and legal principles. That case involves the State of \nTexas, and I have filed an amicus brief asking the Court to respect its \nown precedents as well as the authority of the people of Texas to \ndetermine its criminal laws and policies consistent with our U.S. \nConstitution. There is a serious risk, however, that the Court will \nignore Texas law, ignore U.S. law, and ignore the U.S. Constitution, \nand decide in effect that the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court can \nbe overruled by the International Court of Justice.\n  There are still other examples, other decisions, where we see Supreme \nCourt justices citing legal opinions from foreign courts all across the \nglobe--from India, Jamaica, Zimbabwe--the list goes on and on.\n  I am concerned about this trend. Step by step, with every case, the \nAmerican people may be losing their ability to determine what their \ncriminal laws shall be--losing control to the control of foreign courts \nand foreign governments. And if this can happen with criminal law, it \ncan also spread to other areas of our government and of sovereignty. \nHow about economic policy? Or foreign policy? Or our decisions about \nsecurity and military strategy?\n\n  I think most Americans would be disturbed if we gave foreign \ngovernments the power to tell us what our Constitution means. Our \nFounding Fathers fought the Revolutionary War precisely to stop foreign \ngovernments from telling us what our laws say. In fact, ending foreign \ncontrol over American law was one of the very reasons given for the \nRevolutionary War. The Declaration of Independence specifically \ncomplains that the American Revolution is justified because King \nGeorge, and I quote, ``has combined with others to subject us to a \njurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our \nlaws.'' After a long and bloody revolution, we earned at last the right \nto be free of such foreign control. It was ``We the People of the \nUnited States'' who then ordained and established a Constitution of the \nUnited States, and our predecessors specifically included a mechanism \nby which only ``We the People of the United States'' could change it if \nnecessary. And of course, every Federal judge and justice swears an \noath to ``faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the \nduties incumbent upon me . . . under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States. So help me God.''\n  I am concerned about this trend. I am concerned that this trend may \nreflect a growing distrust amongst legal elites--not only a distrust of \nour constitutional democracy, but a distrust of America itself.\n  First, it reflects distrust of our constitutional democracy.\n  As every high school civics student learns, the job of a judge is \npretty straightforward. Judges are supposed to follow the law, not \nrewrite it. Judges are supposed to enforce and apply political \ndecisions, not make them. The job of a judge is to read and obey the \nwords that are contained in our laws and in our judicial precedents--\nnot the laws and precedents of foreign governments, which have no \nsovereign authority over our Nation.\n  I fear, though, that some judges simply don't like our laws, and they \ndon't like the political decisions that are being made by the American \npeople, through their elected representatives, about what our laws \nshould be. So perhaps they would rather rewrite the law from the bench. \nWhat's especially disconcerting is that some judges today may be \ndeparting so far from American law, from American principles, and from \nAmerican traditions, that the only way they can justify their rulings \nfrom the bench is to cite the law of foreign countries, foreign \ngovernments, and foreign cultures--because there is nothing in this \ncountry left for them to cite for support.\n  Moreover, citing foreign law in order to overrule U.S. policy offends \ndemocracy, because foreign lawmaking is in no way accountable to the \nAmerican people.\n  There is an important role for international law to play in our \nsystem here in the United States, to be sure. But it is a role that \nbelongs to the American people, through the political branches of the \nUnited States--to the Congress and to the President, to decide what \nrole international law shall play in our legal system. It is \nemphatically not a role that is given to our courts. Article I of the \nConstitution gives Congress, not the courts, the authority to enact \nlaws punishing ``Offenses against the Law of Nations.'' And Article II \nof the Constitution gives the President the power to ratify treaties, \nsubject to the advice and consent and the approval of two-thirds of the \nSenate. Yet our courts are overruling U.S. law by citing foreign law \ndecisions in which the U.S. Congress has had no role, and citing \ntreaties that the U.S. President and the U.S. Senate have refused to \napprove.\n\n  To those who might say there is nothing wrong with simply trying to \nbring U.S. law into consistency with other nations, I say this: This is \nnot a good faith effort to bring U.S. law into global harmony. I fear \nthat this is simply an effort to further a particular ideological \nagenda. Because the record suggest that this sudden interest in foreign \nlaw is political, not legal; it seems selective, not principled. U.S. \ncourts are following foreign law inconsistently--only when needed to \nachieve a particular outcome that a judge or justice happens to desire, \nbut that is flatly inconsistent with U.S. law and precedent. Many \ncountries, for example, provide no exclusionary rule to suppress \nevidence that is otherwise useful and necessary to convict criminal \ndefendants--yet our courts have not abandoned our constitutional rule \non that topic. Very few countries provide for abortion on demand--yet \nour courts have not abandoned our Nation's constitutional jurisprudence \non that subject. Four justices of the Supreme Court believe that school \nchoice programs to benefit poor urban communities are unconstitutional \nif parochial schools are eligible, even though many other countries \ndirectly fund religious schools.\n  Even more disconcerting than this distrust of our constitutional \ndemocracy is the distrust of America itself.\n  I would hope that no American would ever believe that the citizens of \nforeign countries are always right, and that Americans are always \nwrong. Yet I worry that some judges may become more and more interested \nin impressing foreign governments, and less and\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nless interested in simply following American law. Indeed, at least one \nSupreme Court justice has stated publicly that following foreign \nrulings, rather than U.S. rulings, and I quote, ``may create that all \nimportant good impression,'' and therefore, and I quote, ``over time we \nwill rely increasingly . . . on international and foreign courts in \nexamining domestic issues.''\n  This attitude is especially disturbing today. The brave men and women \nof our Armed Forces are putting their lives on the line in order to \nchampion freedom and democracy not just for the American people, but \nfor people all around the world. America today is the world's leading \nchampion of freedom and democracy. Meanwhile, the United Nations is \nrife with corruption, and the United Nations Human Rights Commission is \nchaired by Libya.\n  I am disturbed by this trend, and I hope that the American people \nwill have a chance to speak out. I believe that the American people do \nnot want their courts to make political decisions; they want their \ncourts to follow and apply the law as it is written. The American \npeople do not want their courts to follow the precedents of foreign \ncourts; they want their courts to follow U.S. law and the precedents of \nU.S. courts. The American people do not want their laws controlled by \nforeign governments; they want their laws controlled by the American \ngovernment, which serves the American people. The American people do \nnot want to see American law and American policy outsourced to foreign \ngovernments and foreign courts.\n  So today, I submit a sense of the Senate resolution, to give this \nbody the opportunity to state for the record that this trend in our \ncourts is wrong, and that American law should never be reversed or \nrejected simply because a foreign government or foreign court may \ndisagree with it. This resolution is nearly identical to one that has \nbeen introduced by my colleague in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Tom Feeney. I applaud his leadership and his efforts in \nthis area, and I hope that both the House and the Senate will come \ntogether and follow in the footsteps of our Founding Fathers, to once \nagain defend our right as Americans to dictate the policies of our \ngovernment--informed, but never dictated, by the preferences of any \nforeign government or tribunal. And I ask that the text of the \nresolution be included at the appropriate place in the Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3111-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 23--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \n ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE, AND A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF \n                      THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 24\n\n       Whereas, on December 9, 2003, President George W. Bush \n     stated it is the policy of the United States to ``oppose any \n     unilateral decision, by either China or Taiwan, to change the \n     status quo'' in the region;\n       Whereas, in the past few years, the United States \n     Government has urged both Taiwan and the People's Republic of \n     China to maintain restraint;\n       Whereas the National People's Congress of the People's \n     Republic of China passed an anti-secession law on March 14, \n     2005, which constitutes a unilateral change to the status quo \n     in the Taiwan Strait;\n       Whereas the passage of China's anti-secession law escalates \n     tensions between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China \n     and is an impediment to cross-strait dialogue;\n       Whereas the purpose of China's anti-secession law is to \n     create a legal framework for possible use of force against \n     Taiwan and mandates Chinese military action under certain \n     circumstances, including when ``possibilities for a peaceful \n     reunification should be completely exhausted'';\n       Whereas the Department of Defense's Report on the Military \n     Power of the People's Republic of China for Fiscal Year 2004 \n     documents that, as of 2003, the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China had deployed approximately 500 short-range \n     ballistic missiles against Taiwan;\n       Whereas the escalating arms buildup of missiles and other \n     offensive weapons by the People's Republic of China in areas \n     adjacent to the Taiwan Strait is a threat to the peace and \n     security of the Western Pacific area;\n       Whereas, given the recent positive developments in cross-\n     strait relations, including the Lunar New Year charter \n     flights and new proposals for cross-strait exchanges, it is \n     particularly unfortunate that the National People's Congress \n     adopted this legislation;\n       Whereas, since its enactment in 1979, the Taiwan Relations \n     Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), which codified in law the basis \n     for continued commercial, cultural, and other relations \n     between the people of the United States and the people of \n     Taiwan, has been instrumental in maintaining peace, security, \n     and stability in the Taiwan Strait;\n       Whereas section 2(b)(2) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares that ``peace and stability in the area are in the \n     political, security, and economic interests of the United \n     States, and are matters of international concern'';\n       Whereas, at the time the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted \n     into law, section 2(b)(3) of such Act made clear that the \n     United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with \n     the People's Republic of China rested upon the expectation \n     that the future of Taiwan would be determined by peaceful \n     means;\n       Whereas section 2(b)(4) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares it the policy of the United States ``to consider any \n     effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than \n     peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat \n     to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of \n     grave concern to the United States'';\n       Whereas section 2(b)(6) of the Taiwan Relations Act \n     declares it the policy of the United States ``to maintain the \n     capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force \n     or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the \n     security, or the social or economic system, of the people on \n     Taiwan''; and\n       Whereas any attempt to determine Taiwan's future by other \n     than peaceful means and other than with the express consent \n     of the people of Taiwan would be considered of grave concern \n     to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n       (1) the anti-secession law of the People's Republic of \n     China provides a legal justification for the use of force \n     against Taiwan, altering the status quo in the region, and \n     thus is of grave concern to the United States;\n       (2) the President should direct all appropriate officials \n     of the United States Government to convey to their \n     counterpart officials in the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China the grave concern with which the United \n     States views the passage of China's anti-secession law in \n     particular, and the growing Chinese military threats to \n     Taiwan in general;\n       (3) the United States Government should reaffirm its policy \n     that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful \n     means and with the consent of the people of Taiwan; and\n       (4) the United States Government should continue to \n     encourage dialogue between Taiwan and the People's Republic \n     of China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3111-3", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3111-S3112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, the Senate stand in adjournment \nuntil 9:30 a.m. on Monday, March 21, unless the House adopts S. Con. \nRes. 23, at which time the Senate will then be in adjournment under the \nprovisions of the\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\nconcurrent resolution until 2 p.m. on Monday, April 4, 2005. I further \nask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be \ndeemed to have expired, the Journal of the proceedings be approved to \ndate, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then \nbegin a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak \ntherein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are hopeful that the House of \nRepresentatives will be able to act soon on the Schiavo bill we have \njust passed. If they are able to pass that legislation in the form \nreceived and then pass the adjournment resolution, it would not be \nnecessary for this body, the Senate, to return.\n  We will then have completed our work and will adjourn for the Easter \nbreak. If the House is unable to act and, therefore, does not adopt the \nadjournment resolution, then the Senate would automatically return to \nbusiness tomorrow morning. I am hopeful that the House will be able to \naccept this bipartisan and bicameral agreement.\n  I thank many Members on both sides of the aisle for expediting this \nlegislation through the Senate. First and foremost, I need to thank, \nonce again, the Senator from Florida, the current occupant of the \nchair. We will now wait and monitor, over the course of the afternoon \nand evening, House action. In all likelihood, it will be a long \nevening, but we are prepared to be here as long as it takes to see that \nthis important bill passes so it can be sent to the President \nimmediately for his signature. Time is of the essence.\n  If the Senate does not need to return, I alert Members that we will \nhave a busy legislative session after adjournment. There are a number \nof important matters to consider, including the supplemental \nappropriations that we will turn to when it becomes available.\n  I announced previously that no votes will occur on April 4, and \ntherefore there is the possibility of votes on Tuesday, April 5.\n  Mr. President, for the record, I note that a colloquy that was \nprinted earlier in the Record was between Senator Levin and myself. It \nis an important colloquy that expresses the views to which we have \nagreed. I should mention that many such conversations have gone on \nbetween and among all Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/03/20/senate-section/article/S3112-1", "month": "03", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
