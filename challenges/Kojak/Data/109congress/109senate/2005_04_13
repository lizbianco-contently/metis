Mr. President, I wish to comment on the passing of Pope \nJohn Paul II last week. A number of us had the opportunity to represent \nthe United States, represent this body in Rome. It was a moving \nexperience, an emotional experience, and one that I briefly want to \nshare.\n  The passing of Pope John Paul II was moving. It was a historical \nevent that riveted the world. Millions of Catholics and non-Catholics \nalike were touched and influenced by this great man. He leaves an \nextraordinary legacy that all of us have reflected upon over the last \nweek.\n  In his 26-year reign as head of the Catholic Church, the third \nlongest pontificate in history, Pope John Paul was seen by more people \nthan any other individual in history. He influenced more lives than \nmany kings and presidents before him.\n  Together with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul \nhelped vanquish the Soviet Union, expose the brutality of communism, \nand free hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n  He, indeed, was a hinge of history, one of the great leaders of the \n20th century who helped make our world over on the pillars of faith, \nfreedom, liberty, and human dignity.\n  As I mentioned, I had the real privilege of leading a delegation of \n14 Senators to pay tribute to this great leader. We left last \nWednesday. As we soared over the Atlantic, all of us shared our \nthoughts and stories and reflected upon the Pope's remarkable life. Not \nonly did he live through the great upheavals of the 20th century, but \nhe helped bring about many of its greatest achievements.\n\n  As a young man in war-torn Poland, he lived under those heavy boots \nof fascism and communism, and yet even then he possessed an enduring \nhope and commitment to man's redemption.\n  To our great fortune, Karol Woljtyla ascended the world's stage and, \nas the 264th Pope of the Catholic Church, pressed belief into global \naction.\n  In the Catholic Church, he grew its religious following from 757 \nmillion faithful when he began his papacy in 1978 to over 1 billion \ntoday.\n  We arrived as a delegation in Rome on Thursday morning. The weather \nwas truly glorious that day; one might even say Heaven-sent weather--\nclear blue skies, sunshine, a gentle wind.\n  After a brief moment to organize, we went to Vatican City. As we \ndrove along the roadways, posters lined the city walls with giant \npictures of John Paul emblazoned with the words ``grazie'' and ``a \ndio.'' As we pulled closer to St. Peter's Square, priests, monks, \npilgrims, and well-wishers from around the world, many Americans, would \ncome up and say hello to us, all crowding those stone streets around \nthe Basilica.\n  On that first day, our delegation was escorted into St. Peter's to \nview the Pope's body. We filed into the crowds as they passed \nrespectfully. Many had waited hours and hours, indeed, well over 24 \nhours on average. They passed by bowing, saying prayers, crossing \nthemselves, and waving small papal flags. As we came around the corner, \nwe came into view of the Holy Father. It was a powerful moment for our \nentire delegation--the viewing. It was the first of many powerful \nmoments over the remainder of that day and the next day when the \nservice actually occurred.\n  As we passed by the body, you could not help but to pause and run \nthrough a series of your own prayers of thankfulness, as each and every \none of us did.\n  The next day was the funeral. Again, it was a beautiful day--crisp \nweather, morning sky glistening overhead. The square was full, silent, \nsolemn, and respectful. We were privileged to enter the Square and find \nour seats. Our seats were out front, probably 50 or 75 yards, both the \nSenate and House delegations.\n  The ceremony was about 2\\1/2\\ hours. Many people have had the \nopportunity to see it on television, but the presence there, that sense \nof time and place is difficult to describe. You could feel the powerful \nstrength of the man for whom we all gathered and prayed. It was \nuplifting, it was serious, and a very dignified celebration in many \nways.\n  As the funeral drew to a close, the adoration for Pope John Paul \ncrescendoed to almost an electric pitch. I heard my colleagues who were \nwith us describe it to our other colleagues over the course of the last \n48 hours that way off in the distance we began to hear clapping and the \nroar of the crowd as it came forward, a huge wave all the way up to St. \nPeter's and then to the Basilica. It was truly a moving and powerful \nexperience.\n  The crowd did, at the end, begin to chant and begin to cheer as the \nPope was held up one last time in that wooden coffin and dipped down to \nthe people in St. Peter's. He was then lifted aloft and carried \nsolemnly into the Basilica for his final burial.\n  In closing, I know I speak for all my colleagues when I say it was a \ntremendous honor for those of us who were able to attend on behalf of \nour fellow Americans and this institution in paying our respects for a \nmomentous and truly historic world figure.\n  Pope John Paul will be remembered for many things: his intellect, his \ncharisma, his warmth, his steadfast belief in the culture of life. \nAbove all, he will be remembered for his humble dedication to God and \nhis unwavering love for us all, each and every one a child of God.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to take up to 20 minutes of the majority time, and I \nrespectfully ask the President pro tempore to notify me when I have 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, having heard the words of the majority \nleader relative to the delegation that was in Rome last week for the \nburial of Pope John Paul II, I think all Americans, as well as every \nother individual around the world, were truly moved by the work of this \nman over the years he served as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church.\n  Having been to Rome a couple of years ago and been in a service that \nPope John Paul II celebrated, I, too, was very moved by the presence of \nthis man. Certainly during his term as Pope he had a tremendous impact \non the world, and this man is truly going to be missed as a leader, not \njust of the religious world but as the world leader that he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3506-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3506-S3508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss an issue \nthat is very dear to my heart. I practiced law for 26 years before I \ncame to Congress and I had the pleasure of trying many cases before any \nnumber of judges, both at the State and Federal level, and I am very \nmuch concerned about what is happening with our judiciary today. For \nthe last 2 years, I served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and have \nobserved what obviously happened during those 2 years, but during the \nlast few months, as we entered into this new session and approached the \nconfirmation of nominees who are being put forward by the President, I \nremain concerned about some things that are happening.\n  I will start by noting again that never before in the history of the \nSenate has a minority of 41 Senators held up confirmation of a judicial \nnominee where a majority of Senators has expressed their support for \nthat nominee. It is for this reason, if given the opportunity, I will \nvote in favor of changing our rules to allow confirmation of a judicial \nnominee by a simple majority because under the Constitution of the \nUnited States, the Senate is required to give its advice and consent to \nthe President on his judicial nominees.\n  The Senate can say no in regard to any particular nominee, but to do \nso we need an up-or-down vote to decide what advice we give the \nPresident. Failing to answer the question is shirking our \nconstitutional role in the separation of powers scheme. The \nConstitution spells out in certain areas, such as passage of \nconstitutional amendments and ratification of treaties, where more than \na simple majority of Senators is required. Confirmation of judges is \nnot one of these areas.\n  The Senate rules have changed on several occasions over the years as \nto whether and in what circumstances a filibuster is allowed, but we \nhave, unfortunately, come to a point in time where the filibuster is \nbeing abused to hold up judicial nominees on which we are required to \nact; that is, to say yes or no. I believe it is in violation of the \nConstitution.\n  I want to take a point in fact relative to the circuit in which I \npracticed for a number of years, and that is what is happening today \nwith regard to the judicial nominee to the Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The Democrats have held up confirmation of the only nominee \nPresident Bush has made to the Eleventh Circuit Court which handles \nFederal appeals in my home State of Georgia as well as Alabama and \nFlorida.\n  As a result, on February 20 of last year, President Bush exercised \nhis constitutional authority to make a recess appointment of Judge Bill \nPryor, the former attorney general of the State of Alabama. This recess \nappointment is temporary in nature, but President Bush has renominated \nJudge Pryor in the 109th Congress for a permanent position on the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As a former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I know we need \nto review with great care the qualifications of judicial nominees to \nensure\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\nthat they have established a record of professional competence, \nintegrity, and the proper temperament for judicial service. I intend to \nvote for confirmation of Judge Pryor's nomination to the Eleventh \nCircuit for the following reasons: Since his recess appointment, Judge \nPryor has gained the respect of his colleagues on the Eleventh Circuit \nwithout regard to political persuasions. This is no surprise to me \nbecause Judge Pryor is a tremendously selfless public servant who has \nworked very hard to help others both within and outside the scope of \nhis official duties.\n  In private life, he established a program called Mentor Alabama which \nprovides adult role models for at-risk children, and he has personally \nacted as such a mentor. In his service as attorney general for the \nState of Alabama, Bill Pryor established a record of evenhanded \nenforcement of the law. A noteworthy example of his fairminded \ntreatment of his public duties is his enforcement of Alabama abortion \nlaws. Bill Pryor is personally opposed to abortion based on his deeply \nheld faith as a Roman Catholic. However, in 1997, the Alabama \nLegislature enacted a ban on partial birth abortion that did not \ncomport with the Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. The Alabama statute prohibited abortions prior to as well as \nfollowing viability of the fetus. Attorney General Pryor ordered law \nenforcement officials to enforce the law only insofar as it was \nconsistent with the Supreme Court's precedents which encompassed only \npostviability situations. In so doing, he adopted the narrowest \npossible construction of the Alabama statute.\n\n  Moreover, in the wake of September 11, 2001, many abortion clinics \nwere receiving letters with threats of anthrax exposure. In response, \nAttorney General Pryor held a press conference in which he asserted \nthat the Alabama law ``provides stern felony penalties for those who \nnow prey upon the public anxiety over fears of anthrax and other \npotential dangers. We warn anyone who is tempted to do so that their \ndeeds are not a joke and will not be treated as mild misbehavior, but \nas a despicable crime against their fellow citizens that will not be \ntolerated.'' At this crucial time in history, Bill Pryor's statement \nsent a clear message that anthrax threats against abortion clinics \nwould be prosecuted vigorously.\n  Despite his personal religious convictions, Bill Pryor has a keen \nknowledge of the Constitution's requirement that the Government make no \nlaw respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\n  In Chandler v. Siegleman, as attorney general he persuaded the \nEleventh Circuit to vacate a district court injunction that prohibited \nstudent-initiated prayers in school. Acknowledging the constitutional \ndistinction between student-led prayers and teacher-led prayers, Bill \nPryor refused to argue on appeal in favor of the constitutionality of \nteacher-led prayers as was the position of then Alabama Governor Fob \nJames. In addition, General Pryor rejected Governor James' suggestion \nthat the State of Alabama argue that the first amendment was never \nincorporated by the 14th amendment and thus does not apply to the \nStates.\n  In sum, Bill Pryor has established an impressive record as a fair, \ndiligent, and competent public servant. His nomination to the Eleventh \nCircuit enjoys strong bipartisan support in his home State of Alabama, \nand in my home State, our attorney general, the Honorable Thurbert \nBaker, a Democrat, has written in support of Bill Pryor's nomination.\n  I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop holding up the confirmation \nof President Bush's only nominee to the Eleventh Circuit by voting to \nmove forward with Judge Pryor's nomination when it reaches the floor.\n  Now let us look at another circuit. I just explained what the \nsituation is with the Eleventh Circuit. Opposition to some of President \nBush's nominees in other areas of the country such as the Ninth Circuit \nstrikes me as odd because it directly contradicts what some Democrats \nhave said in the past about the concept of balance on the courts.\n  My friend from the other side of the aisle, the senior Senator from \nNew York, acknowledged a couple of years ago in a speech on the Senate \nfloor that the Ninth Circuit was ``by far the most liberal court in the \ncountry.''\n  To quote from the Congressional Record of March 13, 2003, Senator \nSchumer stated:\n\n       I believe there has to be balance, balance on the courts. \n     And I have said this many times, but there is nothing wrong \n     with a Justice Scalia on the court if he is balanced by a \n     Justice Marshall. I wouldn't want five Scalias, but one might \n     make a good and interesting and thoughtful court with one \n     Brennan. A Rehnquist should be balanced by a Marshall.\n\n  Four of President Bush's nominees to the Ninth Circuit--Richard \nClifton, Jay Bybee, Consuelo Callahan, and Carlos Bea--have been \nconfirmed and are now sitting on the Ninth Circuit. That is the good \nnews. But Democrats refused to give an up-or-down vote to two of \nPresident Bush's nominees to the Ninth Circuit, or one-third of the \njudges he has nominated. When one considers that 14 out of the 26 \nactive sitting judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals were \nappointed by President Clinton and 2 of them were confirmed in the last \nyear of his Presidency, the Judiciary Committee and the Senate in \ngeneral treated President Clinton fairly with respect to the Ninth \nCircuit. Moreover, of the 28 total seats on the Ninth Circuit, 17 were \nDemocratic nominees, 14 by President Clinton and 3 by President Jimmy \nCarter.\n\n  We now have two remaining seats on the Ninth Circuit to fill, and we \nhave seen two nominees from President Bush to fill these seats. The \nfairness that the Senate showed President Clinton's nominees has not \nbeen applied to all of President Bush's nominees, as the two nominees, \nCarolyn Kuhl and Bill Myers, have been filibustered despite their \ntremendous qualifications.\n  President Clinton had 8 years in office and was able to put in over \nhalf the active judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I might \nadd that some of these active judges turned out to be activist judges. \nBut with due respect to my colleagues on the other side, it is time to \nbalance out 17 Clinton and Carter nominees with qualified individuals \nsuch as Carolyn Kuhl and Bill Myers. That is the kind of balance we \nneed on the Ninth Circuit.\n  One of the reasons the Ninth Circuit needs some balance is the \noutrageous nature of some of the decisions coming from that bench. For \nexample, in the 1996-1997 term, Judge Reinhart, a Carter appointee, was \noverturned six times in cases where he was the author of the majority \nopinion.\n  To cite specific examples of outrageous cases of judicial activism, \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has, first, barred children in \npublic schools from voluntarily reciting the Pledge of Allegiance--that \nwas in Newdow v. U.S. Congress, a 2002 case; second, initially barred \nCalifornia from holding a gubernatorial recall election notwithstanding \na clear State statutory scheme and widespread popular support, which \nwas a 2003 decision in the case of Southwest Voter Registration \nEducation Project v. Shelley; third, invented a constitutional right to \ncommit suicide, a 1996 decision, Compassion in Dying v. Glucksberg; and \nfourth, made it far more difficult to prosecute those who give material \nsupport to foreign terrorist organizations, the case of Humanitarian \nLaw Project v. U.S. Department of Justice, a 2003 case.\n  Also, this court struck down California's three strikes criminal \nsentencing law in the case of Andrade v. California in 2001 and only \nimplemented the Supreme Court's reversal of that decision by a divided \npanel with Judge Reinhardt upholding the defendant's sentence only \nunder the Supreme Court's ``compulsion'' and Judge Pregerson stating \nthat ``in good conscience'' he could not follow the Supreme Court's \ndecision.\n  Lastly, that court held that a foreign national criminal apprehended \nabroad pursuant to a legally valid indictment was entitled to sue the \nU.S. Government for money damages, a 2003 case, Alvarez-Machain v. \nUnited States.\n  I could go on, but there is no small wonder, then, that even Senator \nSchumer has stated:\n\n       The Ninth Circuit is by far the most liberal court in the \n     country. Unless this is the kind of activist court that \n     Democrats want to preserve, it's time to at least allow an \n     up-or-down vote on nominees like Carolyn Kuhl and Bill Myers \n     to restore some balance.\n\n  There have been two issues that have been raised by the other side \nduring the debate and the filibuster by the\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nother side of the aisle relative to the judicial nominees sent up by \nthe President. One of those is the fact that filibustering Federal \njudges is not something that is new, and it is a contention of the \nother side of the aisle that Republicans initiated a filibuster on the \nnomination of Judge Abe Fortas back in the Johnson administration. I \nwill once again set the record straight relative to exactly what \nhappened, and I will quote because I want to make sure that we get this \nexactly right. This is from a statement made by the former chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, in some remarks that were \nmade on the Senate floor on March 1, 2005. Senator Hatch stated as \nfollows:\n\n       Some have said that the Abe Fortas nomination for Chief \n     Justice was filibustered. Hardly. I thought it was, too, \n     until I was corrected by the man who led the fight against \n     Abe Fortas, Senator Robert Griffin of Michigan, who then was \n     the floor leader for the Republican side and, frankly, the \n     Democratic side because the vote against Justice Fortas, \n     preventing him from being Chief Justice, was a bipartisan \n     vote, a vote with a hefty number of Democrats voting against \n     him as well. Former Senator Griffin told me and our whole \n     caucus there never was a real filibuster because a \n     majority would have beaten Justice Fortas outright. Lyndon \n     Johnson, knowing that Justice Fortas was going to be \n     beaten, withdrew the nomination. So that was not a \n     filibuster. There had never been a tradition of \n     filibustering majority-supported judicial nominees on the \n     floor of the Senate until President Bush became President.\n\n  I think that factual statement by Senator Hatch says it all relative \nto any issue concerning the contention that this is not the first time \nwe have seen filibusters on the floor of the Senate. As we move into \nthe consideration of these judges for confirmation, I am not sure what \nis going to come out from the other side.\n  I have great respect, first of all, for this institution in which we \nserve. I am very humbled by the fact, as is every one of the 100 \nSenators here, that our respective States have seen fit to send us here \nto represent them. But as I traveled around the country last year, \ncampaigning for President Bush, as well as for Senate nominees, I \ncontinuously heard from individuals--whether it was in a formal \ngathering or whether it was in an informal gathering such as, on a lot \nof occasions, being in airports, or sometimes even walking down the \nstreet--it was unbelievable the number of Americans, and I emphasize \nthat these were not Republicans or Democrats in every instance, they \nwere just Americans who were very much concerned about what is \nhappening with respect to the judicial nominees on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator now has 2 minutes left, at \nwhich time there will be 10 minutes left for the majority.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Chair.\n  This body has a number of rules which have been in place for decades. \nThose are good and valid rules and need to be followed in most \ninstances. But there comes a time when you have to look the American \npeople in the eye and say: I know Americans sent a majority party to \nthe Senate, and I know you want us to carry out the will of the \nAmerican people but, unfortunately, even though it only takes 51 votes \nto confirm one of President Bush's judicial nominees, we have a Senate \nrule that says you have to have 60 votes before you get to the point \nwhere you only have to have 51 votes. It doesn't take a Philadelphia \nlawyer to figure out something is wrong with that rule, and it needs to \nbe corrected.\n  As we move into the consideration of these judges, I hope we will \nreach an accord so the integrity of this institution will be \nmaintained. Hopefully, our rules can be maintained intact. But it is \nimperative we do the will of the American people, which is move toward \nthe confirmation of the President's judicial nominees as required by \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3508-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3508-S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ISSUES CONFRONTING THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues my \nobservations and urgings on two issues: One, following on the eloquent \nremarks of the Senator from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, on the importance \nof judges and actions in the Senate; and the second has to do with our \nNational Guard and Reserves who are being called up for duty and what \nthe Federal Government can do to be helpful to them.\n\n\n                                 Judges\n\n  First, on judges, I look at four pillars as being essential for a \nfree and just society: freedom of religion, freedom of expression, \nprivate ownership of property, and fourth, the rule of law. The rule of \nlaw is where judges come in, where you have fair adjudication of \ndisputes, as well as the protection of our God-given rights.\n  It is absolutely essential we have judges on the bench at the Federal \nlevel, and at all levels, who understand their role is to adjudicate \ndisputes, to apply the facts and evidence of the case to the laws, laws \nmade by elected Representatives. We are a representative democracy. \nThat means the judges ought to apply the law, not invent the law, not \nserve as a superlegislature, not to use their own opinions as to what \nthe law should be but rather apply it. That is absolutely essential for \nthe rule of law, for the credibility and stability one would want to be \nable to rely on in our representative democracy for investments and, as \nwe advance freedom, to try to have the people of other countries around \nthe world put into place these four pillars of a free and just society.\n  What we have seen is a break of precedent in the Senate. For 200 \nyears judicial nominees from the President, when they were put forward, \nwere examined by the Judiciary Committee very closely, as they should \nbe, as to their temperament, philosophy, and scholarship. If they \nreceived a favorable recommendation from the committee, they would come \nto the floor and Senators would vote for them or against them. In the \nlast 2 or 3 years, what we have seen is unprecedented obstruction, a \nrequirement, in effect, of a 60-vote margin for judges, particularly at \nthe appellate level. The most egregious in recent years, in my view, \nwas Miguel Estrada. He is an outstanding individual, completely \nqualified--great scholarship, great experience--a modern-day Horatio \nAlger story, having come to this country from Central America, applying \nhimself, doing well. Indeed, the American Bar Association unanimously \ngave him their highest recommendation and endorsement.\n  That went on for a year. Then it went on for another year. It went on \nfor over 2 years, and he finally had to withdraw, notwithstanding the \nfact that a vast majority of Senators were actually for Miguel Estrada.\n  It is not unique to him. It has happened to roughly 10 or so \nappellate judges, including those nominated for the Ninth Circuit, \nwhich is the circuit where you have adventurous, activist judges who \nignore the will of the people. For example, the recitation of the \nPledge of Allegiance in schools, which they struck down because they \nare concerned about the words ``under God.'' That is the sort of \nactivist judiciary that is ignoring the will of the people, who are the \nowners of this Government.\n  People say: What do we need to do, and they up come with this term, \n``nuclear option.'' It is a constitutional option. It shows how out of \ntouch people are in calling this a nuclear option, when all it is is \nthe question of whether it is a majority vote to give advice and \nconsent or to dissent on a particular judicial nomination. It is my \nview, in the event the minority party continues with the approach of \nobstructing the opportunity of a nominee to have fair consideration, \nthen this constitutional option must be utilized. We should not be \ntimid. We should not cower. I believe the obstructionist approaches are \npreventing me from exercising my duty and responsibility to the people \nof the Commonwealth of Virginia to advise and consent on these judicial \nnominations. I hope my colleagues will not continue this obstructionist \napproach. In the event they do, then we have to use the constitutional \noption. I do not think it is too much to ask Senators to get off their \nhaunches and show the backbone or spine to vote yes or no, but vote, \nand then explain to their constituents why they voted the way they did \non any particular man or woman who has been nominated to a particular \njudicial position.\n  I am hopeful we do not have to use it, but if we do, go for it. Do \nnot cower. Do\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nnot be timid. The people, as my colleague from Georgia said, all across \nthis country, whether they are down in Cajun country in Louisiana, \nwhether they are in Florida, whether they are in the Black Hills of \nSouth Dakota, or whether they are in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, \nexpect action on judges. As much as people care about less taxation and \nenergy security for this country and wanting us to be leaders in \ninnovation, they really expect the Senate to act on judges. It is a \nvalues issue. It is a good government issue. It is a responsibility-in-\ngoverning issue that needs to be addressed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 356\n\n  I would like to turn my attention to the amendment pending on the \nsupplemental, one submitted by Senators Durbin, Mikulski, and me. This \namendment will eliminate the pay gap that many of our Federal employees \nwho serve in either the National Guard or the Reserves suffer when they \nare called up for active duty. We need to do everything we can within \nreason to recruit and retain those who serve in the Guard and Reserves. \nWe, as a Federal Government, and I, as a Senator, encourage private \nbusinesses to make up that pay gap.\n  Many times, when people get called up, their Active-Duty pay is less \nthan they would be getting in the primary job. That is what the pay gap \nis. It is one of the key factors, top five factors in people not re-\nupping. It does have an impact on their families. On average, the pay-\ngap loss is about $368 a month. They still have housing payments, they \nstill have food. Many of those who serve in the Guard and Reserve have \nfamilies, and those expenses go on.\n  Out of the 1.2 million members of the National Guard and Reserves, \n120,000 are also employees of the Federal Government. As of January \n2005, 43,000 Federal employees have been activated since September 11, \n2001, and are serving courageously and beneficially for our freedom and \nour security. Right now there are more than 17,000 on active duty.\n  There are those firms in the private sector who have made up this pay \ngap. There are over 900 companies, such as IBM, Sears, General Motors, \nUPS, Ford, that make up the pay differential. In fact, 23 States have \nenacted similar legislation to make up the pay difference. I am proud \nto say one of them is the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  The Senate has supported this in the past. I think it makes a great \ndeal of sense that we support not only the members of the Guard and \nReserves who are called up to active duty who serve in the Federal \nGovernment, but also support their families. I think this amendment, \nwhich I am sponsoring along with Senators Durbin and Mikulski, makes a \ngreat deal of sense. It is one I hope, when we get to voting on it \nsometime today, will enjoy the support of all the Members of the \nSenate. It is very important we do what we can, within reason, to help \nin the recruitment and retention of those who are serving our country, \nwho are disrupting their lives and, in fact, are being called up more \nfrequently and for longer duration than ever before.\n  I hope we will see that agreed to on the supplemental some time \ntoday. I also hope we will get back to the 200-year history of the \nSenate on consideration, treatment, and actual voting on outstanding \njudicial nominees who have come out of the Judiciary Committee with a \nfavorable recommendation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, am I correct that we are in \nmorning business and it is appropriate to address the Senate in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday it live the \nnomination and confirmation process as envisioned by our Constitution \nwith regard to two nominees. The Constitution, of course, provides that \nit is a two-step process: the President nominates and the Senate then \nconfirms or rejects. In this case, there was quite a contrast between \nthe two nominees.\n  In one of my committees, the Foreign Relations Committee, we have a \nhighly contentious, highly divisive debate raging over the nominee of \nthe President, Mr. John Bolton, to be the Permanent Representative of \nthe United States to the United Nations. It is a very significant post \nrepresenting the wishes of the American people, of the U.S. Government, \nto the world body, the United Nations.\n  While at the same time those confirmation hearings were occurring in \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, another one of my committees, \nthe Commerce Committee, was considering the nomination of Dr. Michael \nGriffin to be administrator of NASA. Dr. Griffin's nomination is quite \na contrast to Mr. Bolton's nomination, for it is embraced almost \nunanimously in a bipartisan way. The extraordinary support is shown \neven to the point that the chair of the Science and Space Subcommittee, \nSenator Hutchison of Texas, and I, the ranking member of that \nsubcommittee, both requested that the chairman of the full committee, \nSenator Stevens, accelerate the confirmation process. So that Dr. \nGriffin could be confirmed by the committee and we could get his \nnomination to the floor of the Senate this week, putting him in place \nas the administrator next Monday. NASA desperately needs to have a \nstrong leader in place, particularly as we recover from the disaster to \nColumbia. We are also going to launch an expected flight for recovery \nsomewhere about the middle of May. That is the contrast between two \nnominees.\n  I think one of the things that makes Dr. Griffin so attractive as the \nhead of NASA is not only that he is literally a rocket scientist with \nsix graduate degrees. Not only does he have exceptional experience in \nthe Nation's space program, both the manned and unmanned programs, but \nhe carries with him a demeanor that contains an element of humility, \nwhich will serve him well in the NASA family. NASA is a family. We have \nseen that borne out in the history of our space program in times of \ntragedy as we have had in the past. The NASA family comes together, and \nin times of triumph not only with the extraordinary space \naccomplishments we have had, but in times of extraordinary triumph \nwhere in fact it has been said that failure is not an option. The \nextraordinary success we had with Apollo 13 in which we thought we had \nthree dead men on the way to the Moon when the Apollo module blew up, \nand how in real time people in a simulator back in Houston, people in \nmission control, the design engineers--all came together to figure out \nthe fix. Since the main propulsion system had blown up, rapidly losing \nelectricity, and how to design the circumstances which in a trajectory \ntowards outer space they could get back home safely to Earth. And they \ndid that.\n  That is another illustration of how the NASA family works when it \ncomes together. It wants a leader who has an appreciation of that \nfamily, who knows something about the business of that family, and who \nin fact can comport themselves with humility.\n  Interestingly, this is a contrast to the other nomination being \nconsidered at the same time, on the very same day, in another one of my \ncommittees. This is a controversial nomination because of the alleged \nimproprieties which stem not from a sense of humility but from a sense \nof entitlement, even bordering on arrogance in demanding one's way. Not \none's personal beliefs and ideology--we can all debate those because \nthose are differences of issues. But in this particular case, Mr. \nBolton is alleged to have berated intelligence analysts and, according \nto the allegations from some former very high-ranking State Department \nofficials, insisting that they be fired, dismissed, or transferred \nbecause their analysis of the intelligence differed with his. Contrast \nthe personalities, the nominee to be NASA administrator and the nominee \nto be the U.S. Representative to the U.N., contrast of styles, contrast \nof attitudes, and contrast of capabilities. Thus, it leads to \nextraordinary differences in the nomination process.\n  I wish all of the nominations were as Dr. Griffin in NASA, except for \none hiccup that I think we are taking care of with the junior Senator \nfrom Virginia. It is my hope that today Chairman Stevens will call the \ncommittee, that\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nwe will vote Dr. Griffin out of the Commerce Committee and get his \nnomination to the floor. At least by tomorrow, so his name can be sent, \nconfirmed, and the President can go ahead and swear him in.\n\n\n                        Information Data Brokers\n\n  If that were not enough to engage one Senator from the State of \nFlorida in activities, we also saw yesterday a day that started to \nbring out new revelations on a completely different subject. This time \nwe found from the wire reports that the number of names which had been \nthought to have been missing or stolen from an information data broker, \nnamely one located in my State, a company called Seisint in Boca Raton, \nFL, owned by LexisNexis. The company is owned by an international \nconglomerate located in France, which a month ago announced that 30,000 \nnames were missing--that is 30,000 names and Social Security numbers, \nand who knows how much other sensitive information. These records are \ncompiled in this company for many law enforcement agencies. We were \ntold yesterday the number is now not 30,000, it is 10 times that; it is \nover 300,000.\n  This is one of a series of five or six revelations in the last 2 \nmonths of information. Data brokers trade and sell this information \nabout us--information that normally we would be so careful in seeing \nthat it's secured and locked up or shredded so somebody can't get that \ninformation and go out and steal our identity. We now find these \ninformation brokers--in one case called ChoicePoint--have 12 billion \nrecords; they have records on virtually every American.\n  We have seen over the last couple of months a series of these stories \nwhere the information is suddenly missing, or they found that somebody \nhoodwinked them and bought their information under false pretenses. It \nis now out in the public domain in somebody else's hands.\n  Members of the Senate, if we don't do something about this, none of \nus in America will have any privacy left because our personal \nidentities will be taken from us.\n  I hope Senators have had an opportunity to experience what I have in \ntalking with victims of identification theft. One of the biggest \ncomplaints, aside from the harassment and the financial losses, is they \ncan't get their identity back. They do not know where to go. They go to \ntheir local law enforcement. We can't help you. They go to their State \nagencies. We can't help you. They go here, they go there, and they keep \ngetting referred to somebody else, and all the while somebody else has \ntheir identity. Maybe they are put on the watch list, or the do-not-fly \nlist, or suddenly they are getting dinged for $25,000 charges on a \ncredit card, or their driver's license--such as the truck driver's \nlicense in Florida which gives the privilege of driving vehicles loaded \nwith hazardous materials. Guess what that would do in the wrong hands.\n  We find, if we don't do something, that none of us will have any \nprivacy left. It used to be in the old days that we were careful to \nshred our records, or keep them locked up. Now we know all of this \nprivate, personal, and financial information is in the hands of \ninformation brokers who have it on computer--billions of bits of \ninformation. They are trading it and selling it and buying it. There is \nsomething we can do about it. I suggested one way a month ago when I \noffered a bill that has been referred to the Commerce Committee. Today, \nSenator Schumer of New York and I have taken a number of bills, \nincluding mine and his, and we have put them together into a \ncomprehensive package. The bill is being referred to the Commerce \nCommittee, and it is my hope we will get the Senate to start moving on \nthis. As we speak, the Judiciary Committee is having a hearing on this \nvery subject. It is my hope we will get some action so we can protect \nthe personal identity of every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3510-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3510-S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR OPTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I imagine that recently it has been \npretty difficult to wake up every morning to read the newspaper if you \nare a Federal judge. Extremists in and out of Washington, DC, have \nnearly declared war on the judiciary, from demanding retribution for \nrecent decisions that lawmakers disagree with to suggesting impeachment \nfor judges who do not toe the party line. It is discouraging, it is \ndisheartening, and it is downright wrong.\n  But what is so concerning about this recent rhetorical assault is it \nis being backed by action that has nothing to do with judges and \neverything to do with increasing Republican power at the expense of our \nConstitution.\n  I am deeply concerned that Republicans are trying to increase their \npower by ignoring rules dating to our country's founding. They want to \npush through radical judicial nominees who will serve a lifetime on the \nbench by eliminating a 200-year-old American rule allowing each Member \nin the Senate to speak out on behalf of our constituents and to fight \nfor the ideals we hold dear.\n\n  We had an election last year, and it is true, Republicans ended up \nwith a majority in this body. But that does not mean half the country \nlost its voice. That does not mean tens of millions of Americans will \nhave no say in our democracy. That does not mean Republicans have carte \nblanche to pack the courts and to ignore the rights of the minority.\n  In reality, this is not about judges. This is not about a Senate \nprocedural change. This is, plainly and simply, a power grab and an \neffort to dismantle the checks and balances our Founding Fathers \ncreated. Without that system, the Senate would simply become a \nrubberstamp for the President. It would allow whichever political party \nis in power, Republican or Democrat, to have the say over our Nation's \ncourts. I will not stand for that.\n  This is a basic argument about the future of the Senate. It is about \nhow we are going to conduct our business. I believe in giving the \npeople a voice, in standing up for those people who sent me here, and \nin protecting the rights of minorities everywhere.\n  One of the first things every child is taught about American \nGovernment is the separation of the three branches. This separation and \nthe checks and balances that come with it are fundamental to the \ngreatest system of government ever created. This system is worth \nprotecting. That is exactly what many of my colleagues and I intend to \ndo.\n  This is not a debate about judicial nominations. It is about \nincreasing the amount of power that is wielded by the majority. We hear \na lot about judges in the Senate, so let me put that discussion in \ncontext for a minute.\n  The judges who serve on the Federal bench affect the lives and \nliberties of every American. These are lifetime appointments. This is \nnot the nomination to a commission or nomination to an ambassadorship; \nthis is a lifetime appointment for a Federal judge whose rulings over \nthe next 30 or 40 or more years will have ramifications for every \nsingle American.\n  As Senators, we are elected to serve our constituents. We are asked \nto confirm judges whose decisions can change U.S. history and shape the \nlives of American people for generations to come.\n  When any citizen, Republican or Democrat, in a blue State or a red \nState, a man or a woman, no matter what race, color, or creed, comes \nbefore a judge, we have a responsibility to ensure they will get a fair \nshake. That citizen, no matter who or where they are, must know our \nsystem will work for them. They have to have confidence in that.\n  How can we make those assurances to each and every Senator, \nRepublican or Democrat, red or blue State, man or woman, no matter what \nrace, color or creed, if Republicans alone are selecting, considering, \nand confirming them to the courts? I don't believe we can.\n  In addition, we expect Federal judges to provide the proper check in \nour system of checks and balances outlined in our Constitution. Without \nit, our system does not function properly. We have to ensure each and \nevery nominee for the courts has sufficient experience to sit in \njudgment of our fellow citizens. We have to ensure every nominee will \nbe fair to everyone who comes before their court. We have to ensure \nevery nominee will be evenhanded in administering justice, and we have \nto ensure every nominee will protect the rights and the liberties of \neach and every American.\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n  To determine if a nominee meets those standards, we have to explore \ntheir record, we have to ask them questions, we need to weigh their \nresponses. That is a tremendous responsibility of each and every \nSenator. It is one I take very seriously.\n  In the Senate we have made a lot of progress in confirming the judges \nPresident Bush has nominated. Look at the figures. The Senate has now \nconfirmed 205 judicial nominees of President Bush. In 3 years we have \nstopped 10 of those whose records raised the highest questions about \ntheir abilities to meet the standard of fairness every American \nexpects. Let me repeat that: We have confirmed 205 judicial nominees. \nThat is a confirmation of 95 percent. We have confirmed 205 judges, the \nbest confirmation rate since President Reagan. Today, 95 percent of \nFederal judicial seats are filled. This is the lowest number of \nvacancies in 13 years. There are now more Federal judges than ever \nbefore.\n  I have to point out while the majority is complaining today about our \nconfirmation rate, it was a different story during the Clinton \nadministration. Back then, Republicans used many roadblocks to stop or \nblock the confirmation of judges who were nominated by President \nClinton. During Clinton's second term, 175 of his nominees were \nconfirmed and 55 were blocked from getting votes. During those years, \nthe majority used the committee process to ensure nominees they \ndisagreed with never came to a vote in the Senate and 55 never received \nconsideration.\n\n  The Senate has an impressive record of confirming judges. That is \nclear in the 98-percent confirmation rate, the 95 percent of Federal \njudicial seats that are filled, and today the lowest number of \nvacancies in 13 years.\n  I will talk about the process we have used in my home State of \nWashington to confirm judges. We have worked out a system to ensure \nthat Washington judges are nominated and confirmed even when different \npolitical parties hold Senate seats or control the White House. For \nmany years I worked with a Republican Senator and a Democratic \nPresident to nominate and confirm Federal judges from my State. Today, \nwith a Republican President I am working with my colleague from \nWashington State on a bipartisan process to recommend judicial \ncandidates. We developed a bipartisan commission process that forwards \nnames to the White House. It has worked very well. Both sides had equal \nrepresentation on the commission. The commission interviews and vets \nthe candidates.\n  It worked for Senator Gorton and me when we forwarded names to \nPresident Clinton and it is working well for Senator Maria Cantwell and \nme as we recommend names to President Bush. I am very proud that during \nPresident Bush's first term we worked together to confirm five \nexcellent judges through this bipartisan commission.\n  We, in fact, confirmed Ron Leighton, a distinguished trial lawyer in \nTacoma who is now a U.S. district court judge for the western district \nof Washington in Tacoma.\n  We confirmed Lonny Suko as a district court judge for the eastern \ndistrict of my State. He is a distinguished lawyer and a U.S. \nmagistrate judge who has earned the respect of many in his work on some \nof eastern Washington's most difficult cases.\n  We also confirmed Judge Ricardo Martinez for a vacancy on the U.S. \ndistrict court for the western district of Washington State. He, in \nfact, holds the distinction of becoming the first Latino district judge \nin the history of our State. For over 5 years he has served as \nmagistrate judge for the U.S. District Court in the western district. \nBefore that, he was a superior court judge for 8 years and a King \nCounty prosecutor for 10 years. I will never forget calling him from \nthe Senate floor after we completed his vote on the confirmation. I \ncould hear the cheers in the background from a truly overjoyed, \ndeserving family.\n  Also during the first term we confirmed Judges Richard Tallman and \nJames Robart. Both of them are now serving lifetime appointments with \ndignity.\n  In Washington State, we are making genuine bipartisan progress \nconfirming judges. It is a process that serves the people of my home \nState well. Our record of bipartisanship makes this current Republican \npower grab all the more outrageous. The record proves it is not about \njudges at all. This procedure is about destroying the checks and \nbalances our Founding Fathers created to prevent the abuse of \nGovernmental power and to protect the rights and freedoms of all \nAmericans. Now we are hearing the Republicans want to destroy the \nindependence in Federal judges by rewriting the rules so they can ram \nthrough appointment of Federal judges, especially a Supreme Court \nJustice, who will overreach and roll back the rights of American \npeople.\n  Recent comments by advocates on the other side and even by some \nelected officials have left me very worried about the future of the \nindependent judiciary. It seems many in this country are intent on \nrunning roughshod over the Constitution, bent on misusing their power \nto destroy fundamental principles of our great democracy. That is not \nhow America works. It is not what our Founding Fathers intended. In our \ndemocracy, no single person and no single political party may impose \nextreme views on the Nation. The constitutional system of checks and \nbalances was set up for a reason. It has worked for two centuries. \nThere is no reason to destroy this fundamental principle now.\n  My colleagues and I are standing up to these abuses. We are fighting \nto protect the historic power of this body to make sure it is not a \nrubberstamp for sectarian, partisan, special interests. We will \ncontinue to do so.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time on this side and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to think \nabout the implications of what has been called the nuclear option and \nwhat effect that might have on this Chamber and on this country. I urge \nall of us to think not just about winning every debate but about \nprotecting free and democratic debate.\n  During my Senate campaign, I had the privilege and opportunity to \nmeet Americans from all walks of life and both ends of the political \nspectrum. They told me about their lives, about their hopes, about the \nissues that matter to them, and they also told me what they think about \nWashington.\n  Because my colleagues have heard it themselves, I know it will not \nsurprise many of them to learn that a lot of people do not think much \ngets done around here on issues about which they care the most. They \nthink the atmosphere has become too partisan, the arguments have become \ntoo nasty, and the political agendas have become too petty.\n  While I have not been here too long, I have noticed that partisan \ndebate is sharp, and dissent is not always well received. Honest \ndifferences of opinion and principled compromise often seem to be the \nvictim of a determination to score points against one's opponents.\n  But the American people sent us here to be their voice. They \nunderstand that those voices can at times become loud and \nargumentative, but they also hope we can disagree without being \ndisagreeable. At the end of the day, they expect both parties to work \ntogether to get the people's business done.\n  What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican or \nDemocrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so they can \nmake all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and \nkeep quiet.\n  The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone \nin this Chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the \nfilibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end to \ndemocratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock \nwill only get worse.\n  I understand that Republicans are getting a lot of pressure to do \nthis from factions outside the Chamber, but we\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nneed to rise above ``the ends justify the means'' mentality because we \nare here to answer to the people--all of the people, not just the ones \nwho are wearing our particular party label.\n  The fact is that both parties have worked together to confirm 95 \npercent of this President's judicial nominees. The Senate has accepted \n205 of his 214 selections. In fact, we just confirmed another one of \nthe President's judges this week by a vote of 95 to 0. Overall, this is \na better record than any President has had in the last 25 years. For a \nPresident who received 51 percent of the vote and a Senate Chamber made \nup of 55 percent of the President's party, I would say that confirming \n95 percent of their judicial nominations is a record to be proud of.\n  Again, I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with \nchanging these rules. In the long run, it is not a good result for \neither party. One day Democrats will be in the majority again, and this \nrule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a \nDemocratic minority.\n  I sense that talk of the nuclear option is more about power than \nabout fairness. I believe some of my colleagues propose this rule \nchange because they can get away with it rather than because they know \nit is good for our democracy.\n  Right now we are faced with rising gas prices, skyrocketing tuition \ncosts, a record number of uninsured Americans, and some of the most \nserious national security threats we have ever had, while our bravest \nyoung men and women are risking their lives halfway around the world to \nkeep us safe. These are challenges we all want to meet and problems we \nall want to solve, even if we do not always agree on how to do it. But \nif the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority \nparty and the millions of Americans who ask us to be their voice, I \nfear the partisan atmosphere in Washington will be poisoned to the \npoint where no one will be able to agree on anything. That does not \nserve anybody's best interest, and it certainly is not what the \npatriots who founded this democracy had in mind. We owe the people who \nsent us here more than that. We owe them much more.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, the pending business \nis the Durbin amendment which I offered yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I have been informed the Senate has not laid \ndown that measure yet.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3512-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3512-S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 356 TO H.R. 1268\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be added as cosponsors to my amendment: Senators Kerry, \nLandrieu, Sarbanes, Leahy, Lincoln and Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for those who are following the business \nof the Senate, after morning business we hope to move to closure of \ndebate on my amendment. It is my understanding that Senator Stevens is \nreturning from the White House and would like to speak on the \namendment, and we will have a formal unanimous consent request but it \nis my intent to protect his right to speak for up to 5 minutes and to \nprotect my right to close for up to 5 minutes. Otherwise, our goal is \nto try to have a vote at 12:15 on this amendment. I say that even \nthough there has not been a formal consent agreed to, but that is what \nthe discussion leads to.\n  For those who are following this debate, this is an important bill \nthat is before us. It is the supplemental appropriations bill. The \nPresident has come to Congress and asked for money to wage the war in \nIraq and Afghanistan. What we find curious is that this amount is not \nbeing included in the President's budget. In fact, he is arguing he is \nmoving toward a balanced budget but fails to include the cost of the \nwar.\n  It is my understanding, and I think I am close on this number, with \nthis additional $81 billion, we will have allocated and spent $210 \nbillion on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The President refuses to \ninclude this in his budget. If he did, we would have a much deeper \ndeficit than currently stated.\n  Those of us who believe in at least honesty in accounting cannot \nunderstand why we are doing this separately. Why do we have a \nsupplemental bill for this war in Iraq and Afghanistan when we are \nclearly going to be there for a period of time? I hope for a short \nperiod of time but at least for some period of time.\n  That budget argument aside, I will go to the merits of what we are \ndiscussing. The $81 billion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is a \nfigure that I will support. I was one of the Senators who joined my \ngreat friend and leader Senator Robert Byrd in voting against the \nresolution to authorize the President to use force in this war in Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There were 23 of us on the Senate floor who did that. I \nbelieve it was the right vote not because I am making any excuses for \nSaddam Hussein, a tyrant, a dictator, a man I am glad is out of power, \nbut many of us, particularly those of us sitting on the Intelligence \nCommittee at the time, felt there were representations being made to \nthe American people about the nature of this threat that were just \nplain wrong.\n\n  I listened in the Intelligence Committee as they described the \nevidence of weapons of mass destruction and was puzzled. I could not \nunderstand the statements from the administration which were coming out \nabout all of these weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that threatened \nus in the Middle East and around the world; the evidence was not there. \nThe people that we needed on the ground to confirm the evidence were \nnot there.\n  In addition, there was a lot of speculation about nuclear weapons \nthat Saddam Hussein was developing with aluminum tubes to be used in \ncentrifuges. As we listened to the agencies of our own Government in \nhot debate over whether or not these tubes had anything to do with \nnuclear weapons, I was puzzled as to how some of the leaders in this \nadministration could be talking about mushroom clouds because Saddam \nHussein is going to detonate a nuclear weapon. They talked about some \nconnection between the terrible tragedy of 9/11 on America and Saddam \nHussein, and yet there was no evidence--and there still is absolutely \nno evidence--connecting Saddam Hussein to that terrible tragedy that \noccurred on 9/11.\n  As this evidence accumulated, Senator Byrd, myself, and many others \nsaid the case that the administration is making for the invasion of \nIraq is not there. The evidence is not there. I personally feel one of \nthe worst things that can happen in a democracy is when the leadership \nof a democratic government misleads the American people into believing \nthere is a threat that does not exist.\n  I am not arguing that they deliberately misled us. It could have been \na sin of omission. I do not know the answer to that. But the fact is \nthose of us who voted against the use of force had serious questions as \nto the justification for the war, and I might add serious questions \nabout our readiness for that war. Trust me and other Senators, if we \nneeded to call on any military force in the world to perform a mission, \nI want to dial 911 and find the United States on the other end of the \nline. We have the very best military in the world. I knew they would \nacquit themselves very well once the invasion was under way, and I knew \nthey would be successful.\n  I could not predict how long it would take, and thank goodness it was \nshort-lived. But the military aspects of the war and the success \nnotwithstanding, it is clear that this administration was not prepared \nfor waging the peace that followed. They were unprepared in terms of \nthe number of men and women on the field, in terms of the equipment \nthat is available, such as armor for humvees and body armor for \nsoldiers. We were not prepared for it. Here we are, more than 2 years \nlater in Iraq, in\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\na position where we need to stay and finish, and we are still arguing \nover the basics.\n  I visited Iraq 3 weeks ago, went there after first going to Kuwait \nand visiting with our troops. I met with the 1644th Illinois National \nGuard unit, a transport unit that moves humvees and trucks back and \nforth between Baghdad and Kuwait City every single day at great danger \nto the men and women driving those vehicles. The first thing they \nwanted to show me was: get in the truck, sit here and look how cramped \nit is as we sit here for hours and look around. There is no armored \nprotection for us as we are driving back and forth through these \ndangerous zones. Two years after the invasion, we still do not have the \nadequate equipment that our troops need.\n\n  This bill will come before us, and I will support it. I had \nmisgivings, and still do, about the initiation of the invasion of Iraq \nbut I do not have any misgivings about providing our soldiers, our \nmarines, our airmen and our sailors the very best equipment and all the \nresources they need to perform their mission and come home safely.\n  Look at some other aspect of this war that is equally important. This \nis a different war than we have ever waged. This is a war that depends \non an American fighting force that is largely, or at least to a great \nextent, composed of men and women in the National Guard and Reserves. \nWe have not done this before, but we have to do it now. Were it not for \nthe 40 percent of the 157,000 or 160,000 men and women in Iraq from \nGuard and Reserve units, we would not be able to send our soldiers in \nthe field to fight. Thank goodness those Guard and Reserve units are \nthere.\n  Understand that unlike the Active-Duty military, the Guard and \nReserve military come in under different personal and family \ncircumstances. Here is a man or woman in a Guard unit in Illinois or \nvirtually any State who signed up to serve his or her country looking \nfor perhaps some scholarship assistance to go to school, ready to \nrespond to a natural disaster or to be called up for a few weeks at a \ntime, and they are being activated for lengthy periods, for a year to a \nyear and a half and sometimes more. It is creating a terrible hardship \nfor the families of these Guard and Reserve unit members.\n  The amendment that is pending before us is very basic. We have said \nto employers across America, if one of their employees is in the Guard \nor Reserve, and that employee is activated, do your best to stand \nbehind that employee and his family; make certain, if they can, they \nkeep their health insurance in place, if necessary; try to make up the \ndifferential in pay between what the military pays and what they were \nmaking in the private sector so that soldier who is off risking his \nlife is not worried about the family back home.\n  And guess what. Almost 1,000 American businesses have stepped forward \nand said: We accept the challenge. We believe in these men and women. \nWe believe in America. We are going to stand behind them. So when they \nare activated, these companies step up, as well as units of local \ngovernment, and make up the difference in pay, giving them the peace of \nmind to know that even though they are separated from their family \nwhile away overseas, they are going to have enough money coming in to \nmake the mortgage payments, pay the utility bills, and all the basics \nof life.\n  When it comes to employers, there is one employer that does not meet \nthat obligation; there is one employer in America, the largest single \nemployer of Guard and Reserve soldiers in America, that refuses to make \nup the difference in pay. There is one employer in America which has \nsaid for 2 straight years now, We will not protect the Guard and \nReserve soldiers' families while they are overseas fighting. There is \none employer in America that coincidentally is praising all of these \nprivate-sector employers for standing behind their soldiers and yet \nrefusing to cover their own employees. What is that employer? It is the \nUnited States Government. Our Federal Government refuses to make up the \npay differential for activated Federal employees who go into the Guard \nand Reserve. It turns out that some 51 percent of those who are serving \noverseas today have seen a dramatic cutback in their pay. How can we \nhave Web sites and speeches praising all of the employers across \nAmerica, the businesses that stand behind their soldiers, while the \nFederal Government does not?\n  So for the third time since the invasion of Iraq, I am offering this \namendment. It is called the Reservist Pay Security Act, and it says the \nFederal Government will meet the obligation private sector employers \nare meeting every day and make up the pay differential for Federal \nemployees who go overseas in the Guard and Reserve. It is not a radical \nsuggestion. It is a commonsense suggestion that we would stand behind \nthese employees and soldiers as we ask others to do.\n  I see some of my other colleagues are in the Chamber, and I am going \nto yield the floor at this moment. We are hoping for a vote at around \n12:15 or so, but we are going to accommodate the schedules of the \nSenators and try to ask for a unanimous consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3513-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 333 And 334\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced two amendments to \nhelp our military families to be able to contend with the death of a \nloved one and the problems that flow to these families when one of \nAmerica's service people are lost either in combat or in the course of \nduty. The disruptions are obviously enormous and unimaginable in many \nways, but one of those disruptions is that after a period of 180 days, \neven in the middle of a school year, a widow would have to move off the \nbase notwithstanding the kids are in the middle of a school year. I can \ngive the names of people I have met in a number of instances over the \ncourse of the last couple of years traveling the country, people who \ntalked about the incredible disruption to their family because of this.\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\n  What we have learned listening to the commanders in the military and \nalso to the families is that when we recruit, we are not just \nrecruiting individual soldiers, and when we equip, we don't just equip \nby giving them the weapons and the technology they need to fight a war. \nWe recognize we recruit a whole family and we retain a whole family. We \nneed to have policies that are family thoughtful, family sensitive, so \nwe can retain people in the military, particularly in a volunteer force \nwhere we expend enormous public dollars in order to train people to \nprovide us with the superb capacity we have in our military.\n  One of my amendments would provide an extension of that 180-day \nperiod of time so you get a year for the school year issue and other \nissues of finding a suitable home and figuring out whether you are \ngoing to go back and live with your parents, what your job is going to \nbe, and where you are going to live, so all of these things are not \nproviding added pressure to families who are already remarkably \ndisrupted.\n  The second is an amendment that would extend the death benefits, the \ntotal death benefits to families so those families who are unfortunate \nenough to lose a loved one are not suffering for the rest of their \nlives as a consequence of that contribution to their Nation.\n  These amendments would be the first strong steps in what I call the \nmilitary families bill of rights. I am not going to go through all of \nthe details and the arguments for that, but I would like to say to my \ncolleagues that yesterday I sent out an e-mail asking Americans to send \nstories in about their personal struggles with these issues, or those \nof their friends and friends' families that they heard about.\n  In less than 24 hours over 2,000 families responded. They took the \ntime out of their busy days in the hopes that we would listen, so I \nwould like to share a few of those stories with my colleagues.\n  The first is a couple in Austin, TX, who e-mailed me about one of \ntheir two young children who has Job's syndrome. When their father was \ncalled to duty, Home Depot stopped paying his salary and cut his health \ninsurance. His wife, who was a schoolteacher, had to purchase insurance \non the open market, leaving her finances in complete disarray. Her \ndaughter was in the hospital so often that she eventually used up all \nof her sick and vacation days. The school docked her pay for lost time, \nand her financial situation went from bad to worse.\n  This is because her husband was serving his country, but the \nGovernment did nothing for his family to make up that difference.\n\n  I got an e-mail from a pharmacist whose nurses were upset about a \nwoman who could not afford medication for her child because her husband \nhad been called to duty in Iraq. They eventually found a way to get the \nmother the medication that her daughter needed, but the pharmacist was \nleft questioning his Nation's leadership. Here is what he said:\n\n       I was dismayed that there apparently was no help available \n     for this mother whose husband was serving his country.\n\n  A guy in Abilene, TX, e-mailed me about his first friend in the world \nwho was shot down in Iraq. He left behind a wife and three children. \nOver 2,000 people honored him at the memorial service, but that did not \ndo anything to help his parents, who were draining their retirement \nsavings to get health insurance for their grandchildren. This fallen \nsoldier's friend wrote:\n\n       Nathan's family is getting by because of their love and \n     faith in God and each other, but after losing a son in \n     service to America, they should not have to struggle to see \n     that his wife and children will get by. His wife has already \n     lost her husband, and his children will already grow up \n     without their father. His daughter Courtney will not have her \n     Dad to walk her down the aisle when she marries. They will \n     not have a Dad at their High School graduations or at the \n     birth of their children. They should not have to sacrifice \n     anymore.\n\n  That is what this friend wrote to us, all of us Senators. Finally, I \nwant to share a letter I received in February from Amy Beth Moore from \nFort Hood, TX. Her two children, Meghan, age 13, and Sean, age 10, no \nlonger have their father Jim. During his tour in Iraq, Jim was shot at, \nand his Hummer took a near deadly bullet in the gas tank. When he \nreturned home, he was a senior officer in charge of refitting his unit \nfor the next deployment. This required frequent helicopter flights back \nand forth from Texarkana.\n  On November 29, 2004, his Blackhawk crashed, killing Jim and six \nother soldiers. Listen to what Amy wrote:\n\n       Consider our predicament. But for the grace of God, my \n     husband would not have survived a deployment to Iraq and then \n     was working to ready the Fourth Infantry Division for its \n     next deployment. Why should it matter where he was killed \n     while serving proudly in the military? Why should we as his \n     surviving wife and children not be entitled to the increased \n     death gratuity and life insurance? I have been a full time \n     mom, managing the home front of a career soldier and it is \n     now up to me as a widow and a single parent to provide for \n     our children. These benefits would greatly assist me in doing \n     that and frankly, without them, we will have a serious \n     challenge in the days and months and years ahead without Jim. \n     I know that compensation in any form will in no way make up \n     for the loss of a loved husband and father and all the missed \n     moments that we would have shared as a family, but nothing is \n     more important to me right now than trying to take care of my \n     children, and it is on their behalf that I make this request.\n\n  We have heard from military families. We have heard from friends. \nThere are thousands more such stories across the Nation. The test is \nwhether we, as a matter of conscience and common sense, are going to do \nwhat is right for those who serve our country.\n  I thank the Appropriations Committee for fixing part of this, for \ngoing beyond the administration's request to limit the benefit to \ncombat. But now I ask my colleagues to heed the advice of uniformed \nmilitary leaders about those on active duty today and their families in \nthe military. We need to provide this benefit to all Active-Duty \npersonnel.\n  Amy Beth Moore is right. What difference does it make where he was \nkilled? He was killed preparing the troops to do what we need to do in \nIraq, and his loss is as real whether he was killed in Iraq or \nelsewhere. If we fail to adopt these amendments we are going to confirm \nthe greatest fears of Amy Beth Moore and the over 2,000 Americans who \ne-mailed their stories to me, that Washington talks a good game but \ndoesn't really care about these families.\n  For the survivors of our Nation's fallen heroes, much of life \nremains. Although no one can ever put a price on the loss of the life \nof any loved one, it is up to us to try to be generous, and I think \ncorrect, in helping them to put their lives back together. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in working toward a strong bipartisan military \nfamilies bill of rights that does right by those who serve and by their \nfamilies. I hope we can start that by taking the right direction in \nadopting these two important amendments today.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia again for his \ncourtesy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Durbin as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask if the Senator will add my name as a \ncosponsor to both amendments.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am honored to have the Senator from West Virginia as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the bill before us contains funding for a \nnumber of items that can hardly be described as emergencies, despite \nthe fact that they are contained in an emergency supplemental funding \nbill.\n  One of those items that fairly leaps off the page is a $36 million \nearmark, tucked away in the report under military construction for the \nArmy, to build a new, permanent prison at Guantanamo, Cuba. Why is this \ntucked away as an emergency? It is to house detainees from the war on \nterrorism.\n  What struck me about this item is that the American people are being \nasked to build a permanent prison to house 220 prisoners from the war \non terrorism when the courts have not yet determined the legal status \nof the detainees or whether the United States can continue to hold \nthese individuals indefinitely without charging them with a crime.\n  We are walking on thin ice here--thin ice. If ever there was a case \nof putting the cart before the horse, this seems to be it. Construction \nof a new\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\npermanent prison in Guantanamo assumes that the United States has in \nplace a solid policy and a valid requirement for the long term \ninternment of detainees at that site when in fact neither the policy \nnor the requirement has been validated.\n  Ever since the Supreme Court ruled last year that U.S. law applied to \nGuantanamo, and that prisoners held there could challenge their \ndetentions in Federal Court, the status of the detainees at Guantanamo \nhas been a matter of open debate. A flurry--we have reached beautiful \nspring weather now, but a flurry of subsequent legal challenges mixed \nwith allegations of prisoner abuse have only muddied the waters \nfurther.\n  In August, a Federal district judge ruled that the military tribunals \nbeing conducted at Guantanamo must be halted because they did not \nprovide minimally fair procedures and violated international law. Hey, \nlook out here. Look what we are doing. Where are we going? Meanwhile, \nanother Federal judge recently stopped the Government from transferring \ndetainees from Guantanamo to other countries pending a review of the \nprocess.\n  What is wrong with that? At the heart of the Guantanamo detention \ncontroversy is whether the detainees are entitled to prisoner of war \nstatus under the 1949 Geneva Convention, or are they, as the \nadministration contends, ``enemy combatants'' who are entitled to no \njudicial oversight. It is a complex legal debate that is unlikely to be \nresolved anytime soon.\n  And yet the White House has determined that the construction of a $36 \nmillion maximum security prison at Guantanamo is such an urgent \nrequirement that it cannot allow the courts to rule on the validity of \nthe administration's detainee policy or even wait for the regular \nappropriations process. Not even wait for the regular bill--put it in \nthe supplemental.\n  This despite the fact that there is currently no overcrowding at \nGuantanamo, that the prison population is steadily declining--down to \napproximately 540 from a high of about 750--and that the Pentagon has \nalready built a $16 million, permanent, state-of-the-art maximum \nsecurity prison at Guantanamo to hold 100 prisoners. At the same time, \naccording to an article last month in The New York Times, the Defense \nDepartment is trying to enlist the aid of the State Department and \nother agencies to transfer more prisoners out of Guantanamo, in an \neffort to cut by more than half the current population at Guantanamo.\n  The fact is, the Pentagon has no idea at this point how many \ndetainees from the war on terrorism are facing long term detention, or \nwhere they will eventually end up.\n  As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it at a hearing before the \nSenate Appropriations Committee in February, ``The Department of \nDefense would prefer not to have the responsibility for any \ndetainees.''\n  For once, I agree with Secretary Rumsfeld, particularly given the \nallegations of abuse that have dogged the Defense Department's \ntreatment of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Guantanamo. \nThe Defense Department should not automatically assume an open-ended \nburden of being the world's jailer of foreign enemy combatants.\n  Given all the uncertainties concerning the future requirements for \ndetention facilities at Guantanamo, where--oh where, tell me--is the \nurgency in this request? The Defense Department insists that prisoners \ncurrently in custody at Guantanamo are in conditions that are safe, \nsecure, and humane. The current detention facilities at Guantanamo \ninclude Camp 4, where detainees live in 10-man bays with nearly all-day \naccess to exercise yards and other recreational privileges; Camp 1, \nwhere detainees are housed in individual cells with a toilet and sink \nin each cell; and Camp 5, the new 100-bed maximum security prison that \nthe Pentagon boasts would be envied by many States. Camp Delta also \nboasts a 19-bed detainee hospital, which military officials describe as \na state-of-the-art facility, complete with first-rate dental care.\n  With the exception of the existing maximum security prison, these are \ntemporary facilities, but according to the Defense Department, they are \ndesigned to provide safe, secure, and humane housing for the prisoners. \nAs the Pentagon is quick to point out, the concrete slab and open-air \nchain-link enclosures that originally housed prisoners when the \nGuantanamo detention facilities opened in January of 2002 are long \ngone.\n  The Defense Department, in its justification for the new prison, \nasserts that the existing temporary facilities are nearing the end of \ntheir useful life, will not meet Geneva Convention requirements, and \nwill be subject to continued scrutiny by the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross, the ICRC, until facility standards are raised.\n  Playing the Geneva Convention card is a curious tactic coming from an \nadministration that selectively cherry-picks which of the Geneva \nConvention standards it chooses to apply to the prisoners at \nGuantanamo. The only Geneva Convention requirements cited by the \nDefense Department in its justification for the new prison are that \nhousing units and core functions should be contiguous and allow for \ncommunal conditions where practical--certainly nice-to-have amenities \nbut hardly a core requirement for the humane treatment of prisoners.\n  In fact, the ICRC's main concern about Guantanamo, according to the \norganization's website, is not contiguous detention units but the fact \nthat the administration has attempted to place the detainees in \nGuantanamo beyond the law. Building a new prison will not address that \nconcern, and it will not exempt the Guantanamo detention center from \nthe watchful eyes of the Red Cross. Nor will allegations of \nmistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo be resolved by trading one set \nof cell blocks for another.\n  There may indeed be advantages to moving more Guantanamo prisoners \nfrom temporary into permanent detention facilities, but until we have a \nclearer picture of the number of prisoners who will be housed there \nover the long term, there is no compelling reason to rush into spending \n$36 million of your money--it is your money--the taxpayers' dollars to \nbuild a prison based on guesstimates instead of facts.\n  At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, Gen \nBantz Craddock, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, which oversees \nGuantanamo, was asked what the Pentagon was doing to improve the \nquality of life for the U.S. military personnel assigned to Guantanamo. \nGeneral Craddock replied that he had submitted a list of unfunded \nrequirements of several million dollars for U.S. military facilities. \nBut, he continued, ``we are watching this closely because we don't want \nto get out in front of the policy with regard to the long-term detainee \nissue down there.''\n  That is good advice from General Craddock, and I would suggest that \nwe apply it to the detention facilities at Guantanamo as well. It is \nthe policy that should drive the construction, not the other way \naround. Before we ask the American taxpayers--before we ask you, the \npeople out there who are watching the Senate Chamber here with open \neyes, with open ears and probably with open mouths, you, it is your \nmoney--before we ask you, the American taxpayers to spend $36 million \nto build a brand new permanent prison for foreign detainees at \nGuantanamo we should make sure that we have an ironclad requirement for \nthat prison. Until the courts have resolved the legal status of the \nprisoners and until the Department of Defense and the administration \ndetermine the role of the department in the long-term detention of the \nprisoners, building a permanent maximum security prison at Guantanamo \nis premature.\n  Madam President, are there any pending amendments ahead of this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are amendments pending.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will take my amendment in the order in which the \namendment has been called up.\n  I ask unanimous consent ahead of time if it may be in order to have \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment, even though it won't be voted on at \nthis moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nlaid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 367\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 367.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce by $36,000,000 the amount appropriated for \n``Military Construction, Army'', with the amount of the reduction to be \n    allocated to funds available under that heading for the Camp 6 \n              Detention Facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba)\n\n       On page 169, line 13, strike ``$897,191,000'' and insert \n     ``$861,191,000''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to ask for the yeas and nays at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare preparing to seek unanimous consent that we have a series of three \nvotes that will begin at 1:45 p.m. today. These will be on or in \nrelation to the Durbin amendment and the two Kerry amendments which are \npending before the Senate. We hope to be able to reach agreement on \nthis consent request so Senators can be advised very soon that that \nwill be the order of the Senate.\n  That still leaves, of course, the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia which we will have an opportunity to discuss separate and \napart from these three that will be voted on. Then we will seek to deal \nwith that amendment in the regular order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to advise the Senate that \nwe have been able to reach agreement on a series of votes that will \noccur at 1:45. I am authorized by the leadership on both sides to \npropound this unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent at 1:45 p.m. today the Senate proceed to a \nseries of votes in relation to the following amendments: Durbin No. \n356; Kerry No. 333; Kerry No. 334; provided further that no amendments \nbe in order to these amendments prior to the votes, and that prior to \nthe Durbin vote Senator Stevens and Senator Durbin be allocated 5 \nminutes each to speak; further, that there be 2 minutes equally divided \nfor debate prior to each vote; finally, that all votes after the first \nbe limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I appreciate the cooperation of all \nSenators in getting this agreement. Senator Byrd has offered an \namendment on which the yeas and nays have been ordered, but we will not \nvote on that amendment until others who wish to speak on the amendment \nhave an opportunity to do so. That will occur at any time. If we do \ncomplete debate on the Byrd amendment prior to 1:45, that could be \nsomething we could consider adding, but at this point we are not \nprepared to make that announcement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, imagine how nervous you would be if I \ntold you as we go about our business in the Senate, hidden in the \nCapitol basement were over 500 tons of some of the deadliest material \never conceived by man, VX nerve gas. Suppose I told you it had been \nthere for decades, and although the authorities had previously promised \nto safely destroy some toxins, they were now changing their tune. They \nhad put their plans to dispose of these deadly weapons on hold, leaving \nyou to babysit them. I imagine you would start to feel a little \nnervous. Now you know how the residents of Madison County, KY, feel. \nFor the people of Madison County, KY, and all over central Kentucky, \nthe fear I have described is a daily reality.\n  The Blue Grass Army Depot in Madison County contains 523 tons of our \nNation's chemical weapons stockpile. Since the 1940s, it has stored \nmustard gas, sarin nerve agent, and VX nerve agent. Each of these is \namong the deadliest nerve agents ever created. As little as 10 \nmilligrams of VX is enough to kill a human being. That is about the \nmass of 10 grains of sand. It is virtually undetectable to the naked \neye, and yet if that tiny amount is inhaled, death is imminent. If it \nis absorbed through the skin, death takes mere minutes.\n  The time has come for the safety of our fellow Kentuckians to safely \neliminate these heinous weapons.\n  The Department of Defense has agreed it is time for the weapons to \ngo. They promised they would dispose of them. Congress has appropriated \nhundreds of millions of dollars for them to safely destroy the \nmaterials. Yet the Department refuses to take the necessary steps to \naccomplish the task. The Department has offered all sorts of reasons \nwhy, many of which even contradict each other. But the bottom line is, \nthey refuse to spend the money the President requested and the Congress \nappropriated to dispose of these chemical weapons stored in Kentucky.\n  This Congress cannot and will not let them get away with it. The \nDepartment's foot dragging on eliminating these weapons is simply \nunacceptable. The best they claim they can do is to place the Blue \nGrass Army Depot on caretaker status, meaning that virtually no cleanup \naction will be taken. The Department's own studies have shown the \nlonger we sit on these dangerous weapons, the greater the risk to \nsurrounding communities. The Department of Defense needs to fulfill its \nobligations, and it needs to clean up these sites now--not some other \ntime, now.\n  In 1996, I authored legislative language that created the Assembled \nChemical Weapons Alternatives Program, also known as ACWA, to find the \nbest method to destroy VX and other deadly agents. The Blue Grass Army \nDepot became one of the ACWA sites, along with a site in Pueblo, CO.\n  The DOD refuses to clean up that site in Colorado also, and so my \nfriend Senator Wayne Allard knows this issue well. I thank him for his \nsteadfast involvement and leadership on this question. He feels as \nstrongly as I do that the dangerous substances located at the hearts of \nour States need to be disposed of safely and quickly.\n  The Department claims ACWA sites must be downgraded to caretaker \nstatus because they are over budget due to cost overruns. Yet the \nDepartment's own schizophrenic decisionmaking is what led to these \ncosts. The Department has repeatedly stopped or slowed down design work \nand then restarted, adding unnecessary startup and stop-work costs. \nThey stingily parcel out appropriated monies in such small quantities \nthat it is impossible to spend it efficiently. Thus, it is the \nDepartment's own bureaucratic mismanagement that has created the cost \nproblems.\n  Perhaps we should expect no less from an outfit whose operating maxim \nis printed on this board behind me. Dr. Dale Klein, the Assistant to \nthe Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense \nPrograms, admitted in his testimony last week before the House Armed \nServices Committee that, as he said:\n\n       As I often tell people, some of our budgeting processes are \n     accurate but incorrect.\n\n  Let me run that by you one more time. He said:\n\n       As I often tell people, some of our budgeting processes are \n     accurate but incorrect.\n\n  What nonsense. Can you believe that? Dr. Klein, speaking of the \nDepartment of Defense, said on the record:\n\n     . . . some of our budgeting processes are accurate but \n     incorrect.\n\n  I will leave it to someone else to figure out exactly what that \nmeans, but it\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\ndoes not fill me with confidence in the Department's ability to resolve \nthis issue. The Congress must pursue this matter if we ever want to see \npositive results. Therefore, I have authored a provision, section 1115, \nin this bill before us, the supplemental appropriation bill, that \nexpressly directs DOD to spend the money Congress has appropriated to \ndispose of chemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot, which is in \nKentucky, and the Pueblo Chemical Depot, which is in Colorado. It \nforbids them, absolutely forbids them, from shunting that money into \nany other purpose.\n  Let me be clear: This provision does not add a penny of new spending \nto this bill. It merely requires the Department to spend the money they \nrequested for the purposes they identified.\n  DOD has broken its word to the citizens of Madison County. But the \nlanguage I have authored will force the Department to get Blue Grass \nback on track, and I promise that prediction will prove both accurate \nand correct. My provision will guarantee that the $813.4 million in \nprior-year monies that has been budgeted for ACWA sites will not be \ntransferred for other purposes.\n  Over the past several years, the President has requested specific \nfunds for ACWA. For reasons of comity, Congress has provided these \nfunds for the overall chemical demilitarization program largely in lump \nsums, trusting that DOD would comply with the President's budget \nrequest. But they have not. Instead, DOD undermined the President's \nbudget request and diverted funds intended for the ACWA Program. This \nlanguage will hold the Department to the President's budget request \nwith respect to this program.\n  My provision will force DOD to obligate at least $100 million at the \nACWA sites within 120 days of the enactment of this legislation before \nus. Because the Department has purposely--purposely--withheld funds \nfrom the ACWA sites and downgraded them to caretaker status, work has \ncome to a virtual halt at Blue Grass in Kentucky and completely at \nPueblo in Colorado.\n\n  The Department itself has repeatedly determined that the storing of \nthese deadly weapons poses an increasing danger over time. Yet they now \ncomplain they will have to jump through multiple bureaucratic hoops \nbefore those sites can be up and running again. By obligating $100 \nmillion immediately, we can get much-needed funds moving through the \npipeline again and help jump-start the cleanup efforts at both sites.\n  My provision will also require the Department to provide Congress \nwith a bimonthly accounting, every 2 months, of the money spent at \nthese sites. This improved oversight will hopefully shed some light on \nthe opaque processes at DOD. Perhaps with enough work, we can even find \nout how to make a budget both accurate and correct.\n  Because safety is paramount, my provision will do one more thing. It \nwill prohibit DOD from conducting a study on the transportation of \nchemical weapons across State lines. Because transporting chemical \nweapons across State lines is illegal already, one would think this \nprovision unnecessary. But despite the law, the Department has ordered \na study on doing that which it cannot legally do. It is a mystery to me \nwhy the Department would spend precious time and money exploring an \noption that is not an option, that is illegal under Federal law. Let me \nsay again, the Department of Defense is currently spending funds that \nshould be going toward destroying deadly chemical weapons on studying a \ncourse of action that is illegal.\n  That suggests to me that rather than destroying the chemical weapons \nwhere they are stored, the Department is considering transferring them \nout of the Blue Grass Army Depot to other facilities. That is reckless \nand irresponsible for too many reasons to describe. Kentuckians do not \nwant trucks full of nerve gas speeding down the interstate, and I \nsuspect neither do the people of other States, such as Alabama, \nArkansas, Utah, or any other State. Even if it were legal, there is no \nway politically these weapons are going to be moved across the country \nto some other site for destruction.\n  Before I conclude, I want to address one more failure of the \nDepartment of Defense. By not meeting their obligations to the people \nof Kentucky and Colorado, they are breaking not only their word, they \nare breaking America's word. That is because by placing the ACWA sites \non caretaker status, the Department is acknowledging the weapons will \nnot be disposed of at least until 2016 at the earliest, yet the United \nStates has signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which establishes a \ndeadline for elimination of these substances in 2012 at the latest. The \nDepartment of Defense should be working with all the speed it can \nmuster to meet this deadline, not openly thumbing its nose at it. \nPassing this bill will move us closer to compliance with the Chemical \nWeapons Convention.\n  In this age of terrorism, our decisionmaking processes for handling \nand disposing of such horrifying weapons must be focused and clear. The \nDepartment of Defense approach to ACWA sites has been neither.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill. With the passage of \nsection 1115, you will get accountability and transparency from the \nDepartment of Defense. You will ensure that the promise made to the \npeople of Kentucky is a promise fulfilled. Most importantly, you will \nprotect the safety of hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  On the other hand, if we do nothing, it will all be left up to DOD. \nThe best they can be is ``accurate but incorrect.''\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is time control in place right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes prior to the first \nvote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have 5 minutes after 1:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes before the vote at \n1:45 p.m.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 334\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to speak first on the amendment \noffered by Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska may proceed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Defense Subcommittee has considered \nthis matter very closely. We believe the provision for death gratuity \nis a special and unique situation, and we provided it in the bill \nbefore the Senate.\n  What we seek to provide is a special recognition for our Nation's \nfallen heroes who have given their lives in combat defending our Nation \nor who have died in training or other activity that is considered \nrelated to combat by title X.\n  Let me state that again. Our provision covers all service members who \nlose their lives in combat or who die in training or other activity \nthat is considered combat related by title X.\n  The normal death gratuity in effect now is $12,400. It provides \nimmediate cash to meet the needs of survivors. This amount is payable \nimmediately and is intended to provide sufficient funding to support \nfamilies until other benefits, particularly those such as the Survivor \nBenefit Plan, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, and Social \nSecurity, come into play.\n  We believe every life is precious, and we grieve over the loss of \nlife when it occurs among anyone in our military. But our \nAppropriations Committee has included this provision to provide special \nrecognition for fallen heroes. This special recognition is intended for \nthose who have died as a result of combat or combat-related situations, \nsuch as training, and in support of the global war against terrorism \nour Nation is fighting.\n  The administration and the Department of Defense strongly oppose the \nrecommended expansion of the death gratuity to cover all deaths of \nanyone who is in uniform. In fact, a 2004 independent study requested \nby the Department of Defense concluded that the full system of benefits \nprovided to survivors of members who die on active duty is adequate, \nsubstantial, and comprehensive.\n  That study did identify a lack of recognition for direct sacrifice of \nlife, as\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\nprovided by the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act, which pays more \nthan $267,000 to survivors in recognition of deaths in performance of \nduty of law enforcement officers and firefighters. The Senate \nsupplemental bill provides this type of recognition for our military.\n  First, if we consider opening the special death gratuity for all \ncasualties, we should also consider the significance of a retroactive \ndate, as we considered the concept of trying to cover all casualties. \nIf the increased death gratuity is provided for all deaths, there is no \nlonger a direct connection to the events of 9/11 and the war against \nterrorism.\n\n  Finally, to increase the death gratuity to include all deaths would \ncost an additional $300 million in this year alone, 2005. The total \nbill for fiscal year 2005 would be about $1.1 billion.\n  Many of us who served in war in defense of our Nation--and I am one \nof those--believe there is a special significance in the way we have \ndefined death gratuity in the Senate bill before us now. We believe it \nis fully appropriate for the problem of recognizing fallen heroes.\n  I know this provision is related to other outpourings of those who \nhave lost life in the September 11 controversy. There is a connection \nin that this provision seeks to recognize soldiers who have fallen as a \nresult of the actions we have taken as a nation to address 9/11 in the \nfight against terrorism. I do not believe we should devalue the most \nheroic sacrifices of our men and women in uniform by making this cover \nanyone in uniform.\n  Mr. President, I do intend to oppose this amendment.\n  I have 5 minutes before 1:45 p.m.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 356\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to oppose the amendment to fill the pay \ngap when Guard and Reserve are mobilized. This is the Durbin amendment. \nThis emergency supplemental bill is not the proper legislative vehicle \nto add new benefits without approval of the committee of jurisdiction. \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee, I am told, does not support the \ninclusion of this new benefit in our supplemental bill. The \nadministration did not request that additional authority, and I am told \nit opposes this amendment. The proposed amendment, I believe, should be \nheld for debate when the appropriate committee, such as the Armed \nServices Committee, brings the authorization bill before the Senate.\n  The amendment to this bill would require Federal agencies to pay any \ndifference between military pay and civilian compensation for employees \nof the Federal Government who either volunteer or are called to active \nduty. The estimate we received from the Congressional Budget Office is \nthis is an additional cost of $152 million over a 5-year period.\n  Reservists and guardsmen know when they are activated what their \nmilitary pay will be, what their total compensation is. There is no \nmisunderstanding about that. In an all-volunteer force, individuals \nchoose whether they serve in the military. Certainly financial \nconsiderations enter into that decision, whether their service be full \ntime or part time, with an obligation to answer the call of duty when \nnecessary.\n  When Guard and Reserve members train for mobilization, they \nunderstand they are subject to mobilization during war and national \nemergencies. The likelihood of mobilization is evident as the \nDepartment has been mobilizing Guard and Reserve members almost \ncontinuously for the past 13 years.\n  More importantly, this provision would do a disservice to patriotic \nnon-Federal reservists who are self-employed, small businessmen, or \nemployees who do not receive such coverage as proposed by the Durbin \namendment.\n  In addition, the amendment would allow mobilized reservists to make \nsignificantly more than those active-duty service members whom they \njoin when they are called up to serve in active duty. This could be \ninterpreted by some active-duty members to mean that the Federal \nGovernment places a higher value on the service of those people who are \ncalled up temporarily than we do on those who are career military \npeople. The amendment would cause a significant equity issue as far as \nthe active-duty service members and I believe would negatively affect \ntheir morale.\n  Requiring the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to pay \nthe differential salary limits the ability of agencies to accommodate \nstaffing shortages through temporary personnel actions. Once these \npeople are called up, the Department has to hire someone temporarily to \ntake their place. The place is there for them when they come back, but \nthey will not have the ability to have the money available if they have \nto pay this differential. This issue becomes more significant the \nlonger the period of active duty.\n\n  Another concern is that this amendment does not distinguish between \nReservists who volunteer to perform active duty and those who are \ninvoluntarily called to active duty. Reservists who volunteer for duty \ncan weigh the financial impact of such service when considering whether \nto apply for an assignment.\n  Finally, Reserve service offers a robust pay and benefits package. \nWith the support of Congress, military pay is now very competitive with \npay in the private and public sectors and allowances are increasing to \nminimize out-of-pocket expenses.\n  Any changes to Guard and Reserve compensation system should be \nassessed for the long term, not just during this current deployment. \nQuestions regarding affordability and equity of benefits must be \ncarefully weighed and answered before we legislate changes.\n  This appropriation bill is not the appropriate legislative vehicle to \nset military compensation policy; this change should be considered by \nthe Armed Services and Governmental Affairs Committees which have \njurisdiction over these matters.\n  Thus, we strongly recommend that the Senate hold this authorization \nmeasure for full consideration by the Armed Services and Governmental \nAffairs Committees. The amendment deserves adequate time for analysis \nand debate in light of the full system of military benefits and funding \nconstraints.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Durbin's amendment touches on a \ncritical issue: the strains being placed upon the National Guard and \nthe Reserve by the long deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. He \ncorrectly points out that these deployments have resulted in a \nfinancial crisis for unknown numbers of American families who have \nloved ones called to duty, pulled out of their civilian careers, and \nsent half a world away for long periods of time.\n  The amendment pending before the Senate would compensate those \nmembers of the National Guard and the Reserve who suffer a loss of \nincome because they are away from their civilian jobs--but only if \nthose jobs are with the Federal Government. The many Guardsmen and \nReservists who work in the private sector would not be helped by the \namendment.\n  I am very sympathetic to the plight of the families of National \nGuardsmen and Reservists who have found themselves in dire financial \nstraits because of a long, unexpected deployment that takes the family \nbreadwinner away from his job. I have heard from families in West \nVirginia who could be facing financial ruin because of a soldier's drop \nin income due to a protracted, 18-month deployment.\n  However, the Congress is approaching this problem from the wrong end. \nThe heart of this matter is not how much Uncle Sam may pay our citizen-\nsoldiers. The problem is that our National Guard and Reserve are being \ndeployed, and re-deployed, for such long periods at a time. The United \nStates hasn't sent so many part-time soldiers overseas in half a \ncentury. In addition to causing financial hardships for many American \nfamilies, the pace of these deployments is threatening to break the \nback of the National Guard and the Reserve.\n  In 2003, I offered two amendments to limit the deployment and re-\ndeployment of the National Guard and Reserve. Unfortunately, the Senate \nvoted down those amendments, and the strains on the National Guard and \nthe Reserve continue and, in some cases, are worsening. Until Congress \nlimits the excessive deployments of our citizen-soldiers, or until our \ntroops start coming home from Iraq, there will continue to be myriad \nstrains on our troops and their families. It is not reasonable to \nexpect the government to\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\ncompensate our troops and families for each difficulty or strain that \nthis foolish war in Iraq has caused, because our national treasure is \nfinite.\n  What's more, I am concerned that the amendment on which the Senate \nwill soon vote will have financial consequences for many years down the \nroad. Our country is neck deep in red ink, and Congress must be \njudicious in enacting benefits that grow to have a life of their own \nwell after the Senate has voted. This problem is compounded by the \nrefusal of the President to budget for the costs of the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. If the White House does not budget for the war, there \nis no way to increase revenues or lower other spending in order to \nbalance the budget. In the coming days of debate on this emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, I will offer an amendment on this \ncrucial point.\n  Despite these reservations about the pending amendment, the bottom \nline is that the families of many National Guardsmen and Reservists are \nexperiencing real financial hardships. Although this amendment will \nonly take care of some of those families, it will provide a lifeline to \nfamilies who are struggling to make ends meet because of the demands of \nthe war in Iraq. I commend the Senator from Illinois for his commitment \nto the National Guard, and I will support him on this amendment.\n  However, when the Senate next considers relieving the strains caused \nby the long deployments of the Guard and Reserve, the Senate should not \nadopt a piecemeal approach. The heart of the matter is our open-ended \nmission in Iraq. Unless that matter is addressed head-on, Congress will \ncontinue to find more and more ways to spend our nation's scarce \ntreasure. That is not a wise fiscal course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senator from \nAlaska, who has served the Senate and his country so well, now opposes \nthis amendment. When it was last offered on an emergency supplemental \nbill on October 17, 2003, he joined with 95 of our colleagues in voting \nfor this amendment. I think the amendment still is a valid amendment.\n  Let me explain what the amendment does. Seventeen thousand Federal \nemployees have been activated into Guard and Reserve units. They find \nthat when they go into this activated status, they are receiving less \nin income than they were paid by the Federal Government. The bill says \nthe Federal agencies they worked for will make up the difference so as \nthey are serving our country and risking their lives overseas they will \nhave this pay differential, so their families will be able to keep the \nmortgage paid, pay the utility bills, and keep the family together.\n  The Senator suggests this is going to create some sort of a \ndisadvantage to those in active military, but I am sure he feels, as I \ndo, that companies across America that stand behind their employees who \nare activated in the Guard and Reserve are doing the right and \npatriotic thing by making up the difference in pay between what one is \npaid when they are home and what one is paid when they are in uniform. \nThey are saying to this soldier: We are with you; we are with your \nfamily; serve your country and come back to your job; we are proud of \nyou.\n  There is one employer at the top in America that does not do it. It \nis the Federal Government. The arguments are made on the floor today \nthat if we stand behind these soldiers who are Federal employees, \nsomehow it is a poor reflection on the rest of the military. That is \nnot true. We revere and honor those who serve our country, active \nmilitary, activated Guard, activated Reserve. Fifty-one percent of the \nactivated Guard and Reserve take a cut in pay to serve America. What I \nam saying is if one is a Federal employee, for goodness sakes, they \nought to have their salary made whole. Why should they go overseas, \nworrying about whether they are going to get hit by a bullet, step on a \nlandmine or hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, and whether their spouse \ncan pay the bills at home for tuition for the kids? Why do we not stand \nbehind these soldiers who are serving? We are out there on the Fourth \nof July waving our flags, but, for goodness sakes, we have a chance to \nstand behind them today on the Senate floor. It is absolutely shameful \nthat the Federal Government will not provide the same kind of pay \nprotection for our activated Guard and Reserve that over 900 private \nbusinesses, State and local governments, have provided across America. \nWe honor them.\n  The Secretary of Defense has a Web site to honor the fact that they \nare standing behind the soldiers, but we do not do it. The Federal \nGovernment does not do it. This is our chance to make a difference.\n  Also, on the Kerry amendment, I disagree with the Senator from \nAlaska. To think that if someone is on a troop plane headed over to \nKuwait and, God forbid, it crashes, they are entitled to $12,000; \nhowever, if they get off the plane and are killed in combat they should \nbe entitled to $100,000--I think they are heroes in both instances. \nSenator Kerry is suggesting we should regard them as such. I think his \namendment is a valid amendment and, yes, it does cost money. It costs \nmoney to stand behind our veterans, our soldiers, and their families. \nThat is part of the real cost of war. That is why I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this amendment. The amendment I am offering today passed 96 \nto 3 when last called. It passed by a voice vote after that. It has the \nsupport of the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States, and the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States. These organizations represent the \nmen and women who are risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nare asking for basic fairness from the Federal Government. I think this \namendment is long overdue.\n  For 3 years now, this amendment has been lost in conference. It \npasses on the Senate floor and disappears, and Federal employees \nactivated to serve our country wonder what happened. Well, today we \nwill have a chance with this rollcall vote to see if we want to stand \nbehind these men and women in uniform. This is an amendment that is \nlong overdue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Salazar of Colorado be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum, before a vote is \ncalled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we each have \n1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senator from \nIllinois because every person the Senator has mentioned in connection \nwith Senator Kerry's amendment is covered. All the people on an \nairplane going to combat are covered. Any training-related combat, they \nare covered. The question is whether people who stand side by side with \nsomeone in the Pentagon working daily in uniform, a civilian person \nworking the same job, whether one should be covered in the event of \ndeath and the other should not, whether one should be covered while \ndriving home here in Washington, DC, after drinking too much, gets in \nan automobile accident, and get the same benefit a fallen hero gets. I \nask the Senator if he would consider in connection with his amendment \neliminating a request for the yeas and nays and we would be glad to \naccept that amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, if I had not lost this amendment \ntwice in conference after it passed the Senate, I would agree to that, \nbut I think we need a record vote. I do not know what it takes to \nfinally get this Senate to go on record and stand by the Senate \nposition in conference. Twice now we have taken this proposal to \nconference and it has disappeared, with the White House or Department \nof Defense or somebody opposing it. If we have a record vote, I think \nwe have a much better chance to say to the conferees, for goodness \nsakes, the third time, let us stand up for these men and women.\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nI am sorry; I want to insist on the yeas and nays. I believe that is \nthe only way to make it clear where we stand on the issue and to \nconvince the conferees to finally stand for the Senate position if it \nsucceeds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

The yeas and nays have been ordered on the underlying \namendment. I ask the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Durbin amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 356) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We have under the order a vote, now, on two Kerry \namendments, Nos. 333 and 334. Is there time for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 2 minutes \nto be evenly divided on each amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague in \nsponsoring these amendments, which will increase the death gratuity \nfrom $12,000 to $100,000 for all service members killed on active duty, \nand allow their dependents to continue receiving the basic housing \nallowance for a full year instead of the 180 days in current law.\n  All of us support our troops. We obviously want to do all we can to \nsee that they have proper equipment, vehicles, and everything else they \nneed to protect their lives as they carry out their missions. But we \nalso need care for the families of these courageous men and women who \nmake the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Any service member's death is tragic, whether in combat overseas or a \ntraining accident here in the United States. They are heroes, not \nvictims. These brave men and women came forward to serve our country \nknowing what the dangers were and knowing the possibilities. They stood \ntall when the country needed them.\n  Their case is a tragedy, and so is the void left behind for their \nloved ones.\n  We know what happens when a family is notified of a death. There is a \nknock on the door. They open the door and a military officer is \nstanding there to give them the most dreaded news they will ever \nreceive. Details are few and typically only include the time and place \nof the death, and perhaps some brief words on how it happened. A few \ndays later, he provides them a death gratuity check for $12,000 and \nhelps them through the process of making the funeral arrangements while \nthe flag draped coffin is on the way home.\n  After the burial, the conversation turns to additional funds and \nbenefits. The topic often has to be pressed by the officer, because the \nfamilies, so burdened, seldom think in terms of what their benefits \nmight be. They slowly realize that instead of having a constant \nbreadwinner for many years, they receive only a modest monthly sum.\n  The burden of combat deaths falls most often on the junior enlisted \npersonnel, whose average yearly wages can be as low as $17,000. The \nactual benefit depends on number of children and other specific \ncircumstances, and decreases over time because of age or a child's \nstatus as a student.\n  The current Senate bill uses the administration's formula to achieve \na $500,000 threshold, and includes some noncombat deaths, but not all \nof them. The bill, for example, provides a $100,000 gratuity to \nsurvivors of those killed in training accidents. But it retains the \ncurrent $12,000 gratuity for other types of deaths, such as those who \ncollapse during strenuous exercise or are killed in an accident driving \nto work. It is distinction without a difference for the family of the \nservice member who died. They know only that their loved one went to \nwork to help prepare their fellow soldiers, marines, sailors or airmen \nfor battle and will never return. In today's military, all jobs and \nstations are equally important.\n  Our amendment eliminates any distinction between combat and non-\ncombat deaths and provides a death gratuity of $100,000, regardless of \nwhere or how a service member dies.\n\n  Along with other provisions of the bill, the amendment would increase \nthe total death benefit to $500,000, depending on the amount of \nmilitary life insurance a person carries.\n  No one can ever put a price on a human life, but there is no doubt \nthat current levels are unacceptably low.\n  It's also very important to extend the length of time for surviving \nwidows and children to remain in military housing to a full year, \neither on base or with housing assistance.\n  Currently, surviving spouses and dependents of military personnel \nkilled on active duty may continue in their military housing or receive \ntheir military housing allowances for up to 180 days after the death of \ntheir loved one.\n  Their loss is traumatic enough without the immediate pressure of \nhaving to find a place to live, moving, and disrupting their life all \nover again. Extending the length of time for survivors to stay in \nmilitary housing gives them greater flexibility as they struggle to \ndeal with what has happened. Children will be able to finish the school \nyear among friends and in familiar surroundings.\n  We know we can do much more to take care of military families after \nthe loss of a loved one. We have been complacent for too long, and I \nurge my colleagues to support us in providing this much needed and \nwell-deserved relief to these courageous and suffering families.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, point of inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 333\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nAlaska, or the manager, is prepared to accept one of the amendments, I \nthink. Am I correct?\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct; we are willing to accept the \nsecond amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is amendment No. 334, which extends \nthe period of time that spouses can remain on a base after their spouse \nhas died in action.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is amendment No. 334.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall be vitiated and the Senate \nadopt that amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Amendment No. 333.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Amendment No. 333?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLincoln be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To which amendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. To amendment No. 333 and amendment No. 334.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \ncosponsor will be added to both amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Our records show it is amendment No. 334.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is confusion.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am corrected; it is amendment No. 333.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair, the \namendment described by the Senator from Massachusetts is----\n  Mr. KERRY. No. 333.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 333.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Alaska wish to modify \nhis unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have made the motion we vitiate the rollcall and \naccept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No rollcall has been ordered at this time. \nWithout objection, amendment No. 333 is agreed to. The motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 333) was agreed to.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 334\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the second amendment is an amendment to \nraise the death benefit for those who die while in service to our \ncountry. Currently, it is $12,000 plus change. We want to take it up to \n$100,000.\n  The Senator is going to tell you that the Pentagon is opposed to \nthis. Secretary Rumsfeld is opposed to this. The uniformed leadership \nat the Pentagon is overwhelmingly in favor of it.\n  Air Force GEN Michael Moseley said:\n\n       I believe a death is a death and our servicemen and women \n     should be represented that way.\n\n  Army GEN Richard Cody said:\n\n       It is about service to this country and I think we need to \n     be very, very careful about [drawing a] distinction.\n\n  And GEN Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said:\n\n       I think a death gratuity that applies to all service \n     members is preferable to one that's targeted just to those \n     that might be in a combat zone.\n\n  Let me say to our colleagues, you can be driving a car and have a car \naccident in a combat zone, and you qualify for the upper level. But if \nyou are serving on an aircraft carrier or elsewhere and you are \ntraining personnel, and you die from a catapult that falls or you have \nan accident, you do not get the same benefit, even as you are preparing \nto send troops to war.\n  That is wrong. We believe you ought to apply it according to the \ndesire of the uniformed generals, which is to treat all members of the \nservice the same say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, respectfully, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is wrong. Those who die in training or other activities \nrelated to combat are covered by our amendment. We sought to recognize \nfallen heroes from the time they enter training for combat to go \noverseas. They are covered by our amendment. What this amendment does \nis it does not give us the opportunity to recognize those who put their \nlives on the line. We oppose this amendment because of that fact. We do \nbelieve there ought to be a distinction.\n  The Senator's amendment will mean, if someone right here in this \ndistrict while in uniform drinks too much and dies while driving home, \nthey are going to get this gratuity, the same gratuity the fallen hero \nshould get. It is wrong to cover anyone in uniform with this type of \nallowance. We have increased the insurance for everyone in uniform. \nThey can buy up to $400,000. But raising this from $12,240 to \n$100,000--it should go to those related to combat and in combat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to table this amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 334) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for having \nsupported amendment No. 334 to extend the $100,000 death gratuity to \nthe survivors of all who die on active duty.\n  I want the record to show what the amendment will accomplish and why \nwhat it accomplishes is important.\n  Current law provides $12,000 to all members of the military who die \non active duty, regardless of circumstance.\n  Earlier this year, President Bush proposed increasing the death \ngratuity to $100,000 for those who die in Iraq, Afghanistan, or \ndesignated combat zones.\n  The supplemental legislation reported by the Appropriations Committee \nincreases the death gratuity to $100,000 for those who die in combat \nand those classified under circumstances classified as warranting \nCombat Related Special Compensation, CRSC, if they had lived. CRSC was \na compromise brokered a few years ago in lieu of concurrent receipt. \nUsing CRSC, the $100,000 death gratuity would go to those who die ``as \na direct result of armed conflict; while engaged in hazardous service; \nin the performance of duty under conditions simulating war; or through \nan instrumentality of war.'' For all others, the death gratuity remains \n$12,000.\n  My amendment is very simple. It changes the existing law to say \n$100,000 shall be paid in death gratuity under all circumstances in \nwhich $12,000 is now paid. It eliminates the provisions in the \nlegislation that distinguish between the manner and place of deaths. It \neliminates any connection to combat related special compensation. It \ndoes not extend the death gratuity to anyone who doesn't already \nreceive the $12,000.\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\n  The amendment simply heeds the advice of the uniformed leadership of \nthe military who said, unambiguously, that a death is a death is a \ndeath, and Congress should not try to parse them.\n  General Richard A. Cody, U.S. Army, said:\n\n       It is about service to this country and I think we need to \n     be very, very careful about making this $100,000 decision \n     based upon what type of action. I would rather err on the \n     side of covering all deaths rather than try to make the \n     distinction.\n\n  Admiral John B. Nathman, U.S. Navy, said:\n\n       This has been about . . . how do we take care of the \n     survivors, the families and the children. They can't make a \n     distinction; I don't believe we should either.\n\n  General Michael T. Moseley, U.S. Air Force, said:\n\n       I believe a death is a death and our servicemen and women \n     should be represented that way.\n\n  General William Nyland, U.S. Marine Corps, said:\n\n       I think we need to understand before we put any \n     distinctions on the great service of these wonderful young \n     men and women. . . . they are all performing magnificently. I \n     think we have to be very cautious in drawing distinctions.\n\n  Finally, General Richard Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, said:\n\n       I think a death gratuity that applies to all service \n     members is preferable to one that's targeted just to those \n     that might be in a combat zone.\n\n  I also want to note that the practical effect of my amendment is \nidentical to the provisions of the House-passed supplemental. The \nunderlying bill, H.R. 1268, passed the House on March 16, 2005, and in \nsection 1113 it would require an equal death gratuity of $100,000 for \nall service members, regardless of the circumstance and location of \ntheir death. Like my amendment, it does not treat one military family \ndifferently than others.\n  Lastly, my amendment has been endorsed by the Enlisted Association of \nthe National Guard of the United States, EANGAUS; the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, MOAA; the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, NGAUS; the National Military Family Association, NMFA; \nthe Reserve Enlisted Association, REA; and the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, ROA.\n  I thank my colleagues again for their support and look forward to \nworking with them to hold this mark in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 367\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Byrd \namendment. It is my understanding that, after I speak and after Senator \nByrd has a few minutes to respond, we will have a vote on this \namendment.\n  The amendment put forth by Senator Byrd would take out $40 million \nrequested by the administration in emergency funds to build a detection \nfacility and security fence at Guantanamo Bay. I believe we must keep \nthe $40 million to allow the Department to move forward to make better \nfacilities at Guantanamo Bay, facilities that are more secure, and \nfacilities that will make operations more efficient, especially in the \nuse of guards.\n  Currently, there are about 545 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. About \nhalf of those are housed in three camps, which are built as temporary \nfacilities. I have seen these facilities. Many of us have gone to \nGuantanamo Bay to look at them. They are basically walls made of chain-\nlink fences. Of course, there is no climate control, and there is not \nvery much room for exercise of detainees. Building the more permanent \nfacility would provide a better, more secure facility, and facilities \nthat are better housing units.\n  I think Guantanamo Bay is the perfect place to hold these types of \ndetainees, many of whom are dangerous terrorists. I do not want these \nprisoners moved. I don't want them moved into facilities in communities \nin our country, on our shores, where they can pose a danger for our \ncitizens and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist activity. Al-Qaida \nhas shown that it will try to liberate--by force if necessary and with \nno regard to the loss of innocent lives--their fellow terrorists. U.S. \nforces in Iraq and Afghanistan have weathered such attacks and thwarted \nrepeated violent escape attempts. Recent reports of tunnels, riots, and \nmortar attacks against detention facilities in Iraq have been well \npublicized in the press.\n  Do we want to move that to the lower 48 States in the United States \nof America? I don't think so. Having them on an island, where other \nterrorist attempts to free prisoners are much less able to be put \nforth, is the exact right place for these prisoners. I want to make \nsure that we have the best facilities possible and that we have the \npermanent facilities on an island in Cuba so that there is not as much \ncapability to do harm to innocent Americans as there would be if we \nmoved those prisoners to places on our soil such as Atlanta, GA, or \nFlorida.\n  The detention facility that would be built will also reduce the \nnumber of required personnel. The current facilities require \nsignificant personnel to monitor detainees. A permanent facility would \nfree 150 of them to perform other tasks in the global war on terror. It \nwill be the same for the security fence; we could free up 196 people \nwho are now guarding around the perimeter of Guantanamo Bay. So that is \n346 fewer guards that would be needed if we had the permanent \nfacilities.\n  It is very important that we keep the $40 million asked for by this \nadministration to make better, more permanent facilities at Guantanamo \nBay. I want them to stay on that island, not moved into the United \nStates where we know terrorists are dwelling, we know they are looking \nfor ways to attack our country. The last thing we want is for them to \nstart moving into detention facilities to try to free prisoners and, in \nthe process, harm innocent Americans or the people who are guarding \nthose prisoners.\n  So I ask the Senate to vote this amendment down and give the \nadministration and the Department of Defense the capability to house \nthese prisoners in the most efficient way possible and certainly in a \nway that protects American lives to the greatest extent possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I do not know of any other Senators who \nintend to debate this issue. I would like to put an exclamation point \non the statement made by the distinguished Senator from Texas though.\n  One thing that is clear, if we do not have a permanent facility \nthere, an improved facility, we are going to have to keep more U.S. \npersonnel there guarding and maintaining the security of this facility. \nIf we use the funds the administration is requesting, approve the \nrequest the administration has submitted to the Congress, then we will \nbe able to use a lot of the people who are there now for other purposes \nelsewhere in the war on terror to help better defend the country and \nmake sure we are safeguarding the security interests of the American \npeople.\n  This is not to help prisoners have a better deal, even though the \nfacility will be more humane and easier to care for and to deal with, \nbut it will be more secure, and it will help us reallocate resources \nthat will benefit our national security interests. That is the point.\n  This is money well invested. The administration is requesting it. Our \nsubcommittee chair supports it after reviewing the request. So I think \nthe Senate should support the committee and what it has recommended and \nreject the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Byrd amendment? \nThe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Pentagon defends the current facilities for the \nincarceration of prisoners at Guantanamo as being safe, secure, and \nhumane. There\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\nis no emergency, unforeseen or otherwise, that requires the immediate \nconstruction of a 220-bed maximum security prison to relieve existing \ndeficiencies at Guantanamo, and so it is premature.\n  That is part of the case I am making, it is premature. Why have this \nitem in this bill? Why in an emergency supplemental bill? It is \npremature to ask the American taxpayers to spend $36 million--it is \nyour money, I say to the taxpayers--to build a permanent maximum \nsecurity prison at Guantanamo when the courts have not yet determined \nthe legal status of the detainees at Guantanamo or have not determined \nwhether the United States can continue to hold them indefinitely \nwithout charging them with a crime.\n  The prison population at Guantanamo is steadily declining, down to \nabout 540 from a high of 750. The Department of Defense reportedly \nhopes to further cut the current population by at least half. However, \nDOD has not given a firm estimate of how many detainees it expects will \nrequire long-term incarceration.\n  Why all the hurry? The 220-bed prison is a guesstimate--a \nguesstimate--not an estimate.\n  The Department of Defense has already built one permanent maximum \nsecurity prison at Guantanamo, a $16 million state-of-the-art facility \ncompleted less than a year ago that has the capacity to hold 100 \nprisoners.\n  Temporary detention facilities at Guantanamo include several camps in \nwhich prisoners are housed in individual cells with a toilet and sink \nin each cell, and one camp where detainees who are considered the least \ndangerous are housed in 10-man bays with all-day access to exercise \nyards.\n  The Department of Defense contends that these temporary facilities \nare nearing the end of their useful life, but the Department does not \nargue they are unsafe or uninhabitable.\n  The U.S. military has many urgent unmet needs, some of which are \nemergency status needs. Construction of a second permanent maximum \nsecurity prison at Guantanamo is not among these urgent, unmet needs. \nThis is a decision that should be deferred until the courts have \nresolved the legal status of the detainees at Guantanamo and until the \nDefense Department determines the number of detainees it expects to \nhold in custody for the long term.\n  What I am saying right now is the request is premature. Let us wait \nuntil the courts do their job. Then we will have a picture of what we \nneed to do. Let us not be premature in spending the taxpayers' money \nwhen there are too many unanswered questions that ought to be answered \nand which in time will certainly present us with a clear picture of the \npermanent needs.\n  I thank the Chair and thank all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas, 27, nays 71, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 93 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--27\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--71\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dayton\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 367) was rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 372\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 372, which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 372.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should not \n  delay enactment of critical appropriations necessary to ensure the \n   well-being of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces \n   fighting in Iraq and elsewhere around the world, by attempting to \n   conduct a debate about immigration reform while the supplemental \n   appropriations bill is pending on the floor of the United States \n                                Senate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) our immigration system is badly broken, fails to serve \n     the interests of our national security and our national \n     economy, and undermines respect for the rule of law;\n       (2) in a post-9/11 world, national security demands a \n     comprehensive solution to our immigration system;\n       (3) Congress must engage in a careful and deliberative \n     discussion about the need to bolster enforcement of, and \n     comprehensively reform, our immigration laws;\n       (4) Congress should not short-circuit that discussion by \n     attaching amendments to this supplemental outside of the \n     regular order; and\n       (5) Congress should not delay the enactment of critical \n     appropriations necessary to ensure the well-being of the men \n     and women of the United States Armed Forces fighting in Iraq \n     and elsewhere around the world, by attempting to conduct a \n     debate about immigration reform while the supplemental \n     appropriations bill is pending on the floor of the United \n     States Senate.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I realize the Senator from Texas has \nbeen recognized to offer his amendment. I ask unanimous consent I be \npermitted to offer my amendment after the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, I have no objection to \nthat request. I note that Senator Feinstein, who is also joining me as \na cosponsor on this amendment, would like to speak following me. \nSenator Isakson would also like to speak. I ask unanimous consent they \nbe recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Withholding the right to object, I have no objection to \nhow long you wish to speak on your amendment, Senator. I wanted to be \nsure I got to offer my amendment this afternoon.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland will be considered after the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Maryland for working with us.\n  This amendment is a sense of the Senate that Congress should not \ndelay enactment of the supplemental appropriations bill by attempting \nto conduct a debate about comprehensive immigration reform at this \ntime.\n  As I made clear, along with Senator Kyl and others on this point, I \nam for comprehensive immigration reform. It is long overdue. It is \nsomething in the regular order we are going to consider, both in the \nSubcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Citizenship, which I \nchair in the Judiciary Committee, but also I have talked with the \nchairman of the full Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, and he has\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nadvised me that once we complete our work--hopefully in the next couple \nof months--he would give us an expedited markup in the full committee.\n  On a subject so complex and potentially divisive as comprehensive \nimmigration reform, it is appropriate we take up this issue as we would \nmost complex issues; that is, by the regular order. It is particularly \nimportant we do so in light of the subject matter of the present \nlegislation in the Senate which is an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill that should be passed without undue delay so our \nmen and women in uniform can get the resources they need, including the \nequipment to do the job we have asked them to do and which they have so \nheroically agreed to do on our behalf in the war on terror.\n  I confess there are many good proposals out there with regard to \nimmigration reform. The Senator from Maryland has a proposal on H-2B on \nwhich there will be some agreement; some people will agree with it. The \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho has a bill called the agriculture jobs \nbill which will attempt to create a workforce that can work in the \nagricultural industry. I have some problems with the details of that \nbill, but in the main it is a well-intentioned effort to try to deal \nwith part of this problem.\n  I say ``part of this problem'' advisedly. Rather than try to deal \nwith this issue on a piecemeal basis, it is important we enact \ncomprehensive reform. For too long we have simply ignored the fact our \nborders are not secure, that once people get past the border they \nliterally can melt into the landscape. It has resulted in the current \nuntenable proposition that there are about--no one knows for sure--10 \nmillion people who have come into our country outside of our laws. We \nneed to deal with that, particularly in a post-September 11 \nenvironment, by addressing the security concerns, by restoring our \nreputation in this country as a nation that believes in and adheres to \nthe rule of law but also in a way that is compassionate and deals with \nthe economic reality involved where approximately 6 million of those 10 \nmillion people are currently in the workforce, many performing jobs \nAmerican citizens simply do not want to perform.\n  It is not because I disagree with the general intent of immigration \nreform that I speak in favor of this resolution, which says we ought to \ntake up this matter but in the regular course and on another day.\n\n  It is mainly because I do not want to see, nor do I believe any \nSenator on the floor or in their office or elsewhere would want to see \nus get bogged down and diverted in an immigration debate that, frankly, \nI do not think we are yet ready for, and at a time which I think could \nwell damage our long-term prospects at getting comprehensive \nimmigration reform passed, but particularly in a way that is \ncalculated--let me change that word; it is not ``calculated''--the \nresult likely would be that we would slow down and perhaps bog down \nthis emergency supplemental appropriations bill to equip our troops \nwith what they need.\n  So this resolution suggests, in the last paragraph, that:\n\n       Congress should not delay the enactment of critical \n     appropriations necessary to ensure the well-being of the men \n     and women of the United States Armed Forces fighting in Iraq \n     and elsewhere around the world, by attempting to conduct a \n     debate about immigration reform while the supplemental \n     appropriations bill is pending on the floor of the United \n     States Senate.\n\n  I commend this to all of our colleagues. I express my appreciation in \nparticular to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, for working \nwith us. We both serve on the Judiciary Committee and believe this is \nan important issue. But it needs to be handled in the regular course \nthat would not divert us from the immediate task at hand, which is to \nmake sure our troops have the resources they need in order to complete \nthe job we have asked them to do on our behalf.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nauthoring this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. I agree with all the comments he has made. I believe it is a \nhuge mistake to bypass the Judiciary Committee, to bypass the \nImmigration Subcommittee on bills that are big in their ramifications \non the United States of America.\n  If we do that, we will get into a debate on the floor on the AgJOBS \nbill. I think very few people know, for example, that the way the bill \nis written you can have two misdemeanor convictions and essentially \nstill get a temporary green card. That can be misdemeanor theft. That \ncan be misdemeanor battery. That can be misdemeanor drugs. I will have \nan amendment to address that. I will take some time with it.\n  Most people do not know you just have to have 100 hours of work in a \n12-month period. I will have an amendment to address that, and there \nwill be other amendments to address that. But this is a very \ncontroversial bill that can have a huge impact on the number of people \ncoming across the border. At the very least, it should have a markup in \nJudiciary. We should have an opportunity to make amendments in \nJudiciary before it comes to the floor of the Senate as an amendment on \nan appropriations bill.\n  There is also the REAL ID bill, which very well may come up. Senator \nMikulski has an amendment on H-2B. I am concerned about it because it \ndoes not have a cap on the number, and the H-2B quota has been reached. \nI believe it is 66,000. Maryland has some problems, which are valid \nproblems, I am sure. But just to open the bill, unless there is a \nspecified number--I think we need to discuss it.\n  I will bring up the State Criminal Alien Program for reauthorization. \nThis is paying back the States for their costs of confinement of \nillegals who commit felonies and misdemeanors and go to county jails \nand State prisons. So it will open a long and complicated debate on the \nfloor of the Senate. We should not do that. Please. I have sat as a \nmember of the Immigration Subcommittee now for 12 years. I come from a \nbig immigration State, the largest, no doubt about that, in America, a \nState with very deep concerns.\n  I understand the agricultural labor needs of the States as well as \nanyone. And not to be able to have a markup, not to be able to make \namendments in a committee and present a bill that has been scrubbed, \namended, and is ready for prime time, I believe, is a huge mistake.\n  So I am very pleased to support the Senator's amendment. I will have \nanother amendment in due course in this area as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand at this moment to very cautiously \noppose the resolution and to express my reason. I say ``cautiously'' \nbecause of my respect for the Senator from Texas and respect for the \nSenator from California and all of the work they are putting into \nimmigration and the need for comprehensive reform.\n  None of us in the Senate argue about it, but we certainly are willing \nto talk about it. In fact, we have talked about it now for 1,201 days \nsince 9/11. Mr. President, 9/11 was that day of awakening when we found \nout there were millions of foreign nationals in our country without \ndocumentation, and some of them were here with evil intent. Not many \nbut some. Most are here and hardworking.\n  Tragically enough, because of the character of an obsolete package of \nimmigration laws, they are living in the back streets and shadows of \nAmerica. They have no rights. They work hard. Many of them take their \nmoney back to their birth country. Some of them attempt to stay. That \nis where we are. We all know that.\n  The Senator from California has talked about the numbers. Her State \nhas a very big problem. I hope we can get into that debate.\n  Let me also talk about the timing of it. I think you are going to \nsee, if it is extended, only those who would want to extend the time of \nthis debate. The issue of the Senator from Maryland is a very small, \nsensitive, important debate. It is very time sensitive. That law should \nhave been in place the first of April so the hires could have gone \nforth at the first of May. In my State, the resorts open June 1. It is \ncritical that workforce be in place by June 1.\n  Comprehensive debate, according to the Senator from Texas, should \nprobably take place late summer, early fall, when they have finally \ndone their\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nwork. I do not criticize them for that. But I must tell you, long \nbefore 9/11 I was looking at the very tragic situation of American \nagriculture. American agriculture has admitted openly that they have a \nvery large problem. It is quite simple. The Bureau of Labor and \nStatistics will tell you the workforce may have as many as, well, 1.6 \nmillion workers, and 70 percent of them are not documented and \ntherefore, by definition, illegal. By surveys alone, the workers admit \nit. Yet we now say: Gee whiz, we will talk about it now.\n  It is too late now. It can't be done now. It is time sensitive to the \nindustry, very time sensitive to the food on the shelf of the American \nconsumer, time sensitive to humane support of those who toil in our \nfields.\n  No, there is never the right time. And, oh, about this supplemental, \nthis ``urgent'' supplemental--I am sorry, I do not mean to criticize \nthe Senator from Texas--we have been urgently working on this for 2 \nmonths. That is how long ago the President proposed it, 2 months ago. \nWe will have this on the President's desk by the first of May. That is \nwhen they want it. We do not need to debate immigration for 4, 5 days \nunless the Senator from California wants to drag it out.\n  There will be amendments on the floor of the Senate to my bill, and \nthere should be. It is open for amendment. I would hope I could \nconvince Senators to take it as it is. It has had hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. It is well vetted. It has been 8 years in the \ncrafting. Last year, I had 509 groups supporting it. This year I will \nhave 600.\n  This issue's time has come, and it is time the Senate deal with it \nopenly and forthrightly. I was willing to step back for a moment. I \ntold the leader so. The leader worked on it but could not put that \npackage together. I will be on the floor of the Senate later today, \nhopefully, offering my amendment. It has been filed at the desk. We can \ndeal with this in a day, unless there are Senators who want to drag it \nout by throwing in amendments that ought to go in the substantive \ncomprehensive package that the Senator from Texas, chairing the \ncommittee, is working on and attempting to do at this moment.\n  A comprehensive bill? You bet. Rifle shots, targeted? You bet. We \nhave to do it now and should do it now--H-2B, H-2A, critical to \nAmericas's workforce and food supply now, not this fall or this winter \nor next year. We almost collapsed the raisin industry in the Central \nValley in California last year. Why? Because Social Security was doing \nits work and checking Social Security numbers. And 72 percent of them \nwere mismatches. That is a phrase for ``illegal.'' The Senator from \nCalifornia knows it. She has admitted she has a major problem in the \nheart of America's agricultural food basket.\n  Shame on us for not having the time to deal with the problem and deal \nwith it forthrightly, honestly, and fairly. I am willing to subject my \nwork to amendments, if the Senator from California wants to bring all \nof the amendments she can. I would hope she would target it to those \nspecific two, the AgJOBS bill. She is right about misdemeanors, but I \nam only following the current Federal law, the current law for \nimmigration. I haven't changed it at all. If she doesn't like it, she \nwill bring amendments, and maybe we can adjust that a little.\n  I have worked with the Senator from California. I am not disagreeing \nwith the premise of some of her arguments. But if she wants to throw \nthe whole baby in with the bath water, then she had better be careful \nbecause she will collapse her agricultural economy if we make a \nmisstep.\n  We are doing something right now that is critical to America and to \nAmerica's culture. We are trying to control our borders. We are trying \nto apprehend and deport those in our country who are illegal. We ought \nto do that. I have voted for everything along the way. But as we work \nto get all of this done and clean up the inheritance of the last 20 \nyears of bad law or law that wasn't enforceable--and we learned all \nabout it in a post-9/11 environment--we have to remember one thing: As \nwe do the right things, we have to do all of it the right way or we \nwill collapse certain segments of America's economy because we \ndestroyed the workforce that is out there at this moment, toiling in \nAmerica's agricultural fields or in America's processing plants, \nworking hard to take money home to their children and wives--not here, \ndominantly in Mexico. Some here.\n  That is the reality that I bring to the floor, and I am very willing \nto debate. I hope we can get into that debate later on today.\n  When you think about the Cornyn-Feinstein resolution, that this is \nnot the right thing, then when is it? Twelve hundred days from now, \n1,300, 1,400 days from the day that America awoke to the problem as \nAmerica's people were killed and our trade center fell and our Pentagon \nwas attacked? That is the reality. We are doing all the right things. \nWe are moving in the right direction. But let's make sure that as we \ndo, we do it in a package that doesn't start collapsing segments of our \nindustry or mistreating people who work hard for themselves and for the \nAmerican economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me a few \nmoments to speak about this issue.\n  If we read the preamble to this proposed amendment, it says it is a \nsense of the Senate that the Congress of the United States should not \ndelay the appropriation to our men and women in harm's way by having a \ndebate over immigration policy. It could just as easily say it is the \nsense of the Senate that the Congress should not delay a comprehensive \nimmigration reform debate which is the reason we have the problem \ntoday.\n  I have a great respect for the Senator from Texas. I understand why \nthis amendment has been put together because, as the Senator has said, \nthere are a lot of us who have been trying for 3 or 4 days to figure \nout a way to bring about a meaningful debate on comprehensive \nimmigration reform. I am taking this opportunity because I want to make \npoints not on behalf of the Senator from Georgia but on behalf of the 9 \nmillion people in Georgia I represent.\n  Those points are as follows: REAL ID is not an immigration issue. It \nis a national security issue. By the time we get to the end of this \ndebate and the conference, it should be a part of this package.\n  No. 2, I have the greatest respect for the Senator from California \nand the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Texas and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I wouldn't disregard for a second the amount of work that \nhas gone into the comprehensive immigration laws of this country, \ntrying to bring about fundamental change. However, as of this date, in \nthe 3 and a half plus years since 9/11, the Congress has done little to \naddress some major issues. For a second, I would like to address them.\n\n  As I do, I want you to know I am a second-generation Swedish \nAmerican. Because of this great country, my grandfather emigrated in \n1903 in the potato famine. My father was born in 1916. My grandfather \nwasn't naturalized until 1926. Because of this Constitution, I am in \nthe Senate today. I respect the legal immigration process. I also \ndespise those who tend to judge books by covers and categorize people \nby their ethnicity or their look or say: They are an illegal alien. We \nhave delayed so long in dealing with securing our borders, enforcing \nlegal immigration and seeing to it there are consequences to bad \nbehavior, the American people have lost confidence in the government to \nactually do what the Constitution expects us to do.\n  Think about a few things for a second. We have talked about \nagriculture. We are spending money enforcing the adverse effect wage \nrate on the onion farms of south Georgia. We are spending money \nenforcing a law that actually would induce a farmer to think about \nhiring undocumented workers rather than documented workers because it \nis going to cost him $2, $3, or $4 an hour more to hire the documented \nworker, and we don't have the enforcement people to enforce our \nborders. How in the world can we justify trying to enforce that which \ninduces the wrong thing to happen?\n  We have seen our health facilities, our educational facilities--I \nchaired the Georgia Board of Education. I\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nspent more time providing Spanish-speaking teachers for our State, and \nbilingual programs, which I am proud of. I want to educate every one of \nthem. I helped write No Child Left Behind. But as the flood and the \nflow continues and the suspicion continues that we fail in Washington \nto recognize the crisis we have in this country, a crisis that is \ncausing some of our citizens to take actions that worry me deeply, it \nis my responsibility on the floor of this Senate to represent the \npeople of the State of Georgia.\n  I respect the Senator from Texas and this amendment. I understand why \nit is here. If we get about the business of a feeding frenzy, of taking \nsome of the points I have mentioned and the Senator from Idaho has, we \nmay delay, but somehow, some way we need to send the American people \nthe clear signal we get it. We are going to have comprehensive reform. \nWe are going to have a comprehensive debate, and it is going to be \nsooner rather than later.\n  I will disagree, I am sure, as will others with me, on where we need \nto go. But disagreeing on how we get there and getting there are two \ndifferent things. We no longer have the luxury. Our States, our school \nsystems, our hospitals, our farmworkers, and our people no longer have \nthe luxury or the patience for us to delay any longer.\n  In my State of Georgia, there is an old saying: If you want to get \nthe mud out of the stream, get the hog out of the spring. \nProcrastination on dealing with the delicate and difficult issues of \ncomprehensive immigration reform have muddied the water in America and \nwill do great harm if we don't hurry up and take the 8, 3, 4, and 6 \nyears of work that has been done in committees and move forward with \ncomprehensive reform.\n  I believe the Senator from Texas is trying to use this as a \nfoundation for that to happen. I understand the Senator from Idaho's \nfrustration which I have shared. I hope if my remarks contribute \nanything, it will be to send a message: Regardless of whether we agree \non the specifics, let us no longer delay in dealing with the single \nlargest domestic issue to the people of the United States and that is \ncomprehensive immigration reform and rewarding legal immigration and \ngetting our arms around illegal immigration.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wanted to make a brief response, \nboth to the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Idaho. One of the \nreasons why I think it is so difficult to look at a broken immigration \nsystem is because our immigration system is so big. America takes more \nimmigrants in its regular immigration quota a year than other \nindustrialized countries put together.\n  If you take that and you take all of the other programs, H-1B, H-2B, \nthe L visas, and all these other visas, it adds up to about 5.5 million \npeople a year who come into our country under one visa or another. It \nis an enormous job to look over this whole breadth and scope of \nimmigration programs and make the necessary changes.\n  I think one logical change is if a quota of people coming from Mexico \nis perhaps too small, people have to wait too long; therefore, there is \na huge illegal immigration problem. Nonetheless, we are a nation of \nlaws. If we have the law, we should follow the law. So I am one who \nbelieves reform should be done, but in the name of reform I don't \nbelieve we should pass a bill quickly on an appropriation bill without \ngoing through the necessary steps to adjust it and amend it in the \ncommittee.\n  Let me make a point in response to the Senator from Idaho, and I am \npleased that he is a great expert on California agriculture. Since he \nis, he will know that the great bulk of the workforce is illegal. That \nworkforce has been there for a very long time. I would accept a bill \nthat provided for some adjustment of a workforce that had worked in \nagricultural labor for 3 years, that had been in California doing it, \ncould show prior work documentation and be vouched for by employers.\n  According to this bill that we are going to have on the floor--and I \nassume people feel it is going to sweep through--you only have to work \nfor a hundred days--that is, 575 hours--in 12 months and you are \neligible for your family coming, for a temporary green card; and then \nif you work another time, you get a permanent green card.\n  Well, this is going--mark my words--to be a huge magnet. When I \ndiscuss this with people, they say: There is an eligible date. Look at \nit here. Do you think people across the border know the eligible date? \nAll they know is they have to be here and work for a hundred days, so \ncome on over. They come over and you cannot find them and they don't go \nhome. What happens is the numbers build up, the people in southern \nCalifornia find people camping in their backyards, in their gullies, \nand in the parks; there is no housing, the schools are overcrowded, and \nthen people go to the ballot with an initiative. That is what happened \nin 1994 when proposition 187, unconstitutional as it was, passed. Polls \nshow that if put on the ballot today, it would most likely pass again.\n  So I have tried to be constructive. I have proposed amendments that \nhave been rejected by the authors in the House and the Senate. I am on \nthe Immigration Subcommittee. Why do any of us serve on a subcommittee, \nthen, if a bill of such enormous dimension--this could be the largest \nimmigration program in history. It could bring millions of people into \nthis country. The workers, their spouses, their minor children are all \npermitted.\n  We should know what we do. Now, a hundred days of work, 575 hours of \nwork--if I were on the other side, I would say I can sneak across and \nget a hundred hours of work, then I can bring in my family and I will \nhave a green card. It is nirvana.\n  For my State, it is perhaps different--Texas might be the next State, \nand then Arizona--in terms of sheer numbers and problems. When the \nPresident proposed his plan, let me tell you that apprehensions at the \nborder in February went up 14.2 percent; the next month, March, 57.8 \npercent; April, 79.6 percent. So the call was out there, and people \nthought, aha, and they tried to come across the border to get into the \ncountry. The same thing will happen.\n\n  That is why it is important that we figure a way to prevent that from \nhappening. I will provide for an adjustment of status for people who \nhave worked in agricultural labor for a long time, for a substantial \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For a nice question or a mean one?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have never been mean to the Senator from California, nor \nhas she to me. She obviously makes very important points. None of those \nhave been disputed and none of them have been dismissed out of hand. \nCalifornia is a unique situation. Texas is a unique situation. My State \nof Idaho has a large number of undocumenteds during the year, but it is \nequal to one county in the Central Valley of California. I understand \nthat.\n  I don't understand California agriculture as well as the Senator from \nCalifornia, but I spent a good deal of time down there because I work \non a broad variety of issues dealing with California and water. \nCalifornia has a very real problem. The Senator has a right to be \nconcerned and alarmed. Any amendments she would wish to offer that are \nviewed as constructive I will take a very hard look at to make sure \nthat what we do works.\n  Yes, we have a January 1, 2005, date. I will not get into the details \nof my bill. We will debate that. So the rush of the border would \nalready have had to occur. But it hasn't. It has increased simply \nbecause there is a demand for workers in this country.\n  If the Senator wants to help me shape that more, I am willing to \nlisten to that and see what we can do with amendments that deal with \nthe misdemeanor issue she is concerned about and a time certain. None \nof us wants to create a rush at the border. What we want to create for \nCalifornia and the rest of the country is a legal workforce that is \nthere, real, and honors those here for 3, 4, 5 years, who are married \nand have families here. We say: Go back to Mexico, and you may get back \nacross the border.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I think I have the floor. I was \nwaiting for the question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The question is quite simple: Offer your amendments, and I \nwill take a serious look at them. You make very important issues for \nyour State and many other States, and I\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nhope you will do that in a fair and responsible way, as you have always \nbeen on this issue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I happen to agree with her 100 percent. \nShe is exactly right. Not only are we going to see a flood of illegals \ncoming across in greater numbers than what we have today, we are going \nto see status under the AgJOBS bill, which is pure and simple amnesty. \nBut you are also going to have somewhere between 8 million and 13 \nmillion illegal aliens who are here today having the opportunity to \nbecome legalized. Just the fact that we don't know, as the Senator has \nalluded to, how many there are, with the difference being between 8 \nmillion and 13 million, that tells you how big the problem is.\n  So I happen to agree with her, and I will simply tell her we are \ngoing to have an alternative--Senator Kyl and I--to the AgJOBS when we \nget to that. The Senator is exactly on target relative to these folks \nwho are going to line up at the border.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may conclude my discussion, and then I will \nyield the floor to Senator Craig. He mentioned raisins. The last time I \nlooked, it took 40,000 workers in California to harvest the raisin crop \nin 4 different counties. Most of these are illegals. Most of these have \ndone it year after year. They also go from crop to crop to crop, as we \nknow.\n  The key is to take care of, in my view, the people who are already \nhere and working and are a part of this. The demand for the \nagricultural jobs comes every time the employer sanctions are carried \nout. Then suddenly the agricultural industry says we are for bringing \nmore people in from other countries. I think we have to find a way to \nhave a workforce that is known, identifiable, reasonably and well paid, \nthat can get housing, can send their children to school, that work in \nthis industry. Probably one-half of the agricultural workforce--I would \nsay 600,000 workers--is illegal. These are the 600,000 who I believe we \nshould be concerned with--not opening the border to bring in more but \nto find a way that they then can become a responsible part of the \nworkforce. That is where I am, because I admit that is a need.\n  This bill does not do that. This bill sets up a different program and \ndoes not relate to people who have been here for years working in \nagriculture. They may be very good citizens. They probably are. Some of \nthem own their homes, they have children, they are responsible. They \nhave a tough life, true. I think this can be handled. But what has \nhappened is there is a set mentality that the bill has to be this way \nbecause we have 60 votes, and we are going to keep it this way. That is \na problem and, therefore, that mentality does not let it go through \nImmigration, does not let amendments have exposure in committee.\n  Virtually everybody here who is arguing is a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is where we ought to be debating it instead of on the \nfloor passing a piece of legislation of which no one--no one--knows the \nabsolute effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before the Senator yields, may I ask two \nquick questions? Will the Senator from California respond? First, the \nSenator from California is the ranking member on the Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, which I \nchair; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator another question. She \ntalked about the probability of thousands and thousands of illegal \nimmigrants being attracted to come into the country who are not here \nnow. The Senator from Idaho said we will have a cutoff date.\n  Was the Senator from California, in raising that concern--which I \nbelieve to be an absolutely legitimate concern--perhaps talking about \nsection 101(D)(1)(c) of the bill of the Senator from Idaho which \nactually invites former lawbreakers to return to the United States? In \nother words, illegal immigrants who have formerly worked in U.S. \nagriculture.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, can the Senator give me a page?\n  Mr. KYL. I do not have the page. It is a section that permits former \nimmigrants, who worked here illegally in agriculture but have since \nreturned to their home, to return to our southern border and apply for \nthe special status that is set up in the bill the Senator from \nCalifornia described earlier in order to file a preliminary application \nfor status as temporary permanent resident if they appear in designated \nports of entry with an application that ``demonstrates prior qualifying \nemployment in the United States,'' and then could be granted admission \nto the United States by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  That is question No. 1. Is that one of the areas in which additional \nillegal immigrants would be attracted to come into this country?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely. Additionally, this bill gives this \nspecial temporary green card to people with two misdemeanors on their \nrecord. I have discussed this with the authors in the House, and they \ndo not want to amend it. My own view is there should be no \nmisdemeanors. Why should somebody who broke a law coming here be able \nto break two more laws and get special consideration? We all know \nmisdemeanor laws vary. We know there are misdemeanor drug laws, there \nare misdemeanor battery laws, misdemeanor theft laws, misdemeanor \ndriving under the influence--there are all kinds of criminal \nmisdemeanors. To say someone who broke the law who came here illegally, \nwho was illegally employed, can have two misdemeanors on their record \nand have a special status is something I do not understand. Yet I have \nimplored them for a substantial period of time, and they do not want to \nchange.\n  If we had a chance to discuss this in the Judiciary Committee in a \nmarkup, this would be brought out, and we could debate it back and \nforth. People could say why they want it, we could say why we do not \nthink it should be included, and there would be a vote. At least a bill \nwould have been vetted by a committee process.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from California yield for another question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Under the provisions we talked about before, which would \nattract any number of illegal immigrants--and by the way, that is not a \nterm I throw around negatively because they would, in fact, have to say \nthey were illegal immigrants in order to gain entry into the United \nStates. They would have to say they were working illegally in the \nUnited States before and now they want to come back. That is the \nprovision of law under which they could actually come back into the \nUnited States.\n  Based on the experience of the Senator from California with the use \nof illegal documentation--Social Security cards, driver's licenses, all \nof the other items of identification that can be counterfeited--would \nthe Senator have a view as to whether this particular provision could \nbe taken advantage of by those wishing to commit fraud? Of course, \npeople already committed fraud in this country by coming here illegally \nand using those same fraudulent documents to gain employment in the \nfirst place. Isn't this one that would engender a lot of fraudulent \napplications to come back into the United States?\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This has been and is today a huge problem. \nAdditionally, there is another problem on our southern border, if the \nSenator would give me a minute, and that is, other than Mexicans \ncrossing the border being picked up illegally. I think it was up to \n88,000 last year. So it is shooting up. And when you ask the Border \nPatrol about it, they say this is very difficult for them to sort it \nall out because there is such pressure on the border. The Senator, \ncertainly, in Arizona knows that pressure on the border.\n  The fraud of documents is well known. One can buy a driver's license, \na Social Security card fraudulently in places that I know of and have \nseen it happening in southern California for $15 or $20. So that is not \na big problem.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can conclude by saying to the Senator from California, \nI think the proposal she and the Senator from Texas have set forth to \nput this very\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nimportant but very complicated discussion off and not have this debate \non the bill that helps to fund our war operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is a very good proposal which I intend to support.\n  As she knows, I welcome the opportunity to work with her and also \nwith my good friend and colleague from Idaho, the Senator who is \nproposing the bill, which I would oppose but would hope to be able to \nwork on if we have the opportunity to do that outside the kind of \nactivity in which we are engaged on the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  So I do support the proposal of the Senators from Texas and \nCalifornia and hope the body will approve it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I enjoyed this debate. It has been over 15 \nyears since the Senate has had real debate on immigration. The Simpson-\nMazzoli bill was the last time the Senate seriously looked at this \nissue, and it took us years to finally come up with a bill. We have not \nseriously addressed changes since.\n  There have been dramatic changes across America in immigration \npatterns, the number of people coming in, certainly issues of national \nsecurity. If there is ever an issue we should address in comprehensive \nfashion, it is immigration.\n  I commend President Bush. We do not see eye to eye on many things, \nbut I commend him for his leadership in suggesting we debate \nimmigration. His proposal is not one I embrace in its entirety, but it \nat least opened the debate. Many were critical of it, some lauded it, \nbut at least he had the courage to step up and say: Let's debate it.\n  Now comes the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we have an \nimportant bill before us relative to the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \ntsunami relief. Senator Cornyn, a Republican of Texas, and Senator \nFeinstein, a Democrat of California, have said this bill should not \ninclude immigration provisions. I think they make a compelling \nargument, an argument which I joined with several of my colleagues in \nmaking to Senator Frist a few days ago, who cosigned a letter--about 20 \nof us--to Senator Frist saying we do not believe one specific \nimmigration provision should be part of this conference or this \nappropriations bill, and that relates to the REAL ID.\n  For those who have not followed the debate, the REAL ID is a \nprovision adopted in the House of Representatives which will be part of \nthis appropriations bill when the House and Senate come together to \ndecide the final work product.\n  My concern, I say to Senator Cornyn and Senator Feinstein, is that \nthe garlic is in the soup. There is no way to take it out at this \npoint. Those of us who may be conferees will walk into that conference \ncommittee and face an immigration issue, a very serious immigration \nissue, a very controversial one.\n  So the suggestion we not add any immigration debate to this bill may \nbe a good one to expedite it but like it or not we are going to face \nwhat I consider to be some very onerous provisions of the REAL ID bill \nwhich will be part of the conference committee report. If it is \nappropriate, I will retain the floor but ask the Senator from Texas \nabout that particular circumstance. Would the Senator from Texas be \nopen to modifying his sense of the Senate resolution in paragraph 4? In \nparagraph 4, the Senators from Texas and California say Congress should \nnot short circuit the discussion of immigration by attaching amendments \nto this supplemental outside of the regular order.\n  Would the Senator from Texas modify his resolution to add the \nfollowing language: Or by including provisions relating to immigration \nin the conference report to this supplemental appropriation bill?\n  If the Senator would, then I think what we are saying is we want a \nclean bill. By this vote, we are instructing our conferees to not come \nback with REAL ID, to not come back with any immigration provision.\n  I understand the predicament Senator Mikulski faces in Maryland. \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island faces a similar predicament when it comes \nto Liberian refugees. Senator Schumer faces an emergency situation with \nvictims of volcano on an island who are now going to be deported back \nto tragic circumstances.\n  The point I am making is we cannot escape the reality immigration is \non top of us and coming at us, but if we want this bill--because of its \nspecial nature--to be clean, I ask, without yielding the floor, if I \ncould, through the Chair, if the Senator from Texas would be open to \nincluding this language in his sense of the Senate resolution?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the question of the Senator \nfrom Illinois. For purposes of the Senate bill, it is absolutely \ncritical, as I think the debate has shown so far, we not get into other \nunrelated issues to the war supplemental, but we ought to leave it up \nto the conferees. Obviously, we are going to have to deal with the \nHouse provisions, and that is going to be worked on in the conference \ncommittee I do not expect to be on.\n  This is the agreed language Senator Feinstein and I have been able to \ncome up with, and it covers the area we have some control over; that \nis, what happens in the Senate on the Senate's version of the bill.\n  Certainly, I will want to work with the Senator from Illinois and all \nmy colleagues to try to make sure we enact comprehensive reform. Part \nof the problem is we are taking this in a rifle-shot fashion when I \nthink what we need to do is deal with it comprehensively. That is the \nreason for the resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas. I do apologize. I \nmentioned to him a minute or two ago that I was going to ask a question \nalong these lines. I would like to ask Senator Cornyn and Senator \nFeinstein to consider this. Because if we do not go to that next step \nand say we are not going to let the House bring in an immigration \nprovision in conference and tie our own hands and not offer important \nimmigration provisions in the Senate, that is unfair. If we are going \nto make this an immigration and appropriations bill, then we have some \npretty important issues to consider.\n  Senator Kennedy has an issue with Senator Craig--Senator Mikulski, so \nmany do. If this conference is going to be open and the REAL ID \nprovisions come rolling out at us, as difficult as it is, as time \nconsuming as it may be, we have no recourse but to open the issue and \nopen the debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, reluctantly, I rise to oppose this \namendment, even though I agree with many of the principles expounded in \nit. No. 1, to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, the sponsors of \nthis amendment, I too, agree, that our immigration system is badly \nbroken. It does fail to serve the interests of our national security \nand our national economy. We do need to enact the critical \nappropriations bill to support our troops and help people who are \ntsunami victims and some other important aspects. At the same time, \nthough, the sense of the Senate really should be directed to the House. \nFor someone like myself, who has a very serious crisis because of \nsomething called the H-2B visas, which I will explain in more detail at \nanother time, the fact is this is our only vehicle.\n  Immigration, as an issue, was introduced in the supplemental \nappropriation bill in the House of Representatives with an enormously \ncontroversial and prickly concept, the so-called REAL ID card. I know \nthat my colleague from Tennessee has proposed some creative solutions \nto deal with that. I know that others want to talk about this. If we \ncan talk about comprehensive immigration reform, I am all for it. But \nthe question is, When are we going to do it? It has been over 1,000 \ndays since 9/11, and we have not done comprehensive immigration reform, \nnor have we looked at what aspects of immigration are working. There \nare certain aspects that are working in certain areas of the guest \nworker programs; college students who come from abroad, who work in our \ncountry and learn in our country and go back home, what a tremendous \nexercise in public diplomacy the so-called J visas have accomplished.\n  In my own State, the H-2B visa, which allows guest workers to come\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\ninto this country for seasonal employment to take jobs that are \ncertified as not being held by American workers, with a mandated return \nto their own home, has worked well. It has worked so well that the cap \nis now bursting at the seams.\n  I am all for comprehensive immigration reform, but No. 4 says \nCongress should not short circuit the discussion by attaching \namendments to this supplemental. We have had no discussion. There is \nnothing to short circuit. What we do have is a series of, as Senator \nDurbin has said, these rifle-shot crisis situations.\n  It would be wonderful if we could have comprehensive reform. I look \nforward to participating in that comprehensive reform. For now, we have \nto look at those States that are facing a crisis because of the flawed \nimmigration system we have now and for which we are advocating modest \nand temporary legislative remedies.\n  I salute our colleagues. They have a big job ahead of them. Anybody \nwilling to undertake comprehensive immigration reform needs to be \nencouraged, supported and worked with. We need elasticity in this bill \nto deal with those things related to our economic viability. In many \nways, a guest worker program that is working needs to be addressed, and \nI hope to offer an amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maryland has \nworked hard on this need, as well as the Senator from Idaho, and there \nare other Senators who feel deeply we ought to deal with immigration. \nMost of us have been to Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan. We know what this \nbill is about. This bill is about whether the National Guard men and \nwomen from Tennessee have sufficient armor when they go into a combat \nzone. This bill is about whether we are going to get some money to the \nnew Palestinian Authority in time for them to be a success so we can \nbegin to have the hope of peace in the Middle East. This bill is about \nwhether we are going to fully fund a building in Baghdad for our \nthousands of Americans who are there so that they do not have to live \nin trailers and live in a more dangerous situation than most Americans \noutside of this country live in today in the world.\n  This bill is about whether our combat men and women have rifles that \nare sufficiently modern to defend themselves. This bill is about \nwhether we have safe trucks. Eight hundred of them convoy from Kuwait \nCity to Baghdad every day, carrying supplies to our men and women. This \nbill is about whether we have helmets for our combat men and women. We \nshould not be slowing it down. It is amazing to me that we would slow \ndown a bill to support the men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, 40 \npercent of whom have left their mortgages, left their homes, left their \nchildren, left their jobs. They are dealing with all the issues we have \nto deal with from half a world away. Plus they are being shot at, and \nsome of them are being killed. We are slowing it down because we have \nfailed to address one of the single most important issues facing our \ncountry, and so we come up in the middle of a debate about whether to \nsupport our troops and say, okay, let us stop for a few weeks and argue \nabout immigration.\n  For Heaven's sake, we should pass the bill to support our troops \nimmediately. We agree with it. We all support it. We support them. We \nall agree with it. Then we should get about the business of dealing \nwith the point of the Senator from Maryland, and the proposal of the \nSenator from Idaho, and the work Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn are \ndoing.\n  This is a country that is unified by a few principles, our country, \nthe United States of America. We are not unified by our race or by our \nethnicity or anything else such as that. Among those principles is the \nrule of law. We go all around the world meddling in other people's \nbusiness, preaching about the rule of law, yet we have 10 to 15 million \npeople living here who violate the law by being here. We should not \ntolerate that, and we should be embarrassed as a Congress that we have \nfailed to deal with it.\n  This is not a problem Tulsa can deal with or Nashville can deal with. \nThis is a flat out responsibility of the Congress to solve, and we \nshould solve it. We are dumping on the backs of local communities the \ncost for schools to educate people who are illegally here. Ten years \nago in the schools of southern California, a third of the children in \nthe largest school district in California were here illegally. Somebody \nhas to pay for that. Emergency rooms in hospitals have many people \nthere who are here illegally. That is straining the budgets of cities \nand states.\n  So here we are in the middle of a debate about how quickly we can \nsupport our military effort, and somebody over in the House of \nRepresentatives attaches a bill that might make some sense but--No. 1, \nit slows down our bill for the troops, and No. 2, it probably imposes \nupon states a big unfunded Federal mandate which most of the people on \nthis side of the aisle were elected to stop. I mean there are 190 \nmillion state driver's licenses. What the House provision would do is \nsay we are going to turn the state driver's license examiners into CIA \nagents so they can go around and check and see whether we have any \nterrorists coming in, and then we are going to make them pay for it as \nwell. Here is one more unfunded mandate.\n  Then the third thing we are doing, and we have not even considered \nthrough our committees whether this is the best way to do it, is \ndetermining if we are going to have in effect a national identification \ncard. In fact, that is what the REAL ID Program is. It is a national \nidentification card. They say it is not, but what else is it? We have \ntaken an ineffective national identification card, the driver's \nlicense--I have mine right here. We have taken an ineffective national \nidentification card, and we are trying to turn it into an effective \none. We know it is ineffective because we know that the terrorists in \n9/11 all had driver's licenses. I know it because mine expired in 2000, \nand every time I hand it over at the airport they never turn it over to \nsee if it was renewed to the year 2005. We have an ineffective \nidentification card, and the House wants us, without going to a single \ncommittee, to pass a big unfunded mandate, slow down help for the \ntroops, and pass an unfunded national identification card. That is what \nwe are being asked to do here, and I don't think we should do it. That \nis not the right way to go about it.\n  I fully support the idea of allowing the Democratic and Republican \nleadership to agree on a certain time soon where we address this \nmassive challenge to our credibility as a nation, as a nation of the \nrule of law, and where we create an immigration system we can be proud \nof. For me, that means a generous program to allow people to come here \nand work legally, and then we enforce the law. For me, that means we do \nnot have a double system where we have 500,000 or a million people who \nstand in line to get in, and then we have another million people who \nbreak the line to get in. That is not right.\n  We also need to address questions about whether we are going to \ncontinue to require people who apply for student visas to say when they \napply that they never intend to live here. Of course, many of them do \nand we want many of them to. Do we not want the brightest scientists in \nChina or India to come to the University of Alabama or Tennessee and \nthen stay here and create jobs to keep our standard of living up? We \nare getting more competition from those other countries for these \nbright people. We need to look at that. Then we need to look at \nenforcement.\n  But this is not the way to do business here. I strongly support the \nCornyn resolution. I do not want to see the REAL ID legislation or any \nother immigration legislation slow down money for the troops, put an \nunfunded mandate on state and local governments, and prematurely, \nwithout careful, comprehensive consideration, try to deal on this floor \nwith one of the greatest issues we have to face.\n  We should pass the Cornyn resolution. We should pass the bill \nsupporting the troops. Then we should set aside a specific time, face \nup to it, and do our job of reforming the immigration laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this issue because I \nthink we find ourselves fixing the wrong problem\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nagain. The real consequence of not having addressed the immigration \nproblems in this country means we have problems with crops that are not \ngoing to be harvested because we don't have workers. But the time to do \nthat is right after we finish this bill.\n  The American people as a whole do not want an amnesty program, but \nthey will accept an amnesty program if we fix the border, and we have \nnot secured the border. We have not done what we need to do in this \nbody, in the House or through the administration, to enforce the laws \nof this country.\n  It is illegal to come here and we should not reward illegal behavior. \nBut you can't even begin to address that until you say we are going to \nenforce closing this border for national security purposes but also for \ncompetitive purposes.\n  We need to have a national debate about how many people need to come \nin and supply an effort to our Nation as we grow. All of us in this \ncountry are immigrants except for the Native Americans. We would \nwelcome others. But it has to be done legally. We have not done our job \nas bodies of the legislature, along with this administration, of first \nsecuring the border.\n  We have a national priority in terms of our own safety. Yet the \npolitics of securing that border plays into every Presidential \ncandidate who is running today. It becomes a political football. The \nfact is, for our children we need to secure that border to make sure we \ndon't have terrorists coming across. ``60 Minutes'' 3 or 4 weeks ago \nshowed a person from Croatia who came across the border illegally, \nbecame a legalized citizen after that, and ran guns and exported them \nthroughout our country. He had access illegally to get here in the \nfirst place. That is not what we want.\n  We need to solve agricultural problems. I come from an agricultural \nState. But the American people are not going to accept an amnesty \nprogram, I don't care how you design it, based on any type of \nemergency, until we fix the obligation we have, which is to control \nthat border. We have the capability to do it. We have the technology to \ndo it. We have the money to do that and a lot less of other things if \nwe would do it. If we will in fact control that border, then we can \nsolve every other problem that comes about.\n  There are going to be consequences of not fixing the problems that \nwere outlined by Senator Mikulski and Senator Craig, but rightly so, \nbecause we haven't done our job. There are consequences when we do not \ndo our job. So I support Senator Cornyn's resolution fully. We need to \ncome back and address this. We need to address every other area, but we \nhave to first recognize that the American people are counting on us to \ndo what is right in terms of securing the border. As long as we \ncontinue to ignore that because it is not politically acceptable in \ncertain circles, then we are not going to fulfill our duty to protect \nthis country. When we have troops fighting in Iraq and in Afghanistan \nand around the rest of the world, and we will not even enforce the law \nwhen we have the capability to do it, we dishonor them.\n  So this is fixing the wrong problem. It is a problem, yes, but it is \nnot the real problem. The problem is the border and controlling the \nborder. I am convinced the American people are compassionate and will \ndeal with any other issue of those who are here and those who want to \ncome here in an orderly fashion, once they have the confidence that we \nhave the border controlled. But we fail to do that at our peril, we \nfail to do that at the peril of the safety of this country, and we fail \nto do that at the peril of these areas that need specialized help in a \nshort period of time. We are going to suffer the consequences of that \nand we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I point out the debate we have been seeing \nhere in the last couple of hours to me proves the point, and that is \nthis is a complex, difficult, contentious issue, but one that, from \nwhat I heard over the last couple of hours, we all agree needs to be \naddressed.\n  Indeed, that is what the resolution says. It says Congress must \nengage in a careful and deliberate discussion about the need to bolster \nenforcement of and comprehensively reform our immigration laws. That is \nwhat the resolution says.\n  I know different Senators have different proposals. As I have said, I \nthink the idea is we ought to take up those in the Judiciary Committee \nin the Subcommittee on Immigration, and we ought to be able to come up \nwith a bill we can present to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand other members. We can have it marked up. With the help of the \nmajority leader, we can get it to the floor of the Senate.\n  It would be my hope we can do that within the next few months. I \nagree. We have a serious problem that has long been neglected in this \ncountry, and it cries out for an answer.\n  Lest any of our colleagues think this is not a complicated matter, \nlet me point out some of the matters contained in the AgJOBS bill alone \nwhich I think are very controversial. For the benefit of our colleagues \nwho are listening, this will give them a flavor of why I say this is \nsuch a complex and contentious issue.\n  For example, although the AgJOBS bill purports to be a temporary \nworker program, it does not have a requirement once people are \nqualified to work in the program that they actually return to their \ncountry of origin. I believe this component of a work-and-return \nconcept is absolutely critical to any program we might justly call the \ntemporary worker or guest-worker program.\n  Second, one of the provisions of the AgJOBS bill is entitled \n``Eligibility for Legal Services.'' This provision requires free, \nfederally funded legal counsel be afforded through the Legal Services \nCorporation to assist temporary workers in the application process for \nlegal permanent residency. That is right. The bill requires that the \ntaxpayers pay the bill for these allegedly temporary workers to apply \nfor legal permanent residency under the bill, creating a new legal \nright and a new right to legal representation for which the American \ntaxpayers are going to be called on to pay.\n  Third, the AgJOBS bill allows farm workers who are currently working \nillegally in the United States to cut in line in front of workers who \nhave followed legal avenues from the start, violating the principle the \nSenator from Tennessee articulated so well just a few moments ago.\n  Next, AgJOBS grants amnesty to as many as 3 million illegal aliens \nwho say they have worked recently in U.S. agriculture, along with their \nfamily members.\n  So not only are we talking about a worker program, we are talking \nabout bringing families and children, which common sense tells us will \ndecrease the likelihood that at any such time in the United States part \nof this program will indeed be temporary. Indeed, it is more likely \nthat they will stay beyond the span of their visa and live here \npermanently.\n  One other point: Since virtually all of the special agricultural \nworkers granted the one-time-only amnesty enacted in 1986 left \nagricultural work as soon as they had their green cards on hand, AgJOBS \nputs illegal aliens on the path to U.S. citizenship in a two-step \nprocess.\n  First, illegal aliens would be granted temporary residence and \nindentured for up to 6 years to ensure they continue to work in \nagriculture in the short term. Next, once these newly legalized aliens \nare provided records of labor, they will be granted lawful permanent \nresidence and then U.S. citizenship--amnesty, in a word.\n\n  Next, AgJOBS also freezes wage levels for new legal H-2A, \nnonimmigrant, agricultural workers at the January 2, 2003, level for 3 \nyears following enactment. The undocumented worker can then stay in the \nUnited States indefinitely while applying for permanent resident \nstatus. They can become citizens so long as they work in the \nagricultural sector for 675 hours over the next 6 years. Their spouse \nand minor children are permitted to accompany them and will also earn \nlegal permanent residency status.\n  I point that out because, as the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nsaid earlier, I doubt there are many of our colleagues who understand \nthe content of this AgJOBS bill. If the Senator from Idaho chooses to \noffer it as an amendment, we will take up that debate. Senator \nFeinstein and others may offer some amendments, and I hear that Senator \nKyl and Senator\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nChambliss may have amendments of their own. Who knows how many other \namendments may be working out there related to AgJOBS or maybe a more \ncomprehensive bill to deal with this issue generally.\n  But that makes the point. While we are spending time talking about \nimmigration reform, we are not getting to the job that ought to be \nhighest on our list of priorities; that is, making sure this emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill passes without undue delay and without \ngetting bogged down in other matters, such as immigration reform.\n  In the end, I join with all of my colleagues and say it is past time \nwe deal with immigration problems in this country comprehensively. We \nhave no border security now. We do at the bridges, but between the \nbridges it is come and go almost as you please. While many people come \nacross the border to work, we understand as human beings people who \nhave no hope or no opportunity where they live will do almost anything \nto be able to provide for their family. Be it human smugglers or be it \nself-guided trips across the Rio Grande or across our northern border, \nit is relatively easy to get into the United States, and the terrorists \nwho know that can exploit that and hurt the American people.\n  We also know once people get to the interior of the United States, \nthere is virtually nonexistent law enforcement. We have inadequate \ndetention facilities along the border, particularly in my State. They \nhave to let virtually all of the detainees, the immigrants who come \nacross illegally, go on their own recognizance and ask them to come \nback for a deportation hearing 30 days later. It should be no surprise \nthat in some instances 88 percent of them don't show up and simply melt \ninto the landscape--many of them working in places all across the \ncountry doing jobs Americans, perhaps, do not want.\n  But this demonstrates how badly broken our immigration system is, our \nborder security, our interior enforcement, and the reason we need to \ndeal with this comprehensively, not just with a Band-Aid.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Feinstein and me and the \nothers who have spoken already in support of the Cornyn-Feinstein \nresolution and let us have a debate about immigration--comprehensive \nimmigration reform. But let us not do it at the time when our troops \nare fighting the war on terror and delay them getting the equipment and \nthe resources they need in order to do the job they volunteered so \nnobly to do on our behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \nleadership on this issue and for his remarks, which I share.\n  We have a problem with immigration and law enforcement and national \nsecurity. Some of these are just security and some of these involve \neconomic and social policy that impact the immigration question.\n  I believe we can do better. We need to give serious thought and \nconsideration that we can do much better. We have people who want to \ncome here. They want to do so in the right way. They will be assets to \nour Nation. We ought to identify those people and try to accommodate as \nmany as possible, consistent with our own national interest.\n  The Senator from Texas mentioned what is happening in enforcement \ntoday. It is a nightmare. There was an article this morning in the \nWashington Times about 13 illegals stopped by the local police \nofficers. They were released on bail. They are asked to show up for a \nhearing on their deportation. The statistics show, as the Senator just \nsaid, as much as 80 percent of those people do not show up. They become \nabsconders. It makes a mockery of the system in many ways.\n  I have some ideas about this issue. I have some beliefs that local \nlaw enforcement has been confused in what their authority is. We ought \nto encourage them to be helpful in this area instead of discouraging, \nas the current laws today are.\n  I have done legal research on that particular question, but this is a \nDefense supplemental bill to fund our soldiers in the field in combat. \nIt is not the time to debate comprehensively one of the most complex \nand sensitive subjects this country has to deal with. That is \nfundamental.\n  The Sensenbrenner language offered early on on the intelligence bill \nwas not accepted. He was given a promise he could move it on the first \nvehicle that came out of the House. This is more a national security \nissue, by far, than an immigration bill. It is simply a tool to create \na system by which we can readily identify those who are not here \nlegally.\n  It is my observation, having been around this Senate now for some \nyears, that you can propose and do a lot of things on immigration. \nUnless you come up with something that works, that has the actual \npotential to be an impediment to illegal entry into our country, that \nis when we start hearing an objection. It seems those proposals never \npass.\n  I am prepared not to offer anything on this bill. I am prepared not \nto debate on this bill. My opinion is, the Sensenbrenner language is \nfine. I am all for it. But we are at this point looking at the \npotential of a flood of amendments dealing with immigration on a bill \nthat ought to be funding our soldiers.\n  The distinguished Senator from Mississippi who chairs the \nAppropriations Committee must be looking in wonder at a bill that is \nsupposed to be funding our troops that has now become a massive debate \non this issue of immigration. It is unfortunate.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Cornyn have agreed on an amendment that \nmakes sense. It is something I can live with. I believe it would move \nus forward.\n  The legislation being proposed, such as AgJOBS, is not good to begin \nwith, and I would probably oppose it, but more than that it is not the \ntime to deal with it. We are just not ready. It is not appropriate.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this, and not only support it but to \nvote down the amendments that deal with immigration so we can get this \nbill done. We will have to deal with immigration. It is a critical \nnational issue. It is important to our country. We are a nation of \nimmigrants. We do not want to stop people from coming here. We do have \nneeds in many areas and sectors of our economy.\n  I am not sure the Republic is going to fall if we do not have enough \ncustodial helpers in some resort somewhere. I am not sure the Republic \nis going to fall if there is not somebody to turn the bedspreads down \nat night and put a little piece of chocolate on the pillow. In fact, we \nhave a lot of American citizens who do that work dutifully every day. \nIf they were paid $2 or $3 more an hour, maybe they would do it; maybe \nthere would be more American citizens prepared to do that work.\n  We grow cotton in my home State of Alabama. If we bring twice as much \ncotton into the United States as was brought in the year before, will \nwe not drive down the price of cotton, or any other commodity?\n  We need to be of the understanding that unlimited immigration to meet \nevery possible need some business person says is critical is not the \nright policy for our country just because they say it is critical. They \nhave an interest. They want cheap labor. We are now talking about \nmatters that go beyond this supplemental.\n  I am proud of our soldiers. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan three \ntimes. They are performing exceedingly well. We have a responsibility \nto support them. This legislation does that. It is our responsibility \nto move it forward, get it to them, remove this uncertainty, make sure \nthe Defense Department has what they need to support our troops because \nwe are holding their feet to the fire. If they are not doing what the \nDefense Department ought to be doing, we are going to be on them, and \nwe need to give them the resources so we can legitimately complain if \nour soldiers are not being adequately supported. We will make a mistake \nif we get off that purpose and move toward a full-fledged debate on \nimmigration.\n  I support the Cornyn-Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to offer an amendment. I \nunderstand my colleague from California is seeking a unanimous consent.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. If I may, Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland. I ask unanimous consent--\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. This is without yielding the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized following the Senator from Maryland for the purpose of \noffering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Maryland yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, without losing my floor privileges.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. It is an \namendment to restore the money for the initial design of the building \nfor the National Intelligence Director. When this bill was before our \ncommittee, we reduced that amount at the time, but when the budget was \npresented, there was not a nominee for that office.\n  Yesterday, I presented to the Intelligence Committee Ambassador \nNegroponte to be the new NID and discussed this issue with him. It has \nbecome somewhat controversial. This amendment I have would restore the \nmoney our committee reduced in the line that deals with the NID. It has \nbeen cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside temporarily \nso we may consider this amendment. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am now confused. As a courtesy to the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, I yielded to \nhim so he could offer his technical amendment. Are we now laying my \namendment aside?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Where are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is offering a unanimous consent to \nset aside your amendment and to bring up his, which has not been done \nyet.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in the interest of following the regular \norder and engaging in senatorial courtesy, we really need order. I \ncould not hear the distinguished Senator and, therefore, was concerned \nthat we were having some slippage in our process.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 386\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. I have \na request to set aside the Senator's amendment temporarily while we \nconsider this amendment which has been cleared on both sides. It \nrestores the original budget request for NID.\n  I offer the amendment on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nHawaii, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be brought \nbefore the Senate, that it be adopted, that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that we go back to the amendment of the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 386.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 149, line 10 strike ``$89,300,000'' and insert \n     ``$250,300,000'' and on line 11 strike ``$20,000,000'' and \n     insert ``$181,000,000.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to offer an amendment that \nis desperately needed by small and seasonal business throughout the \ncountry. This amendment is identical to the bipartisan bill I \nintroduced in February called Save Our Small and Seasonal Business Act. \nIt is designed to be a 2-year temporary solution to the seasonal worker \nshortage that many coastal States and resort States are facing.\n  I wish to acknowledge the need for comprehensive immigration reform, \nbut right now small and seasonal businesses all over this Nation are in \ncrisis and need our help. These businesses need seasonal workers before \nthe summer begins so they can survive.\n  For years, they have relied on something called the H-2B visa program \nto meet their needs. This is a temporary guest worker program. But this \nyear they cannot get the temporary labor they need because they have \nbeen shut out of the H-2B visa program because the cap has been \nreached. This is a program that lets businesses hire temporary guest \nworkers when no American workers are available.\n  This amendment modeled after the Save Our Small and Seasonal Business \nhelps employers by doing four things:\n\n       It temporarily exempts the good actor workers--those who do \n     return home after they have worked a season--from the H-2B \n     cap. Employers apply for and actually name those good \n     compliant workers who have complied with the law, they name \n     them so that they are allowed them to reenter for this \n     temporary period.\n       It protects against fraud within the H-2B program.\n       It provides a fair and balanced allocation for the H-2B \n     visas.\n\n  And it reports to Congress how the program is working and where the \nbeneficiaries are.\n  I urge my colleagues to help small businesses by passing this \namendment and save these businesses and actually save thousands of \nAmerican jobs.\n  Thousands of small and seasonal businesses are facing a worker \nshortage as we approach the summer. In my home State, this is primarily \nin the seafood industry. This year, because the cap of 66,000 workers \nwas reached earlier in the year, my small businesses have been \neffectively shut out. We have had a lot of summer seasonal business in \nMaryland on the Eastern Shore and Ocean City, people working on the \nChesapeake Bay, and many of these businesses use the program year after \nyear.\n  First of all, they do hire American workers. They hire all the \nAmerican workers they can find. But at this time of the year, we need \nadditional help to meet seasonal demands. Because that cap was reached \nfor the second year in a row, I might add, these employers are at a \ndisadvantage. They cannot use the program. What will it mean? It will \nmean that some of our businesses will actually have to close their \ndoors.\n  My amendment is supported on both sides of the aisle. It does not \nchange existing requirements for employers. Employers cannot just turn \nto the H-2B visa whenever they want. First of all, employers must try \nvigorously to recruit those workers. Then they must demonstrate to the \nDepartment of Labor that they have no U.S. workers available. Only \nafter that are they allowed to fill seasonal vacancies with the H-2B \nvisas.\n  The workers they bring in often participate in the program year after \nyear. They often work for the same companies. They do not stay in the \nUnited States and are prohibited by law from doing so. They return to \ntheir home country, to their families, and their U.S. employer starts \nall over the following year.\n  Let me just say this: Right now in certain villages in Mexico, there \nare many women--mothers and their adult daughters, aunts--who are \npacking their bags. They are ready to come back to Maryland where they \nhave come before to work in Clayton Seafood or Phillips Crab House, \nwhich so many of you have enjoyed in your visits to the bay, or \nHarrison's seafood. Some of them have been in business 100 years. Some \nof them are major employers. A lot of college kids work their way \nthrough college working at Phillips Seafood, but Phillips Seafood\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nneeds these guest workers to help these kids and to help the restaurant \nstay open.\n\n  These workers are not taking the jobs, they are helping American \nworkers keep their jobs and American companies keep their doors open \nand, I might add, to the delight of many of you here, to the delight of \npeople who enjoy our products, and to the delight of the people who \ncollect the sales tax, Social Security, and so on from those American \nworkers.\n  I know we need comprehensive reform, but while we are waiting for \nthat, I have a temporary fix. By the way, working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, we looked for regulatory relief. We consulted \nwith the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security. \nSecretary Chao could not have been more gracious, more cooperative, \nmore forthcoming, but when it came down to it, her legislative counsel \nsaid, you need to change the law. She could not change the regulations \non this cap.\n  What does my amendment do? First, my amendment continues to protect \nthose American jobs. It is a short-term fix because it is a 2-year \nsolution. This amendment will only be in place for 2 years. So it \nallows this comprehensive reform to go forward.\n  What it does is exempt returning seasonal workers from the cap. That \nmeans there are no new workers. It means those people who have worked \nbefore and have gone back home are the only ones who would be eligible. \nIn other words, in the last 3 years, they had to have worked here under \nthe law, come in under the law, and returned home as the law requires. \nSo it is not new people. It is not an amnesty program. It is an \nemployment program for them and for us. These workers receive a visa, \nand it requires their employers to list them by name. So in all \nprobability, they will return to the same employer. Then, at the end of \nthe year, they will do it all over again. Remember, the only people \neligible are those who have used the program in the past--the employer \nand the actual person coming in.\n  I worry about fraud, too. So we have an antifraud fee that ensures \nthat Government agencies processing the H-2B visa will get added \nresources in their new sanctions. The bill creates a fair allocation of \nvisas. Some summer businesses lose out because winter employers get all \nthe visas. This will make the system more fair. We also simplified the \nreporting requirements.\n\n  I could give example after example of businesses that have been \nimpacted. Clayton Seafood started over a century ago. They work the \nwater of the bay supplying crab, crabmeat, and seafood. It is the \noldest working crab processing plant in the world, and by employing 65 \nH-2B visa workers they have been able to retain all of their full-time \nworkers.\n  The Friel Cannery, which began its business over 100 years ago, is \nthe last corn cannery left out of 300. When they could not find local \nworkers, they turned to the H-2B visa. Since then, that business is \nopen and thriving. Each year this program helps the company not only \nmaintain its workforce, but 75 Americans have good paying full-time \njobs in accounting and marketing and other areas, and it keeps 190 \nseasonal workers going and 70 farmers who would not have a cannery to \ngo to are also able to keep their jobs.\n  So that is what my legislation is all about. It is a quick and simple \nlegislative remedy. It has strong bipartisan support. It is realistic. \nIt is specific. It is immediate, achievable, and does not exacerbate \nour immigration problem.\n  Every Member of the Senate who has heard from their constituents, \nwhether they are seafood processors, landscapers, or other people in \nresort areas, know the urgency in their voice. They know the immediacy \nof the problem. Our companies feel urgency. They feel immediacy. They \nfeel desperation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment and keeping \nthe doors of American companies open while we also maintain control of \nour borders.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I, first, commend Senator Mikulski, and I see the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, and others who have been interested in \nthis issue. Am I right that the earlier numbers by and large have been \ntaken up primarily by winter tourism? The time for application comes at \nthe time of the year when great numbers are taken up for the winter \ntourism, which has happened historically, and what we are trying to do \nwith the Senator's amendment is to treat the summer tourism and the \nsummer needs on an even playing field, as they are in my own State, \nwhich are primarily smaller mom-and-pop stores and some very small \nhotels that need that. So this basically creates a more even playing \nfield, as I understand, between those who would be taken in the \nwintertime and those who need the help in the summer, No. 1; am I \ncorrect?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Massachusetts has accurately assessed \nwhat has created the crisis: that given the time of application and \nwhen they want the people to work, the winter needs then take up \npractically all 66,000. We acknowledge our colleagues who do need the \nwinter help, but we need their help for the summer help. You are also \ncorrect that my legislation would create a more even playing field \nbetween the two and, again, this is a temporary legislative remedy \nwhile we assess the entire situation of the need for comprehensive \nreform, how we keep American jobs, how we keep American companies open, \nand yet retain control of our borders.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Am I correct this is a rather modest increase in terms \nof the demand? In my own State, the numbers are approximately 6,000 for \nthe summertime. The numbers the Senator has are going to be nationwide, \nso this is very modest based upon the need. The final point which the \nSenator has emphasized, but I think it is very important to underline, \nis these are people who have been here before, who have gone home and \ncame back and therefore have demonstrated over the course of their life \nthat they return back home and are in conformity with both the \nimmigration and labor laws that exist today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator, again, has made an accurate assessment. \nThis bill is only applicable to employers and guest workers who have \ncomplied with the law. If a worker has not been here before and they \nhave not demonstrated that they have complied with the law, not \nreturned to their home country, they would not be eligible. That is why \nI say we need to help American business but keep control of the border.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for her response and urge my \ncolleagues to give strong support for her amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as many are well aware, the cap in \ncurrent law on the number of H-2B visas is too restrictive, and it's \nimposing needless hardships on many businesses that rely on seasonal \nworkers to meet the heavy demands of the tourism industry. Once again, \nthese small industries are facing a crisis this summer if the number of \nvisas isn't increased immediately. Senator Mikulski's timely amendment \nwill provide the much-needed relief they deserve, and I urge the Senate \nto support it.\n  For several years in a row, the cap has created a crisis for the \ntourism industry in Massachusetts and nationwide. Countless small, \nfamily-run businesses depend on the ability to hire more workers for \nthe summer season, and they can't possibly find enough U.S. workers to \nfill the need. Without this amendment, many of these firms can't \nsurvive because the seasonal business is the heart of their operation.\n  This fiscal year's allocation of 66,000 visas was exhausted just a \nfew months on into the year. Senator Mikulski will make about 30,000 \nadditional visas available, and it should be enacted as soon as \npossible, so that these firms can make their plans for the coming \nmonths.\n  Obviously, this amendment is only temporary relief. It should be \nachieved through comprehensive immigration reform. We all know our \nimmigration system is broken, and many other reforms are needed as \nwell. The Nation needs a new immigration policy that reflects current \neconomic realities, respects family unity and fundamental fairness, and \nupholds our enduring tradition as a Nation of immigrants.\n  Enacting these other reforms will take time--time we don't have if we \nwant to rescue countless seasonal employers around the country. Senator\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\nMikulski's proposal provides the immediate relief needed to enable \nemployers counting on H-2B workers to keep their doors open this \nsummer, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague along the Chesapeake Bay, Senator Mikulski. \nThis amendment would make minor, temporary changes to the non-\nimmigrant, seasonal visa program known as the H-2B visa program. This \nprogram allows small businesses in the Commonwealth of Virginia to hire \ntemporary workers for non-agricultural jobs.\n  As many of my colleagues know that for each fiscal year, which starts \non October 1, there has been a statutory limitation on the number of \nadmissions to the U.S. under the H-2B visa category since 1990. In \n2004, the statutory cap of 66,000 H-2B visas was reached on March 9. \nThis year the H-2B cap was reached much earlier on January 3.\n  As a result of reaching this cap for the second year in a row, many \nbusinesses, mostly summer employers, have been unable to obtain the \ntemporary workers they need because the cap was filled prior to the day \nthey could even apply for the visas. Consequently, these businesses \nhave and will continue to sustain significant economic losses unless \nCongress acts.\n  Our amendment helps fix this problem by making common-sense reforms \nto our H-2B visa program that will allow our small and seasonal \ncompanies an opportunity to remain open for business.\n  First, the bill would reward good workers and employers. Those \nworkers who have faithfully abided by the law for one of the past 3 \nyears would be exempted from the cap. This exemption will help keep \ntogether workers and employers who have had a successful track record \nof working together.\n  Second, the bill would make sure that the Government agencies \nprocessing the H-2B visas have the resources they need to detect and \nprevent fraud. Starting on October 1, 2005, employers participating in \nthe program would pay an additional fee that would be placed in a Fraud \nPrevention and Detection account. The Departments of State, Homeland \nSecurity, and Labor could use these funds to educate and train their \nemployees to prevent and detect fraudulent visas.\n  Finally, the bill would implement a visa allocation system that would \nbe fair for all employers. Half of the 66,000 visas would be reserved \nfor employers needing workers in the winter and the other half would be \nreserved for companies needing workers for the summer. This provision \nwould allow both winter employers and summer employers an equal chance \nto obtain the workers they desperately need.\n  Without these modifications, these employers will continue to \nstruggle in their efforts to find the necessary employees to keep their \nbusinesses running. Many in the seafood industry in Virginia have come \nto my office, looked me straight in the eye, and told me that their \nbusinesses are not going to make it another year if something is not \ndone soon. Only through passage of this amendment can this detrimental \ncycle be interrupted and these businesses can be saved.\n  Unfortunately, the only real opposition to this legislation is \n``perception.'' I have the utmost respect for those in this Chamber \nthat may not fully support this amendment. Their perception on this \nmatter stems from good principles. Illegal immigration has grown to be \na substantial problem in this country, especially in the area of \ndomestic security, and I agree that changes must be made to make our \npolicy work.\n  However, the temporary changes this amendment proposes does not \nbelong in the debate on immigration or illegal immigration. The H-2B \nprogram is a seasonal, non-immigrant worker visa program. In fact, it \nmay be one of the last programs we have to provide a legal, seasonal \nworkforce for our small businesses, allowing them to fill the gaps \nwhere domestic workers cannot be found.\n  More importantly, these changes do not belong in the immigration \ndebate because they deal with an economic issue. Over 75 percent of net \nnew jobs in this country come from small businesses. This amendment \nproposes changes to help save our small businesses. In many parts of \nthe country, for every temporary H-2B worker that is hired, two more \nfull-time domestic workers are sustained.\n  There are some criticisms of this program which I am sure some will \nraise. Let's take a moment and examine some of these mis-perceptions \nsurrounding the H-2B program.\n  H-2B employers do not do enough to recruit U.S. workers. They could \njust pay more. Virginia employers have not found this to be the case. \nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor set \nstringent guidelines on recruitment and wages.\n  First, U.S. employers must prove that they have exhausted all \nopportunities to hire U.S. workers. One H-2B employer agent in \nVirginia, who assists employers in this process, have told me that they \nhave already spent in excess of $250,000 on such ads on behalf of its \n300 plus clients for the 2005 employment season. This was out of over \n6,000 job openings for 300 plus employers in 30 plus States.\n  Even after this campaign, they only succeeded in locating and hiring \nless than 50 U.S. workers who expressed an interest in the H-2B jobs. \nThey were all hired, but unfortunately, less than half of these workers \nstarted work and even less completed the entire season.\n  In regard to the seafood industry, over the past 15 years, Americans \nhave slowly withdrawn from their workforce. It is common for motivated \nworkers to make $75-$100 dollars in a 7-hour day shucking oysters, \npicking crabs, or packing the product. Those in the seafood industry \nhave told me that despite this earning potential, ``frequently U.S. \nworkers will work for a day or two and then never return. It is \ndifficult to function on the uncertainty of our local work force, but \nwe never give up on them.''\n  In addition, the Department of Labor requires H-2B workers and U.S. \nworkers to be paid the same wages for the same work. Additionally, all \nof the same taxes taken out of a domestic worker's salary are taken out \nof the\nH-2B worker's salary; however, the\nH-2B worker by regulation are ineligible to receive any benefits from \nthe taxes withheld from their paycheck.\n  The H-2B program encourages illegal immigration; or, there's nothing \nmore permanent than a temporary worker, a long review of the management \nof this program reveals otherwise. The employers have successfully \nensured that the workers return to their home country. If they do not, \nemployers are not able to participate in the program next year, and \nneither are the workers. Most consulates in their home countries \nrequire the workers to present themselves personally to prove that they \nhave returned home.\n  Believe me, I am a strong supporter of efforts to help those \nAmericans who want to work get the skills they need to be successful in \nthe workforce. But these H-2B workers are not taking jobs from \nAmericans, they are filling in the gaps left vacant by Americans that \ndo not want them. Like I have said before, this program actually helps \nto sustain domestic jobs.\n  The future success of the H-2B visa program rests on the ability of \nbusinesses to participate in it, but right now, many will be denied \naccess to the program for the second year in a row. The amendment \nintroduced today helps fix this problem by focusing on three main \nobjectives to help make the H-2B program more effective and more fair.\n  These seasonal businesses just cannot find enough American workers to \nmeet their business needs. And ultimately, that is why this program is \nso important. Without Americans to fill these jobs, these businesses \nneed to be able to participate in the H-2B program. The current system \nis not treating small and seasonal businesses fairly and must be \nreformed if we want these employers to stay in business.\n  I congratulate the distinguished Senator from Maryland for raising \nthis issue. I have joined her as a cosponsor on this amendment. In my \nsome quarter of a century that I have been privileged to be in the \nSenate I have watched in my State the loss of the textile industry and \nthe furniture industry. Peanuts have disappeared, tobacco has \ndisappeared, and now the seafood industry is disappearing.\n  The distinguished Senator from Maryland and I have paralleled our \ncareers, and my recollection is there used\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\nto be about 150 oyster-picking and crab-picking small businesses in my \nState. If there is one thing about this legislation, it is for the \nsmall person operator, man and woman. I doubt if there is now more than \n40 out of the 150 or more picking houses remaining in my State, and \nthese folks have come to see me. They are very quiet when they come in. \nThey do not have any high-paid lobbyist. They come up themselves. Maybe \nthey take off their overalls, but by and large they come right in the \noffice in a very courteous way and they do not beg for anything. They \njust want to have an opportunity to remain in existence. Most of these \nsmall operations have been handed down from family to family.\n  Throughout Virginia, we take great pride in the Virginia crabcake. We \nare in competition with the Maryland crabcake. Now, I know Marylanders \nwill come over and steal the Virginia crabmeat to put in their \ncrabcakes. I say to my dear friends, the two Senators from Maryland, \nthey know that, but pretty soon there may not be any crabmeat left for \nthe crabcakes from either State to put on their menus.\n  Likewise, the oysters have declined, but that, I cannot say, is \nentirely due to this labor situation. It is more because of the \nChesapeake Bay and the problems we are having with the balance of \nnature. The oysters are disappearing for a variety of reasons, but I \nwill not get into that. Then a number of the seafood houses that \nprovide bait for fishing are dependent on these workers.\n  I ask my colleagues to listen carefully to two letters that were \nwritten to me, and then I will yield the floor. The first one is from \nCap'n Tom's Seafood. He states:\n\n       My name is Tom Stevens, I am owner and operator of Cap'n \n     Tom's Seafood located in Lancaster County in the Northern \n     Neck of Virginia.\n\n  By the way, that is one community I have tried to help because those \ncounties have great pride, but they do not have as strong an economy as \nthey once did. He continues:\n\n       I'm located less than 30 minutes from businesses like The \n     Tides Inn, Indian Creek Yacht Club and Windmill Point. These \n     business are large consumers of seafood. I also have many \n     customers in the Richmond area.\n       When I opened my plant, for years I tried to operate using \n     local help. However, it has become much harder to operate. \n     Not only is the local force scarce and unreliable, but the \n     younger generation is not interested, in learning the trade. \n     On holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas when oysters \n     are in demand, shuckers are nowhere to be found.\n       As you are aware, in this business, oysters must be shucked \n     and crabs must be picked soon after they arrive. I have tried \n     to get local help by advertising in the local newspapers and \n     through the employment agency without success. I finally got \n     help through the H2 B workers program.\n       Speaking for myself and several others in the industry, we \n     could not operate our businesses if it weren't for the H2 B \n     program. I can not emphasize enough how important this \n     program is for the seafood industry of Virginia. These \n     workers are reliable, hard working, and with excellent work \n     ethics. Their main purpose is to earn money to improve their \n     lives and the lives of their families in their country of \n     origin. I pay them as I do my other workers, not the minimum \n     I was told I could, but the top of the pay scale for the \n     seafood industry. I deduct their taxes including Social \n     Security and pay unemployment, even though they do not claim \n     it.\n       I sincerely hope that you will continue to support the H2 B \n     workers program and to strengthen the program by increasing \n     the quota. The future of the seafood industry is dependent \n     entirely on this program. It is important that our industry \n     remains strong and healthy for the welfare of the State of \n     Virginia.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Stevens.\n\n  The other letter is from Bevans Oyster Company, Inc., in Kinsale, VA, \na small community:\n\n       I am Ronald Bevans, President and owner of Bevans Oyster \n     Company. My company relies on the Federal H2-B temporary \n     foreign visa program to provide the legal, reliable, seasonal \n     labor which my company needs in order to stay in business. We \n     have used this program since 1996 to obtain fish packers from \n     March 1 to December 31. Our workers, for the most part, \n     return to us each year. Some of them have been with us since \n     we started the program in 1996.\n\n  And on and on it goes. One sentence in here stands out:\n\n       Our seafood business cannot survive without the H2-B \n     workers.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join with me to help these small and \nseasonal businesses by agreeing to this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter and other letters printed \nin the Record and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Bevans Oyster Company, Inc.,\n\n                                     Kinsale, VA, January 6, 2005.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am Ronald Bevans, president and owner of \n     Bevans Oyster Company, Inc. My company relies on the federal \n     H-2B temporary foreign visa program to provide the legal, \n     reliable, seasonal labor which my company needs in order to \n     stay in business. We have used this program since 1996 to \n     obtain fish packers from March 1 to December 31. Our workers, \n     for the most part, return to us each year. Some of them have \n     been with us since we started utilizing the program in 1996.\n       This year we requested 110 workers. Our filing agent, Mid-\n     Atlantic Solutions, tells us that our application is still at \n     the U.S. Department of Labor awaiting certification to be \n     used for the next step of the approval process. Although our \n     application was filed as early as legally possible, it did \n     not get to the Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS) \n     before the H-2B statutory cap of 66,000 annual visas was met. \n     Consequently, we will be unable to employ our H-2B seasonal \n     workforce.\n       Our seafood business cannot survive without the H-2B \n     workers.\n       I make every effort to hire American workers for these \n     positions, and have Americans working here wherever possible. \n     However, our experience has been that there is an \n     insufficiency of Americans willing to do the type of work \n     required for these positions. Generally those who are hired \n     quit within the first week. We have a loyal local workforce, \n     but they are getting older and their number diminishes each \n     year.\n       It is critical that you understand that without the help of \n     our foreign workers Bevans Oyster Company will have to shut \n     down and the American workers currently employed here will \n     lose their jobs as well.\n       I opened Bevans Oyster Company in 1966 and have owned and \n     operated it myself ever since. Over the years, my business \n     has continued to grow. When the need arose for additional \n     workers and I could not find reliable help in my area, I \n     turned to the H-2B program to meet my seasonal labor \n     shortfall. With the help of this program over the past eight \n     years, my business has grown and flourished and is now a \n     vital part of the Northern Neck community. This business is \n     my life. By suspending the H-2B program, the government is \n     not only preventing me from accessing my employees, it is \n     taking my livelihood and everything I have worked so hard to \n     build.\n       The lack of seasonal workers for our fish season will have \n     a domino effect on many other people and industries. Our fish \n     suppliers will either have to find a new market for their \n     bait fish or dock their fishing boats. Our customers, which \n     are located along the entire east coast and along the Gulf \n     from Florida to Texas, who have come to depend on us over the \n     years for their bait needs, will suffer from the lack of \n     product, causing their customers to suffer, and so on.\n       As you well realize, the Virginia seafood industry is \n     located in rural counties and provides many needed jobs for \n     U.S. citizens in these communities. The loss of Virginia \n     seafood H-2B workers will lead to the loss of the American \n     jobs the seafood industry provides.\n       I go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that my workers are \n     legally employed and that U.S. workers jobs are protected. \n     The wages I pay are above the prevailing wage for this area \n     and industry. I make sure my workers are housed in decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing. These workers have told me that \n     the opportunity to work in the U.S. has improved their \n     quality of life as well as that of their families and their \n     home communities. The money earned and returned to their home \n     country is an important contribution to that economy. Workers \n     build homes and educate their children. Without the H-2B \n     program, they would never realize these dreams.\n       My company desperately needs some type of relief from this \n     cap. I don't know all the answers. All I know is that we need \n     our workers, and they need us. Please keep the H-2B program \n     operating until a comprehensive solution to the immigration \n     issue is reached. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ronald W. Bevans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Little River Seafood, Inc.,\n\n                                    Reedville, VA, March 24, 2005.\n     To: Mr. John Frierson.\n     From: J. Gregory Lewis.\n     Re: H-2B Program.\n       Dear Mr. Frierson: Thank you for your phone call yesterday \n     regarding the H-2B program and our needs as an employer of \n     immigrant workers. This program has enabled us to meet our \n     seasonable labor needs for many years. Our seasonal jobs, \n     (crab picking, crab packing, etc.), are manual, repetitive \n     tasks--unskilled labor.\n       Regarding our questions about payment to these laborers, \n     when Little River Seafood,\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\n     Inc., hires an employee, that person, local or immigrant, \n     completes the necessary W-4 federal withholding form and the \n     State of Virginia withholding form. We withhold the required \n     social security tax, and federal and state taxes on all \n     employees. In addition, we pay the employer's share of social \n     security tax and pay the federal and state unemployment \n     taxes.\n       Though our pickers are guaranteed a wage of $5.25 per hour, \n     which is the prevailing wage, they are paid by the ``piece \n     rate'' per pound of crabmeat. Most pickers end up earning \n     between $7 and $9+ per hour depending upon how quickly they \n     learn, their level of ability, and ultimately, their \n     productivity. All pickers, immigrant or local, are paid in \n     the same way.\n       As our older local employees have retired, the younger \n     locals do not seek employment in this field. Because we are \n     stabilized by the use of legally documented H-28 seasonal \n     workers, we are able to continue in the crab processing \n     business, make crab purchases from our local watermen (some \n     of whom are students), and keep our local workers employed, \n     some on a year-round basis. Without the H-2B employees, our \n     ability to stay in business, keep our local workers employed, \n     and contribute to the economy would be severely jeopardized.\n       Regarding your questions as to recruitment of employees, \n     Little River Seafood advertises each year, prior to the \n     crabbing season, in our local newspapers. Response to these \n     advertisements has been minimal. Our local Virginia \n     Employment Commission is made aware of our employee needs, \n     and of course, because we are in a small, rural community, \n     these needs are also spread by word-of-mouth. Local response \n     is almost nil. We have employed a few students during the \n     summer for miscellaneous jobs around the plant, and, as \n     mentioned, we do make crab purchases from students that are \n     crabbers learning the business.\n       We certainly appreciate your phone call and your interest \n     in learning more about the necessity of keeping the H-2B \n     program in effect allowing countless small businesses in the \n     United States to remain in business and continue to \n     contribute to the economy.\n       Please let us know if we can provide you with further \n     information.\n                                                 J. Gregory Lewis,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Graham & Rollins, Inc.,\n\n                                    Hampton, VA, January 12, 2005.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner, I am in receipt of your letter dated \n     January 10, 2005. concerning H2-B workers for Graham & \n     Rollins, Inc. My two sons and I appreciate your timely action \n     in pursuit of reconsideration of our petition, however \n     painful, it apparently is not to be. It is a shame that a \n     small fourth generation family business must vanish because \n     our government has become so impersonal to communicate a \n     simple omission of just two names before closing the door and \n     rejecting our petition irrespectively of the consequence from \n     such an act. We have examined all options to save the company \n     concluding that we must by June or July obtain the Mexican \n     H2-B skilled laborers we have trained over the years. As a \n     final act towards this object, we ask if you would consider \n     sponsoring a bill similar in nature to the one you introduced \n     last year exempting returning H2-B visa holders \n     (beneficiaries/workers) from the annual FY 66,000 H2-B \n     program cap, or raising the cap to accommodate the needs of \n     entitled businesses that have been left out. We have reason \n     to believe there are many small businesses such as our own \n     faced with the same crisis, and congressional action is \n     required to keep those institutions whole. The H2-B program \n     was created to accomplish the work not being done in this \n     country because of unavailability of the domestic work force \n     to meet the needs of our work place.\n       Taking away the employees we have trained and become \n     dependent upon through this program is like sabotage. This \n     cannot and must not happen to the many small companies like \n     Graham & Rollins affected by the reduction of the visa cap. I \n     trust and hope you are in agreement and will expedite \n     congressional action to accomplish exempting the returning \n     H2-B workers or raising the cap. Please let us know as soon \n     as possible if you are supportive of this request and if we \n     can help by contacting our other representation.\n           Sincerely,\n     John B. Graham, Sr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                R Marine Construction, Inc.,\n\n                                  Cobbs Creek, VA, March 29, 2005.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       R Marine Construction, Inc. has been operating in \n     Virginia for 38 years as a small construction business \n     specializing in marine construction and excavation. We engage \n     in heavy construction consisting of building piers, \n     bulkheads, riprap (stone) installation along shorelines and \n     landscaping work. This type of work is not easy and requires \n     hard physical labor.\n       Over the years of operating my business, I have \n     continuously dealt with labor problems. It is very difficult \n     to hire domestic workers that are dependable, reliable and \n     are willing to do this type of work. I have hired some \n     excellent supervisors over the years but they can not work \n     without the laborers. We have frequently advertised in the \n     local and regional newspapers and also contacted the \n     employment agencies for job referrals. We pay competitive \n     rates and offer benefits to all domestic workers. We accept \n     employment applications year round and only receive a very \n     small quantity. Most of these applicants will not accept a \n     labor position or are not suitable for this line of work. R \n     Marine also recruits students for summer time positions.\n       We were introduced and participated in the H2B Program in \n     2000. It has been very successful to the livelihood of my \n     business and has created the workforce needed to meet the \n     work demand. The pay rates for the H2B workers are specified \n     by the U.S. Department of Labor. The wages are subject to all \n     state and federal taxes. These workers arrive in the spring \n     and return to their country within 10 months of their \n     arrival. They always return home within this time frame. I \n     have never had a problem with a worker not abiding by the \n     immigration policies. R Marine has had many of the same \n     workers return consecutively for the past 5 years and are all \n     legal workers.\n       If businesses are not able to acquire the number of H2B \n     workers needed to operate their business, they may be forced \n     to hire illegal workers. This will increase the problems for \n     the Immigration Service of keeping up with who will be \n     entering the U.S. and the security of our country. Also, if \n     businesses are forced to shut down or minimize their services \n     they provide to the public, there may be a significant \n     reduction in our American domestic workforce.\n       I thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. \n     Please continue to gain support for the H.R. 793, the H2B cap \n     fix bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Richard E. Callis,\n                                                  President/Owner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, if I could just say \npreliminarily, in order not to split the united front in support of \nthis amendment, I am not going to get into a debate between the quality \nof the Virginia crabcake and the Maryland crabcake, although I must \nnote it is the Maryland crabcake that has always held preeminence in \nthat discussion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object to that statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend my colleague from Maryland for a very \ninnovative and carefully reasoned response to a crisis situation. This \nis a clear example of legislative craftsmanship that addresses the \nissue and does it in a way that does not open up a lot of unintended \nconsequences or other possibilities. It does not constitute any major \nrestructuring of the immigration laws or anything of that sort. This is \nreally an effort in a very focused, almost laser-like way, to address \nthis specific problem.\n  The problem is the following: Under the administrative set up, an \nemployer cannot seek an H-2B visa until within 120 days of when it \nwould be used or exercised. That means that people who need summer \nemployees cannot come in right at the beginning of the year to seek the \nH-2B visas. What happened, of course, this year is people in the \nearlier part of the year--the winter people in a sense--came in, and \nused up all of the 66,000 visas that were available so people who have \nrelied on this program over the years to carry out their businesses \nwere shut out altogether. Of course, that raises very dire prospects \nfor the operation of these small businesses all across the country.\n  We have underscored the crisis confronting the seafood business in \nMaryland and Virginia, but innkeepers in Maine, hotel operators in \nFlorida, and businesses all across the country confront similar \nproblems with respect to being able to bring in these H-2B visa \nworkers.\n  This amendment maintains all the requirements that existed \npreviously. In other words, the employers must still demonstrate they \nhave sought to find American workers for these jobs. That is a current \nrequirement. That is maintained in this amendment.\n  These employers, some of them, have made extraordinary efforts to do \nthat, visiting college campuses, attending job fairs, exploring every \npossible way they can find workers. Many have gone well beyond what I \nthink has been previously required in terms of meeting that \nrequirement. But, they have not been able to find the workers. They \nneed these H-2B workers.\n  What my colleague, Senator Mikulski, has done--I think in a very \nmeasured way--is, if you previously brought in an H-2B worker and that \nworker has then gone back at the end of the limited time during which \nthey were permitted to come into the country to do\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\nthe job, you can, despite the fact we have now bumped up against the \nceiling, bring that worker or workers that helped you meet your \nemployment situation back in. No new worker would come into the country \nunder this provision who had not been here before as part of this H-2B \nprogram. So, in effect, you are saying to someone: Look, you have come \nfor the last 2 or 3 years as part of this program, so it is going to be \navailable to you to come again. And you say to the employer seeking to \nbring them, you can bring back that workforce in order to meet your \nwork situation.\n  In that sense, it is not an expansion of the general availability of \nthe program. You are not broadening who can partake of it. You must \nhave previously participated in the program in order to be able to come \nin again. I think that is a very innovative way to address the \nsituation. It will enable these small businesses to function.\n  It is important to recognize that it is not the functioning of the \nparticular business involved, but it is the functioning of other \nbusinesses, dependent upon the particular business that needs these \nworkers, that will be affected most. If you cannot do the processing of \nthe seafood, then the people down the line who depend on getting that \nseafood in order to do their business are going to be adversely \naffected as well. So there is a ripple effect that goes out through the \neconomy which raises the threat of having a substantial economic \nimpact, at least in some areas of the country.\n  I also want to underscore the amendment, as I understand it--and my \ncolleague can correct me if this is not so--maintains all of the \nexisting penalties that would apply to an employer who might \nmisrepresent any statement on their H-2B petition. In other words, \nemployers would still be held responsible in terms of how they \nconducted their effort. As I mentioned earlier, they are required to go \nthrough all of the necessary measures to ensure they have not been able \nto find available, qualified U.S. citizens to fill these jobs before \nthey file an H-2B visa application.\n  This amendment is limited in time. It is limited in scope, but it \nwould address the current crisis situation. It might not totally \naddress it, but we are confident it would do so sufficiently to enable \nmost, if not all, of these businesses to carry out their functions.\n  I think it does not raise larger questions and, therefore, because it \nhas been very carefully developed, I think it constitutes an \nappropriate response to the situation we are now confronting. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment. It does the job. It does it in a \nvery direct and focused way, and it will enable us to work through \nthese problems while we await general revisions of the immigration \nlaws.\n  This doesn't open up that particular path which I know would concern \nsome Members of this body.\n  I again commend my colleague for very carefully working out an \namendment. I know how much he has consulted with people in the \nadministration and colleagues here in the Senate. I very much hope this \nbody will adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief, but at the same time I \nthink what we have all said is very important to this issue. The H-2B \nclass of workers is a critical component to not just the seafood \nindustry of our coasts but to the resort industry of our country. For \nany of you who have ever skied in the West and met this nice young lady \nor man who speaks with a Norwegian brogue and they are helping you up \nand down the ski lift, my guess is they are class 2B. If you have met a \nyoung man or woman waiting on tables at a resort, possibly in Sun \nValley, ID, they are a class 2B. The reason they are there is because \nthey come, they build a stable presence, they are there for the period \nof time our resort hospitality industries need them, and it is most \nimportant that we have them.\n  Both Senators from Maryland have already talked about the dynamics of \nfirst that employer must seek domestic workers, U.S. citizens, and when \nthat labor supply is exhausted they must seek elsewhere because they \nsimply need that workforce. They come, they stay, they go home. It is a \nprogram that works well.\n  I am going to be on the floor later debating another program that \ndoesn't work well: H-2A. The reason it doesn't--and it used to years \nago in the 1950s; identified the worker and the work necessary and the \nemployer. We had nearly 500,000 in those days of H-2A, known only then \nas the Bracero Program. It was out of the great wisdom of the Congress, \nand it has not worked since. This one works.\n  But what the Senator from Maryland is doing is bumping up the cap a \nlittle bit. Why? Because we have a growing economy, and we have a \ngrowing need. It isn't a static workforce; it is a dynamic workforce--\nwhether it is the seafood industry, whether it is the hospitality \nindustry, or whether it is a stone quarry mining semiprecious stones in \nthe State of Idaho to be polished and placed in the countertops of \nhigh-end kitchens of new homes across America. That is the diversity of \nthis particular workforce.\n  She has identified it. She has recognized it. It is a cap of 65,000. \nThe cap for 2005 was reached on the first day of the fiscal year. That \nnot only speaks to the need but it speaks to the reality of the \nproblem.\n  The amendment is very specific. This amendment would temporarily \nexempt returning workers who have good records and play by the rules \nfrom the H-2A cap, protect against fraud for H-2B, protect against \nfraud in the H-2B program by adding a $150 antifraud fee, and on and \non. In other words, it has some safety checks in it, but it rewards \nthose who play by the rules--and most do. They come, they work, they go \nhome.\n  That is not only ideal for our country, it is ideal for these foreign \nnationals who can benefit themselves and their families by coming here \nto work for a salary that is, of course, better than the salary they \ncan earn in their own home country and working in conditions that meet \nall of the standards of our labor laws in this country. That is \nfundamentally what is so important.\n  My conclusion is simply this: This amendment provides a fair and \nbalanced allocation system for H-2B visas. Currently, many summer \nemployees lose out as winter employers tend to be the first in line for \nthe B's. That was already expressed, both by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and by others who have spoken on this issue.\n  I strongly support the amendment. It is the right time. It needs to \nbe done. We simply cannot wait. This is an issue that is very time \nsensitive. We can't wait until October to hire folks who are needed the \nfirst of May.\n  I hope that we move it quickly through the Congress and get it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield briefly, yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator made the point that this addresses those \nworkers who have played by the rules. In other words, they have come, \nthey have worked, and gone back. They have met all of the requirements. \nOf course, they pay taxes while they are here. We know they are here. \nThey are followed and documented.\n  But I want to add a dimension: It also addresses the employers who \nhave played by the rules by seeking to get their workers through the \nsystem legally.\n  Mr. President, I will read from the article in the Baltimore Sun:\n\n       Despite their frustration, the owners say they will not \n     turn to an obvious alternative work force. ``I am not going \n     to hire illegals,'' said one of the owners. ``It is against \n     the law.''\n\n  He made the point that they have done everything legally. This H-2B \nprogram is a win-win situation. The workers pay taxes, the Government \nknows who they are, and they get checked at the border. So you have \nemployers who want to play by the rules and employees who have played \nby the rules. This amendment focuses on them and gives them a solution \nto a very pressing problem.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Maryland for bringing that up. \nWhat he demonstrates by that statement is a system that works. But he \nalso demonstrates that the other Senator from Maryland has recognized \nthat when pressures build and limits are met, you turn the valve a \nlittle bit and let the pressure off and let the legal system work, \nquite often in H-2A.\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\n  Last year, 45,000 people were identified. But 1.6 million are in the \nworkforce. We had a system in H-2A that worked like this, and we were \nsensitive and constantly working to adjust it. And we wouldn't have an \nillegal, undocumented problem that we will debate later tomorrow or \nnext week. This is a system that works, but it also is one that we have \nbeen sensitive to and have been willing to adjust the cap so everybody \ncan effectively play by the rules and meet the employment needs they \nhave.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks by commending the \nSenator from Maryland for her work on this very important issue. She \nand I, along with Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, and many of our colleagues, have joined forces in a \nbipartisan way to address an issue that affects the small businesses in \nour States.\n  Many American businesses--particularly those in the hospitality, \nforest products, and fishery industries--rely on seasonal employees to \nsupplement their local workers during the peak season. That is \ncertainly true in my home State of Maine. We have many seasonal \nrestaurants and hotels that need to greatly expand their workforces \nduring the summer and fall months. Many of them, after fruitless \nefforts to hire American workers, have found that it has worked very \nwell for them to hire in the past foreign workers under the H-2B visa \nprogram. But this year all 66,000 available H-2B visas were used up \nwithin the first few months of the fiscal year--in fact, in early \nJanuary. The Department of Homeland Security announced that it would \nstop accepting applications for H-2B visas. This creates a particular \ninequity for States such as mine that have a later tourism season. By \nthe time Maine restaurant owners, hotel owners, and other tourism-\nrelated small businesses can apply for these workers, there are no more \nvisas.\n\n  My colleagues from Maryland and Idaho have raised very important \npoints. These are workers who often return year after year to the same \nfamiliar family business in Maine. When their work is done, they leave \nand return home to their home countries. They play by the rules. The \nbusinesses play by the rules. They are not hiring people who are here \nillegally. They are hiring people through this special program.\n  Without these visas, employers are simply going to be unable to hire \na sufficient number of workers to keep their businesses running during \nthe peak season. Many of these businesses fear this year they will have \nto decrease their hours of operation during what is their busiest and \nmost profitable time of year. This would translate into lost jobs for \nAmerican workers, lost income for American businesses, and lost tax \nrevenues for our States.\n  These losses will be significant. We must help them be avoided. That \nis why I have worked with my colleagues in introducing the legislation \nupon which this amendment is based. It is the Save Our Small and \nSeasonal Businesses Act of 2005. It would offer relief to these \nbusinesses by excluding from the cap returning foreign workers who were \ncounted against the cap within the past 3 years and to address the \nregional inequities in the system. It would limit the number of H-2B \nvisas that could be issued in the first 6 months of the fiscal year to \nhalf of the total number available under the cap.\n  By allocating visas equally between each half of the year, employers \nacross the country operating both in the winter and the summer seasons \nwill have a fair and equal opportunity to hire these much-needed \nworkers.\n  Let me emphasize what, perhaps, is the most important point in this \ndebate. That is, employers are not permitted to hire these foreign \nworkers unless they can prove they have tried but have been unable to \nlocate available American workers through advertising and other means.\n  As a safeguard, current regulations require the U.S. Department of \nLabor to certify that such efforts have occurred. In Maine, as in other \nStates, our State Department of Labor takes the lead in ensuring that \nemployers have taken sufficient steps--including advertising--to try to \nfind local workers to fill these positions. Indeed, that is the \npreference of my Maine employers. They would much rather be able to \nhire local workers. Indeed, they do hire local workers, but there \nsimply are not enough local people to fill these seasonal jobs that \npeak during the summer and the fall.\n  Comprehensive, long-term solutions are necessary for this and many \nother immigration issues. But we have an immediate need. The summer \nseason is fast approaching. Tourism is critical to the economy of \nMaine. But if the tourism businesses are not able to hire a sufficient \nnumber of workers to operate their businesses, the economy will suffer \nand American jobs will be lost. It is exactly as the Senator from \nMaryland so eloquently explained in her statement.\n  We need to make sure we act now to avoid a real crisis for these \nseasonal businesses this summer and fall.\n  I salute the Senator from Maryland for her work on this. I hope my \ncolleagues will join in supporting this amendment. This vehicle may not \nbe the very best for this proposal, but we do need to act. Time is \nrunning out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nremarks, along with her and her colleague from Maine for their advocacy \non behalf of Maine workers. We know Maine has been hard hit with many \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator DeWine of Ohio as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope the distinguished chairman of the \nCommittee on Appropriations would take my amendment or, at the very \nleast, have an amendment tonight. There needs to be a discussion on how \nwe proceed.\n  I note there seems to be no one here. I could speak on this bill, I \nhave such passion, such fervor about the need for it that I could speak \nfor an extended period of time, but I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is to be recognized following the last debate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I see.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My amendment is pending and I recognize the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma wishes to speak. The Senator from California has an \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was going to make a unanimous consent request to have a \nvery short statement concerning S. 359. I recognize your amendment is \npending, but I would do that through unanimous consent. This is the \nAgriculture Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator wishes to speak on another matter, \nperhaps as if in morning business, I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might, how long will this be?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the Senator from California, I could do \nanywhere between 2 minutes and an hour. Your choice.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would object since I have been waiting.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I can make it very short.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Two minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Three minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Perhaps I could clarify this, Mr. President. The reason \nI asked for a quorum call, reclaiming my right to the floor, is so the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I could \ndiscuss how we were going to proceed for the rest of the \nevening. Therefore, the Senator from California would know how\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nto exercise her right as the next in line.\n\n  So if the Senator from California could be patient for a minute to \nget clarification, he could be a time-filler.\n  Would that be a good way to do it?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be fine.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is a klutzy way of talking about it, but it is, \nnevertheless, where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will make this very quick. And I \nappreciate this very much from the Senators from Maryland and \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, I just want to get on the record.\n  Last summer, I had an intern in my office from Rwanda. I have been \nactive in Rwanda in kind of a mission thing for quite some time. She \ncame to this country 10 years ago after the genocide that was taking \nplace. She went through all the problems in becoming a legal resident. \nAnd, of course, she is going to actually become a citizen.\n  I have been privileged for a number of years to be chosen to speak at \nthe various naturalization ceremonies in Oklahoma. These people go \nthrough all of the procedures. I daresay that most of those who go \nthrough the naturalization process become better citizens than some who \nare born here.\n  Certainly, they know more about the history of this country. That is \none of the reasons I have opposed, historically, any type of an amnesty \nprogram.\n  Now, the one that is before us by my very good friend from Idaho has \nfour steps of amnesty in AgJOBS. The first one is a temporary resident \nstatus, so that this jobs bill states that upon application to DHS, the \nimmigration status of an illegal immigrant shall--not ``will,'' not \n``may be,'' but ``shall''--be adjusted to lawful temporary resident \nstatus as long as the immigrant worked in an agricultural job for at \nleast 575 hours or 100 workdays, whichever is less.\n  The next step is to take that same person and give them permanent \nresident status. The third step would be to make an adjustment not only \nfor those individuals coming in but also for the spouses and the minor \nchildren. So we are talking about opening that gate for many more \npeople.\n  Fourthly, the reentry. Now, this means if somebody left the country \nunder any circumstances, they would be allowed to come back and go \nthrough this process.\n  On top of that, another thing I do not like about the legislation is \nit does have a taxpayer-funded legal services provision in it.\n  So I just want to get on record and say this is something I do not \nthink is in the best interests of this country.\n  Mr. President, I do thank the Senator from California and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving my right to object, may I ask what the \nSenator would like to do?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What I would like to do is put forward an amendment. \nI gather there will be no more votes tonight.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, that is what we are trying to determine. That is \nwhat I am trying to determine. I would like to have a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, that is fine. I will not take long. I will just \nput the amendment in. I will not ask for a vote tonight.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \npending amendment is set aside.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want the Senator to know it is my \nintention to vote for her amendment. I obviously did not want it on \nthis bill, but since it is, it is my intention to vote for it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 395\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that text of the REAL ID \n      Act of 2005 should not be included in the conference report)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask that the amendment be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 395:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Senate conferees should not agree to the inclusion \n     of language from division B of the Act (as passed by the \n     House of Representatives on March 16, 2005) in the conference \n     report;\n       (2) the language referred to in paragraph (1) is contained \n     in H.R. 418, which was--\n       (A) passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, \n     2005; and\n       (B) referred to the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate on February 17, 2005; and\n       (3) the Committee on the Judiciary is the appropriate \n     committee to address this matter.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the clerk. This amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Brownback, Lieberman, Alexander, Leahy, Clinton, and Boxer.\n  As the clerk has read, it is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It \nrelates directly to the REAL ID Act. It is the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that attempts to bind the Senate conferees to oppose the REAL \nID Act in the conference on this bill. I would like to take a minute to \nexplain why.\n  First of all, this was presented to the Senate in February. It has \nnot yet been heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee. And, once again, \na very controversial bill will be considered in conference on this \nbill. It was put in the House bill in a preemptive way. It is there, \nand we have to deal with it.\n  I want everyone to know this bill is major in scope in what it does \nto change immigration hearings and much to do with immigration. It very \nmuch tightens the standards for asylum and withholding of removal. It \nwould give judges broad discretion to deny asylum claims based on the \ncredibility of the applicant. And possibly one reason alone could mean \na negative credibility finding.\n  It changes the statutory requirement that an applicant must \ndemonstrate to be granted asylum, making it much more difficult, and it \neliminates judicial review by barring a court from reversing the \ndecision of the judge or other adjudicator about the availability of \ncorroborating evidence.\n  It would give the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nthe ability to unilaterally waive all laws to construct the border \nfence, including possibly wage and hour laws, criminal laws, labor \nlaws, civil rights, and so on.\n  Now, the problem with this section--I happen to be for finishing this \n3-mile stretch of California border with a border fence--is the wording \nin this is so broad that it appears to provide waiver authority over \nlaws that might impede the expeditious construction of barriers and \nroads not just to finish the fence in Southern California but anywhere \nin the United States. And it would allow for no review or appeal of the \ndecisions of the Secretary of Homeland Security relating to this.\n  In terms of judicial review of orders of removal, it would limit, if \nnot eliminate, stays of removal while cases are pending. Most \nimportantly, it would eliminate, for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, any habeas corpus review of removal orders for both criminal \nand noncriminal immigrants. This is a major change. It would limit the \nability of the courts of appeal to review mixed questions of law, even \nin cases of longtime, lawful permanent residents, if virtually any \ncrime led to the deportation.\n  Further, the restrictions on reviewing mixed questions of law would \napply to asylum and claims under the Convention Against Torture. Now, \nhere is a section that causes great concern. I believe it does to \nRepublicans as well as Democrats.\n  The REAL ID Act appears to essentially create bounty hunters. Let me \ntell you how it does that. It increases the authority of bail bondsmen \nto arrest and detain anyone they believe is illegal, including a \nfinancial incentive by leaving it up to a bondsman's opinion that an \nalien poses a flight risk which necessitates them being turned over to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. If that is the case, the alien\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\nforfeits his or her bond premium under very broad circumstances. \nIllegal aliens turned over to the Department of Homeland Security must \nbe detained.\n  Now, this is at a time when immigration officials have not proven \nthey can detain all of the aliens they apprehend today.\n  What this does is, it says to the bail bondsman, if you think someone \nis illegal, you can go after them. You can maintain custody over them \nand you turn them in, and they have to be detained. This is on a bail \nbondsman's opinion of illegality. It also would provide bail bondsmen \nwith unfettered access to information on illegal aliens and to \ninfluence Government processes with noncitizens subject to bonding. I \ndon't know that we should be giving bail bondsmen this authority \nwithout any hearing in the Senate or any consequential discussion in \nthe House on this point.\n  It sets minimum bonds for aliens in removal proceedings at $10,000, \nand it prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from releasing \nanyone on their own recognizance who is in removal proceedings. We \ndon't even know if we can hold everybody. This particular section, \nactually more than any other, causes me enormous concern, and obviously \nthe cosponsors of this sense of the Senate.\n  It does a number of other things. It holds spouses and children of an \nalien accountable for an alien's involvement in a terrorist \norganization or activity, even if they didn't know about it. I don't \nknow that we should do that without understanding what we are doing.\n  With respect to driver's licenses, it creates a large unfunded \nmandate on the States. The CBO did a cost estimate of the costs \nassociated with implementing the driver's license provisions and \nestimated that DHS would spend $20 million over the 5-year period to \nreimburse States for the cost of complying with the legislation. But in \naddition, it would require States that participate in the driver's \nlicense agreement, which is an interstate database, to share driver \ninformation at a cost of $80 million over 3 years, to reimburse States \nfor the cost to establish and maintain the database. The grand total is \n$100 million over 3 to 5 years.\n  The just-passed intelligence reform law sets up a process whereby \nStates, the Federal Government, and interested parties will make \nrecommendations for establishing minimum Federal standards for driver's \nlicenses and personal identification documents. The REAL ID Act \nessentially countermands the rights of States in this process. Both the \ncurrent law, pursuant to the intelligence reform bill, and the REAL ID \nAct require that States set certain minimum document requirements as \nwell as minimum issuance standards. The difference is that the REAL ID \nAct eliminates the stakeholder process and proscribes a very \ncomplicated and burdensome set of requirements on States.\n  It also has differences between the intelligence reform bill and the \nREAL ID Act on the issue of driver's licenses and personal \nidentification documents. The intelligence bill gives States 2 years to \ncomply with minimum standards. The REAL ID Act gives States 3 years in \norder for these documents to be accepted by a Federal agency for \nofficial purposes.\n  Secondly, the intelligence reform bill requires that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and the Secretary of Transportation work together to \nestablish minimum standards for driver's licenses and personal \nidentification documents. The REAL ID Act imposes on States what must \nbe done.\n  I don't think we should do this. We passed an intelligence reform \nbill. We dealt with some standards in that bill. Here, without a \nhearing, without any committee consideration, this bill is put, by the \nHouse of Representatives, on to this supplemental and is in conference.\n\n  I don't think we should do this. The sponsors agree with me. So we \nhave proposed a sense of the Senate that would seek to bind conferees \nto eliminate the REAL ID Act from this bill. That doesn't mean it is \neliminated for all time. I also believe the Judiciary Committee should \npromptly hear the bill. We should consider amendments. We should be \nable to compare it in this house with the intelligence reform bill just \npassed and, therefore, make a decision. This is what the Senate is set \nup for. We are meant to be a deliberative body. We are meant to \nconsider major and controversial pieces of legislation and, if \nnecessary, slow them down. This is added unilaterally on this \nsupplemental bill with no consideration by this house whatsoever. It is \ngoing to resolve itself with a very few Members of this body dealing \nwith an enormously complicated, controversial bill that conflicts with \nother legislation passed by this body. We don't do our work if we let \nthis happen.\n  We have proposed this sense of the Senate, and I am hopeful there \nwill be enough votes in this body so that the conferees on the Senate \nside will simply not accept business being done this way. Who would \nhave thought a major piece of immigration legislation would be placed, \nwithout hearing, on this emergency supplemental which deals with the \nwar in Iraq and critical emergency matters? It is a big mistake.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and I understand the vote will not be \ntonight, but this will be put in the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 387\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As I understand the regular order, the H-2B amendment I \nhave offered is pending. I note that there are other speakers on the \nother side of the aisle but on the same side of the issue who wish to \nspeak. I note the Senator from Wyoming is here and he wishes to speak. \nI want to continue the debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is the regular order.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. I will \nbriefly tell of my interest and support for this idea. I am very \npleased to be a cosponsor. This is an issue we have struggled over the \nlast couple of years. Certainly it is not the overall remedy to our \nwhole struggle on immigration. However, this is something we do need to \ndo now that will last in the meantime while we work on the other.\n  Each of us who has spoken has a little different role to play in our \nhome States with regard to this issue. In Wyoming, it is primarily the \nsummer season, travel and vacations, Jackson Hole, WY, and other places \nwhere this has been a very important part of providing services there. \nLast year, of course, we were caught up in the 66,000-worker \nlimitation, and it was kind of unfortunate for us because, as I said, \nit was the summer season, and therefore, the applications didn't get in \nas quickly as they did in some other places where their seasons started \nearlier. By the time our folks applied, there were no vacancies.\n  I am for an overhaul of immigration. When we have the needs and we \nwant people to be able to legally come to this country, whether it is \nfor a short while, whether it is for a longer while, come legally, I am \none who thinks illegal is illegal and we shouldn't have it that way.\n  We have to look at the demands and then find a relatively simple way \nto work through it; otherwise, people tend to try to ignore it and go \naround, so that doesn't work.\n  These small businesses are in need of some relief. They cannot find \nworkers to do these jobs. The Labor Department certifies there is \nindeed a labor shortage in this case and they look to willing workers.\n  The Mikulski amendment is quite simple, as has been explained. It \ndoesn't count workers to the cap of 66,000 who have participated in the \nH-2B program during the past 3 years. It separates the allocation to \ntwo 6-month batches 2-year temporary relief. It collects new fees for \nfraud prevention and detection so folks who process the applications \nhave the skills and tools to identify fraud. We need to make these \nchanges.\n  I understand the difficulty with the bill that is on the floor. I \nthink the resolution is coming clear so we can deal with some of these \nissues and leave the larger, longer term solutions to another time.\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland and I look forward \nto a very positive vote on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \ncomments in articulating the economic issues facing Wyoming. I have had \nthe occasion to visit there myself and I know what a wonderful State it \nis. I am not much of a skier; I am built a little too close to the \nground for that. But this shows this is not only a coastal State issue, \nand it also shows it is not only a seafood processing issue; this is an \nissue that affects our entire country, particularly those who depend \nupon summer seasonal workers. We understand some of our States enjoy--\nwhether it is Massachusetts, Wyoming, or Idaho--both summer and winter. \nEither way, the Senator knows that we depend on summer workers. We \nthank him and the Senator from Idaho who spoke, as well as others.\n  Mr. President, I note that the hour is late and now that the Senator \nfrom Wyoming has spoken, I am not sure if there are other people who \nwish to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Snowe of Maine be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to get a vote on my amendment, \nbut it is not possible tonight. Therefore, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to support a cause which is essential \nto the continued prosecution of our war on terrorism. It is essential \nto preserving our National Guard and Reserve as a vital force in \ndefending our country, and it is essential to defending our moral \nobligation to those who defend our Nation.\n  No one--particularly those citizens who have placed themselves in \nharm's way at our bidding--should be forced to choose between doing \nright by their loved ones and doing right by our country. The amendment \nI have submitted will prevent that moral tragedy from happening.\n\n  What I refer to as the patriot penalty--the cut in income those who \nare called to active duty in our Guard and Reserve must suffer--has \nbecome a very serious problem. We now have about 180,000 Active-Duty \nGuard and Reserve personnel; 40 percent of the forces in Iraq have been \ncalled to active duty from the Guard and Reserve. The deployments are \nnow lasting longer on average than any time since the Korean war.\n  Since that conflict, it had been our practice to not summon the Guard \nand Reserve for active duty for more than 6 months. Today it is routine \nthey are called to service in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere for \nlonger than that period of time, making these deployments not \nreasonably anticipatable on behalf of these individuals and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, 51 percent--more than half--of the guardsmen and \nreservists who are called to active duty suffer a loss of income, the \npatriot penalties. The average loss is $4,400 per citizen soldier--a \nmaterial amount of money for the average American family. The General \nAccounting Office in a recent study indicates that there is growing \nfinancial strain on these families, even up to bankruptcy. It is \nmorally unacceptable. It is unacceptable from a national security \nstandpoint and from our obligation as fellow citizens that those we \nplace in harm's way and ask to make the ultimate sacrifice physically \nshould also be asked to make the ultimate sacrifice financially.\n  That is what this amendment would stop. It is hard, not just for the \nsoldiers and their families involved; it is also undermining the \nvitality of the Guard and Reserve and the essential role they play in \nservice to defending our country. Fully five out of six of the Reserve \nbranches did not meet their recruiting goals in the most recent period. \nGeneral Helmly, the head of the Army Reserve, has described the Army \nReserve as a broken force. At a time when we are relying upon our \nReserve and our Guard men and women more than ever before, they are on \nthe cusp of becoming, according to their commander, a broken force. We \nmust not let that happen. Of the 78 percent of these individuals who \nare considering not reenlisting in the Guard and Reserve, fully 75 \npercent, three-quarters, cite the loss in income as a material factor \nin their decision to not reenlist.\n  Many laudable firms in my State and, I am sure, in the State of \nMississippi, the State of South Carolina, and elsewhere, are doing \ntheir part. About one-third of employers are seeking to make up this \npenalty, the patriot penalty, on their own; 23 States are helping. It \nis important we do our part as well.\n  Our amendment would provide, after someone has been called to active \nservice for more than 6 months--therefore a period of time more than \nwas reasonably anticipatable--for up to $10,000 in lost income be made \nup for these individuals, meaning that more than 95 percent of those \nwho suffer this penalty would be made whole.\n  We provide incentives for the two-thirds of employers currently not \ncontributing to making up these penalties, for them to do their part as \nwell, making it a public-private partnership. The cost over the next 5 \nyears is estimated to be about $535 million. Given the scope and the \nmagnitude of the undertakings in Afghanistan, in Iraq, the costs we are \nincurring for so many other activities, including to try to train, \nequip and put into place Afghans and Iraqis to defend their countries, \nthis is well within our budget. This is well within what we can afford \nas a country, to do right by those who are attempting to implement \nfreedom abroad, to ensure that they can do right by their loved ones \nand their families at home.\n  Objections, of course, are raised to anything in the Senate. The \nprincipal one is that it will lead to an inequality of pay to those on \nthe battlefield, permanent Active-Duty personnel versus Reserve and \nGuard men and women who have been called to serve by their side. These \nare unequal circumstances. As I said, for those who are Active-Duty and \nhave made that commitment to our country, they can plan for that \ncircumstance. For those in the Guard and Reserve who have been called \nto service for a period of time that was not anticipatable because it \nis longer than any time in the last half century, they require and \ndeserve somewhat different treatment. I simply say, we do not call upon \nour Active-Duty personnel to take a cut in pay when they enter combat. \nWe should not ask our guardsmen and reservists to take a cut in pay \nwhen they do likewise. That is why the patriot penalties must be made \nup.\n  In conclusion, we should find it within both our hearts and our \nwallets to do right by those who defend our country. It is important to \nthe fight against terrorism. It is important to the preservation of the \nGuard and Reserve as a vital component of our Nation's security. It is \nimportant and essential that we fulfill our moral obligation to those \nwe have called to duty so that they can do right by their loved ones, \njust as we are asking them to do right by their company.\n  I respectfully ask for my colleagues' support of this urgent and \nworthwhile initiative.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I submit the following notice in writing: \nIn accordance with Rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby \ngive notice in writing that it is my intention to move to suspend \nparagraph 4 of Rule XVI for the purpose of proposing to the bill H.R. \n1268 amendment No. 398, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 231, after line 6, add the following:\n\n   TITLE VII--SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF SENATE ON WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION \n                              CONTRACTING\n\n     SEC. 7001. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 7002.

Mr. President, this debate on emergency funding for our \nmilitary wouldn't be complete if we did not begin to address the crises \nmilitary families face at home as well as abroad.\n  I am proud that the Senate has passed my two amendments, one to allow \nfamilies to stay in military housing for a full year after the death of \na spouse, the other to ensure all military families receive $500,000 in \ntotal death benefits when a loved one dies in service to America, but I \nam also deeply moved by the stories I have heard from across our \ncountry in the last 24 hours about the challenges to military families \nevery day.\n  Yesterday, I sent an email to Americans asking them to share their \nstories--of husbands and wives, sons and daughters, neighbors and \nfriends who serve their country with courage but have been left on \ntheir own by our policies here at home. Within hours over 2,000 \nAmericans sent me their stories. They took time out of their busy days \nto share their stories on the hope someone would listen. Their voices \nmust be heard in the halls of Congress. Today, I enter a small sample \nof their stories into the Congressional Record to prove we are \nlistening, and hope that today's victory marks a new beginning, and \nthat soon Congress will answer all their prayers and pass a \ncomprehensive Military Families Bill of Rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Alan Neville--Aberdeen, SD\n       This is a story about my own family. In January 2003, my \n     wife was called to active duty with her Army National Guard \n     unit. She was inactive status and a mere 7 days from being \n     completely out of the military when she was mobilized. She \n     went from being a civilian attorney to a Sergeant/E-5 \n     administrative clerk at a significant loss of pay. At that \n     time, I became a single parent to four young children for one \n     full year. In August 2004, I too was called to active duty \n     with my Army Reserve unit. I went from being a university \n     professor to being a Sergeant First Class/E-7. Once again, \n     our four children were without one of their parents during \n     their critical stages of development. We've done our part, \n     now it's time for others to do their part. The burden placed \n     on the National Guard and Reserve forces seems extreme. The \n     morale among more seasoned soldiers, those with 10 to 20 \n     years of service, is not good. Many are getting out of the \n     military at the first available moment.\n     Jack Cooper--Corpus Christi, TX\n       This is a story about a young couple in Austin, Texas. The \n     husband works for Home Depot and was called up in the Marine \n     reserves. There are two young children, both girls. One of \n     the girls has Job's Syndrome. Home Depot did not continue the \n     family's insurance.\n       They had to go out and pay ridiculous rates for additional \n     health insurance to cover the child. That was money they \n     could not afford because Home Depot did not pay his salary \n     while he was gone. The child was in the hospital for much of \n     the time the father was in Iraq. The mother had to take off \n     from teaching to stay with the child in the hospital. She \n     used up all vacation and sick time, and then was docked pay \n     for lost time.\n       We are not taking care of our soldiers or their families.\n     Doris Fulmer--Albuquerque, NM\n       I just lost my husband on February 11. He was a navy pilot \n     for 28 years. He paid on my SBP for years, and now I can \n     hardly get by, and waiting for the increase in October is \n     going to be difficult. I will have to sell my house to \n     survive. It appears they are waiting for us to die to . . .\n       Not enough is being done for the active duty veteran. I \n     don't see how the administration can be so tight with the \n     veterans and their loved ones while we wage war in a foreign \n     country and pour in millions of millions of dollars.\n     Stephen Cleff--Haddenfield, NJ\n       This past Christmas, my uncle was called into service in \n     Iraq. He has served this country in Vietnam and when he \n     returned continued to serve as a policeman.\n       My uncle is 58 years old. This is an example of how \n     stretched our armed forces are because of the current \n     policies of the President and his followers.\n       His current service not only required that he miss \n     Christmas with his family, including his father who was very \n     ill, but more importantly, it required that he miss his \n     father's funeral. His wife is now alone in their house, \n     waiting for his return. I do not know the specifics of their \n     finances, but I do know that they relied on his income as a \n     police officer.\n       I wonder how easily our current majority leaders would send \n     people into combat if they had to survive on the same \n     benefits.\n     Christopher Perkins--Burnham, ME\n       Here in Central Maine we have a young man, Fred Allen who, \n     like myself, volunteered to be a paratrooper and served in \n     both Afghanistan and then in Iraq.\n       He was grievously wounded in both legs in Falluja, a name \n     we all know from the news. He spent a good deal of time in \n     the hospital getting back on his feet and continues his \n     healing and therapy at home. According to his mother he is \n     receiving little in the way of compensation or direct help.\n       I can draw a strong parallel here with my personal \n     experience in the Army.\n       I enlisted in 1967 at the height of Vietnam and also went \n     Airborne. I served with the 3/506th Airborne Infantry \n     ``Currahees'' of the 101st Airborne Division in 1968-69. I \n     was a radio operator and then a machine gunner in the field. \n     I received the Combat Infantryman's Badge, Jump Wings, Air \n     Medal and the Bronze Star with ``V'' Device for heroism in \n     ground combat.\n       After my return home my best friend was killed in Vietnam \n     and I began to have serious problems with nightmares, \n     depression etc.\n       The army's answer at the time was a ``resignation for the \n     good of the service'' Sign here and you can go home.\n       In the 1980's there was a greater awareness of the problems \n     veterans were having and programs were developed, but for \n     over 15 years we were on our own. Many good soldiers didn't \n     make it.\n       Thanks to Senators Mitchell and Cohen I was finally able to \n     receive PTSD treatment and treatment for arthritis and a \n     disability award.\n       It is my greatest hope that our younger brothers will not \n     have to wait so long for their help. I once wrote a critique \n     of the PTSD program at VAMROC, Togus, Maine for Senator \n     Mitchell. This was my final remark.\n       ``We who placed our lives in the balance, and were not \n     found wanting, ask for no more than that which is our due, to \n     be treated with dignity, honor and respect.''\n     Pamela Goers--Romulus, MI\n       My stepson is in the Navy stationed in Washington State. He \n     finds it so extremely hard to take care of his family on his \n     pay that he was willing to volunteer to go to Iraq \n     [again] because of the bonus offered and how much his \n     family would benefit from it. This is just wrong. The \n     military men and women put their lives on the line for us; \n     the least we can do is ensure that their families are \n     provided for.\n     James Tate--Coon Rapids, Iowa\n       I have 2 sons in Afghanistan, deployed for 1 year duty with \n     the 168th Infantry Iowa National Guard. The younger has had \n     the misfortune of having his marriage disintegrate in his \n     absence and he has no assurance that his construction job \n     will be available on his return. The older has a contract \n     detassling business for 2 Iowa seed corn companies. This is a \n     very seasonal business and Mike has suffered a $60,000.00 \n     loss of income from the business. In his absence his wife and \n     I had the responsibility of keeping the business going but \n     the companies involved were fearful that in his absence we \n     would not be able to handle the number of acres he normally \n     completes. Consequently they cut the allotted acres by \\1/2\\. \n     Much of the fixed expenses of running such an operation \n     remain the same regardless of the total acres performed. \n     Normally the business returns approximately $70,000 above \n     expenses. Last summer the return was less than $10,000.00. \n     Besides, there remains a question of whether or not the \n     companies will make the normal acres available in the future \n     or if they will give them to the other contractors that \n     filled the void this past summer.\n       My wife and I raised and educated 11 law abiding, tax \n     paying American citizens. This administration has created a \n     situation that for the first time in nearly 70 years leaves \n     me ashamed of what my country is doing in the world.\n     D. Bottoms--Oregon, WI\n       My best friend Kurt Jerke, age 31, is a captain in the \n     Indiana National Guard. He was a Ph.D. graduate student in \n     the Department of\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\n     Biological Sciences at Purdue University. In his final year \n     for his Ph.D. degree, he received orders to leave for \n     Afghanistan. At this time, his wife Katie had just giving \n     birth to his first son. Kurt left when his son was only two \n     months old. Katie has been in a daze ever since Kurt left for \n     Afghanistan with managing her job, daycare and caring for her \n     child, while maintaining there house all as a single parent. \n     They're son, Cade, is now a year old. He's a walking, \n     talking, cute little guy. Kurt missed his son's first year \n     and Kurt still has no end in site. Kurt has no idea when or \n     if he's coming home. Kurt has no idea if he's staying in \n     Afghanistan or if he's going to Iraq . . .\n     Sandy Fox--Cleveland, OH\n       As a 6-year member of the Ohio National Guard, my son was \n     within one month of completing his obligation when he was \n     notified that he could not leave the service. He is now in \n     Baghdad, much to the dismay of the entire family.\n       He has two sons, ages 2 and 4. He discovered the week \n     before he shipped out for Iraq that his wife is pregnant with \n     a daughter . . . the first female in our family for quite a \n     long time. His wife is a nursing student who also has a part-\n     time job. Not only has his departure caused emotional \n     upheaval for the entire extended family, he was the major \n     ``breadwinner'' for his nuclear family.\n       Knowing that she could not afford to keep up payments on \n     their apartment, their vehicles, etc., without his income, \n     she approached the military for assistance. She was told that \n     there was nothing they could do for her. . . that she would \n     have to turn to her in-laws for help to sustain her and her \n     family while her husband was serving our country.\n       In summary, this poor pregnant woman is living in the \n     basement of her in-laws' home with her two sons because the \n     military and our government turned their backs on her. Their \n     atrocious treatment of the military personnel, their families \n     and our veterans belies all their public rhetoric about \n     family values and moral integrity. It's disgraceful! I don't \n     know how they sleep at night.\n     Kara Block--Jamaica Plain, MA\n       My brother is a lieutenant in the Marine Corps. He has been \n     on two tours of duty to Iraq and is about to deploy for the \n     third time, this time to Afghanistan.\n       Since 9/11, our family has been continually shadowed with \n     the threat of losing my brother on one of his deployments. He \n     was on the first wave of the invasion in March 2003 as part \n     of the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance that forged ahead to \n     Tikrit. On that first Iraq deployment, we did not hear from \n     our brother until it was time for his battalion's return to \n     the States. He called my parents via a satellite phone before \n     heading back, to ask them to wire $200 for a phone card to \n     call home from the ship that carried them homeward. The U.S. \n     government does not pay for its troops to keep in touch with \n     their families while deployed.\n       On his second deployment to Iraq, my brother called home to \n     ask for a particular kind of field binoculars, as those that \n     should have been standard issue to him had not been provided. \n     These binoculars cost my parents $500, and were obtained only \n     with great difficulty [incidentally, per Newsweek in 2003, \n     the average American troop spent over $2000 outfitting \n     himself/herself with safety and field gear]. For many other \n     military families, the purchase of this necessary safety-\n     enhancing instrument would be prohibitively expensive.\n       In January 2004, when much media ado was made about the \n     lack of armor in the Humvees contributing to many unnecessary \n     roadside fatalities from IEDs, President Bush made a \n     statement assuring all military family members that the \n     troops would receive proper armor by March 2004. However, \n     upon their return, several Marines Lieutenants informed us \n     that the armor did not arrive till June/July 2004; despite \n     the battalion's mission being to escort military and civilian \n     convoys--a highly dangerous duty that took them all over IED-\n     infested roads of Iraq. The Marines also cited a shortage of \n     flak-jackets on their first deployment.\n       The ordeal of enduring those long, dangerous deployments \n     (especially cognizant of the lack of armor/equipment) and \n     perennially bracing for bad news is too great to recount \n     here. Needless to say, these last few years have taken an \n     extensive toll on the health and happiness of this family, \n     which I consider as much of a sacrifice for this nation as \n     the military service of my brother.\n       Despite the outcry of his family against such things as his \n     inadequate training for the jobs with which he was tasked, \n     lack of armor and other safety-enhancing equipment [and \n     despite the acknowledged fact that he and his men faced death \n     at every moment at the behest of a president who lied us \n     about the reasons for war], my brother has volunteered to \n     extend his time in the Marines and to deploy for a third time \n     in two years. Were I a poet I would better describe my \n     boundless pride in him and all our troops. Heartbreakingly, \n     he and all the other troops who give so much for this country \n     ask so little in return.\n       We celebrate the heroism our troops with homecoming \n     parades, yellow ribbons and imposing bronze memorials. But we \n     as a country [especially in Congress] should put our money \n     where our mouth is and increase combat pay, grant our \n     Veterans adequate health care and other benefits, and take \n     care of the families of the fallen or injured (e.g., access \n     to good education for their children). THAT would be a \n     meaningful demonstration of our respect and appreciation for \n     their sacrifice. Our troops deserve no less.\n     Theresa Grof--Agawam, MA\n       My husband was activated in 2001 after 9/11. His pay was so \n     low as a technical sergeant in the U.S. Air Force Reserves \n     that we are now 20,000 dollars in debt and have no way out. \n     My husband has served his country many times, he is a Gulf \n     War Veteran, Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran, and an Iraqi \n     Freedom Veteran. He has 14 years in the United States Air \n     Force Reserve, but the pay is so low and the benefits being \n     slowly eroded away that he is no longer sure if he wants to \n     make it to 20 years. He sees his unit falling apart and wants \n     to stay but with cuts in benefits and our debts mounting (we \n     have also both attended college on our GI Bills during these \n     activations) that it just does not seem feasible to stay in \n     the reserves any longer. His unit is losing more and more \n     longtime reservists every week. The unit is becoming \n     undermanned and when they get a new recruit, which is not \n     very often, the person is not well trained enough to really \n     help. This problem of losing long serving military men like \n     my husband will affect the military's mission. Retaining \n     these men is important and passing a bill to help those of us \n     so in debt because of continuous activations should be a \n     major priority at this time. I am very proud of my husband \n     and I see his determination to keep serving his country but \n     soon there will be no reason to stay.\n     Mark Vaughn--East Greenwich, RI\n       I am in the U.S. Army Reserve and have been deployed 4 \n     times in 8 years. I have missed almost 36 percent of my \n     daughter's life while deployed. When not deployed I am an \n     adjunct college professor and, until recently did not make \n     enough to be able to afford health insurance. The only time I \n     and my daughter were covered was while I was deployed. While \n     I believe that is would be cost prohibitive to provide all \n     Reserve and National Guard soldiers health benefits, it would \n     be the right thing to do to provide them a health plan which \n     they could buy into (co-pay). This plan would cover them and \n     their families whether or not they were deployed. In addition \n     to providing the families of our soldiers, sailors, marines \n     and airmen a benefit it will also help keep them healthy \n     should they be called up. I believe that it would also \n     provide a strong incentive for recruiting. Just a thought.\n     Heidi Behr--Orlando, FL\n       I work as a social worker at a local elementary school in \n     Maitland, Florida. We have some kids in our school whose \n     parents are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. I know of many \n     families (some at our school and in our community and \n     elsewhere around the country) who are struggling to make ends \n     meet financially because they are not receiving adequate \n     compensation while their loved ones serve in the Armed \n     Forces. Many of the families who have members in the National \n     Guard are dealing with the double blow of loss of pay while \n     also now not having their husband or wife at home. I think it \n     is criminal that our government calls these national guards \n     up without compensating the family for their lost wages and \n     insurance. If a family was dependent on this guard member's \n     insurance through their civilian job, many times those \n     families have now lost health insurance. This is not right \n     and needs to be taken into account by the government when \n     they decide to call these men and women back into service.\n     Carrie Philpott--Eugene, OR\n       My son joined the Marine Corp in November of 2002. He \n     enlisted with the hopes that he would be able to fulfill his \n     dream of attending college and earning a BA degree in \n     Criminal Justice. Other than the GI bill, no other funds are \n     available to him for higher education He has just spent a \n     month at home with me after being injured while serving \n     our country in Iraq. He had the time to study his military \n     benefits package and look at what university he would be \n     able to attend. Imagine his disappointment and frustration \n     to find that his GI bill will only cover 1.75 years of an \n     undergraduate degree at a state university that doesn't \n     even offer a degree in his field of study. He has now \n     returned to his unit to complete his 4 year enlistment \n     only to be told that he will have to go back to Iraq in \n     Aug. '06.\n       Along with his physical injury, my son had nightly \n     nightmares, screaming out visions that could only have come \n     from his battle experiences. I wonder what else he will have \n     to endure for the price of an education?\n     Kathy Hartman--Loveland, CO\n       This is a story in reverse to what you are seeking. I have \n     a nephew serving in Iraq who works as a security guard for a \n     private contractor. He receives approximately $18,000 per \n     month and has all of the finest in equipment and security. He \n     received his training as a Ranger in the U.S. Army but now \n     serves as an employee of a private contractor.\n       My question is, why isn't every soldier employed in Iraq \n     able to receive the salary, benefits and equipment that this \n     ``soldier'' does? Why have we contracted some of this war out \n     to the highest bidders, using our tax dollars to pay some of \n     our soldiers a more-than-decent wage while our ``grunts'' \n     fight and die at minimum wage? I do not understand this \n     inequity except of course for the fact that we have now set \n     up wars and military expenses to benefit large corporations \n     even more than they have benefited in the past.\n       Don't get me wrong. While I do not believe in this war, I \n     do believe that all those in\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n     harm's way should be equitably compensated, trained and \n     outfitted. I would rather that all soldiers be compensated at \n     a wage befitting the horror and danger they experience.\n       Clearly the private contractors are able to pay generous \n     compensation in addition to making generous profits. This is \n     wrong.\n     Nada Smith McLeskey--Columbus, OH\n       I was married for 28 years to my first husband who for 21 \n     years served our country in the United States Air Force. He \n     continues today serving our country by teaching your high \n     school students leadership by serving with the JRAFROTC \n     Program in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our daughter served for 6 \n     years in the Utah Air National Guard and today our son serves \n     our country in the United States Air Force in the Special \n     Forces branch. Our son has already seen one tour of duty to \n     the Middle East. He is married and a father of 3 children. He \n     is an enlisted service member. His wife was forced to stop \n     working because their childcare far out weighed the income \n     she could bring home and the subsistence allowance program \n     was cut by the Bush Administration. They now live in base \n     housing but none the less, their income for a family of five \n     is roughly $2000 per month. By the time their bills are paid, \n     there is little left for them to buy groceries or enjoy the \n     luxury of maybe going out to a movie or to eat. I send them \n     what I can per month to help out. I know what it is like to \n     serve our country and have to live on an extremely tight \n     budget. My daughter in law would love to work so they can pay \n     off their debts and have extra money, but with 3 children \n     under the age of 6 it is impossible as childcare would eat up \n     all her wages. Thank you.\n     Doug Brewer--Tacoma, WA\n       My daughter is best friends with a 16 year-old whose father \n     is a reservist. He was deployed to Iraq, leaving behind a 12 \n     year-old autistic child, who needs the care of two parents to \n     even have a semblance of a quality of life. The father is in \n     Mosul, a very dangerous place, ostensibly for a year, but we \n     all know how that length of time has tended to expand. I \n     can't tell you how many tears this family has shed over the \n     father's safety, the one parent's frustration of raising an \n     autistic child (among two other siblings), as well as the \n     financial pressures of having the main bread-winner gone. \n     Why? For what purpose?\n     Katie Laude--Beaver Dam, WI\n       My husband is a reservist currently serving in Afghanistan. \n     He served his 8 years of military service after getting an \n     ROTC scholarship for college. After finishing his two years \n     of being a company commander he went on IRR. After September \n     11th he was given the advice to join back with his unit or \n     risk being ``cross-leveled'' into another unit where he \n     wouldn't know the troops.\n       Well, as it turns out, he did join his old unit again but \n     was still cross leveled to a unit in St. Cloud, MN (we live \n     in southern Wisconsin). We have three boys (ages 9, 6 and 1). \n     I had our third son after my husband had left. To make it \n     worse, I have NO family support group unless I want to drive \n     over 5 hours to the unit in Minnesota. I have had to hire out \n     virtually everything around our house (lawn, snow removal, \n     home maintenance, etc). After taking a year leave from my job \n     after the baby was born, I felt I had to go back to work. So \n     I am now working full time as a teacher and raising three \n     kids with no husband.\n     Linda Brown--Bunker Hill, WV\n       Our daughter is in the MD Air National Guard as well as a \n     full time college student. We still carry her on our medical \n     insurance. She has been deployed twice in the last 3 years \n     each time putting her education on hold. Her boyfriend works \n     full time at the WV Air National Guard but does not have \n     medical insurance. My daughter became pregnant but is unable \n     to marry her boyfriend because he does not have medical \n     insurance. There is no way she could marry him and then have \n     the baby with no insurance. I advised her not to, what if \n     something happened to her or the baby? We cannot afford to \n     pay out of pocket and we make too much money to qualify for \n     Government aid. We would like our daughter to be married and \n     she would like to be also. Her boyfriend has checked into \n     private insurance but at $800 a month they can not afford it. \n     My daughter served in Qatar in Operation Enduring Freedom as \n     did her boyfriend. He flies almost every week doing missions \n     for our government but is not offered insurance! It makes me \n     so mad, most of our government officials don't care about \n     healthcare for others because they will never have to worry \n     about themselves.\n     Gail Mountain--Gloucester, MA\n       Like a lot of stories about abuse and mistreatment, despite \n     the specific issue surrounding that abuse and mistreatment, \n     proving it is very difficult.\n       Nonetheless, I would like to share my suspicion of \n     mistreatment of my nephew as a member of the Air Force \n     reserve who lost his job in the U.S. upon his return from a \n     3-month assignment in Kuwait, perhaps a year ago.\n       He had been getting subtle messages for months from his \n     employer that his need for time off to accommodate his \n     military training was not appreciated.\n       When he returned from Kuwait, he was ``let go'' under what \n     I believe to me the guise of his inability to do his work.\n       He believes, and so do I, that he lost his job because of \n     the time it took for him to serve his country.\n       He will never be able to prove it, but I think we need to \n     also find a way to insure this does not happen to those who \n     choose to serve our country, yet still need to earn a living.\n       This young man continues to diligently working on his \n     master's degree and to take every opportunity to get as much \n     military training as he can so he can become a part of the \n     investigative branch of the Air Force because he loves his \n     country and because he wants to participate in the safety of \n     it. I hope a part of your work will be to also insure that \n     our reserves and our national guard are taken care of by the \n     country they choose to protect.\n     Sarah O'Malley--Castine, ME\n       This story is of a man in a town near by, the nephew of a \n     friend, a high school classmate. Harold Gray was in the \n     National Guard, the 133rd Engineering Battalion from here in \n     Maine. He was injured several months ago by a road side bomb, \n     getting hit with shrapnel in the head and shoulder. Shrapnel \n     destroyed his eyes and lodged in his brain.\n       Harold was in a coma for quite a while at a military \n     hospital in Washington. His wife traveled to DC to be by his \n     side, and his three young daughters are staying in their home \n     community with family. Harold's wife is a manicurist with no \n     benefits, when she doesn't work, she doesn't get paid. She \n     hasn't been working for months now. In every store you go in \n     around here, there is a coffee can with Harold's picture, \n     collecting spare change to help support his family. This \n     soldier's family is living off good will and spare change.\n       As a Guardsman, I don't know what kind of extended support \n     Harold and his family can expect. The best case scenario for \n     Harold's situation would be a full cognitive recovery, but \n     with total blindness. This is however, extremely unlikely. \n     Harold will live the rest of his life with shrapnel in his \n     brain, and the severe cognitive deficit that goes with it, as \n     well as the loss of this sight. As a Guardsman, not a member \n     of the Army etc, I fear that his family will fall between the \n     cracks, and through loop holes and bureaucracy not receive \n     the benefits (however paltry) that regularly commissioned \n     soldiers are entitled to.\n     Jean Harris-Letts--Middleburg, FL\n       I am a physician in a town where many of my patients count \n     on military benefits.\n       For Medicare recipients, most of the time both Social \n     Security checks go for food and rent, while hopefully the \n     service connected spouse will be able to get his or her \n     medication from the Veterans Administration. The non-military \n     spouse will have to get samples of meds or often go without.\n       My younger patients whose spouses are in the military are \n     in an only slightly better position . . . It baffles me how \n     anyone could countenance cutting military benefits in a time \n     of war, when so much depends on morale.\n       The patients to whom I refer are not deadbeats. They are \n     hard working people, who are just not being properly \n     compensated, and find only twenty four hours in the day when \n     they try to do more.\n     George Cleveland--Milwaukee, WI\n       I am a Vietnam era vet with severe back pain, lumbar/sacrel \n     facet degeneration. I was completely independent when \n     President Clinton was in office. When President Bush got in \n     office and reduced V.A. funds. They took away my pain \n     meds, which where 6-5mg Percocets and 2-10mg Oxiocotins. \n     It's gotten to the point that I can't walk with my \n     grandchildren anymore. I'm 58 years old and poor with no \n     other insurance I've talked to other vets with similar \n     problems. We've basically been told that we are not worth \n     the price of our meds. What's going to happen 40 years \n     from now when the vets from Iraq still need help will they \n     be forgotten to? Just go to any V.A. Hospital in this \n     country and talk to the vets sitting in the smoking area \n     and ask. This will probably screw me pretty bad but at \n     this point I just don't give a damn.\n     Holly Ortman--Fort Benning, GA\n       My name is Holly Ortman. Not only am I a nurse in the US AF \n     Reserves (inactive now), but I am also a spouse of an active \n     duty soldier in the US Army and a mother of 4. I am highly \n     educated and was working on my Practitioners Degree. I have \n     always stood behind our government and its decisions, but as \n     of late, I feel that my support is dissipating due to the \n     government's lack of support for the military families and \n     the military child. When our son was 6 months old, my husband \n     was given orders to deploy to Afghanistan with the 10th \n     Mountain Division. At the time I was an ICU Nurse manager at \n     the local hospital. At this point in our lives, we only had 3 \n     children. Due to the demands of being a mother of 3, one of \n     which was only 6 months, and an acting single parent due to \n     the absence of my husband, I had to step down as the nurse \n     manager and work in the ER as an emergency/trauma nurse. This \n     was very short lived because in the state of New York nursing \n     is unionized, therefore everything works off of seniority. \n     That left only night shifts open for me to work. Because \n     finding a trustworthy person to come in at night and watch 3 \n     children and get 2 of them ready for school the next morning \n     is so difficult I had to totally resign my nursing position. \n     Just so you understand the seriousness of this let me explain \n     that before I resigned, our family income was close to \n     $4500.00 a month. Because I could not work\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\n     due to the military deployment, our income fell to less than \n     1800.00 a month. This qualified our family for W.I.C., and \n     other forms of public assistance, which we had never needed \n     before, but desperately need now. During his deployment, my \n     husband re-enlisted for another 6 years. He is a very \n     patriotic man and he wanted to do what he felt in his heart \n     was right. We toughed it out and my husband came home in May \n     of 2004. Shortly after his return, we found out we were \n     pregnant with our 4th and last child. He then received his \n     orders for Fort Benning, Georgia. We relocated to Fort \n     Benning and upon his First day of reporting and 6 months TO \n     DO THE DAY of his return from Afghanistan he was told to \n     collect his CIF gear, he would be leaving for Iraq by January \n     and that they needed his combat experience over there. We \n     were devastated, as the birth of our last child was due in \n     February and we were hoping to financially catch up by me \n     going back to work. Due to the fact that my pregnancy was \n     high risk, he was allowed to stay behind until the baby was \n     born. He is now leaving for Iraq this Saturday. My career, in \n     a field that is in dire need of experienced people, will once \n     again be on hold, and we will have to scrape by yet again due \n     to the minimal amount the government pays my husband to leave \n     his family and put his life on the line. I was so \n     disappointed in my government when I heard that many wanted \n     to decrease the deployment pay. We are barely making it as it \n     is and without that pay we would literally be in dire \n     straights. Now there is talk of decreasing the amount of the \n     yearly raise to help the budget. Both of my oldest children \n     go to a military school and it has been a God send. They have \n     deployment groups for them and a counselor to help with the \n     transition, which was very hard during the first deployment. \n     These schools know how special a military child is. Now \n     Donald Rumsfeld wants to shut down our military schools. How \n     much more can you people keep taking from us before you \n     realize that we have nothing left to take? I cannot even \n     repay my government student loan because I can not work \n     because of his continual deployment and the government \n     doesn't pay him enough to keep us above poverty level. My \n     family has sacrificed so much and only keeps getting slapped \n     in the face by our government. My family feels so used. I \n     currently hold a commission as Major in the USAF IRR, which I \n     am resigning, and I have told my husband, we will find him a \n     way out. We just can't afford the price of your freedom \n     anymore. I am sorry but fine speeches and big talk cannot put \n     food on my table and bring my husband home alive. Thank you \n     for this chance to share this with you.\n     Richard Perez, Sr.--Las Vegas, NV\n       On February 10th, 2005 at 11:30pm in Al Asad, Iraq, we lost \n     our only son USMC LCpl Richard A. Perez Jr.\n       His story is on www.richardperezjr.com website.\n       The heartache will never end. My wife Rosemarie who had \n     been a senior sales agent for State Farm with the states \n     highest sales totals for the past 4 years is devastated and \n     has no more energy to even perform her job anymore because of \n     the loss of our only son.\n       I, Richard A. Perez Sr., Battle with this problem daily, \n     recently our son had signed with us on a very large home loan \n     which we thought would solve all problems as we have rented \n     for 20+ years and never owned a home.\n       We bought it with the pretense that Rich would help us with \n     the home loan and to build upon his career and life with his \n     own family as he was generating money in his management \n     position at Jack in the Box restaurant. The house has not \n     been built as of yet, but the looming cost of a home here in \n     Las Vegas is skyrocketing and a big payment is due soon. We \n     cannot afford to do this as our daughter is a student at UNLV \n     another a student in High School aspiring model and actress \n     and a third only 10 years old a gymnast in Henderson . . . \n     all girls who lost their brother.\n       I personally have lost my job and find myself on \n     unemployment getting 329.00 per week because I grieved too \n     long and could not perform my job at the level expected.\n       Costs run high, but our family has been ruined by a war my \n     son never intended on entering as he was a reservist and had \n     goals and dreams of his own. We still have not even gotten \n     our sons final report , we don't even know the details of \n     what happened? 8-9 weeks ago . . . He was proud to be a \n     Marine and we are proud of him, the little money the \n     Government gave us has paid his college loans at UCLA and we \n     are faced with the hardship of our lives being ruined, \n     because of Iraq.\n       My whole family has suffered during the past 2-3 months \n     since the accident but really the past 7-9 months we've been \n     stressed and it has affected all that we do daily.\n       What a disaster, what a shame that my own land of liberty, \n     land of the free has placed us in bondage for years to come \n     and has all of us reeling as where do we go from here?\n       I am a 7th generation American. My family tree is American \n     Indian, Spanish and Mexican from Los Angeles, CA. I grew up \n     thinking my country was great, my forefathers defended my \n     stance so we can live today. My very uncle Fred Perez sold \n     airplanes to Iraq and Iran as he worked for Boeing in the 60-\n     70s. My cousin lost a leg in the USMC in Vietnam. My Uncle \n     lost an arm in Korea and my wife's uncle died on the shores \n     of France during WWII. What happened to the American Dream? \n     Why, when my family and son defended liberty, do we now \n     suffer? People in NYC buildings were provided 2 million \n     dollars each so they could adjust to their loss. Yes, they \n     needed it, but we do too.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to H.R. 1268 \nwhich would require the Department of Defense to submit a report to \nCongress by July 15, 2005, on the Government's processes and policies \nfor disposal of property at military installations proposed to be \nclosed or realigned as part of the 2005 round of base closure and \nrealignment, and the assistance available to affected local communities \nfor reuse and redevelopment decisions.\n  This report will be of tremendous assistance to States and local \ncommunities affected by BRAC, and faced with difficult decisions about \nthe redevelopment and economic revitalization of their areas. The \nreport required by this amendment is similar to Community Guides to \nbase reuse, which were published by the Department of Defense in all \nfour previous BRAC rounds during the Commission's deliberations. These \nguides served a vital purpose for affected communities by explaining \nexisting Federal law pertaining to property disposal and by endorsing a \nproactive and cooperative relationship between military departments and \nlocal communities, without appearing to be directive in nature. I ask \nsupport for this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3548-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, inscribed on an exterior wall of the \nChapel at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France, are \nthe following words:\n\n       These endured all and gave all that justice among nations \n     might prevail and that mankind might enjoy freedom and \n     inherit peace.\n\n  Many years after the bloody battle on Normandy's shores and many \nmiles from those sandy beaches and jagged cliffs, Army 1LT Charles \nWilkins, III, of Columbus, OH, like the thousands of American \nservicemen who perished before him over 60 years ago, gave his life so \nthat others, too, might enjoy freedom and inherit peace.\n  On August 20, 2004, 1st Lieutenant Wilkins was killed near Samarra, \nIraq, when a roadside explosive detonated near his Humvee. He was 38-\nyears-old.\n  Today, I would like to pay tribute to this fellow Ohioan and to take \na few moments to remember him here in the Senate Chamber. You see, \nCharles--or Chuck, as he was known to his family and friends--was a \ndeeply devoted, unselfish man. He lived his life with a sense of duty--\nalways dutiful to his country, to his family, to his friends, and to \nhis job. Chuck defined the term ``citizen soldier,'' balancing his \nservice in the Ohio National Guard with his obligations to his family \nand his career.\n  After attending both Bishop Hartley High School and St. Charles \nPreparatory School, Chuck graduated in 1985, and enlisted in the U.S. \nAir Force. After his discharge, he enrolled at The Ohio State \nUniversity to study economics. While in college, Chuck joined the Ohio \nNational Guard because, according to his sister Lorin, ``He wanted to \nbe an officer.'' After earning his college degree, Chuck took a job as \na transportation planner with the Federal Highway Administration, \nbecame a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity, and began attending \nCapital Law School--all while continuing his service in the National \nGuard.\n  At any time, Chuck could have quit being a soldier and settled into a \nquiet life as a civilian. But, that wasn't the type of person he was. \nRather, Chuck was the type of person who always gave 100 percent of \nhimself. In addition to his full time job, his military \nresponsibilities, and his law classes, Chuck served as a peer-advisor \nat Capital for first-year law students.\n  As someone who also attended law school, myself, I know how difficult \nand time consuming study can be--and Chuck Wilkins was doing it with a \nhost of additional fulltime commitments! One of his advisees remembered \nhow helpful Chuck was:\n\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\n\n       Without Chuck, I doubt I would have made it through that \n     very difficult first year [of law school]. He was always \n     positive and upbeat, and he was constantly encouraging [us] \n     to never give up. We could always count on Chuck to lift us \n     up when we were down. It was important to him to make our \n     first year journey a little bit better by sharing things that \n     weren't available to him during his first year. I'm glad he \n     took the time to make our first year law school world a \n     better place.\n\n  Chuck Wilkins always made time for others. As one of his co-workers \nsaid, ``He was always looking out for somebody else, never for \nhimself.'' It was this sense of selflessness led Chuck to Iraq.\n  Chuck was a member of the 216th Engineering Battalion, based in \nChillicothe, OH. When his original unit was passed over for deployment \nto Iraq, Chuck sought a transfer to a unit that was scheduled to deploy \nin February of 2004. The new unit needed officers, and the Iraqi people \nneeded bridges and roads. Once again, Chuck gave of himself so that \nothers would not go without. It was hard for Chuck to leave his career \nand his law school studies, but as his sister, Lorin, said, ``He was \nArmy, through and through. He wanted to help rebuild Iraq so people \ncould have the same freedoms we do.''\n  As I said earlier, Chuck Wilkins wanted the Iraqi people to ``enjoy \nfreedom and inherit peace.''\n  Though his sense of duty compelled him to go, it still was hard for \nChuck to leave his family--the family he loved so very much. Like any \nmother, Natalie Wilkins did not want her son to leave for war. She \nbegged him not to go and to seek an exemption, but Chuck would just \nreply, Mom, I can't stay. I have to go with my men.'' While his deep \nsense of duty pulled him away from his loved ones here at home, Chuck \nremained a family man'' in every sense of that phrase. His sister, \nLorin, says that Chuck was always there for the family. She said that \neven with his busy schedule, if you called him, he would be there.'' He \ntook good care of his mom and dad and his sisters, always making sure \nthat his family was provided for--whether he was home in Ohio or \nthousands of miles away in Iraq.\n  Charles Wilkins, Jr.--Chuck's father--says that one of his last \nmemories of his son is of him swimming in a pool, playing with his \nnephew, laughing. That is when Chuck Wilkins was happiest--that is when \nhe was making others happy, making them feel safe and cared for and \nprotected.\n  We honor the fallen because they have honored us--with their service, \nwith their sacrifice. Charles Wilkins not only gave himself to his \ncountry, he gave a little bit of himself to everyone he met.\n  When Charles passed away, his mother said that the world lost a good \nman--a man whose llfe was bound by duty and good deeds. Our world is \nthe lesser without him, but it is also the better for the time he lived \non this earth. Charles Wilkins was a good citizen, a good soldier, a \ndevoted family man, and a compassionate human being. Everyone who met \nhim was touched by him in some way. He will be dearly missed.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his grandmother, Dorothy; his \nmother, Natalie; his father, Charles; and his sisters Lorin and Davina \nin our thoughts and our prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3549-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ALASKA-MONGOLIA TIES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and \nrecognize the contributions of an ally to the United States, an ally \nthat has contributed to our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and who has \nworked in close cooperation with my State of Alaska.\n  While their contributions have not received the widespread \nrecognition given to other countries, the nation of Mongolia has been a \nsteadfast friend of the United States. They have not been deterred by \nthose critics who deride the quality of the nations included in the \ncoalition forces.\n  Mongolia's contributions mean a bit more to the State of Alaska. In \nSeptember 2004, we marked the 1-year anniversary of the start of the \nAlaska-Mongolia National Guard State Partnership.\n  Through the State Partnership Program, a true friendship has \ndeveloped between Mongolia and Alaska. Our National Guard has \nestablished broad working relationships and increased exchanges with \ntheir Mongolian partners. They stand side by side with the Mongolian \nArmed Forces in Iraq as they participate in the coalition fighting the \nglobal war on terror. In fact, the Mongolian Ministry of Defense \nspecifically requested Alaska National Guard support based on Alaska's \nrelationship with their nation.\n  I would like to quote MG Craig Gambell that, ``[a]s long as the \nMongolian Armed Forces are willing to send troops in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, the Alaska National Guard will continue to \nstand by their side.''\n  Prior to 2000, Mongolia did not have a national policy of deploying \nforces beyond its borders. Yet, they were the first coalition country \nto contribute an infantry battalion to Iraq. The Mongolian Armed Forces \nare currently providing security to a logistics base in southern Iraq, \nescorting convoys, constructing military barracks, medical facilities, \nand local schools. They deserve special recognition for preventing a \nsuicide attack that could have killed hundreds.\n  Alaska's pairing with Mongolia in the National Guard State \nPartnership Program is fitting, given our similar geographic size, \ntopography, population density, and climate. The program allows \nAlaska's soldiers to work with Mongolian forces on professional \nmilitary skills as well as in military-to-civil and civil-to-civil \nareas. Beyond the teamwork in Iraq, other events have been coordinated \nto keep the partnership together for years to come.\n  Last year, an Alaska National Guard delegation met with Prime \nMinister Elbegdorj, as well as other senior level government and \nmilitary leaders in Mongolia. Already plans to send observers both this \nyear and next have been made.\n  The success that the partnership enjoyed this past year is a direct \nreflection of the willingness and eagerness on both sides to further \nour relations. The Alaska National Guard tells me that Mongolia is \nenthusiastic about their democratic reforms and is aggressively working \nto meet its goals.\n  I thank the leaders of Mongolia for their friendship and support, and \nI look forward to the continued success of this partnership between the \nLand of the Midnight Sun and the Land of Blue Sky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3549-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3549-S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMBODIAN KHMER NEW YEAR\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President. I rise today on behalf of my fellow Rhode \nIslanders to commemorate the 2549th Anniversary of the Buddha, the \nKhmer New Year.\n  This 3-day anniversary, which begins today, highlights the rich \nheritage of Cambodian Americans, while recognizing contemporary \nKhmerian accomplishments. Specifically, the New Year's festivities \ncelebrate the ancient dance, music, and religious traditions of the \nCambodian community. The event also provides older Cambodian Americans \nwith an opportunity to pass their customs down to future generations \nwhile simultaneously allowing all Khmerians to share their culture with \nother Americans.\n  This celebration traditionally serves as a respite between the \nKhmerian harvest and the weeks colloquially referred to as the ``rainy \nseason.'' Traditionally, the Anniversary of the Buddha affords \nKhmerians a chance to give thanks, reflect, and welcome the spirit \nTevada Chhnam Thmey. Also, in accordance with tradition, scores of \nCambodian-Americans will gather with friends and family to visit local \nmonasteries. While there, the Khmerian people will proffer food to \ntheir clergymen, pray for ancestors, give charity to the less-\nfortunate, forgive the misdeeds of others, and thank elders for their \nknowledge and care.\n  The Khmerian ceremonies and activities occurring this week \ndemonstrate that each year brings new opportunities for charity, peace, \nand happiness. Rhode Islanders witnessed the realization of one such \nopportunity this year. I was fortunate to work with Miriam Hospital in \nProvidence and Representatives Kennedy and Langevin to obtain visas to \nreunite Cambodian-Rhode Islander Minea Meas with his family. Three long \nyears after Minea received political asylum in our country, his wife, \nChantol Lim, and his children Monita, Sovannra, and Sinvath joyfully \nrelocated from Cambodia to build\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\na positive future with Minea in Rhode Island. Consequently, the Meas \nfamily will never forget the Year of the Monkey.\n  As we commemorate this important time, let us reflect on recent \ninternational affairs and our Nation's continued efforts to promote \nuniversal human rights and fundamental democratic ideals. Let us also \ntake this opportunity to honor the Cambodian Americans currently \nserving in our Nation's military, for helping to preserve the liberties \nwe all enjoy.\n  Finally, I would like to wish all Cambodian Americans happiness, \nprosperity, and good health in this, the Year of the Rooster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3550-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MAX M. FISHER\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, he was the son of poor Russian \nimmigrants who grew up to be a citizen of the world. He was a skilled \nbusinessman who devoted much of his time to giving away millions of \ndollars to charity. He was a modest man with a low profile who was \nsought out by world leaders for his advice.\n  America has lost one of its finest citizens with the passing last \nmonth of Max Fisher.\n  A former Member of this body, Jacob Javits, called Max Fisher \n``perhaps the single most important lay person in the American Jewish \ncommunity.'' If for no other reason, his commitment to the Jewish \npeople would have earned him the title, but the hundreds of millions of \ndollars he helped raise for Jewish charitable causes further \ndemonstrated his devotion.\n  Presidents Nixon and Ford turned to him to serve as an unofficial \nemissary to Israel during times of crisis in the Middle East. His work \nwas hailed by Henry Kissinger in his autobiography.\n  Though a resident of Michigan as an adult, Max Fisher was no \nWolverine. He was a Buckeye through and through. Max grew up in Salem, \nOH and attended the Ohio State University on a football scholarship. In \nhis time as an athlete the world got a glimpse of the competitive \nspirit that was to serve him so well in business. In one of his most \nfamous plays as a Buckeye, Max sacrificed four of his teeth when he \nsuccessfully blocked a punt with his face.\n  After his graduation from Ohio State in 1930, Max headed for Detroit \nand began his career as a pioneer in the oil refining business. Max saw \nthat the automobile would transform the nation, and he had the vision \nto create the refinery capacity necessary to run those millions of new \nvehicles. He learned the business inside and out and became a legend \nwhen he built another oil company--Aurora Gasoline and its affiliate, \nSpeedway '76--that, after a series of mergers, became Marathon Oil in \n1962. Twenty years later, U.S. Steel bought Marathon and the sale of \nMax Fisher's 600,000 shares added another fortune to his fortune.\n  Never content to rest on his laurels, Max's business interests \ncontinued. He had successful ventures in food processing and real \nestate, including as a partner in the purchase of the 77,000 acre \nIrvine Ranch in Orange County, CA, which was the largest private real \nestate transaction in American history at the time.\n  One of the traits of Max Fisher that I admire most is that he never \nabandoned his friends in time of trouble. When others might have told \nhim he had reason to do so, he remained loyal. After his friend Richard \nNixon resigned the presidency and entered a long winter as a political \npariah, Max reached out to him with encouraging words, writing that \n``history will record the great contribution you have made to the \nworld.'' He stuck by his friend Gerald Ford when Jimmy Carter narrowly \ndefeated him in 1976.\n  Some say that after Ohio State, Detroit was Max's first love. When \nriots erupted in Detroit in the late 1960s, Max did everything in his \npower to try to bring people of all races and faiths together. At his \nfuneral, a retired Federal judge told the story of how Max Fisher went \ndown to City Hall to demand the release of African American citizens \nwho were jailed for peaceful protests. Max never gave up on Detroit--\nand nearly everyone will tell you that without Max, Detroit might not \nhave survived as a viable urban core.\n  Max had the grace to see the innate value of people as children of \nGod. I always felt good when I met with Max. His honesty was consuming \nand he made you feel like you were the only person he cared about. His \nexample of giving generously and doing deeds of loving kindness \ninspired others to follow suit. No one will ever be able to calculate \nthe money that would not have been given without Max's example.\n  I will never forget the wonderful program that was held to honor Max \nwhen we cut the ribbon to open the Max Fisher College of Business at \nthe Ohio State University. I am sure it was a special moment for Max to \nthink about what it meant for the son of an immigrant to have the \nCollege of Business named for him at one of the Nation's largest \nuniversities. And as an Ohio State alumnus and former football player, \nI'm sure it was special to know that just a stone's throw away was the \nHorseshoe where he played football as a student. It was a fitting \ntribute to a great American who made a difference for his fellow man \nand country.\n  Like the Ohio State University's College of Business, the Detroit \nSymphony Orchestra's performance hall also bears Max's name. These twin \nmonuments to Max Fisher are a fitting tribute to a man who was a genius \nin business and every bit the passionate humanitarian.\n  Ours is a better Nation and world for him having been in it. Thank \nyou, Max.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3550-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EZION-MOUNT CARMEL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n200th anniversary of a true Delaware institution, Ezion-Mount Carmel \nUnited Methodist Church. Ezion-Mount Carmel stands as a testament to \nthe power of faith and community. It has survived through several \nincarnations to become a beacon of light in Wilmington, and a constant \nreminder that we can--and we must--triumph over adversity.\n  Ezion-Mount Carmel's history is as complex as one might expect from \nsuch a venerable institution. Its genesis was when the African-American \nmembers of the Old Asbury Methodist Church, unsatisfied with being \nforced to worship from the church's balcony, founded their own \ncongregation and helped establish the freedom to worship in Delaware. \nThat congregation would ultimately come to be known as Ezion-Mount \nCarmel United Methodist Church, and it has survived war, fire and \ncommunity strife with a clear purpose and mission.\n  Beyond its extraordinary past, Ezion-Mount Carmel is a dynamic force \nfor good today. One of Wilmington's community outreach leaders, the \nchurch offers numerous programs which have a real, positive effect on \nthe often troubled community in which it resides. As it has for two \ncenturies, Ezion-Mount Carmel continues to be a place of refuge and \nhope for those in need. It is where a congregation and a community \ngather to gain strength from each other and from God, and to continue a \nlegacy of remarkable achievement.\n  For its noble past, its exciting present and its promising future, I \nask that the Senate join me in congratulating Ezion-Mount Carmel United \nMethodist Church on its 200th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3550-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3550-S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SOO LOCKS ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th \nanniversary of completion of two of the four Soo Locks in the St. Marys \nRiver. These locks, completed in 1855, provide the link between Lake \nSuperior and the rest of the Great Lakes at Sault Ste. Marie, MI. These \nlocks have proved to be vital to the economy of the Great Lakes region \nas well as the nation as a whole. The locks, in fact, handle more cargo \nthan the Panama Canal annually. The history of the Soo Locks is really \nthe story of the settlement of the Midwest and the rise of the region's \nindustrial legacy.\n  Lake Superior is separated from Lake Huron by the St. Marys River. \nPrior to the locks, rapids made navigation of this river impossible. \nThe Ojibway Indians, and later white settlers, were forced to portage \ntheir small\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\nboats around the rapids to reach Lake Superior. Larger ships had to \nhave their cargo unloaded and then moved by wagon to the other side of \nthe rapids, where it could be loaded onto another ship.\n  In the 1840s, extensive copper and iron mining began in Michigan's \nUpper Peninsula, and several boomtowns soon sprang up along Lake \nSuperior's shores. Due to the lack of roads, all travel and trade was \ndone by boat. The increased traffic soon made it clear that continuing \nthe loading and unloading of cargo at Sault Ste. Marie would not be \npossible.\n  An act of Congress in 1852 gave 750,000 acres of public land to the \nState of Michigan for use as compensation to the company that would \nbuild a system of locks between Lake Superior and the other Great \nLakes. The project was undertaken by the Fairbanks Scale Company due to \ntheir mining interests in the Upper Peninsula.\n  Despite poor building conditions during the cold winters, the two \n350-foot locks were constructed within the 2-year deadline set by the \nState. On May 31, 1855, the locks were turned over to the State of \nMichigan and named the State Lock.\n  The opening of the State Lock decreased the cost of shipping iron ore \nfrom the Upper Peninsula to industrial centers like Detroit, Chicago, \nand Cleveland, by more than half. This, along with railroad \nimprovements, allowed Michigan's Upper Peninsula to fuel America's \nindustrial revolution. Michigan was able to lead the nation in iron \nproduction for almost 50 years. Even today, about 22 percent of the \niron ore produced in the United States comes from Marquette County \nalone.\n  In 1881, it became clear that new locks would be necessary to keep up \nwith growing traffic. Additionally, the State did not have the funds to \nimprove the existing locks, so they were transferred to the \njurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers, where they have been ever \nsince.\n  The current lock system consists of a total of four locks, two of \nwhich are shallower and no longer used. The other two, the MacArthur \nand the Poe locks, were completed in 1943 and 1968 respectively. The \nMacArthur lock is used most often and can accommodate ships of up to \n800 feet in length. Larger ships need to use the Poe lock as it can \nhandle ships of up to 1,000 feet in length. There are plans to build a \nnew lock in place of the two unused locks, but funding has not been \nappropriated. Common cargos that pass through the locks today include \niron ore, limestone, coal, grain, cement, salt and sand.\n  Today the Great Lakes shipping industry and the Soo Locks still allow \nmany industries to stay competitive. The Soo Locks shaped the economy \nof the Great Lakes region, and the engineers who helped design and \nconstruct the locks truly deserve to be remembered and honored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3551-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF KING'S DAUGHTERS MEDICAL CENTER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of Self-Help Enterprises. Self-Help is an organization that \nhelps low-income families build their own homes. Now in its 40th year, \nSelf-Help Enterprises has been instrumental in building over 5,000 new \nhomes in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  As its name implies, Self-Help aids families that try to help \nthemselves. The mission of Self-Help Enterprises stresses that of \npersonal responsibility, pride in ownership and community. Through its \nvarious programs Self-Help not only helps to build houses, it builds \ncommunities.\n  To qualify for help a family must demonstrate that it is committed to \nbuilding their own home and that it is dedicated to helping others in \nthe community. In this way, Self-Help ensures that a sense of community \nis built. Families receive counseling through every step of the home \nbuilding process and are taught, not shown, how to build a house so \nthat they may take pride in their work. Each family must contribute at \nleast 40 hours of ``sweat equity'' a week towards building their home, \nwith a total of 1,300-1,500 hours of labor. Self-Help calls this sweat \nequity the family's down payment. Families are organized into groups of \n10 or 12. From these groups families work to build each others' homes. \nThrough cooperative work Self-Help Enterprises helps an average of 150 \nfamilies build homes each year.\n  Self-Help Enterprises also works on Community Development Projects \ndesigned to improve the infrastructure present in low-income \nneighborhoods. Similarly, Self-Help rehabilitates older homes to help \nfamilies keep homes that may be run-down, and makes homes safer to live \nin. To date, Self-Help has rehabilitated 5,000 homes, renovated 20,000 \nwater and sewer connections, and weather-proofed 40,000 homes.\n  Self-Help understands the importance of providing affordable housing \nto families. For families who cannot own a home, Self-Help develops \nmulti-family housing projects and establishes rent levels and financing \nplans to give low-income families a chance to raise their children in a \nsafe and secure environment.\n  In its mission statement, Self-Help Enterprises states that all \nfamilies really need is ``someone to bridge the gulf between dreams and \nreality.'' Self-Help is that bridge. I congratulate Self-Help \nEnterprises on their 40th anniversary and wish them many more years of \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3551-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3551-S3552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HABITAT FOR HUMANITY, FRESNO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 20th anniversary of Habitat for Humanity, Fresno.\n  Habitat for Humanity, Fresno was formed in 1985. For the past 20 \nyears, Habitat for Humanity has been a champion in the community on \nbehalf of those who cannot afford homes. The mission of Habitat for \nHumanity is to end poverty housing ``by uniting individuals, families \nand communities to build decent, affordable housing.''\n  Since its inception, Habitat for Humanity, Fresno has helped build \nover 35 homes. The process through which it helps to build homes \ndemonstrates its dedication to its mission. Habitat for Humanity \nstresses that it does not build homes for families. It facilitates the \nbuilding of homes. While the difference may seem slight, it is in fact \none of the sources of success for this organization. To qualify for aid \nfrom Habitat for Humanity, families must show that they are invested in \nbuilding a home. This investment, or dedication, will serve as the \nfoundation from which a house is built.\n  Habitat for Humanity chooses its families regardless of ethnicity. It \nprovides aid to low income families who show a willingness to partner \nwith the community. This willingness to partner serves to perpetuate an \naltruistic sense of participation and involvement within the community. \nAnd indeed, Habitat for Humanity is fueled by the dedication and \ngoodwill of volunteers.\n  Since 1985, Habitat for Humanity has hosted over 7,000 volunteers. \nThese volunteers range in age, ethnicity, gender and occupation. The \ndiverse background of these volunteers is representative of the far \nreach that Habitat for Humanity has in the community.\n  The homes they construct are built with the love, strength and \ndedication of a community. The mission of Habitat for Humanity goes far \nbeyond\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\nmerely building houses. Through its work in the community Habitat for \nHumanity not only builds houses, it builds strength within the \ncommunity and confidence in its recipients.\n  I congratulate Habitat for Humanity, Fresno on the celebration of its \n20th anniversary and wish them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3552-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3552-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3552-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:50 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 18.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 769. A bill to enhance compliance assistance for small businesses; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, regulatory fairness remains one of my \ntop priorities. In 1996, I was pleased to support, along with all of my \ncolleagues, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, \nSBREFA, which made the Regulatory Flexibility Act more effective in \ncurtailing the impact of regulations on small businesses. One of the \nmost important provisions of SBREFA compels agencies to produce \ncompliance assistance materials to help small businesses satisfy the \nrequirements of agency regulations. Unfortunately, over the years, \nagencies have failed to achieve this requirement. Consequently, small \nbusinesses have been forced to figure out on their own how to comply \nwith these regulations. This makes compliance that much more difficult \nto achieve, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of the regulations.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, found that agencies have \nignored this requirement or failed miserably in their attempts to \nsatisfy it. The GAO also found that SBREFA's language is unclear in \nsome places about what is actually required. That is why today, I am \nintroducing The Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of \n2005, to close those loopholes, and to make it clear that we were \nserious when we first told agencies, and that we want them to produce \nquality compliance assistance materials to help small businesses \nunderstand how to deal with regulations.\n  My bill is drawn directly from the GAO recommendations and is \nintended only to clarify an already existing requirement--not to add \nanything new. Similarly, the compliance guides that the agencies will \nproduce will be suggestions about how to satisfy a regulation's \nrequirements, and will not impose further requirements or additional \nenforcement measures. Nor does this bill, in any way, interfere or \nundercut agencies' ability to enforce their regulations to the full \nextent they currently enjoy. Bad actors must be brought to justice, but \nif the only trigger for compliance is the threat of enforcement, then \nagencies will never achieve the goals at which their regulations are \ndirected.\n  The key to helping small businesses comply with these regulations is \nto provide assistance--showing them what is necessary and how they will \nbe able to tell when they have met their obligations. Too often, small \nbusinesses do not maintain the staff, or possess the resources to \nanswer these questions. This is a disadvantage when compared to larger \nbusinesses, and reduces the effectiveness of the agency's regulations. \nThe SBA's Office of Advocacy has determined that regulatory compliance \ncosts small businesses with less than 20 employees almost $7,000 per \nemployee, compared to almost $4,500 for companies with more than 500 \nemployees. If an agency can not describe how to comply with its \nregulation, how can we expect a small business to figure it out? This \nis the reason the requirement to provide compliance assistance was \noriginally included in SBREFA. That reason is as valid today as it was \nin 1996.\n  Specifically, my bill would do the following:\n  Clarify how a guide shall be designated: Section 212 of SBREFA \ncurrently requires that agencies ``designate'' the publications \nprepared under the section as small entity compliance guides. However, \nthe form in which those designations should occur is not clear. \nConsistent use of the phrase ``Small Entity Compliance Guide'' in the \ntitle could make it easier for small entities to locate the guides that \nthe agencies develop. This would also aid in using on line searches--a \ntechnology that was not widely used when SBREFA was passed. Thus, \nagencies would be directed to publish guides entitled ``Small Entity \nCompliance Guide.''\n  Clarify how a guide shall be published: Section 212 currently states \nagencies ``shall publish'' the guides, but does not indicate where or \nhow they should be published. At least one agency has published the \nguides as part of the preamble to the subject rule, thereby requiring \naffected small entities to read the Federal Register to obtain the \nguides. Agencies would be directed, at a minimum, to make their \ncompliance guides available through their websites in an easily \naccessible way. In addition, agencies would be directed to forward \ntheir compliance guides to known industry contacts such as small \nbusinesses or associations with small business members that will be \naffected by the regulation.\n  Clarify when a guide shall be published: Section 212 does not \nindicate when the compliance guides should be published. Therefore, \neven if an agency is required to produce a compliance guide, it can \nclaim that it has not violated the publishing requirement because there \nis no clear deadline. Agencies would be instructed to publish the \ncompliance guides simultaneously with, or as soon as possible after, \nthe final rule is published, provided that the guides must be published \nno later than the effective date of the rule's compliance requirements.\n  Clarify the term ``compliance requirements'': The term ``compliance \nrequirements'' also needs to be clarified. At a minimum, compliance \nrequirements must identify what small\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\nbusinesses must do to satisfy the requirements and how they will know \nthat they have met these requirements. This should include a \ndescription of the procedures a small business might use to meet the \nrequirements. For example, if, as is the case with many OSHA and EPA \nregulations, testing is required, the agency should explain how that \ntesting might be conducted. The bill makes clear that the procedural \ndescription should be merely suggestive--an agency would not be able to \nenforce this procedure if a small business was able to satisfy the \nrequirements through a different approach.\n  It is time we get serious about ensuring that small businesses have \nthe assistance they need to deal with the maze of Federal regulations \nwe expect them to handle on a daily basis. The Small Business \nCompliance Assistance Enhancement Act of 2005 will make a significant \ncontribution to that effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Compliance \n     Assistance Enhancement Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all \n     employers, employ half of all private sector employees, and \n     pay 44.3 percent of total United States private payroll.\n       (2) Small businesses generated 60 to 80 percent of net new \n     jobs annually over the last decade.\n       (3) Very small firms with fewer than 20 employees spend 60 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms to comply with \n     Federal regulations. Small firms spend twice as much on tax \n     compliance as their larger counterparts. Based on an analysis \n     in 2001, firms employing fewer than 20 employees face an \n     annual regulatory burden of nearly $7,000 per employee, \n     compared to a burden of almost $4,500 per employee for a firm \n     with over 500 employees.\n       (4) Section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) requires \n     agencies to produce small entity compliance guides for each \n     rule or group of rules for which an agency is required to \n     prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section \n     604 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (5) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n     agencies have rarely attempted to comply with section 212 of \n     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note). When agencies did try to comply \n     with that requirement, they generally did not produce \n     adequate compliance assistance materials.\n       (6) The Government Accountability Office also found that \n     section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) and other sections \n     of that Act need clarification to be effective.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To clarify the requirement contained in section 212 of \n     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) for agencies to produce small entity \n     compliance guides.\n       (2) To clarify other terms relating to the requirement in \n     section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note).\n       (3) To ensure that agencies produce adequate and useful \n     compliance assistance materials to help small businesses meet \n     the obligations imposed by regulations affecting such small \n     businesses, and to increase compliance with these \n     regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENHANCED COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 212 of the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 \n     note) is amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) Compliance Guide.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For each rule or group of related rules \n     for which an agency is required to prepare a final regulatory \n     flexibility analysis under section 605(b) of title 5, United \n     States Code, the agency shall publish 1 or more guides to \n     assist small entities in complying with the rule and shall \n     entitle such publications `small entity compliance guides'.\n       ``(2) Publication of guides.--The publication of each guide \n     under this subsection shall include--\n       ``(A) the posting of the guide in an easily identified \n     location on the website of the agency; and\n       ``(B) distribution of the guide to known industry contacts, \n     such as small entities, associations, or industry leaders \n     affected by the rule.\n       ``(3) Publication date.--An agency shall publish each guide \n     (including the posting and distribution of the guide as \n     described under paragraph (2))--\n       ``(A) on the same date as the date of publication of the \n     final rule (or as soon as possible after that date); and\n       ``(B) not later than the date on which the requirements of \n     that rule become effective.\n       ``(4) Compliance actions.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each guide shall explain the actions a \n     small entity is required to take to comply with a rule.\n       ``(B) Explanation.--The explanation under subparagraph \n     (A)--\n       ``(i) shall include a description of actions needed to meet \n     the requirements of a rule, to enable a small entity to know \n     when such requirements are met; and\n       ``(ii) if determined appropriate by the agency, may include \n     a description of possible procedures, such as conducting \n     tests, that may assist a small entity in meeting such \n     requirements.\n       ``(C) Procedures.--Procedures described under subparagraph \n     (B)(ii)--\n       ``(i) shall be suggestions to assist small entities; and\n       ``(ii) shall not be additional requirements relating to the \n     rule.\n       ``(5) Agency preparation of guides.--The agency shall, in \n     its sole discretion, taking into account the subject matter \n     of the rule and the language of relevant statutes, ensure \n     that the guide is written using sufficiently plain language \n     likely to be understood by affected small entities.

A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention \nand Control Act of 1990 to reauthorize and improve that Act; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins and I are very pleased to introduce the National Aquatic \nInvasive Species Act of 2005. This bill, which reauthorizes the \nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, takes a \ncomprehensive approach towards addressing aquatic nuisance species to \nprotect the nation's aquatic ecosystems. Invasive species are not a new \nproblem for this country, but what is so important about this bill is \nthat this is the first real effort to take a comprehensive approach \ntoward the problem of aquatic invasive species. The bill deals with the \nprevention of introductions, the screening of new aquatic organisms \nthat do come into the country, the rapid response to invasions, and the \nresearch to implement the provisions of this bill.\n  During the development of this country, there were more than people \nimmigrating to this country. More than 6,500 non-indigenous invasive \nspecies have been introduced into the United States and have become \nestablished, self-sustaining populations. These species--from \nmicroorganisms to mollusks, from pathogens to plants, from insects to \nfish to animals--typically encounter few, if any, natural enemies in \ntheir new environments and wreak havoc on native species. Aquatic \nnuisance species threaten biodiversity nationwide, especially in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  In fact, the aquatic nuisance species became a major issue for \nCongress back in the late eighties when the zebra mussel was released \ninto the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes still have zebra mussels, and \nnow, 20 States are fighting to control them. The Great Lakes region \nspends about $30 million per year to keep water pipes from becoming \nclogged with zebra mussels.\n  Zebra mussels were carried over from the Mediterranean to the Great \nLakes in the ballast tanks of ships. The leading pathway for aquatic \ninvasive species was and still is maritime commerce. Most invasive \nspecies are contained in the water that ships use for\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nballast to maintain trim and stability. Aquatic invaders such as the \nzebra mussel and round goby were introduced into the Great Lakes when \nships, often from nations, pulled into port and discharged their \nballast water. In addition to ballast water, aquatic invaders can also \nattach themselves to ships' hulls and anchor chains.\n  Because of the impact that the zebra mussel had in the Great Lakes, \nCongress passed legislation in 1990 and 1996 that has reduced, but not \neliminated, the threat of new invasions by requiring ballast water \nmanagement for ships entering the Great Lakes. Today, there is a \nmandatory ballast water management program in the Great Lakes, and the \nCoast Guard is in the rule-making process to turn the voluntary ballast \nwater exchange reporting requirement into a mandatory ballast water \nexchange program for all of our coasts. The current law requires that \nships entering the Great Lakes must exchange their ballast water, seal \ntheir ballast tanks or use alternative treatment that is ``as effective \nas ballast water exchange.'' Unfortunately, alternative treatments have \nnot been fully developed and widely tested on ships because the \ndevelopers of ballast technology do not know what standard they are \ntrying to achieve. This obstacle is serious because ultimately, only \non-board ballast water treatment will adequately reduce the threat of \nnew aquatic nuisance species being introduced through ballast water.\n  Our bill addresses this problem. First, this bill establishes a \ndeadline for the Coast Guard and EPA to establish a standard for \nballast water management and requires that the standard reduce the \nnumber of plankton in the ballast water by 99 percent or the best \nperformance that technology can provide. This way, technology vendors \nand the maritime industry know what they should be striving to achieve \nand when they will be expected to achieve it. After 2011, all ships \nthat enter any U.S. port after operating outside the Exclusive Economic \nZone of 200 miles will be required to use a ballast water treatment \ntechnology that meets this standard.\n\n  I understand that ballast water technologies are being researched, \nand some are currently being tested on-board ships. The range of \ntechnologies include ultraviolet lights, filters, chemicals, \ndeoxygenation, ozone, and several others. Each of these technologies \nhas a different price tag attached to it. It is not my intention to \noverburden the maritime industry with an expensive requirement to \ninstall technology. In fact, the legislation states that the final \nballast water technology standard must be based on the best performing \ntechnology that is economically achievable. That means that the Coast \nGuard must consider what technology is available, and if there is no \neconomically achievable technology available to a class of vessels, \nthen the standard will not require ballast technology for that class of \nvessels, subject to review every three years. I do not believe this \nwill be the case, however, because the approach of this bill creates a \nclear incentive for treatment vendors to develop affordable equipment \nfor the market.\n  Technology will always be evolving, and we hope that affordable \ntechnology will become available that completely eliminates the risk of \nnew introductions. Therefore, it is important that the Coast Guard \nregularly review and revise the standard so that it reflects what the \nbest technology currently available is and whether it is economically \nachievable.\n  There are other important provisions of the bill that also address \nprevention. For instance, the bill encourages the Coast Guard to \nconsult with Canada, Mexico, and other countries in developing \nguidelines to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance \nspecies. The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force is also charged with \nconducting a pathway analysis to identify other high risk pathways for \nintroduction of nuisance species and implement management strategies to \nreduce those introductions. And this legislation, for the first time, \nestablishes a process to screen live organisms entering the country for \nthe first time for non-research purposes. Organisms believed to be \ninvasive would be imported based on conditions that prevent them from \nbecoming a nuisance. Such a screening process might have prevented such \nspecies as the Snakehead, which has established itself in the Potomac \nRiver here in the DC area, from being imported.\n  The third title of this bill addresses early detection of new \ninvasions and the rapid response to invasions as well as the control of \naquatic nuisance species that do establish themselves. If fully funded, \nthis bill will provide a rapid response fund for states to implement \nemergency strategies when outbreaks occur. The bill requires the Army \nCorps of Engineers to construct and operate the Chicago Ship and \nSanitary Canal project which includes the construction of a second \ndispersal barrier to keep species like the Asian carp from migrating up \nthe Mississippi through the Canal into the Great Lakes. Equally \nimportant, this barrier will prevent the migration of invasive species \nin the Great Lakes from proceeding into the Mississippi system.\n  Lastly, the bill authorizes additional research which will identify \nthreats and the tools to address those threats.\n  Though invasive species threaten the entire Nation's aquatic \necosystem, I am particularly concerned with the damage that invasive \nspecies have done to the Great Lakes. There are now roughly 180 \ninvasive species in the Great Lakes, and it is estimated that a new \nspecies is introduced every 8 months. Invasive species cause \ndisruptions in the food chain, which is now causing the decline of \ncertain fish. Invasive species are believe to be the cause of a new \ndead zone in Lake Erie. And invasive species compete with native \nspecies for habitat.\n  This bill addresses the ``NOBOB'' or No Ballast on Board problem \nwhich is when ships report having no ballast when they enter the Great \nLakes. However, a layer of sediment and small bit of water that cannot \nbe pumped out is still in the ballast tanks. So when water is taken on \nand then discharged all within the Great Lakes, a new species that was \nstill living in that small bit of sediment and water may be introduced. \nBy requiring technology to be installed, this bill addresses a very \nserious issue in the Great Lakes.\n  All in all, the bill would cost between $160 million and $170 million \neach year. This is a lot of money, but it is a critical investment. As \nthose of us from the Great Lakes know, the economic damage that \ninvasive species can cause is much greater. However, compared to the \nannual cost of invasive species, the cost of this bill is minimal. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work \nto move the bill swiftly through the Senate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, from Pickerel Pond to Lake Auburn, from \nSebago Lake to Bryant Pond, lakes and ponds in Maine are under attack. \nAquatic invasive species threaten Maine's drinking water systems, \nrecreation, wildlife habitat, lakefront real estate, and fisheries. \nPlants, such as Variable Leaf Milfoil, are crowding out native species. \nInvasive Asian shore crabs are taking over Southern New England's tidal \npools and have advanced well into Maine--to the potential detriment of \nMaine's lobster and clam industries.\n  I rise today to join Senator Levin in introducing legislation to \naddress this problem. The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 \nwould create the most comprehensive nationwide approach to date for \ncombating alien species that invade our shores.\n  The stakes are high when invasive species are unintentionally \nintroduced into our Nation's waters. They endanger ecosystems, reduce \nbiodiversity, and threaten native species. They disrupt people's lives \nand livelihoods by lowering property values, impairing commercial \nfishing and aquaculture, degrading recreational experiences, and \ndamaging public water supplies.\n  In the 1950s, European Green Crabs swarmed the Maine coast and \nliterally ate the bottom out of Maine's soft-shell clam industry by the \n1980s. Many clam diggers were forced to go after other fisheries or \nfind new vocations. In just one decade, this invader reduced the number \nof clam diggers in Maine from nearly 5,000 in the 1940s to fewer than \n1500 in the 1950s. European green crabs currently cost an estimated $44 \nmillion a year in damage and control efforts in the United States.\n  Past invasions forewarn of the long-term consequences to our \nenvironment and communities unless we take steps to prevent new \ninvasions. It is too late\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nto stop European green crabs from taking hold on the East Coast, but we \nstill have the opportunity to prevent many other species from taking \nhold in Maine and the United States.\n  Senator Levin and I introduced an earlier version of this legislation \nin March of 2003. Just a few months earlier, one of North America's \nmost aggressive invasive species hydrilla--was found in Maine for the \nfirst time. This stubborn and fast-growing aquatic plant had taken hold \nin Pickerel Pond in the Town of Limerick, ME, and threatened \nrecreational use for swimmers and boaters. At the time, we warned that \nunless Congress acted, more and more invasive species would establish a \nfoothold in Maine and across the country.\n  Unfortunately, Congress failed to act on our legislation and new \ninvasions have continued. In December, for the first time, the Maine \nDepartment of Environmental Protection detected Eurasian Milfoil in the \nState. Maine was the last of the lower 48 States to be free of this \nstubborn and fast-growing invasive plant that degrades water quality by \ndisplacing native plants, fish and other aquatic species. The plant \nforms stems reaching up to 20 feet high that cause fouling problems for \nswimmers and boaters. In total, there are 24 documented cases of \naquatic invasive species infesting Maine's lakes and ponds.\n\n  When considering the impact of these invasive species, it is \nimportant to note the tremendous value of our lakes and ponds. While \ntheir contribution to our quality of life is priceless, their value to \nour economy is more measurable. Maine's Great Ponds generate nearly 13 \nmillion recreational user days each year, lead to more than $1.2 \nbillion in annual income for Maine residents, and support more than \n50,000 jobs.\n  With so much at stake, Mainers are taking action to stop the spread \nof invasive species into our State's waters. The State of Maine has \nmade it illegal to sell, posses, cultivate, import or introduce eleven \ninvasive aquatic plants. Boaters participating in the Maine Lake and \nRiver Protection Sticker program are providing needed funding to aid \nefforts to prevent, detect and manage aquatic invasive plants. \nVolunteers are participating in the Courtesy Boat Inspection program to \nkeep aquatic invasive plants out of Maine lakes. Before launch or after \nremoval, inspectors ask boaters for permission to inspect the boat, \ntrailer or other equipment for plants. More than 300 trained inspectors \nconducted upwards of 30,000 courtesy boat inspections at 65 lakes in \nthe 2004 boating season.\n  While I am proud of the actions that Maine and many other States are \ntaking to protect against invasive species, all too often their efforts \nhave not been enough. As with national security, protecting the \nintegrity of our lakes, streams, and coastlines from invading species \ncannot be accomplished by individual States alone. We need a uniform, \nnationwide approach to deal effectively with invasive species. The \nNational Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 will help my State and \nStates throughout the Nation detect, prevent and respond to aquatic \ninvasive species.\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 would be the most \ncomprehensive effort ever undertaken to address the threat of invasive \nspecies. By authorizing $836 million over 6 years, this legislation \nwould open numerous new fronts in our war against invasive species. The \nbill directs the Coast Guard to develop regulations that will end the \neasy cruise of invasive species into U.S. waters through the ballast \nwater of international ships, and would provide the Coast Guard with $6 \nmillion per year to develop and implement these regulations.\n  The bill also would provide $30 million per year for a grant program \nto assist State efforts to prevent the spread of invasive species. It \nwould provide $12 million per year for the Army Corps of Engineers and \nFish and Wildlife Service to contain and control invasive species. \nFinally, the Levin-Collins bill would authorize $30 million annually \nfor research, education, and outreach.\n\n  Mr. President, the most effective means of stopping invading species \nis to attack them before they attack us. We need an early alert, rapid \nresponse system to combat invading species before they have a chance to \ntake hold. For the first time, this bill would establish a national \nmonitoring network to detect newly introduced species, while providing \n$25 million to the Secretary of the Interior to create a rapid response \nfund to help States and regions respond quickly once invasive species \nhave been detected. This bill is our best effort at preventing the next \nwave of invasive species from taking hold and decimating industries and \ndestroying waterways in Maine and throughout the country.\n  One of the leading pathways for the introduction of aquatic organisms \nto U.S. waters from abroad is through transoceanic vessels. Commercial \nvessels fill and release ballast tanks with seawater as a means of \nstabilization. The ballast water contains live organisms from plankton \nto adult fish that are transported and released through this pathway. \nLast week, a Federal judge ruled that the Government can no longer \nallow ships to dump, without a permit from the Environmental Protection \nAgency, any ballast water containing nonnative species that could harm \nlocal ecosystems. The court case and subsequent decision indicates that \nthere are problems with our existing systems to control ballast water \ndischarge and signals a need to address invasive hitchhikers that \ntravel to our shores aboard ships. Our legislation would establish a \nframework to prevent the introduction of aquatic invasive species by \nships.\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2005 offers a strong \nframework to combat aquatic invasive species. I call on my colleagues \nto help us enact this legislation in order to protect our waters, \necosystems, and industries from destructive invasive species--before \nit's too late.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 773. A bill to ensure the safe and secure transportation by rail \nof extremely hazardous materials; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nExtremely Hazardous Materials Rail Transportation Act of 2005, to \nensure the safety and security of toxic chemicals that are transported \nacross our nation's 170,000 mile rail network.\n  On January 6, 2005, a freight car carrying toxic chlorine gas \nderailed in South Carolina. The derailment caused a rupture that \nreleased a deadly gas cloud over the nearby community of Graniteville. \nAs a result of this accident, nine people died and 318 needed medical \nattention. Many of those needing medical attention were first \nresponders who arrived at the scene of the accident unaware that a tank \ncar containing chlorine gas had ruptured. As one responder described \nit, ``I took a breath. That stuff grabbed me. It gagged me and brought \nme down to my knees. I talked to God and said, `I am not dying here.''' \nIn the aftermath of the chlorine release, more than 5,000 area \nresidents needed to be evacuated from their homes.\n  The Graniteville accident was the deadliest accident involving the \ntransport of chlorine. But it was not the first. Since the use of rail \nfor chlorine transport began in 1924, there had been four fatal \naccidents involving the release of chlorine, according to the Chlorine \nInstitute. Thirteen people have died. In addition, the National \nTransportation Safety Board has investigated 14 derailments from 1995 \nto 2004 that caused the release of hazardous chemicals, including \nchlorine. In those instances, four people died and 5,517 were injured.\n  The Graniteville accident exposes fundamental failings in the \ntransport of hazardous materials on America's rail system. These \nfailings include pressurized rail tank cars that are vulnerable to \nrupture; lack of sufficient training for transporters and emergency \nresponders; lack of sufficient notification to the communities that \nhazardous material train run through and a lack of coordination at the \nfederal level between the many agencies that are involved in rail \ntransport of hazardous materials.\n  Because of these failings, our Nation's freight rail infrastructure \nremains vulnerable to the release of hazardous materials either by \naccident or due to deliberate attack. The ``Extremely Hazardous \nMaterial Rail Transportation Act addresses these\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\nsafety and security issues. My legislation would require the DHS to \ncoordinate Federal, State and local efforts to prevent terrorist acts \nand to respond to emergencies in the transport by rail of extremely \nhazardous materials. It requires the DHS to issue regulations that \naddress the integrity of pressurized tank cars, the lack of sufficient \ntraining for transporters and emergency responders, and the lack of \nsufficient notification for communities. It would also require the DHS \nto study the possibility of reducing, through the use of alternate \nroutes, the risks of freight transportation of extremely hazardous \nmaterial; except in the case of emergencies or where such alternatives \ndo not exist or are prohibitively expensive. Finally, it contains \nprotections for employees who report on the safety and security of \ntransportation by rail of extremely hazardous materials.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 1993 income tax increase on Social Security benefits; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Social \nSecurity Benefits Tax Relief Act of 2005, which repeals the 1993 income \ntax increase on Social Security benefits that went into effect in 1993.\n  When Social Security was created, beneficiaries did not pay federal \nincome tax on their benefits. However, in 1983, Congress passed \nlegislation requiring that 50 percent of Social Security benefits be \ntaxed for seniors whose incomes were above $25,000 for an individual \nand $32,000 for a couple. This additional revenue was credited back to \nthe Social Security trust funds.\n  In 1993, Congress and President Clinton expanded this tax. A \nprovision was passed as part of a larger bill requiring that 85 percent \nof a senior's Social Security benefit be taxed if their income was \nabove $34,000 for an individual and $44,000 for a couple. This \nadditional money is credited to the Medicare program.\n  I was in Congress in 1993, and fought against this provision. This is \nan unfair tax on our senior citizens who worked year after year paying \ninto Social Security, only to be taxed on their benefits once they \nretired.\n  My bill, the Social Security Benefits Tax Relief Act, would repeal \nthe 1993 tax increase on benefits and would replace the money that has \nbeen going to the Medicare program with general funds. This legislation \nis identical to the legislation I introduced in the 108th Congress.\n  Recently during debate on the Budget Resolution, I introduced an \namendment that provides the Finance Committee with the tax cuts to \nfinally repeal the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits. My \namendment passed by a vote of 55 yeas to 45 nays. The legislation I am \nintroducing today provides the legislative blueprint for repealing this \nunfair tax.\n  The 1993 tax was unfair when it was signed into law, and it is unfair \ntoday. I hope my Senate colleagues can support this legislation to \nremove this burdensome tax on our seniors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 775. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 123 W. 7th Street in Holdenville, OK, as the ``Boone \nPickens Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly introduce \nlegislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 123 W. 7th Street in Holdenville, OK, as the ``Boone \nPickens Post Office''.\n  Thomas Boone Pickens, Jr. emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, \nentrepreneurship and philanthropy. He is an excellent example of the \npotential to achieve success in our American free enterprise system. I \nhonor, I proudly seek to name the post office in his hometown of \nHoldenville, OK, where he was born in 1928.\n  As the son of a landman, Pickens quickly appreciated the business \npotential of oil exploration. Oklahoma State University awarded Pickens \na bachelor of science in geology in 1951. He grew frustrated with the \nbureaucracy of working for a large company and decided to start his own \nin 1956. This company was the basis for what became one of the leading \noil and gas exploration and production firms in the nation, Mesa \nPetroleum Company.\n  Not only did Pickens lead in the energy industry itself, he possessed \nthe unique ability to recognize and acquire undervalued companies. \nRepeatedly, markets eventually realized the worth of these companies, \nand shareholder profits soared.\n  His innovative thinking and business skills amassed the fortune and \nwisdom he unselfishly shares with others. Oklahoma State University has \nbenefited from his generous investment in academics and athletics. He \nis also a dedicated supporter of a wide range of medical research \ninitiatives. He is an energetic advocate for the causes he believes in, \ndevoting his time to serve on numerous boards and receiving recognition \nthrough countless awards.\n  He often said, ``Be willing to make decisions. That's the most \nimportant quality in a good leader. Don't fall victim to what I call \nthe ready-aim-aim-aim-aim syndrome.\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n  You must be willing to fire.'' That is exactly the Oklahoma mentality \nof leadership, the ability to make tough decisions and stick to them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nas we commemorate an outstanding citizen so that future generations \nwill be challenged by his example, just as we have been.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 776. A bill to designate certain functions performed at flight \nservice stations of the Federal Aviation Administration as inherently \ngovernmental functions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nensure that rural America's aviation network benefits from the same \nlevel of service and safety as America's busiest airports. Whether \nmoving products and services as part of the global economy, or \nshepherding sick patients for medical care, rural communities require \nthe same basic air infrastructure network. By ensuring that Flight \nService Stations remain in rural areas, general aviation pilots will \ncontinue to be able to serve regions that may otherwise be neglected.\n  Flight Service Stations currently provide general aviation pilots \nwith weather briefings, temporary flight restrictions, emergency \ninformation, and aid in search and rescue situations. Flight Service \nStation Specialists use their expertise of regional weather, landscape, \nand flight conditions to ensure pilots reach their destinations safely. \nTheir work has kept general aviation running smoothly and has literally \nsaved lives.\n  On February 1, 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration announced \nthat operations conducted by Flight Service Stations would be performed \nby a private contractor. Under the Administration's proposal, the \ncontractor will eliminate 38 of the 58 stations across the country. \nWork currently conducted by these stations will then be done by \nemployees located in the remaining 20 stations.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration's proposal will lead to decreased \nsafety for pilots of small planes because they will no longer be \ntalking to personnel familiar with regional weather and topography. The \nconsolidated system will strain service capability because fewer \nemployees will be responsible for a growing system of general air \ntraffic. The proposed plan will be especially harmful to rural areas \nthat more heavily rely upon smaller aircraft.\n  The Federal Aviation Safety Security Act would ensure that these \nfacilities can continue to preserve and protect general aviation in the \nUnited States. This legislation is supported by a large number of \ngeneral aviation pilots and others who depend on their regional Flight \nService Station. The bill already enjoys significant bipartisan \nsupport, and I will continue to work with members of both parties to \npreserve aviation safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Federal Aviation Safety \nSecurity Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Federal Aviation Safety \n     Security Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL DETERMINATION.\n\n       For purposes of section 2(a) of the Federal Inventory \n     Activities Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 2382), the functions \n     performed by air traffic control specialists at flight \n     service stations operated by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration are inherently governmental functions and must \n     be performed by Federal employees.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACTIONS VOIDED.\n\n       Any action taken pursuant to section 2(a) of the Federal \n     Inventory Activities Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 2382), or any \n     other law or legal authority with respect to functions \n     performed by air traffic control specialists at flight \n     service stations operated by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration is null and void.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 777. A bill to designate Catoctin Mountain Park in the State of \nMaryland as the ``Catoctin Mountain National Recreation Area'', and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nre-designate Catoctin Mountain Park as the Catoctin Mountain National \nRecreation Area. This measure was unanimously approved by the full \nSenate during the 108th Congress, but unfortunately, was not considered \nin the House.\n  I spoke during the 108th Congress about the need to enact this \nlegislation and I want to underscore some of the key reasons today. \nCatoctin Mountain Park is a hidden gem in our National Park System. \nHome to Camp David, the Presidential retreat, it has been aptly \ndescribed as ``America's most famous unknown park.'' Comprising nearly \n6000 acres of the eastern reach of the Appalachian Mountains in \nMaryland, the park is rich in history as well as outdoor recreation \nopportunities. Visitors can enjoy camping, picnicking, cross-country \nskiing, fishing, as well as the solitude and beauty of the woodland \nmountain and streams in the park.\n  Catoctin Mountain Park had its origins during the Great Depression as \none of 46 Recreational Demonstration Areas (RDA) established under the \nauthority of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Federal \nGovernment purchased more than 10,000 acres of mountain land that had \nbeen heavily logged and was no longer productive to demonstrate how \nsub-marginal land could be turned into a productive recreational area \nand help put people back to work. From 1936 through 1941, hundreds of \nworkers under the Works Progress Administration and later the Civilian \nConservation Corps were employed in reforestation activities and in the \nconstruction of a number of camps, roads and other facilities, \nincluding the camp now known as Camp David, and one of the earliest--if \nnot the oldest--camp for disabled individuals. In November 1936, \nadministrative authority for the Catoctin RDA was transferred to the \nNational Park Service by Executive Order.\n  In 1942, concern about President Roosevelt's health and safety led to \nthe selection of Catoctin Mountain, and specifically Camp Hi-Catoctin \nas the location for the President's new retreat. Subsequently \napproximately 5,000 acres of the area was transferred to the State of \nMaryland, becoming Cunningham Falls State Park in 1954. The remaining \n5,770 acres of the Catoctin Recreation Demonstration Area was renamed \nCatoctin Mountain Park by the Director of the National Park Service in \n1954. Unfortunately, the Director failed to include the term \n``National'' in the title and the park today remains one of eleven \nunits in the National Park System--all in the National Capital Region--\nthat do not have this designation.\n  The proximity of Catoctin Mountain Park, Camp David, and Cunningham \nFalls State Park, and the differences between national and state park \nmanagement, has caused longstanding confusion for visitors to the area. \nCatoctin Mountain Park is continually misidentified by the public as \ncontaining lake and beach areas associated with Cunningham Falls State \nPark, being operated by the State of Maryland, or being closed to the \npublic because of the presence of Camp David. National Park employees \nspend countless hours explaining, assisting and redirecting visitors to \ntheir desired destinations.\n  My legislation would help to address this situation and clearly \nidentify this park as a unit of the National Park System by renaming it \nthe Catoctin Mountain National Recreation Area. The Maryland State \nHighway Administration, perhaps in anticipation of the enactment of \nthis bill, has already changed some of the signs leading to the Park. \nThis bill would make the name change official within the National Park \nService and on official National Park Service maps. Moreover, the \nmission and characteristics of this park--which include the \npreservation of significant historic resources and important natural \nareas in locations that provide outdoor recreation for large numbers of \npeople--make this designation appropriate. This measure would not \nchange access requirements\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nor current recreational uses occurring within the park. But it would \nassist the visiting public in distinguishing between the many units of \nthe State and Federal systems. It will also, in my judgment, help \npromote tourism by enhancing public awareness of the National Park \nunit.\n  I urge approval of this legislation and ask unanimous consent that \nthe full text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 778. A bill to amend title XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to require a pharmacy that receives payments or has contracts under \nthe medicare and medicaid programs to ensure that all valid \nprescriptions are filled without unnecessary delay or interference; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Pharmacy \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005'' to ensure that our Nation's \npharmacies fill all valid prescriptions without unnecessary delay or \ninterference.\n  We are hearing more and more stories about pharmacists refusing to \nfill prescriptions for contraceptives because of their personal \nbeliefs, not their medical concerns. Some of my constituents have told \nme about their experiences. One woman in Merced County was turned away \nby a pharmacist who said ``we don't do that here,'' but, less than two \nhours later, another pharmacist in the store filled the same \nprescription for another customer immediately. It's not just in \nCalifornia, of course.\n  In Menomonie, WI, a pharmacist told a woman he wouldn't fill her \nprescription for birth control pills or even transfer her prescription \nto another pharmacy. In Fabens, TX, a married woman had just had a \nbaby. It had been a C-section. Her doctor told her not to get pregnant \nagain in the near future, and prescribed birth control pills. She went \nto get her prescription refilled while visiting her mother in Fabens. \nUnfortunately, the cashier told her that the pharmacist wouldn't be \nable to refill her prescription because birth control was ``against his \nreligion'' and was a form of ``abortion.''\n  The American people do not think this is right. According to a \nNovember 2004 CBS/New York Times poll, 8 out of 10 Americans believe \nthat pharmacists should not be permitted to refuse to dispense birth \ncontrol pills, including 70 percent of Republicans. They know that \ncontraceptives are a legal and effective way to reduce unintended \npregnancies and abortions.\n  But this challenge is not just about contraceptives. It's about \naccess to health care. It's about making decisions based on science and \nmedicine. Tomorrow, pharmacists could refuse to dispense any drug for \nany medical condition. Access to pharmaceuticals should depend on \nmedical judgments, not personal ideology.\n  The Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act requires pharmacies that receive \nMedicare and Medicaid funding to fill all valid prescriptions for FDA-\napproved drugs and devices without unnecessary delay or interference. \nThat means, if the item is not in stock, the pharmacy should order it \naccording to its standard procedures, or, if the customer prefers, \ntransfer it to another pharmacy or give the prescription back.\n  There are medical reasons why a pharmacy wouldn't want to fill \nprescriptions including problems with dosages, harmful interactions \nwith other drugs, or potential drug abuse. This bill would not \ninterfere with those decisions.\n  I know some are concerned about those pharmacists who do not want to \ndispense particular medications because of their personal beliefs, \nincluding their religious values. I believe that is between the \npharmacist and his or her employer. In this bill, it is the \nresponsibility of the pharmacy, not the pharmacist, to ensure that \nprescriptions are filled. Pharmacies can accommodate their employees in \nany manner that they wish as long as customers get their medications \nwithout delay, interference, or harassment.\n  Most of our pharmacies receive reimbursements through Medicaid. When \nthe prescription drug program goes into full effect in January, a \ngrowing number will be part of Medicare. If a pharmacy contracts with \nour Medicaid or Medicare programs, directly or indirectly, they should \nfulfill their fundamental duty to the patients they serve.\n  Most pharmacists work hard and do right by their patients every day. \nThey believe in science. They believe that if a doctor writes a valid \nprescription, it should be filled. But, unfortunately, some have put \ntheir personal views over the health of their patients. That is wrong. \nWhen people walk into a pharmacy, they should have confidence that they \nwill get the medications they need, when they need them. The Pharmacy \nConsumer Protection Act of 2005 will help ensure just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 779. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \ncontrolled foreign corporations established\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nin tax havens as domestic corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm joined by Senator Levin of \nMichigan in introducing legislation that we believe will help the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) combat offshore tax-haven abuses and \nensure that U.S. multinational companies pay the U.S. taxes that they \nrightfully owe.\n  Tens of millions of taxpayers will be rushing to file their tax \nreturns in the next few days in order to fulfill their taxpaying \nresponsibility by the April 15 filing deadline. Some tax experts \nestimate that taxpayers will spend over $100 billion and more than 6 \nbillion hours this year trying to comply with their federal tax \nobligation. It's no wonder that many Americans are frustrated with the \ncurrent tax system and would gladly welcome substantive efforts to \nsimplify it.\n  However, this frustration changes to anger when the taxpayers who pay \ntheir taxes on time each year discover that many corporate taxpayers \nare shirking their tax obligations by actively shifting their profits \nto foreign tax havens or using other inappropriate tax avoidance \ntechniques. The bill that Senator Levin and I are introducing today is \na simple and straightforward way to try to tackle the offshore tax-\nhaven problem.\n  Specifically, our legislation denies tax benefits, namely tax \ndeferral, to U.S. multinational companies that set up controlled \nforeign corporations in tax-haven countries by treating those \nsubsidiaries as domestic companies for U.S. income tax purposes. This \ntracks the same general approach embraced and passed by the Congress in \nother tax legislation designed to curb the problem of corporate \ninversions.\n  We have known for many years that some very profitable U.S. \nmultinational businesses are using offshore tax havens to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of U.S. taxes. But Congress has really done very \nlittle to stop this hemorrhaging of tax revenues. In fact, recent \nevidence suggests that the tax-haven problem is getting much worse and \nmay be draining the U.S. Treasury of tens of billions of dollars every \nyear.\n  The New York Times got it right when it suggested that ``instead of \nmoving headquarters offshore, many companies are simply placing patents \non drugs, ownership of corporate logos, techniques for manufacturing \nprocesses and other intangible assets in tax havens . . . The companies \nthen charge their subsidiaries in higher-tax locales, including the \nU.S., for the use of these intellectual properties. This allows the \ncompanies to take profits in these havens and pay far less in taxes.''\n  How pervasive is the tax-haven subsidiary problem? Last year, the \nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of \nCongress, issued a report that Senator Levin and I requested that gives \nsome insight to the potential magnitude of this tax avoidance activity. \nThe GAO found that 59 out of the 100 largest publicly-traded federal \ncontractors in 2001--with tens of billions of dollars of federal \ncontracts in 2001--had established hundreds of subsidiaries located in \noffshore tax havens.\n\n  According to the GAO, Exxon-Mobil Corporation, the 21st largest \npublicly traded federal contractor in 2001, has some 11 tax-haven \nsubsidiaries in the Bahamas. Halliburton Company reportedly has 17 tax-\nhaven subsidiaries, including 13 in the Cayman Islands, a country that \nhas never imposed a corporate income tax, as well as 2 in Liechtenstein \nand 2 in Panama. And the now infamous Enron Corporation had 1,300 \ndifferent foreign entities, including some 441 located in the Cayman \nIslands.\n  More recently, former Joint Committee on Taxation economist Martin \nSullivan released a study that looked at the amount of profits that US. \ncompanies are shifting to offshore tax havens. He found that U.S. \nmultinationals had moved hundreds of billions of profits to tax havens \nfor years 1999-2002, the latest years for which IRS data is available.\n  Although Congress passed legislation, which I supported, that \naddresses the problem of corporate expatriates that reincorporate \noverseas, that legislation did nothing to deal with the problem of U.S. \ncompanies that are setting up tax-haven subsidiaries to avoid their \ntaxpaying responsibilities in this country.\n  The legislation that we are introducing builds upon the good work of \nSenators Grassley and Baucus and other members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee by extending similar tax policy changes to cover the case of \nU.S. companies and their tax-haven subsidiaries.\n  Specifically, our legislation would do the following: 1. Treat U.S. \ncontrolled foreign subsidiaries that are set up in tax-haven countries \nas domestic companies for U.S. tax purposes. In other words, we would \nsimply treat these companies as if they never left the United States, \nwhich is essentially the case in these tax avoidance motivated \ntransactions.\n  2. List specific tax-haven countries subject to the new rule (based \nupon the previous work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment) and give the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to add \nor remove a foreign country from this list in appropriate cases.\n  3. Provide an exception where substantially all of a U.S. controlled \nforeign corporation's income is derived from the active conduct of a \ntrade or business within the listed tax-haven country.\n  4. Make these proposed changes effective beginning after December 31, \n2007. This will give businesses ample time to restructure their tax-\nhaven operations if they so choose.\n  This legislation will help end the tax benefits for U.S. companies \nthat shift income to offshore tax-haven subsidiaries. For example, any \nefforts by a U.S. company to move profits to the subsidiary through \ntransfer pricing schemes will not work because the income earned by the \nsubsidiary would still be immediately taxable by the United States. \nLikewise, any efforts to move otherwise active income earned by a U.S. \ncompany in a high-tax foreign country to a tax haven would cause the \nincome to be immediately taxable by the United States. Companies that \ntry to move intangible assets--and the income they produce--to tax \nhavens would be unsuccessful because the income would still be \nimmediately taxable by the United States.\n  Let me be very clear about one thing. This legislation will not \nadversely impact U.S. companies with controlled foreign subsidiaries \nthat are located in tax havens and doing legitimate and substantial \nbusiness. The legislation expressly exempts a U.S.-controlled foreign \nsubsidiary from its tax rule changes when substantially all of its \nincome is derived from the active conduct of a trade or business within \na listed tax-haven country.\n  In 2002, then-IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told Congress that \n``nothing undermines confidence in the tax system more than the \nimpression that the average honest taxpayer has to pay his or her taxes \nwhile more wealthy or unscrupulous taxpayers are allowed to get away \nwith not paying.'' Last week, IRS Commissioner Everson echoed similar \nsentiments at a Senate Transportation-Treasury Appropriations \nSubcommittee hearing I attended on the IRS's FY 2006 budget request.\n  They are absolutely right. It's grossly unfair to ask our Main Street \nbusinesses to operate at a competitive disadvantage to large \nmultinational businesses simply because our tax authorities are unable \nto grapple with the growing offshore tax avoidance problem. It is \noutrageous that tens of millions of working families who pay their \ntaxes on time every year are shouldering the tax burden of large \nprofitable U.S. multinational companies that use tax-haven \nsubsidiaries.\n  I hope that Congress will act promptly to enact legislation to curb \nthese tax-haven subsidiary abuses. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3565-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3565-S3566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 106--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF DENVER PIONEERS \n   MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM, 2005 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION \n                      DIVISION I HOCKEY CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself and Mr. Allard) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 22, 2004, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate declared that the atrocities occurring in Darfur, \n     Sudan are genocide.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate, ``[w]hen we reviewed the evidence compiled by our \n     team, along with other information available to the State \n     Department, we concluded that genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] \n     bear responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring''.\n       (3) President George W. Bush, in an address before the \n     United Nations General Assembly on September 21, 2004, \n     stated, ``[a]t this hour, the world is witnessing terrible \n     suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, \n     crimes my government has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the \n     Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to \n     apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law and carried \n     out other atrocities in the Darfur region.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining \n     that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its \n     obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling \n     for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region, \n     demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and \n     arrested for verification, establishing an International \n     Commission of Inquiry into violations of international \n     humanitarian and human rights laws, and threatening sanctions \n     should the Government of Sudan fail to fully comply with \n     Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 \n     declares that if the Government of Sudan ``fails to comply \n     fully'' with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564, the \n     Security Council shall consider taking ``additional \n     measures'' against the Government of Sudan ``as contemplated \n     in Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, such as \n     actions to affect Sudan's petroleum sector or individual \n     members of the Government of Sudan, in order to take \n     effective action to obtain such full compliance and \n     cooperation''.\n       (7) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 also \n     ``welcomes and supports the intention of the African Union to \n     enhance and augment its monitoring mission in Darfur'' and \n     ``urges member states to support the African Union in these \n     efforts, including by providing all equipment, logistical, \n     financial, material, and other resources necessary to support \n     the rapid expansion of the African Union Mission''.\n       (8) On February 1, 2005, the United Nations released the \n     Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur \n     to the United Nations Secretary-General, dated January 25, \n     2005, which stated that, ``[g]overnment forces and militias \n     conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of \n     civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of \n     villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging \n     and forced displacement throughout Darfur'', that such ``acts \n     were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and \n     therefore may amount to crimes against humanity'', and that \n     the ``magnitude and large-scale nature of some crimes against \n     humanity as well as their consistency over a long period of \n     time, necessarily imply that these crimes result from a \n     central planning operation''.\n       (9) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General notes that, \n     pursuant to its mandate and in the course of its work, the UN \n     Commission collected information relating to individual \n     perpetrators of acts constituting ``violations of \n     international human rights law and international humanitarian \n     law, including crimes against humanity and war crimes'' and \n     that the UN Commission has delivered to the Secretary-General \n     of the United Nations a sealed file of those named by the UN \n     Commission with the recommendation that the ``file be handed \n     over to a competent Prosecutor''.\n       (10) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1590, establishing the \n     United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) consisting of 10,000 \n     military personnel and 715 civilian police personnel. The \n     mandate of UNMIS includes to ``closely and continuously \n     liaise and coordinate at all levels with the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with a view towards expeditiously \n     reinforcing the effort to foster peace in Darfur, especially \n     with regard to the Abuja peace process and the African Union \n     Mission in Sudan''. Security Council Resolution 1590 also \n     urged the Secretary-General and United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights to increase the number and \n     deployment rate of human rights monitors to Darfur.\n       (11) On March 29, 2005, the United Security Council passed \n     Security Council Resolution 1591, establishing a Committee of \n     the Security Council and a Panel of Experts to identify \n     individuals who have impeded the peace process, constitute a \n     threat to stability in Darfur and the region, commit \n     violations of international humanitarian or human rights law \n     or other atrocities, or who are responsible for offensive \n     overflights, and calling on member states to prevent those \n     individuals identified from entry into or transit of their \n     territories and to freeze those individuals non-exempted \n     assets.\n       (12) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1593, referring the \n     situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the Prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the proviso that \n     personnel from a state outside Sudan not a party to the Rome \n     Statute of the ICC shall not be subject to the ICC in this \n     instance.\n\n     SEC. 7004.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exerted very \n     large demands on the Treasury of the United States and \n     required tremendous sacrifice by the members of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure \n     comprehensive oversight of the expenditure of United States \n     Government funds.\n       (3) Waste and corporate abuse of United States Government \n     resources are particularly unacceptable and reprehensible \n     during times of war.\n       (4) The magnitude of the funds involved in the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq and the war on \n     terrorism, together with the speed with which these funds \n     have been committed, presents a challenge to the effective \n     performance of the traditional oversight function of Congress \n     and the auditing functions of the executive branch.\n       (5) The Senate Special Committee to Investigate the \n     National Defense Program, popularly know as the Truman \n     Committee, which was established during World War II, offers \n     a constructive precedent for bipartisan oversight of wartime \n     contracting that can also be extended to wartime and postwar \n     reconstruction activities.\n       (6) The Truman Committee is credited with an extremely \n     successful investigative effort, performance of a significant \n     public education role, and achievement of fiscal savings \n     measured in the billions of dollars.\n       (7) The public has a right to expect that taxpayer \n     resources will be carefully disbursed and honestly spent.\n\n     SEC. 7002.

Mr. President, I am very troubled that on this Defense \nsupplemental bill, designed to provide the resources necessary for our \nsoldiers in the field to defend themselves and execute the policy of \nthe United States of America against a hostile force, we are now moving \ninto a prolonged and contentious debate over one of the issues that all \nof us must admit is critically divisive and contentious and important \nin our country; and that is, the immigration question.\n  As we all know, the 9/11 Commission made several recommendations \ninvolving security issues affecting this country, particularly in \nidentification and better control over those who would come into our \ncountry, particularly those trying to come in illegally. That was \ndebated in the intelligence bill. Then an agreement was reached. The \nHouse decided to put in that REAL ID language, designed to be \nconsistent with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission for security \npurposes--not an immigration bill, security bill language, their \nversion of it. This Senate has not put any such language in the bill at \nthis time.\n  I will say this. That is one thing. I, as a prosecutor, and somebody \nwho has served on the Judiciary Committee--and we have wrestled with \nthis for some time--have come to the very firm conclusion that the \nSensenbrenner language is important for our security. We need to do \nsomething like this. We have waited too long, I believe. That is my \nview.\n  But now on this floor I am advised we are going to have the Mikulski \nimmigration bill offered, and then we are going to have the Craig-\nKennedy AgJOBS bill, which is a bill breathtaking in its scope, an \nabsolute legislative approval of amnesty in an incredible scope, and \nabsolutely contrary to the very generous but liberal position President \nBush has taken with regard to immigration. That is going to be run \nthrough on this Defense supplemental, and we are going to have to vote \non it.\n  The committees have not studied it. We have not looked at all the \nalternatives that might be considered or other legislation that I am \ninterested in, such as legislation that would empower our local law \nenforcement to be better participants in this entire activity. All of \nthat will be swept away, and we will come through with a bill where we \ngive a million-plus people, who are here in our country illegally--they \nwould be granted temporary resident status, by proving that they worked \nat least 100 hours illegally. And then, if they worked 2,060 hours \nduring a period of 6 years, they then are adjusted to legal permanent \nresidents, what most people call green card holders, a status that is a \nguaranteed track or pass to citizenship, and they can bring their \nfamilies with them.\n  This bill will take 1 million people, and it will put them on a \nguaranteed track to citizenship, people who have come here illegally.\n  Now, what about the people who have followed these H-1B, H-2B visa \nprograms who have worked here legally? Can they get advantage of this \ntrack? Do they get put on a process by which they become citizens? No. \nIt is only the people who are here illegally.\n  This is a bad principle. It is a matter of very serious import for \nlaw. I was a Federal prosecutor for 15 years. It hurts me to see the \nindifference by which our Nation has handled our legal system regarding \nimmigration.\n  Should we allow more people to come here under legitimate conditions? \nAbsolutely. I am for that, legally. I am prepared to discuss that. But \nI am not for a plan that guarantees amnesty for people who have come \nhere illegally and not providing the benefits to those who may be \ntalented, maybe have the skills we need right now, those who do not \nhave connections to criminal or terrorist groups. We ought to be \nworking on that angle of it.\n\n  I am a team player and I want to see things done right, in this \nSenate. I want to see our leadership succeed. I want to see good policy \nexecuted. But we are not going to take this issue lightly. I suggest \nthat it would be an abdication of our responsibility as Senators if we \nallow this to be rammed through, attached to a bill, without the \nAmerican people knowing what we are doing. They need to know this. It \nis going to take some time for them to learn what is being considered \nhere. Senators need to learn what is in this bill. They don't know yet.\n  This AgJOBS bill had 60-something cosponsors last year. Now I \nunderstand it is down to 45. Why? People are reading this thing. It is \nbad law, bad policy. You tell me--this will be the second time we have \npassed an amnesty bill, if AgJOBS were to become law. Passing another \namnesty bill would do nothing more than send the signal to those around \nthe world who would like to come to the United States that the best way \nto become a citizen is to come in illegally and hang on; they will \nnever do anything to you, and eventually there will be another amnesty \nout there? That is why we are concerned about it.\n  Yes, there are hardship cases. Yes, we want to be fair to everybody. \nWe want to be more than fair. We want to be generous. But we have to be \ncareful if we have any respect for law. Sometimes people think in this \nbody--maybe they have never had to deal with it as I have--that laws \ndon't have much import. They do. They are important. They make \nstatements. A society\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nthat cannot set rules and enforce those rules is not a healthy society. \nIf you would like to know why America is the greatest, most productive, \nmost free country in the history of the world, it is our commitment to \nthe rule of law.\n  This process is undermining respect for law in a way that I have not \nseen before, maybe since Prohibition. I think we can improve \nimmigration law. We can be generous with people and try to help them \nand their families and create something. But it is going to take a good \nwhile. It is going to take some hard work.\n  I for one am not going quietly on this bill. We are going to take \ntime. We are going to have debate. We are going to delay this important \ndefense supplemental bill now to go off on this tangent. But I hope and \npray that somehow our leadership and those who are interested in these \nissues can find a way to put this off for now. Let this bill get \npassed.\n  Let's talk about this issue as part of a comprehensive debate. If we \ndid that, we would be serving our constituents a lot better than what \nwe are doing today.\n  If we go forward and we ram this through without the kind of \nhearings, debate, taking testimony, studying data, do all that kinds of \nstuff, our constituents are not going to be happy with us. As a matter \nof fact, I think they are going to rightly be upset with us. It is a \ntactic that should not be done on a matter of this importance.\n  I wanted to make that comment. I know at some point we will be moving \nforward with the bill. Hopefully the leadership can work with those who \nare interested in these issues and create a mechanism at some point in \nthe future where it can be fully debated. I am not prepared to allow \nsuch a tremendously significant piece of legislation as the AgJOBS bill \nto go through without a full debate. Every minute that is available to \nthis Senate to debate it should be put on it. The American people need \nto know what is happening on the floor of the Senate right now. Maybe \nwhen we have a vote, we will have the right outcome.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1134 and \nthat the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1134) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide for the proper tax treatment of certain \n     disaster mitigation payments.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, we will pass legislation in the \nSenate that provides tax relief to all Americans receiving disaster \nmitigation grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. I \nam pleased that my good friend, Senator Grassley, and I, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Landrieu, Bond, Feinstein, Lott, Martinez, Nelson, \nand Vitter could work together to add a necessary and important \namendment to H.R. 1134, which exempts disaster mitigation payments from \ntaxation.\n  For 15 years, FEMA has awarded natural disaster mitigation grants \nthat assist citizens, businesses and communities to take steps to \nprevent or mitigate damages from future natural disasters. The grants \ngo towards elevating buildings in floodplains, flood proofing, seismic \nreinforcement, acquisitions or relocations, wind protections for roofs \nand strengthening of window protections. These grants provide a long-\nterm benefit to society by reducing future loss of life and increasing \npublic safety. In addition to these life-saving benefits, mitigation \ngrants also provide a net cost benefit to society. FEMA conducts a \ncost-benefit analysis prior to awarding a grant that ensures the cost \nof funding a project is less than the damages expected to occur in the \nevent of a disaster. FEMA estimates that for every dollar spent on \nmitigation, an average of eight dollars is saved in the long run.\n  Let me take a minute to explain the history of the tax issue at hand. \nPrior to June of last year, recipients of FEMA mitigation grants \ngenerally excluded them from income. The tax code states clearly that \npost-disaster grants were not taxable. But the tax code doesn't \nspecifically describe the tax treatment of mitigation grants. FEMA \nassumed mitigation grants were treated the same as post-disaster relief \ngrants. However, on June 28, 2004, the Internal Revenue Service issued \na legal memorandum stating these mitigation grants were taxable as \nincome. That means that someone who took advantage of mitigation \nopportunities to prevent future losses would face a significant tax \nliability. The average mitigation grant is $83,000. That means the \naverage tax on a grant is tens of thousands of dollars. That isn't \nfair. It was never intended that taxes be collected under these \nmitigation programs, but under the legal memorandum issued by the \nInternal Revenue Service thousands of taxpayers may have to file \namended tax returns and pay additional tax. Moreover, the Federal \nGovernment changed the rules and never made the recipients aware of the \npotential tax consequences.\n  I compliment the House for taking up this issue and passing \nlegislation that helps taxpayers who receive mitigation grants after \nthe date of enactment. However, there is a flaw in the House bill. The \nbill clearly provides tax relief to ``amounts received after the date \nof enactment.'' What about taxpayers who received mitigation grants in \n2004 or 2003 and before? The chairman of the Finance Committee and I \nhave added an amendment that provides absolute certainty for all \ntaxpayers who received grants in past years. Some have argued that the \nDepartment of the Treasury can provide tax relief for those who \nreceived grants prior to the date of enactment by using the intent \ngleaned from floor statements and letters from Members of Congress. Let \nme be clear, Congress writes laws and the clearest intent is in the \nletter of the law. If our intent is to provide tax relief for those who \nreceived grants before the date of enactment, we should write it into \nthe law. And that is what the amendment my good friend Senator Grassley \nand I have offered.\n  Before I finish, I want to thank Senators Landrieu, Nelson and \nFeinstein for their tireless work. I can tell you firsthand there was a \nsignificant amount of pressure to pass this bill as it was sent from \nthe House. We all wanted to pass this bill as quickly as possible, but \nwe also wanted to be sure we got it right the first time. This bill \ndoes that.\n  I sincerely hope the House will do the right thing and pass this bill \nwith the Senate amendment before the tax filing deadline on Friday.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, last year the Internal Revenue Service \nhit my State like a Category 4 hurricane when it determined that \ndisaster mitigation benefits from the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency are taxable. We get hurricane warnings when a storm is coming, \nwe can track their paths as they come out of the Carribean and into the \nGulf of Mexico. We didn't get any kind of ``tax warning'' from the IRS, \nbut the financial toll on many of my constituents was devastating.\n  Let me explain what happened. In June of last year, the IRS chief \ncounsel issued an advice letter that determined that FEMA disaster \nmitigation benefits were taxable as a matter of law. This ruling \napplied to a variety mitigation grant programs, covering a wide range \nof natural disasters. The main disasters that concern us in Louisiana \nare hurricanes and flooding. They are as much a part of life as \ncrawfish boils and Mardi Gras. The key to our peace of mind is the \nNational Flood Insurance program administered by FEMA. In Louisiana, \n377,000 property owners participate in the National Flood Insurance \nprogram. It is a real Godsend to the people of my state.\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\n  The National Flood Insurance program also provides funding for \nproperty owners to flood-proof their homes through the flood mitigation \ngrant program. FEMA distributes these grant funds to the States which \nthen pass them along to local communities. The local communities select \nproperties for mitigation and contract for the mitigation services. \nCommunities use these funds to put homes on stilts, improve drainage on \nproperty, and to acquire flood proofing materials. These mitigation \ngrants encourage property owners to take responsible steps to lessen \nthe potential for loss of life and property damage due to future \nflooding. The grants also have the added benefit of saving money in the \nlong term for the flood insurance program.\n  But the IRS has turned this valuable disaster preparedness and \nprevention program into a financial disaster for responsible property \nowners by making these payments taxable. This tax is unfair, \nunexpected, and an unfortunate policy decision--unfair and unexpected \nbecause no one told my constituents that they would be taxed for \naccepting FEMA disaster mitigation assistance. The local officials in \ntheir parish were just as surprised. This tax is unfortunate policy \nbecause in the long term, the IRS will undercut the effectiveness of \nusing mitigation as a means of decreasing future costs to the flood \ninsurance program. It will force people to take risks that they will \nnot be hit by a disaster.\n  I was pleased that the House of Representatives passed a bill, H.R. \n1134, to correct this problem. It says that going forward, disaster \nmitigation benefits are not taxable. But this legislation is not \nretroactive. It offers no relief to people who are facing a huge tax \nbill this Friday, April 15, for mitigation funding received in 2004 or \nearlier years. Virtually every constituent who has written or called my \noffice about this issue received their grant in 2004. This bill will do \nnothing for them.\n  I understand that the sponsors of H.R. 1134 and its Senate version S. \n586 claim that once it has been passed, the Department of the Treasury \nwill issue some sort of notice to IRS field personnel essentially \nmaking the effect of this bill retroactive. Treasury officials, \nhowever, cannot cite a legal justification for issuing such a notice. \nThey claim that they can rely on the floor statements of the chairs and \nranking members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate \nFinance Committee as a basis for issuing the notice.\n  Mr. President, we cannot legislate on a wink and a nod. The right way \nto make this relief retroactive is to pass the Baucus-Grassley \namendment to H.R. 1134 and send it back to the House. This amendment \nwill extend the tax relief in this bill to all recipients of FEMA \ndisaster mitigation assistance past, present, and future. I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor of the amendment. I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee for their leadership in bringing this \nmatter to the floor.\n  April 15th is 2 days away. I urge the other body to take up and pass \nH.R. 1134 as amended by the Senate, and send it to the President for \nhis signature. This bill will bring peace of mind to thousands of \nresponsible property owners who face an unfair tax burden. We should \nnot allow April 15th to pass without giving these people relief.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk. I ask that the amendment be considered and agreed to; the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 411) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, I rise today for the second year in a row \nto recognize the recent achievement of the University of Denver Hockey \nTeam. On April 9, 2005, almost a year to the day that they won the 2004 \nMen's NCAA Division I Championship on the frigid ice of a Boston arena, \nthe Pioneers repeated their amazing feat capturing a second national \ntitle in Columbus, OH at this year's Frozen Four. On this particular \nevening the University of Denver Pioneers defeated the North Dakota \nFighting Sioux by a score of 4-1, clinching a seventh overall hockey \nchampionship.\n  At the helm of the University of Denver hockey team for the last 11 \nyears has been coach George Gwozdecky. Coach Gwozdecky came to DU in \n1994 and has compiled an impressive record at DU, including his 400th \nwin as a coach a few short weeks ago and his 405th win in the national \ntitle game. Coach Gwozdecky has shaped the Pioneer program into one of \nthe elite programs in all of collegiate sports, and he is the only NCAA \ncoach to win a national hockey title as a player, assistant coach, and \nhead coach.\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n  Later today the University of Denver campus will host a rally in \nhonor of the Pioneer hockey champions. While I regret that I can not be \nthere in person to commend this fantastic team, I would like to honor \njust a few of the great players that made this repeat championship \npossible. Freshman Peter Mannino, named the Most Outstanding Player of \nthis year's Frozen Four, made an astonishing 44 saves in the \nchampionship game including a 23 shot barrage in the third period. \nForward Paul Stastny scored two of the Pioneer's four goals with Jeff \nDrummond and Gabe Gauthier each adding one. Five Pioneers, Forwards \nGauthier and Stastny, Defensemen Matt Carle and Brett Skinner, and \ngoalie Mannino were named to the All-Tournament Team.\n  Today I share my congratulations with the entire University of Denver \ncommunity. Winning a national title is a rare and precious \naccomplishment. Winning two championships in a row is all the more \nrare. This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication of many \npeople. Congratulations to all the DU Pioneers. Congratulations to \nChancellor Daniel Ritchie, Provost Bob Coombe, President Mark Holtzman, \nInterim Director of Athletics Stuart Halsall, Coach Gwozdecky and his \nstaff, and especially the Pioneer players, students and fans. You have \nmade us all very proud.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

GRIFFIN TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE NATIONAL \n                  AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Commerce Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of Michael Griffin to be the Administrator of NASA, and \nthat the Senate proceed to executive session for its consideration. I \nfinally ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements be \nprinted in the Record, the President then be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n             National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n  Michael D. Griffin, of Virginia, to be Administrator of the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration represents our Nation's greatest hopes and aspirations. \nPresident Bush nominated Dr. Michael D. Griffin to be the next NASA \nAdministrator on March 14, 2005. Dr. Griffin takes over an agency that \nis embarking on the President's Vision for Space Exploration, which \nwill take America back to the moon and eventually to Mars. The Vision \nis NASA's biggest mission since the Apollo program began more than 40 \nyears ago. Dr. Griffin will guide NASA on the first steps of this \nimportant journey that will define America's presence in space for the \nnext several decades. At the same time, we still mourn the loss of the \nColumbia's crew as NASA readies the Space Shuttle for its return to \nflight next month. Dr. Griffin's first task will be to ensure that the \nshuttle program gets back on its feet safely and effectively. NASA \nneeds its next Administrator immediately, and I thank the Senate for \nagreeing to the request from Senator Inouye and myself to discharge and \napprove this nomination.\n  Dr. Griffin's extensive background in space and science will serve \nhim and NASA well. He is currently head of the Space Department at the \nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Previously, Dr. \nGriffin was President and Chief Operating Officer of In-Q-Tel, an \nindependent, nonprofit venture group chartered to identify and invest \nin cutting-edge commercial technologies for intelligence community \napplications. He has also served as CEO of the Magellan Systems \nDivision of Orbital Sciences Corporation, as General Manager of \nOrbital's Space Systems Group, and as the company's Executive Vice \nPresident/Chief Technical Officer. Prior to joining Orbital, he was \nSenior Vice President for Program Development at Space Industries \nInternational, and General Manager of the Space Industries Division in \nHouston.\n  Dr. Griffin has served in a number of Governmental positions. With \nNASA, he served as both the Chief Engineer and the Associate \nAdministrator for Exploration, and within the Department of Defense--\nDOD--he served as the Deputy for Technology at the Strategic Defense \nInitiative Organization--SDIO. Before joining SDIO, Dr. Griffin played \na leading role in numerous space missions while employed at the Johns \nHopkins APL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Computer Sciences \nCorporation. He holds seven degrees in the fields of physics, \nelectrical engineering, aerospace engineering, civil engineering, and \nbusiness administration, and has been an Adjunct Professor at the \nGeorge Washington University, the Johns Hopkins University, and the \nUniversity of Maryland. He is the lead author on more than two dozen \ntechnical papers and the textbook Space Vehicle Design. He is a \nrecipient of the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal and the DOD \nDistinguished Public Service Medal. He is also a Registered \nProfessional Engineer in Maryland and California, and a Certified \nFlight Instructor with instrument and multi-engine ratings.\n  Dr. Griffin succeeds a close friend and former leader of my staff, \nSean O'Keefe. Sean did an admirable job getting the agency's finances \nunder control and, more importantly, holding NASA together after the \nColumbia tragedy. We were lucky NASA had such a leader during that \ntrying time. At the Commerce Committee's hearing on Dr. Griffin's \nnomination I spoke of my recent travels with Sean, during which I was \napproached repeatedly by people who raved about Dr. Griffin. They all \nsaid he was the man for the job if he could be convinced to accept it. \nI am pleased the President appointed Dr. Griffin and I look forward to \nworking closely with him and his team of talented professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/13/senate-section/article/S3606-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
