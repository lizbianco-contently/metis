Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation in the \nSenate dealing with a critically important subject. I am proud to say \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania, Arlen Specter, joined me as \ncosponsor of this legislation. It deals particularly with the murder of \nyoung women in this country by sexual predators.\n  We all know the story recently about the murder of Jessica Lunsford. \nJessica Lunsford was a 9-year-old young girl abducted in February from \nthe bedroom of her home in Florida. Her body was found a month later. \nThe crime was allegedly committed by a 46-year-old convicted sex \noffender with a 30-year criminal history.\n  More recently, we all remember the April 9 abduction of Sarah \nMichelle Lunde from her family's mobile home south of Tampa, FL. A \nconvicted sex offender who had once had a relationship with the girl's \nmother has now confessed to killing her.\n  In March, Jetseta Gage of Cedar Rapids, IA, was abducted, sexually \nassaulted, and murdered. A convicted sex offender on Iowa's sex \noffender registry was charged with that crime and arrested for that \ncrime.\n  In August of last year, a 6-year-old Nebraska girl whose name has \nbeen withheld was sexually assaulted by a 39-year-old convicted sex \noffender.\n  We all remember the case of Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old who was \nkidnapped and murdered by a previously diagnosed sex offender.\n  There was a young woman in my State named Dru Sjodin who was murdered \nin late 2003. Walking out of the\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nshopping center into a parking lot about 5 in the afternoon, she \napparently was abducted by a formerly convicted sex offender who has \nnow been charged with this crime.\n  Dru Sjodin was a wonderful young woman. She was, as has been the case \nwith these other circumstances, the innocent victim of a sex offender. \nAlfonso Rodriguez has been charged in her case. Alfonso Rodriguez \nserved 23 years in prison as a violent sexual predator. He was deemed \nby prison officials to be a high-risk offender who would reoffend when \nreleased. He was nonetheless released from prison, and within 6 months \nhe allegedly murdered Dru Sjodin.\n  I have introduced a law called ``Dru's Law.'' It is supported by Mr. \nLunsford, Mr. Klaas, and so many other families who have been visited \nby these tragedies.\n  Dru's Law does three things. First, it says there should be a \nnational registry of convicted sex offenders. There is not one now. \nThere are State registries but not a national registry. Many Americans \nlive near a State border. If they check their State registry of who the \nviolent sex offenders are in their region, they will find out who is in \ntheir State but not who is 5 or 20 miles away across the border. There \nshould be a national registry of convicted sex offenders, No. 1.\n  No. 2, if a high-risk sex offender is about to be released from \nprison and if that person is deemed to be at high risk for committing \nanother violent offense, the local State's attorneys must be notified \nthat this high-risk sex offender is about to be released so they can \nseek further civil commitment if they believe it appropriate.\n  No. 3, if, in fact, a high-risk sex offender is released from prison \nand there is no further civil commitment, there must be monitoring of \nthat sex offender upon release. There cannot be at the prison door a \nwave and say: So long, you served your 23 years, have a good life. \nThere must be high-level monitoring.\n  It is unbelievable to me that we know the names of these people who \nare committing these murders because they have been behind bars and \nthey are released despite the fact that psychiatrists, psychologists, \nand others judge them to be at high risk for reoffending. I don't want \nto see the list of victims, which includes Dru Sjodin, Polly Klaas, \nJessica Lunsford, and Sarah Lunde, get longer. We can do something \nabout this. We can pass this legislation.\n  Incidentally, this legislation which I reintroduced now with Arlen \nSpecter was passed by unanimous consent last year. We did not get it \nthrough the House, but I have now reintroduced it. I am going to try \nagain, and I hope this time that this legislation gets to the \nPresident's desk for signature. It is long past the time that we do \nwhat is necessary to save lives. We ought not any longer accept the \nstatus quo. Violent sexual predators need to be identified, need to be \non a national registry, and need to be either recommitted, if they are \nat high risk for reoffending, or there needs to be high-level \nmonitoring when they are released. That is simply the case.\n  How much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota has \nconsumed 6 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S3960-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR OPTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on another subject, this morning I read \nsome very troubling comments by a member of the House leadership, on \nthe subject of judges. I normally would not comment about remarks made \nby a member of the House, but we face in the Senate the prospect of \nwhat some are calling the nuclear option. This relates to an attempt by \nan arrogant majority to violate the rules of the Senate, in order to \nchange the rules with respect to the confirmation of judicial \nnominations. Because of the real possibility that this so-called \nnuclear option will be exercised, I wish to react to some of these \nthings that have been said about judges.\n  Judges serve for a lifetime. There are two steps to put a judge on \nthe bench for a lifetime. One, the President must nominate. Second, the \nSenate advises and consents. In other words, the Senate decides whether \nit agrees a judge is fit for service for a lifetime.\n  It is not unusual for the Senate to decide that a judicial nominee by \na President should not go forward. In fact, that happened to America's \nfirst President, George Washington. He lost one of his judicial \nnominations.\n  The Senate has approved 205 out of 215 Federal judicial nominations \nsent to us by President Bush. Because we have only approved 205 out of \n215, which is 95 percent-plus, because there are a few who we have \nselected who we would not want to confirm, there are those who speak of \nchanging the Senate rules, and to do so by violating the Senate rules. \nThat is called the nuclear option.\n  What is the origin of all of this? Some of it has been described in \nstark terms by colleagues in the Congress. It is that they would like \nto define what good behavior means for judges. They do not agree with \nsome judicial rulings, so they want to impeach Supreme Court Justices.\n  They must have missed that course in high school and college that \ntalked about checks and balances, as well as the course that talked \nabout separation of powers. Some in the Congress believe the judiciary \nought to report to them and believe America's judiciary ought to \nconform to their interests, to their notions, of how to read our \nConstitution.\n  It reminds me again that there is a very big difference between an \nopen mind and an empty head when I hear people talking about how we \nmust find ways to get the Federal judiciary to bend to the will of the \nCongress. That is exactly what our Framers did not intend to have \nhappen.\n  Let me say again, we have confirmed 205 of 215 requested lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench offered to us by this President. That \nis an incredibly good record. But because 10 have not been confirmed--\nbecause this Congress has decided not to be a rubberstamp for lifetime \nappointments on the Federal bench--we have some who have decided they \nwant to break the Senate rules in order to change the Senate rules. I \nread in today's papers we have others who are deciding they would like \nto take a crack at impeaching Federal judges and bend the Federal \njudiciary to the will of the majority here in the Congress.\n  I think it is arrogant and I think it is dangerous and I think most \nof the American people would believe the same.\n  I hope, as we proceed in the coming days, there will be some sober \nreflection among those who understand the roles of those in this \ninstitution and the judiciary, who understand the separation of powers, \nand who understand checks and balances. If that is the case, those who \nnow talk about the so-called nuclear option will rethink their \nposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S3960-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3960-S3962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, once again, today, President Bush is going \nto talk about the rising cost of gas and how it is hurting Americans at \nthe pump. He is going to talk again about our dangerous dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Last weekend, President Bush used his radio address to urge Americans \nto support his energy legislation. He said, and I quote him:\n\n       American families and small businesses across the country \n     are feeling the pinch from rising gas prices.\n\n  President Bush is right. The fact is American families are \nstruggling. But unfortunately he is wrong about his support of the \nenergy bill and his approach. The issue is not that the President \ndoesn't understand the problem; it is that he does not have a real \nsolution. He has not proposed the kinds of steps that are staring us in \nthe face, available to us to be able to put together a real energy \npolicy for the country. The energy plan he continues to campaign for \nwill, in fact, make the United States more dependent on foreign oil, it \nwill keep gas prices at record highs instead of making them affordable \nfor consumers, and it will make our air and our water more polluted \ninstead of investing in a cleaner future. These are pretty stark \nchoices. Each and every one of them, on examination, is proven in the \nways in which this administration has moved backwards on enforcement, \nbackwards with respect to its\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\ncommitment to a major independent energy policy for the Nation.\n  What we need to do is provide the Nation with sound solutions that \nare going to create jobs, instill a greater confidence in our \nrelationships with other countries, and begin to move away from that \ndependency and to excite the economy through the creation of those \nkinds of jobs and the commitment to new technologies and to the \nresearch and development to create them.\n  The crisis, as it is currently unfolding, affects our economy. It is \na drag on the economy, a drag on growth, a drag on our security, and it \nis obviously harming our environment.\n  The status quo energy policies the President is promoting are also \nhurting consumers at the pump, and no amount of taxpayer-funded, \ncampaign-style events are going to cover up this reality because the \nevidence is plain for everybody to see at gas stations all across the \ncountry. People are now paying an average of $2.28 a gallon at the \npump. That is up 6 cents in the last week and over 50 cents in the last \nyear.\n  All of this has been predictable. The rise of demand in China and the \nrise of demand in less-developed nations has been there for every \neconomist to lay out over the course of the last years. Notwithstanding \nthe rise in demand and the competition for available oil resources, the \nUnited States continues down the same old road. All of the hype about \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge or other sources is never going to make up \nfor the reality of how much of the oil reserves are actually available \nto the United States versus that increasing demand curve.\n  For the fourth week in a row, gas prices are at an all-time high. \nThey have now increased a staggering 56 percent since 2001. A recent \nGallup survey revealed that 44 percent of Americans believe it is \nextremely important for Congress and the President to address gas \nprices. But you only need to look at the legislation that is promoted \nby the President, and set to be voted on in the House this week, to see \nthat, yet again, Washington is turning its back on common sense and \nturning its back on the best interests of the American people.\n\n  Under this administration, higher gas prices cost American consumers \nan extra $34 billion. If the House passes this bill, the Senate passes \nit, and the President signs it, it will cost the American consumer $34 \nbillion. Airlines, truckers, and farmers spent an extra $20 billion \nlast year alone. That is a regressive energy tax on the backs of \nworking Americans.\n  But the administration's friends got off a lot easier than the \naverage American. This energy bill is going to make their load even \nlighter. While American workers and families were struggling, oil \ncompanies earned record profits in the fourth quarter of 2004: \nExxonMobil, up 218 percent, ConocoPhillips, up 145 percent; Shell, up \n51 percent; ChevronTexaco, up 39 percent; and BP, up 35 percent.\n  Show me the American worker whose income has gone up by several \npercentage points, let alone double digits. Show me the American worker \nwhose income has risen so they can keep up with the higher cost of \nfuel.\n  What is the President proposing to do about this? Well, 95 percent of \nthe tax benefits included in the President's bill, the bill he \nsupports, more than $8 billion, goes directly into the pockets of big \noil and gas companies. At a time when oil prices are at historic highs, \nour energy policy ought to be aimed at investing in new and renewable \nsources of energy, not providing another big giveaway to special \ninterests, particularly to the big oil and gas companies that have had \nthese remarkable increases in their profits over the course of the last \nyear.\n  Simply put, what is good for the administration's contributors has \nnot been good for our economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nhas said:\n\n       Markets for oil and natural gas have been subject to a \n     degree of strain over the past year not experienced for a \n     generation.\n\n  The Chairman of the President's own Council of Economic Advisors has \nadmitted:\n\n       High energy prices are now a drag on our economy.\n\n  But the problem goes even deeper. The administration's failure to \npropose a real energy policy also threatens our national security. We \nare more dependent on foreign oil than ever before, forcing us into \nrisky and even compromising political entanglements with nations that \nwe rely on for the fuel oil. America will never be fully secure until \nwe free ourselves from the noose of foreign oil.\n  Unfortunately, the so-called energy plan of the administration does \nnothing, nothing to reduce our dependency on foreign oil. Don't take my \nword for it. The President's own economists found that oil imports will \nactually increase 85 percent by 2025 under a proposal such as we see at \nthis point. The President's economists also found that ``changes to \nproduction, consumption, imports, and prices are negligible.''\n  You don't have to be an expert on oil or on energy policy to \nunderstand the basics of where we find ourselves. All you have to do is \nbe able to count. The United States of America only has 3 percent of \nthe world's oil reserves. That is all God gave us, 3 percent. Saudi \nArabia has 65 percent of the world's oil reserves. There is no possible \nway, with the current population growth, the current increase in demand \nfor oil, the current increases in other countries, no possible way for \nthe United States to drill its way to energy independence. We have to \ninvent our way to it.\n  But the President's energy policy is completely lacking in the major \ncommitment necessary. There are token commitments, yes, but not the \nmajor commitment you need in order to spur the investment strategies, \nin order to spur the research and development and the fast transition \nin the marketplace we need to provide for the alternative energy \nsources the country ought to demand.\n  The President's energy bill is not even a real Band-Aid on the energy \ncrisis that threatens our economy and challenges our national security. \nWhat it does do for sure is fatten the coffers of big energy companies.\n  There is a reason Senator McCain called the energy bill the No \nLobbyist Left Behind Act.\n  What kind of message do these policies send? If your profits go up, \nyour subsidies go up. If the policy makes us more dependent on foreign \noil, it makes the status quo even worse.\n  What we ought to be doing is something profoundly better than this, \nand we know we could. Energy policy gives us a rare opportunity to \naddress a whole series of challenges at the same time. If we end our \ndependence on foreign oil and move in that direction, then we begin \nto strengthen our national security, and we become more independent and \nmore capable of making choices that are less founded in that \ndependency. If we lead the world in inventing new energy technologies, \nwe create thousands of high-paying jobs in the United States, and we \ncreate products we can export and an expertise we can also export at \nthe same time. If we learn to tap clean sources of energy, then we \npreserve a clean environment, and we reduce the level of environment-\ninduced cancers and other problems we face. If we remove the burden of \nhigh gas prices, then American consumers will have more cash in their \npockets, more ability to spend elsewhere, and we give our economy the \nboost it needs.\n\n  Unfortunately, the energy bill before the Congress achieves none of \nthese fundamental goals in the way we could and in the way we need to, \ngiven the crisis we face. It is laden with handouts to corporate \ninterests. Over the period of the next days, I will lay out further the \nspecifics of those particular linkages and what they mean to us.\n  We have an opportunity to change the direction of our country, to \nchange our economy and make ourselves more secure and to create jobs. \nThe solutions to our energy crises, all of them, are staring us in the \nface. The fact is, a number of years ago, back in 1973, when the first \noil crisis hit, and then in the latter part of the 1970s, this country \ndid move to try to create a real policy of alternative energy. The \nresult was thousands of small companies started up around solar or wind \nor alternatives. But then, unfortunately, in the 1980s, the Government \npulled back from that commitment and many of those companies were lost \nand much of that technology shifted and was lost to Japan or to Germany \nor to other countries. The record of jobs lost versus jobs created and \nof opportunities lost\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\nversus opportunities seized is a clear one. It is long past time we get \nthe politics out of this and put practical, real and, in some cases, \nvisionary solutions on the table so we can strengthen our own economy, \nstrengthen our country, and provide ourselves with alternatives that \nwill make our Nation both healthier and safer at the same time.\n  I believe we owe the Nation more than staged political events and \nrhetoric in the effort to move to that future, and I hope we will do \nso.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, the saga of the judiciary continues on \nCapitol Hill. The Constitution of the United States, which we all keep \nclose at hand, makes it clear that there are three independent branches \nof Government. Each has an important role in the governance of this \ndemocracy. And certainly the independence of the judiciary is something \nwe have valued from the beginning of this Nation, for all the time that \nwe have enjoyed this great country. But it is under attack today from \nthe right wing of the Republican Party in a way that we have not seen \nin quite some time.\n  It was reported in this morning's paper that House Majority Leader \nTom DeLay, Republican of Texas, was interviewed by Tony Snow on Fox \nNEWS radio. Mr. DeLay said of the judges whom he has been critical of \nin the past, when asked if he would include any Supreme Court Justices \namong those he considered activist and isolated, he said Anthony M. \nKennedy, who was named to the Court by President Ronald Reagan.\n  Mr. DeLay said:\n\n       Absolutely. We've got Justice Kennedy writing decisions \n     based upon international law, not the Constitution of the \n     United States. That's just outrageous.\n\n  Mr. DeLay went on to say:\n\n       And not only that, but he--\n\n  Justice Kennedy--\n\n     said in session that he does his own research on the \n     Internet. That is just incredibly outrageous.\n\n  That is a direct quote from Tom DeLay--that a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt who does research on the Internet is one who is a judicial \nactivist.\n  Has the Internet become the devil's workshop? Is it some infernal \nmachine now that needs to be avoided by all right-thinking Americans? \nWhat is Mr. DeLay trying to say as he is stretching to lash out at \njudges who happen to disagree with his political point of view?\n  This coming Sunday, this saga will continue at a church in Kentucky \nwith the so-called ``Judge or Justice Sunday'' sponsored by the Family \nResearch Council. They are arguing that any time we question a nominee \nfrom the Bush White House we are attacking people of faith.\n  I can tell you, of the 205 judicial nominees we have approved of this \nPresident--and only 10 have not been approved--many of them were \nundoubtedly people of faith. I have to say ``undoubtedly'' because I \ncan't say for certain. Do you know why? Because this Constitution \nprohibits anyone from asking a person seeking a job with the Federal \nGovernment or a position in the Federal Government what their religious \nfaith happens to be. We cannot under the terms of article VI of the \nConstitution establish any religious test for office.\n  So now those who support the rejected nominees are saying they were \nrejected because of their faith.\n  You see what they are trying to do. They are trying to draw us into a \nposition where we are going to use religion as some sort of weapon in \nthis debate. That is a mistake.\n  The Constitution, which has carefully separated church and state \nthroughout our history, says to every American that they have a right \nof conscience to decide what they want to believe. When we start \nimposing religious tests, as some in the right would have us do, it is \na serious mistake.\n  As Mr. DeLay lashes out at Supreme Court Justices and others for \ntheir outrageous conduct in ``doing research on the Internet,'' and we \nsee these rallies that are attacking those who are upholding Senate \nrules and traditions of over 200 years based on some flawed \ninterpretation of our Constitution, we understand it is time for \nAmericans who really want to see moderate and balanced and fair judges \nto speak out.\n\n  We have to have the process where the rules are respected, where we \nhave checks and balances in our Government, and where people seeking \nlifetime appointments must demonstrate not only honesty and competency \nbut the fact that they are in tune with the values and the needs of the \nAmerican people. Unfortunately, in the case of 10 judges, many of us \nbelieve the nominees sent by the White House do not meet that test.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of President Bush's nominees have been \napproved. That is not enough for some, but I think it reflects the fact \nthat the Senate has a constitutional responsibility to look closely at \neach nominee and decide whether they are worthy of this lifetime \nappointment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S3962-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3962-S3965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, is it a religious test? Is it an \nenvironmental test? Is it a right-to-life test? Is it a racial test? \nNo. Now we say it is Tom DeLay's test.\n  If it weren't so deadly serious, it would be laughably humorous.\n  But the other side has reduced what is a tremendously important \nconstitutional responsibility of this Senate into a political game.\n  From the very outset, when the Bush administration came to town, \ntelegraphed across the Nation was a very clear message by our \ncolleagues from the other side. Inside their internal party politics \nand beyond, it was all about politics and who they would reject, or who \nthey would disallow the right to have a vote on the floor of the Senate \nwhen nominated by this President--if that nominee made it through the \nJudiciary Committee--whether they would be allowed to became a sitting \njudge in one of the courts of the United States for which the \nPresident, the Congress, and the Senate are responsible.\n  Religious test, environmental test, a right-to-life test, a racial \ntest, now a Tom DeLay test. Doesn't the other side have anything to \ntalk about nowadays? Don't they have a policy they can take to the \nAmerican people that will grasp the majority of the American people's \nminds or is it simply targeting around the edges?\n  It is deadly serious, and it is not humorous at all.\n  I rise today to discuss what is a most important constitutional \nconflict that has developed here in the Senate, and the response that I \nbelieve the Senate must act clearly and profoundly on this issue.\n  In the time that I have been in public office, I have watched the \nCongress and participated in the Congress in conflicts that some would \ncall historic by nature--an impeachment, a contested election, a \nmidsession shift of party control of the Senate, just to name a few.\n  But no issue, in my opinion, has threatened to alter the fundamental \narchitecture of Government in the way that it is now being threatened \ntoday by the conflict over judicial nominees.\n  Some of our colleagues have attempted to downplay the importance of \nthe issue. I think that is what you heard this morning--a reduction of \nthe issue to a debate about Tom DeLay's wisdom or a quote about the \nInternet. This is a lot more important than any one individual, \nincluding Tom DeLay.\n  This is really about the Constitution of the United States. They have \nattempted to call it, Well, it is ``just business as usual'' to oppose \nnominees. They have tried to portray it as insignificant in terms of \nthe number of judges. You just heard that a few moments ago about their \nselective filibuster. They say that is fair and full in the process.\n  They have characterized it as a simple political struggle between the \nparties. Well, it is political, but it is constitutional.\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n  In reality, this issue has the potential of altering the balance of \npower established by the Constitution between our two branches of \nGovernment.\n  I say this because the Constitution gives the Senate a role in \nPresidential appointments--the ability to accept or reject an \nappointment--and when a filibuster stops the Senate from taking that \nvote, it is frustrating the ability of all Senators to fulfill their \nconstitutional duty, to exercise their fundamental constitutional power \nand participate in the essential function of the executive.\n\n  A filibuster doesn't just prevent the Senate from acting, it also \nstops a nominee in midprocess without a final decision as to whether a \nnominee is confirmed or rejected, in essence giving the minority of \nSenators the power to prevent the executive branch from performing its \nconstitutional duty.\n  That is exactly what we have seen by design, by intent, and without \nquestion by votes.\n  Let me talk about a candidate specifically. Let me talk about my own \nhome State of Idaho and the President's nominee to the Ninth Circuit, \nBill Myers.\n  Bill has had a distinguished career as an attorney, particularly in \nthe area of natural resources and the public land laws of our country \nwhere he is nationally recognized by both sides as an expert. These are \nissues of particular importance to public land States in the West, such \nas Idaho, represented in the Ninth Circuit.\n  These issues aren't just professional business to him. In his private \nlife, he has also long been an outdoorsman, and he has spent a \nsignificant amount of time volunteering for the National Park Service.\n  Bill Myers is a public lands man. He loves it, he enjoys it, and he \nhas participated in it. He came to this Senate to work for a former \nSenator, Allen Simpson, Deputy General Counsel at the Department of \nEnergy, and Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States. The \nSenate confirmed him by unanimous consent as the Solicitor to the \nDepartment of the Interior in 2001.\n  The entire Idaho delegation supports him.\n  So what is wrong with Bill Myers? Is it a partisan issue? No. \nDemocrat Governor of Idaho, Cecil Andrus, Secretary of the Interior for \nPresident Carter, said Bill Myers is a man of great ``personal \nintegrity, judicial temperament, and legal experience,'' as well as he \nhas ``the ability to act fairly on matters of law that will come before \nhim on the court.'' Democratic Governor from Wyoming, Mike Sullivan, \nsaid the same thing.\n  So what is wrong with Bill Myers? Why, when last year the Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted him out, to send him to the Senate floor, did \nhe never get a vote? Why was he refused a vote and filibustered?\n  Let me tell you why. I know it firsthand. I served on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I watched the vote. And the day the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voted him to the floor of the Senate, a senior member from \nthe other side of that committee walked out with me and said: You know, \nLarry, your nominee is not going to get a vote on the floor.\n  They had planned it well in advance. They had picked Bill Myers like \nthey have picked other judicial nominees for their political pawn. The \nconversation went on, but it was private and I don't divulge it.\n  But I will say this: From the conversation, I understood very clearly \nwhy Bill Myers would not get a vote and why they would filibuster him. \nIt was just prior to the election, a very important election, a \nPresidential election. They had already picked the candidate they could \nargue had racial undertones. They had already picked the candidate they \nbelieved might be pro-life. They had already picked other candidates \nwho didn't fit their political demographics. They picked Bill Myers \nbecause of his environmental record, and they told me so.\n  Is that picking a person because of their talent, because of their \nexperience, because of their judicial temperament, or is it simply \nplaying what I call the ``nominee process of political roulette''? Pick \nthe candidate who serves your political purpose and prove to your \nconstituent base that you are out there for them.\n  If that is what the nominating process has reduced itself to, then we \nare not only in a constitutional crisis--we are without question in a \npolitical constitutional crisis. No. What we do is important in the \nSenate. We affect the lives of all Americans in one way or another. But \nwe have a constitutional responsibility when it comes to judges who are \nnominated by our President who are sent forth by the Judiciary \nCommittee of this Senate once fully vetted and interviewed and \nquestioned.\n  Once the majority of that committee has spoken, and that nominee \ncomes to the floor of the Senate, I firmly believe that nominee \ndeserves an up-or-down vote. That is the history of the Senate. That is \nthe responsibility of advice and consent. That is what this Senate has \ndone down through the decades.\n  But not now. Not in the politics of the other side. It does not serve \ntheir purpose anymore. So they have reduced it to the rhetoric of \nsaying this is normal; this is usual; this is the politics of the day. \nThose Republicans are being terribly political at this moment.\n  I don't agree with that. I have watched this much too long. It is now \ntime the Senate act to establish once again our constitutional role in \nthe advice and consent with the executive branch of Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge our leadership and the \nrest of my colleagues in the Senate to preserve the significance of our \nresponsibility, enumerated in the Constitution, and to work together to \naddress the judicial crisis that threatens to severely damage our \nsystem.\n  As Members of the Senate, we each bring our own unique background and \nexperience to this institution. And our progress as a body often \nrequires us to make difficult decisions as individuals. While our \nindividual positions on various issues will certainly differ, we must \nstand together to repair the judicial confirmation process in this \nbody.\n  Several judicial vacancies have been lingering in our courts for \nyears, causing many jurisdictions, including one in my home State of \nNorth Carolina, to be declared ``judicial emergencies.'' It is our \nresponsibility as Senators to respond to these judicial emergencies \nwith action and determination.\n  It is inexcusable that we allow judicial vacancies to linger for 6 \nyears or, in some cases, longer. Such is the case for the people of my \nState in the Eastern District of North Carolina. The North Carolina \nEastern District post is the longest district court vacancy in the \nNation--a seat vacant since 1997. In 1999, the administrative office of \nthe courts declared the district a ``judicial emergency'' and it has \nbeen categorized this way for the last 6 years.\n  In North Carolina we face challenges on the appellate level as well. \nThere are 15 circuit court judgeships in the Fourth Circuit but only \none of these is occupied by a North Carolina judge. North Carolina is \nsignificantly underrepresented at the circuit court level. A great deal \nof this can, of course, be attributed to the political nature of the \ndebate surrounding nominations to the Fourth Circuit. All North \nCarolinians deserve another voice on the Fourth Circuit.\n  Judge Boyle, currently serving as a District Court judge for the \nEastern District of North Carolina, was nominated in May, 2001, by the \nPresident to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The American \nBar Association has unanimously rated Judge Boyle as ``well-\nqualified,'' and has stated he would make an outstanding appellate \njudge.\n  The act of merely considering Judge Boyle's nomination should not be \na political issue for this distinguished body. Unfortunately, over the \npast few years it has become one. Before the 108th Congress, when Judge \nBoyle was first nominated, no judicial nomination which had a clear \nmajority of Senators supporting the nomination was ever prevented from \nreceiving an up-or-down vote. This current judicial confirmation \nsituation is unprecedented.\n  We should put aside the grievances that have prevented the \nconsideration of judges through the past three Presidential \nadministrations and work together to find a solution. As Senators we \nmust face this crisis with optimism and confidence. Working together we \nmust address this situation directly because I believe that our \nconstituents do\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\nnot hope for, nor do they expect, inaction from us on such an important \npart of our system of government. Partisan bickering or avoidance of \nour procedural challenges is not a responsible course of action.\n  Let me be clear. I believe if one of my colleagues objects to a \nparticular judicial nominee, it is certainly appropriate and fair for \nmy colleague to vote against that nominee on the Senate floor. But \ndenying these patriotic Americans, of both parties, who seek to serve \nthis country an up-or-down vote is simply not fair, and it certainly \nwas not the intention of our Founding Fathers when they designed and \ncreated this very institution.\n  As our country plants the seeds of democracy across the world, we \nhave the essential obligation to continue to operate as the model. The \nintegrity of the judicial system is vital and will certainly suffer as \na result of inaction. Maintaining our Nation's long-standing \ndistinction requires that its legislature act to ensure harmony and \nbalance among its citizens and its branches of government.\n  We need to fix this broken process. We need to end the judicial \ncrisis. And we need to vote on our judges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to finish my \nstatement if it goes a little bit longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in Lewis Carroll's book ``Through the \nLooking Glass,'' Humpty Dumpty has a famous exchange with Alice in \nwhich he says:\n\n       When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean--\n     neither more nor less.\n\n  Many partisans in the debate over judicial nominations or \nappointments in the Senate and among interest groups, particularly, \nhave the same attitude. Let me offer two examples. One is, they play \ngames with the word ``filibuster.'' The current filibusters against \njudicial nominations have four features: First, they involve defeating \nattempts to end debate such as defeating a motion to invoke cloture \nunder rule XXII; second, they target nominations with clear bipartisan \nmajority support that would be approved if there were a confirmation \nvote; three, they are not about debating these nominations but about \ndefeating them; and fourth, these filibusters are completely partisan, \norganized, and driven by party leaders.\n  For 2 years, Democrats have claimed these filibusters are nothing \nnew, that they happened before the 108th Congress. Last Friday, the \ndistinguished assistant minority leader Senator Durbin offered his \nevidence. He printed in the Record a document titled ``History of \nFilibusters and Judges.'' It was a list of 12 judicial nominations \nwhich it said ``needed 60 (or more) votes--cloture--in order to end a \nfilibuster.''\n  Yet these are filibusters only if, as Humpty Dumpty put it, the word \nfilibuster means whatever you choose it to mean.\n  Listed first is the 1881 nomination of Stanley Matthews to the \nSupreme Court. President Rutherford B. Hayes nominated Matthews shortly \nbefore leaving office and the Judiciary Committee postponed \nconsideration. Hayes' successor, President James Garfield, renominated \nMatthews on March 14, 1881, and the Senate confirmed him on May 12. \nThat is hardly a filibuster, yet that is the big news. They have looked \nso hard to try to find some justification for the inappropriate actions \nthey have taken in the Senate.\n  Two days ago, Senator Nelson of Florida repeated Senator Durbin's \nclaim that this was the first judicial nomination filibuster in \nAmerican history. That claim also appears on the Web site of the \nleftwing Alliance for Justice whose president is shopping it around on \nthe talk radio circuit.\n  This claim is incomprehensible. There was no cloture vote on the \nMatthews nomination for a very simple reason: Our cloture rule would \nnot exist, would not even come into existence, for another 36 years. \nNor were 60 votes needed even for confirmation since the Senate \ncontained only 76 Members.\n  If, as Senator Durbin apparently urges, we today use the Matthews \nnomination as a model, we would debate judicial nominations, including \nthose resubmitted after a Presidential election, and then vote them up \nor down because that is what happened in the Matthews case they used as \nan example of a filibuster. Humpty Dumpty would be proud of them.\n  The other nominations on Senator Durbin's list fare no better. \nAppeals court nominees Rosemary Barkett and Daniel Manion are on the \nfilibuster list even though we did not take a cloture vote on them. \nBoth of them were confirmed and currently sit on the bench.\n  Eight others, including Republican nominee Edward Carnes and \nDemocratic nominee Stephen Breyer, are on the list even though the \nSenate voted to invoke cloture on their nominations. The purpose was to \nget to the vote up and down.\n  Abe Fortas is on the list even though his nomination was withdrawn \nafter a failed cloture vote showed he did not have majority support and \nthe opposition was solidly bipartisan--almost as many Democrats as \nthere were Republicans. It was not an all-Democrat filibuster such as \nthese have been.\n  Here is the kicker: Eleven of the 112 nominees on Senator Durbin's \nfilibuster list were confirmed by the Senate--all 11 of them--with 9 of \nthem sitting on the Federal bench today. And as for Fortas, President \nLyndon Johnson withdrew his nomination, not because there was a \nfilibuster, because no less an authority than Robert Griffin, former \nSenator from Michigan, who had a reputation of impeccable honesty, has \nsaid that there was no filibuster. They had the votes to defeat Fortas \nup and down. They wanted 2 more days of debate so they could make the \ncase better, but Fortas was going to be defeated up and down. So there \nwas no filibuster there either.\n  But even if there were, and even if you could stretch it and say \nthere were, it was a bipartisan filibuster, if you could use the term \nfilibuster, with almost as many Democrats as Republicans voting against \nFortas. But I would take Senator Griffin's word on that, a man of \nimpeccable honesty, who said there was no intent to filibuster by any \nRepublican or Democrat on that nomination.\n  None of these situations bears any resemblance to the filibuster of \nmajority-supported judicial nominations underway today.\n  Let me put this as clearly as I can. Not taking a cloture vote is no \nprecedent for taking a cloture vote. Ending debate is no precedent for \nnot ending debate. Confirming judicial nominations is no precedent for \nnot confirming judicial nominations. And withdrawing nominations \nlacking majority support is no precedent for refusing to vote on \nnominations that have majority support.\n  The second word they play on is ``extremists.'' Democrats and their \nleftwing interest group allies tell us they only use the filibuster \nagainst what they call extremist nominees. Trying to define this label, \nhowever, is like trying to nail Jell-O to a cactus in the Utah desert. \nLike the Constitution in the hand of an activist judge, it means \nwhatever you want it to mean.\n  No matter what the word means, this word extremist, Senators who \ntruly believe a judicial nominee is an extremist may vote against him. \nThey have a right to vote against anybody they think is an extremist. \nBut this is no argument for refusing to vote in the first place.\n  As our colleague Senator Kennedy said in February, 1998:\n\n       We owe it to Americans across the country to give these \n     nominees a vote. If our . . . colleagues don't like them, \n     vote against them. But give them the vote.\n\n  I wonder why the change today? I think he meant that statement back \nthen. Why doesn't he mean it today?\n  In September, 1999, the Judiciary Committee ranking member Senator \nLeahy similarly said our oath of office requires us to vote up or down \non judicial nominations. Why the change today? It seems to me he meant \nit back then.\n  Priscilla Owen, nominated by President Bush to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, was reelected to the Texas Supreme Court \nin 2000, with 84 percent of the vote. There was no major party \nopposition, and the endorsement of every major newspaper in the State \nof Texas. Yet her opponents on the other side call her an extremist.\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nNo fewer than 15 presidents of the State bar of Texas, Democrats and \nRepublicans, strongly endorse her nomination. Yet these opponents call \nher an extremist.\n\n  She has been praised by groups such as the Texas Association of \nDefense Counsel and Legal Aid of Central Texas. Yet her opponents call \nher an extremist.\n  The American Bar Association, often referred to by our friends on the \nother side as the ``gold standard'' to determine whether a person can \nsit on the bench, unanimously gave Justice Owen its highest rating of \n``well qualified.'' This means she has outstanding legal ability and \nbreadth of experience, the highest reputation for integrity, and such \nqualities as compassion, openmindedness, freedom from bias, and \ncommitment to equal justice under law. Yet some of the very Democrats \nwho once said the ABA rating was the gold standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees now call Justice Owen an extremist.\n  Another nominee branded an extremist is California Supreme Court \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe DC Circuit. She is the daughter of Alabama sharecroppers. She \nattended segregated schools before receiving her law degree from the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles--in other words, UCLA. She has \nspent a quarter century in public service, serving in all three \nbranches of State government.\n  Off the bench, she has given speeches in which she expressed certain \nideas through vivid images, strong rhetoric, and provocative argument. \nYet it is what she does on the bench that matters most, and there she \nhas been an evenhanded, judicious, and impartial justice on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court.\n  George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley knows the \ndifference and recently wrote in the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       But however inflammatory her remarks outside the courtroom, \n     Brown's legal opinions show a willingness to vote against \n     conservative views, particularly in criminal cases, when \n     justice demands it.\n\n  In recent terms, Justice Brown has written more majority opinions \nthan any of her colleagues on the California Supreme Court. Yet some in \nthis body brand her an extremist. How can that be? Again, Humpty Dumpty \nwould be proud of this type of misuse of words.\n  A group of California law professors, including Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents, wrote to our Judiciary Committee to say \nthat Justice Brown's strongest credential is her openmindedness and \nthorough appraisal of legal argumentation ``even when her personal \nviews conflict with those arguments.'' Yet some leftwing extremist \ngroups call her an extremist.\n  A diverse group of her current and former judicial colleagues wrote \nus that Justice Brown is ``a jurist who applies the law without favor, \nwithout bias, and with an even hand.'' It is no wonder that 76 percent \nof her fellow Californians voted to retain her in her State's highest \ncourt. Yet her opponents call her an extremist.\n  If words mean anything, if we in the Senate really want to have a \nmeaningful and responsible debate about such important things, then we \nshould stop playing games with words such as ``filibuster'' or \n``extremist.'' There is no precedent whatsoever for these partisan, \norganized filibusters intended to defeat majority supported judicial \nnominations and, I might add, bipartisan majority supported judicial \nnominations.\n  If Senators believe such highly qualified nominees, who know the \ndifference between personal and judicial opinions and are widely \npraised for their integrity and impartiality, are extremists, then they \nshould vote against them. But these people should be given an \nopportunity by having an up-and-down vote. Let's have a full and fair \ndebate. Perhaps the critics will win the day against one or more of \nthese nominees. I doubt it. But we must vote. That is what advise and \nconsent means.\n  Mr. President, as I close, let me return to the 1881 Matthews \nnomination for a moment, the one they have had to stretch to try to \nclaim was a filibuster.\n  In the 47th Congress, a Senate equally divided between Republicans \nand Democrats confirmed Justice Matthews by a single vote. No doubt, \nsome opponents called him many things, perhaps even an extremist. Well, \nI doubt that because that has not happened until President Bush became \nPresident, as far as I can see in the way it has happened here. But we \nsettled the controversy surrounding the Matthews nomination the old-\nfashioned way--not by filibustering but by debating and voting up and \ndown. There is no question we should return to that standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we made good progress on this legislation \nyesterday. We considered a number of amendments. We were able to accept \nsome in terms of being able to agree that they be adopted on voice \nvote. We had some rollcall votes on others. We are pleased that \nSenators cooperated with our committee. We hope to complete action on \nthis bill today, certainly by tomorrow. But if we move with dispatch to \nconsider the amendments that we know about, it is likely we can finish \ntoday, with the cooperation of all Senators. We appreciate that very \nmuch.\n  I know the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, has an amendment \nrelating to PL 480 accounts, and we are prepared to consider that \namendment at this time if he wishes to send it to the desk and offer it \nfor the Senate's consideration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 380\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 380 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. KOHL], for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Inouye, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Coleman, \n     Mr. Obama, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered \n     380.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpopse: To provide supplemental funding for international food \n                              assistance)\n\n       On page 171, line 2 strike ``$150,000,000'' and all through \n     line 6 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``$470,000,000 to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That from this amount, to the maximum extent \n     possible, funding shall be restored to the previously \n     approved fiscal year 2005 programs under section 204(a)(2) of \n     the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of \n     1954: Provided further, That of the funds provided under this \n     heading, $12,000,000 shall be available to carry out programs \n     under the Food for Progress Act of 1985: Provided further, \n     That the amount provided under this heading is designated as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the \n     conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 95 (108th \n     Congress).''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this amendment increases funding for Public \nLaw 480 Title II to provide food assistance to people around the world \nwhere the need is urgent. Senator DeWine joins me as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I also announce that the amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Harkin, Durbin, Leahy, Mikulski, Inouye, Landrieu, Murray, \nDorgan, Coleman, Obama, and Corzine.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add Senators Johnson, Roberts, Dole, \nLugar, Bingaman, Sarbanes, Nelson of Nebraska, and Hagel as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Our amendment increases the food aid amount by $320 million \nfor a total of $470 million. This is not an arbitrary figure but, \nrather, was designed to meet three definite objectives.\n  First, our amendment is crafted to meet the U.S. share of emergency \nfood aid assistance needs that have already been identified for fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  Second, it restores funds for food aid development programs that are \nvital to end the cycle of starvation in the world's poorest nations. \nThese funds were diverted to meet worsening conditions in the Darfur \nregion of Sudan, and our amendment simply restores them to their \noriginal food aid purpose.\n  Third, our amendment restores funding for the Food for Progress \nProgram for commodities that were diverted to provide assistance to \nvictims of the Indian Ocean tsunami.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from President Bush, dated January 13, \n2005, and signed by 43 Senators. It points out the dire shortfall in \nmeeting world food aid needs this year. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2005.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The December 26 tsunami that struck \n     several countries in the Indian Ocean Basin is now known to \n     have killed over 150,000 people, with hundreds of thousands \n     or even millions of others injured or left homeless by the \n     catastrophe. Many of these people have lost all their \n     possessions and find themselves in dire need of essentials \n     such as food, clean water, medical attention and shelter. \n     Over the past several decades, the food aid programs run by \n     the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture have demonstrated their capacity to \n     help people in need, but their fiscal 2005 funding will have \n     to be increased for them to do the job properly.\n       Even before the massive tsunami struck, other unanticipated \n     natural disasters and wars had strained these agencies' \n     ability to provide emergency food aid while still maintaining \n     long-term commitments to development assistance projects. \n     According to one estimate provided to the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry by USAID officials, \n     customary food aid contributions by the United States and \n     other donor countries were expected to fall $1.2 billion \n     short of emergency needs worldwide as of December 9, 2004.\n       As part of the supplemental appropriations bill you are \n     planning to submit within the next several weeks to cover the \n     cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, we urge \n     you to include a request for food aid programs to help the \n     tsunami victims in South Asia as well as to address the food \n     aid shortfall generated by pre-existing emergency assistance \n     needs in Africa and elsewhere in the world. A portion of that \n     money should be used to reimburse recent withdrawals from the \n     Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.\n       It is crucial that you take these steps and not attempt to \n     meet the emergency needs by further cutting existing \n     programs. We believe that previous cuts made to developmental \n     food aid programs in this fiscal year should be restored. It \n     would not be appropriate to help the people of South Asia by \n     reducing aid to people in other developing countries. Such a \n     move would be tantamount to feed one group with the seed corn \n     that another group was supposed to sow for crops the \n     following year. We urge you to consider carefully this \n     situation and take whatever actions are necessary to ensure \n     our ability to meet all of our food aid commitments.\n           Sincerely yours,\n         Tom Harkin; Dick Lugar; Debbie Stabenow; Bill Nelson; \n           Mary Landrieu; Max Baucus; Pat Roberts; Herb Kohl; Jeff \n           Bingaman; E.

This letter was signed by Republicans and Democrats alike. \nThat is as it should be. Compassion should not be a partisan issue.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from the April 13, 2005, Wall Street Journal that \nmakes a very strong case why additional funding for these programs is \nnecessary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, April 13, 2005]\n\n                  Sudan's Farmers Hunger for U.S. Aid\n\n                   (By Scott Kilman and Roger Thurow)\n\n       Seventeen years ago, Philip Majak abandoned his 30-acre \n     farm in southern Sudan, fleeing the ethnic and religious \n     fighting that would kill two million people over two decades, \n     including his first wife. Now, with a tentative peace treaty \n     holding since January, he is itching to go home.\n       ``My house is destroyed, and my tractor. My 70 cows were \n     stolen, the land has grown wild,'' he says at a refugee camp \n     outside Khartoum, Sudan's capital. ``I'll need help to start \n     farming again.'' He looks to two sources of support: ``God \n     will provide. And America.''\n       Maybe not.\n       The U.S. government for years pushed hard for peace in the \n     south of Sudan between the Muslim-dominated government in \n     Khartoum and the rebel group supported by the region's \n     Christian residents. The Americans said that as peace came, \n     so would seeds and tools to help Sudanese farmers rebuild one \n     of Africa's potential breadbaskets.\n       But Sudan's reconstruction period is dawning just as budget \n     pressures in Washington are siphoning money from precisely \n     this sort of U.S.-backed development work around the globe. \n     One project now in limbo would have given Sudanese refugees \n     food for rebuilding farms and roads in the Bahr el Ghazal \n     region--Mr. Majak's home--in the southern part of the \n     country.\n       The U.S. Agency for International Development is reducing \n     funding this fiscal year for 67 development projects in such \n     far-flung places as Angola, Bolivia and Peru. Those projects \n     represent 80 percent of all international development work \n     financed by USAID's Food for Peace office, the budget for \n     which is shrinking at least 13 percent to $1.4 billion during \n     the fiscal year ending in September.\n       The food-aid crunch could worsen next year. The Bush \n     administration, trying to rein in the U.S.'s record federal \n     budget deficit with broad spending cuts, proposes to slice a \n     further 33 percent from US AID's Food for Peace budget in \n     fiscal 2006 to $964 million.\n       Food for Peace donates cash and American-grown commodities, \n     such as wheat flour, corn, soybeans, lentils and peas, to \n     humanitarian groups for two types of foreign assistance: \n     emergency feeding and long-term-development work. Development \n     projects help poor nations modernize their farms so they are \n     less vulnerable to famine. Humanitarian groups sell the \n     donated commodities to raise money for such things as \n     repairing farm roads, digging irrigation wells and \n     vaccinating children. Some groups give the commodities to \n     villagers and farmers as pay for work on these projects.\n       Chariable groups rely heavily on the Food for Peace program \n     for their hunger-fighting work in the poorest parts of the \n     world. Catholic Relief Services, for example, says USAID is \n     withholding $1.6 million of the $4.4 million in Food for \n     Peace support promised for its work in Angola. As a result, \n     Catholic Relief Services has shelved plans for everything \n     from farming classes to food-for-work projects.\n       ``How can a country as wealthy as the U.S. break these \n     sorts of commitments?'' says Marianne Leach, director of \n     government relations in Washington for CARE, which has lost \n     about half of its U.S. funding for development programs in \n     Mozambique and Tajikistan.\n       White House budget spokesman Noam Neusner says the Bush \n     administration is ``providing as much support as we can in an \n     effective way. . . . Eradicating hunger is an important \n     priority of this administration.''\n       USAID officials say it is all a matter of priorities. Given \n     budget constraints on the Food for Peace program, they are \n     raiding development projects for commodities and cash to \n     respond to a wave of immediate food shortages in places such \n     as Ethiopia, northern Uganda, Chad and Darfur, the western \n     region of Sudan where fighting continues. Last year 35 \n     countries needed emergency food aid, according to the United \n     Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.\n       ``We have a budget crunch,'' says Andrew S. Natsios, USAID \n     administrator. ``Our first priority is to save peoples' \n     lives.''\n       As the swelling U.S. budget deficit creates momentum in \n     Congress and the White House to cut government spending, the \n     Food for Peace budget is particularly vulnerable because \n     America's food-aid practices are under attack at the World \n     Trade Organization. Rival exporting powers long have \n     complained that Washington uses food aid to dump surplus \n     crops, thereby subsidizing U.S. growers.\n       Congress is on record recognizing the importance of \n     development projects in preventing famines. The 2002 Farm \n     Bill that guides U.S. agricultural policy mandates that 75 \n     percent of the 2.5 million tons of commodities USAID is \n     supposed to donate through the Food for Peace program goes to \n     non-emergency development projects. But the law gives USAID \n     the power to ignore the mandate during an emergency. As a \n     result, the Bush administration is spending for more of the \n     Food for Peace budget on food emergencies than on development \n     projects.\n       Other federal programs beyond Food for Peace sponsor \n     overseas development work, too. USAID plans to spend $562.2 \n     million on agricultural development this fiscal year, double \n     what was spent in fiscal 2001 by all of its programs. But \n     much of the increase is going to a few countries, such as \n     Iraq and Afghanistan. A study released this week by two \n     Washington advocacy groups--Partnership to Cut Hunger and \n     Poverty in Africa and Resources for the Future--found that \n     U.S. government support for agricultural development in \n     Africa has stagnated in recent years.\n       An exception in Africa is Sudan, where Washington plans to \n     spend more on agricultural development in places where peace \n     takes hold. Donors at an international aid conference \n     yesterday pledged $4.5 billion to rebuild southern Sudan; of \n     that total, $1.7 billion was committed by the U.S., including \n     $850 million already committed.\n       But that represents total aid, not just agriculture. Many \n     needs are still going unmet in southern Sudan. Citing tight \n     funds, USAID rejected a request from World Vision Inc. in \n     September for $7.8 million of cash and commodities to use in \n     Bahr el Ghazal for emergency food rations as well as food-\n     for-work projects from digging wells to building seed-storage \n     facilities.\n       Washington would seem to have a lot riding on the \n     reconstruction of southern Sudan. Beyond its plentiful oil, \n     Sudan presents a test of the Bush administration's ability to \n     bring peace to a region that has been a source of instability \n     and terrorism in Africa. The U.S. has given it about $2.9 \n     billion of humanitarian aid since 1983.\n       U.S. officials thought long and hard about how to restart \n     the Sudanese economy. A blueprint of sorts is laid out in a \n     2003 report by USAID. Looking beyond a recent history of \n     three famines and several near-famines, it sees a potential \n     breadbasket. Blessed with a diverse climate and abundant \n     arable land for a wide range of crops, a peaceful Sudan \n     could, with help, emerge as an agricultural exporter.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. The simple truth is that current funds are insufficient due \nto worsening conditions in the world. Those conditions include the \nongoing conflict in Darfur and food shortages in the south of Sudan; \ndrought conditions in Ethiopia; flooding in Bangladesh; infestations of \nlocusts in western Africa; and ongoing fighting and refugee conditions \nin the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n  By far, the vast majority of spending in this supplemental is to \nsupport our efforts in Iraq. While it is important we show the world we \nare a strong nation, it is also important we show the world we are a \ncompassionate nation.\n  In his inaugural address, the President spoke forcefully about ending \ntyranny and spreading democracy. Everyone shares those objectives. We \nalso know those objectives cannot be achieved solely by force or \ngesture politics. Instead, they demand a commitment to diplomacy and \nhuman compassion.\n  I am proud this amendment has drawn bipartisan support. I am grateful \nto Senator DeWine and the other cosponsors for their help. I hope this \namendment will meet with the approval of all Senators, and I ask for \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Senator Kohl has indicated a very \nimpressive list of cosponsors who ask that the Senate agree to this \namendment. I know of no other request for time to debate the amendment. \nI do not want to cut off any Senator, but we are prepared to go to a \nvote on the amendment if there are no Senators who wish to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 380) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 388\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Bayh and I have an amendment on \nHumvees the floor manager is familiar with. I am going to speak on that \nissue. The amendment is a Bayh-Kennedy amendment. My colleague and \nfriend, the Senator from Indiana, intends to address the Senate very \nshortly on this issue. I wanted to take an opportunity, in these final \nhours of consideration of the supplemental, to bring this to the \nattention of the Senate and the American people.\n  I am delighted to join my colleague Senator Bayh in sponsoring our \namendment which increases the funding for the procurement of up-armored \nHumvees for the Army. The Senate is currently debating an \nappropriations bill that will provide $81 billion primarily for the \nongoing war in Iraq. This funding will bring the total United States \nbill for the war in Iraq to $192 billion and still counting. All of us \nsupport our troops. We obviously want to do all we can to see that they \nhave the proper equipment, vehicles, and everything else they need to \nprotect their lives and carry out their missions.\n  It is scandalous that the administration has kept sending them into \nbattle in Iraq without the proper equipment. No soldier should be sent \ninto battle unprotected. That is exactly what happened in Iraq. As \nrecently as December 2004, soldiers were still digging through \nlandfills to find metal plating to attach to their vehicles for \nprotection--their ``hillbilly'' armor, they call it. It has also been \nwell documented that parents went in desperation to the local Wal-Mart \nto buy armored plates and mail them to their sons and daughters serving \nin Iraq. That is incomprehensible and unacceptable for our soldiers. \nMore than 400 troops have already died in military vehicles, vulnerable \nto roadside bombs, grenades, and other so-called improvised explosive \ndevices. Our amendment will provide additional funding to buy up-\narmored Humvees and add-on armor kits for the Humvees for the Army.\n\n  As we all know, the Humvee is a highly mobile four-wheel-drive \nvehicle. The up-armored Humvee is a version with bullet-resistant \nwindows and steel-plate armor on the doors and underside to protect \nagainst rifle rounds and explosive blasts. It has additional armor for \nthe turret gunner on the roof to protect against artillery, and a \npowerful air conditioning system. The add-on armor kits are mounted on \nthe existing Humvees to give almost as much protection.\n  According to a Philadelphia Inquirer article 2 weeks ago, the Army \nsays all of its 35,000 vehicles in Iraq now have some sort of armor. \nBut a third of them are protected with nothing more than crudely cut \nsheets of steel which are inadequate by the Army's own standards, \naccording to figures released Friday. The largest threats for vehicles \nare improvised explosive devices, rocket-propelled grenades, small arms \nfire, and landmines.\n  Humvees and other military vehicles have become the target of choice \nfor insurgents. Shrapnel from roadside bombs or even a simple AK-47 \nround can slice through an unprotected Humvee. Some of them have little \nmore than vinyl fabric for their roofs and doors. Our troops in \nunprotected Humvees in Iraq would be safer riding in SUVs.\n  According to the Center for Army Lessons Learned, the harm to both \npersonnel and equipment from improvised explosive devices is greatly \nreduced when traveling in an up-armored Humvee. It has taken far too \nlong to solve this problem. We have to make sure we solve it now, once \nand for all. We can't keep throwing money at it and hope it goes away. \nThe delay in correcting the problem has cost the lives of many brave \nyoung men and women killed in combat because they were in unarmored \nvehicles.\n  On July 20, 2003, SGT Justin Garvey, a Massachusetts casualty, was \nwith the 101st Airborne Division and was killed in Mosul when his \nunarmored Humvee was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while on patrol.\n  A few months later, on September 1, 2003, SSG Joseph Camara and SGT \nCharles Caldwell, Massachusetts natives with the Rhode Island National \nGuard, were killed north of Baghdad when their unarmored Humvee struck \na mine.\n  On October 18, 2003, PFC John Hart of Bedford, MA, was killed in Taza \nin Iraq, when his unarmored Humvee was hit by a rocket-propelled \ngrenade. I attended his burial at Arlington National Cemetery on \nNovember 4, 2003. I still remember the letter the parents showed me \nfrom that young man saying he was out on patrol and if he did not get \narmor on his Humvee, the chances of his survival were going to be very \nlimited. Three weeks later he was lost.\n  Last week, a Kentucky National Guard soldier died when shrapnel came \nthrough the window of his vehicle. A comrade says James A. Sherrill, \n27, could have been saved if antiballistic glass had been installed.\n  The saddest part of this story is that the Army could have and should \nhave moved more quickly to correct the problem. As retired GEN Paul \nKern, who headed the Army Materiel Command until last November, said:\n\n       . . . It took too long to materialize. In retrospect, if I \n     had it to do all over again, I would have just started \n     building up-armored Humvees. The most efficient way would \n     have been to build a single production line and feed \n     everything into it.\n\n  In a letter to me dated October 20, 2003, General Abizaid, the \nCENTCOM Commander, said:\n\n       The FY 2004 Supplemental Request will permit the services \n     to rapidly resolve many of the equipment issues that you \n     mentioned to include the procurement of . . . Humvees.\n\n  That goes back to October 20, 2003, General Abizaid saying that the \n2004 appropriations were going to solve this problem.\n  In February 2004, General Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army, \ntestified at an Armed Services Committee hearing that:\n\n       . . . the army never intended to up-armor every Humvee--\n     never until this kind of situation that we have today . . . \n     We have taken armored units, artillery units, all kind of \n     other units and put them into Humvees as motorized \n     formations, which never existed before. And so this is an \n     area where you cannot fix it overnight.\n\n  That is in February of 2004. And we are now in April of 2005. The \nproblem still hasn't been fixed.\n  On December 8, 2004, during a townhall meeting with the United States \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld in Kuwait, a young soldier alerted the \nAmerican public to the issue of armor shortages when he asked:\n\n       Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for \n     pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to \n     up-armor our vehicles and why don't we have those sources \n     readily available to us?\n  After the applause from the troops, Rumsfeld replied:\n\n       It's essentially a matter of physics. It isn't a matter of \n     money. It isn't a matter on the Army of desire. It's a matter \n     of production and capability of doing it. As you know, you to \n     go war with the army you have, not the army you might want or \n     wish to have at a later time.\n\n  He later remarked in the same townhall meeting:\n\n       You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a \n     tank can be blown up. And you can have an up-armored Humvee \n     and it can be blown up.\n\n  We have been told for months that the shortage of up-armored Humvees \nwas a thing of the past and the Army has enough to ensure that every \nHumvee that left a protected base in Iraq would be an up-armored Humvee \nor a Humvee with an add-on kit. This month, the GAO released a report \nthat clearly identifies the struggle the Army has faced. In August \n2003, only 51 up-armored Humvees were being produced a month. It took \nthe industrial base a year and a half to work up to making 400 a month.\n  Imagine that. It took a year and a half for the United States of \nAmerica to move from 50 a month to 400 a month; a year and a half. I \ndon't know how many saw that incredible documentary on the History \nChannel the other night of President Roosevelt talking about the \ngearing up in World War II, where we were producing a victory ship a \nday, over 350,000 planes a year, this country. A victory ship a day we \nwere producing, 350,000 planes a year, and it took us a year and a half \nto move from 50 to 400 a month. This wasn't given a priority. Of the 35 \nyoung Americans from Massachusetts who have been killed, a third of \nthem have been killed from attacks on Humvees.\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nThe great majority of those, the veterans say, could have survived if \nthey had had the protected Humvees.\n  It is obvious the Department has no solution, did not have the \npriority to provide for the up-armor of the Humvees. Secretary of the \nArmy Brownlee told the Armed Services Committee in October 2003 that:\n\n       . . . with the up-armored Humvee, it is more of a \n     challenge. If we go strictly with the up-armored Humvee, it \n     could be as late as the summer of '05 before we would have \n     them all.\n\n  This is in October 2003, we are told in the Armed Services Committee \nit is going to be the summer of 2005 before our troops are going to \nhave the protection they should. Since it is now spring 2005, it looks \nas though he was right.\n  According to the GAO report, there are two primary causes for the \nshortage of up-armored vehicles and add-on armor kits. First, a \ndecision was made to ramp up production gradually rather than use the \nmaximum available capacity. Second, the funding allocations did not \nkeep up with the rapidly increasing requirements. Obviously, the \nPentagon was still being influenced by its cakewalk mentality.\n  The GAO report specifically states that the Pentagon decisionmakers \nset the rate at which both up-armored Humvees and armor kits would be \nproduced and did not tell Congress about the total available production \ncapacity. The GAO was unable to determine what criteria were used to \nset the pace of production. In both cases, additional production \ncapacity was available, particularly for the kits, but not used.\n  The funding issue was part of the problem. Funds were available to \nsupport the planned pace of production of up-armored Humvees. But GAO \nfound that four program managers were not aware of the timeframe for \nreleasing funds. Although the Army received over $1.4 billion between \nfiscal years 2003 and 2004 to produce 7,500 vehicles, it was not \nreleased in a timely and predictable way. In August of 2003, the \nmanagers received requirements for 1,407 vehicles, but had received \nfunding to produce less than half of that number.\n  By October 2003, program managers had a requirement to produce 3,000 \nvehicles, but once again received funding to produce less than half of \nthat. Significant differences continued until April of 2004, when \nrequirements reached 4,400 vehicles and the program managers received \nfunding to produce 4,300 vehicles.\n  The major short-term solution to the up-armored Humvee funding issue \nhas been the additional funds from congressional increases. Parents and \nspouses of fallen service members contacted Members of Congress to \ndemand attention to the problem. For fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the \nArmy received over $1.4 billion to produce 7,500 up-armored Humvees to \nmeet worldwide requirements, including 8,000 vehicles required for the \nCENTCOM's area of operation.\n  In fiscal year 2004, the Army received more than $1 billion to \nproduce up-armored Humvees. Compared to the Bush administration's \nbudget request for $51 million, the parents and spouses made an \nenormous impact. To meet the continuing needs for force protection, \nCongress recommended $865 million in the 2005 appropriations bill to be \nused by the Army for additional armor for Humvees and other vehicles.\n  As part of the Rapid Response Force Protection Initiative, Congress \nintends the funds to be used for a variety of vehicles to respond \nrapidly to the threat of improvised explosive devices and mortar \nattacks against our forces. These are short-term fixes.\n  Amazingly, the GAO found that Army officials have still not made \nlong-term efforts to improve the availability of up-armored Humvees or \nadd-on armor kits. We need to get ahead of this problem. The \nrequirements for up-armored Humvees keep changing.\n  Of the time I have been in the Armed Services Committee, we have had \nnine different estimates by the military--I will include them in the \nRecord--in their testimony before us, going from 30 September 2003, for \n1700; November 2003, 3,000. Then they kept going up by thousands over \ntime.\n  Young American servicemen who are out on patrols do not have that \nequipment. It is one thing if the insurgents have some surprise \ncapability and some technique or technology that we are not prepared to \ndeal with, but we know how to uparmor humvees and we know how to make \narmor plating.\n  The fact that we have young people who are risking their lives \nwithout that protection is what this amendment is about. I know we will \nhear from the other side--because I have heard it every time I have \nbeen part of offering an increase in the funding for the last 3 years--\nwe have enough, we don't need more. We will hear that here again. But \nwe find out that we are still shortchanging the military.\n  Gary Motsek, Director of Support Operations for the Army Materiel \nCommand in Fort Belvoir, VA, said:\n\n       I'm going to get in trouble, but the real challenge is, \n     there had always been an assumption, quite frankly, that the \n     requirements would continue to tail off.\n\n  Obviously, since we are still losing an average of more than one \nsoldier a day since the Iraqi elections in January, those assumptions \nare clearly wrong.\n  It is a tragedy that our soldiers are still paying the price for this \ndelay. In 2003, when it came time to mass-produce uparmored humvees, \nthe Army had only a single source to turn to. It had little interest in \nthis work before Iraq and did not shop for others. Pentagon Acquisition \nChief, Michael Wynne, testified to Congress a year ago:\n\n       It's a sad story to report to you, but had we known then \n     what we know now, we would probably have gotten another \n     source involved. Every day, our soldiers are being killed or \n     wounded in Iraq by IEDs, RPGs, small arms fire. Too many of \n     these attacks are on humvees that are not uparmored. . . . We \n     are directing that all measures to provide protection to our \n     soldiers be placed on a top priority, most highly urgent, 24-\n     7 basis.\n\n  That is his recent statement and we welcome it. In his testimony, \nWynne said: It is a sad story, but had we known what the parents knew \nand what those on the front lines knew, certainly we would have acted \nquicker.\n  But 24-7 didn't happen even then until January this year. The plant \nhad capacity that the Army never consistently used, as the plant \nmanager has said.\n  In November 2003, I asked Secretary Brownlee about armor delays, \nnoting that the three Massachusetts soldiers had died in unarmored \nhumvees. ``Are they running their plant 24 hours?'' Secretary Brownlee \nsaid the plant in Ohio was running at ``maximum capacity.'' But it \nwasn't. Army documents show the monthly armor production at the plant \nfell after that, from about 55 to 45 humvees a month, in December.\n  The plant took its usual week off at Christmas and the armoring plant \ntook two 4-day weekends. Owners say they could have built more--if the \nArmy had ordered it.\n  In early 2004, Members of Congress toured the plant and found that \nits ballistic glass operation was operating on just one shift.\n  Now we have an opportunity to end this frustration once and for all. \nOur soldiers in Iraq deserve the very best, and it is our job to make \nsure the Department of Defense is finally getting it right. Too many \nsoldiers have died because of these needless delays, but hopefully this \nwill be solved by what we do in this bill today.\n  The Bayh-Kennedy amendment contributes significantly to this goal. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I point out that in the House they have found that \nthere wasn't sufficient funding for the President's request. The House \nappropriators increased their appropriations by $232 million. They \nthought that was the bare minimum to bring it up on their review of the \nshortage.\n  I think the Bayh-Kennedy amendment is much closer to the real need. \nBut clearly it is very important that we have an increase in this \nparticular funding in this area.\n  Mr. President, I hope the committee is willing to accept the \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a paper indicating rising humvee \nrequirements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Rising Humvee Requirements\n\n30 September 2003.................................................1,723\n17 November 2003 (Iraq and Afghanistan)...........................3,142\n17 November 2003 (total including backfill).......................3,331\n17 November 2003 (potential increase).............................3,600\n10 December 2003 CENTCOM requirement..............................3,506\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\n8 January 2004 CENTCOM requirement................................3,512\n30 January 2005 CENTCOM requirement...............................4,149\n01 July 2004 CENTCOM requirement..................................8,125\n08 April 2005 CENTCOM requirement................................10,079\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 380\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in the Senate just a few minutes ago, we \npassed an amendment offered by Senator Kohl and myself, which was an \namendment for international aid for $470 million to help provide food \nfor the millions of people in the world who are in dire need of food.\n  First, I thank Chairman Cochran for working with Senator Kohl and \nmyself on this amendment. Senator Cochran is someone who has been a \nleader in this area, a leader in providing food for people around the \nworld throughout his career. I thank him for his great work.\n  I also thank the cosponsors: Senators Coleman, Hagel, Lugar, Roberts, \nDole, Harkin, Durbin, Leahy, Mikulski, Inouye, Landrieu, Murray, \nDorgan, Johnson, Corzine, and Obama.\n  Additionally, I thank the Coalition for Food Aid, the U.S. Conference \nof Catholic Bishops, InterAction, and the numerous other groups who \nhave been calling offices in the Senate in support of this important \namendment. Their support has made a difference.\n  This past year has been notable for the very high profile \nhumanitarian crises we have seen in the world, in the Darfur region of \nSudan, and the catastrophic tsunami that swept throughout Southeast \nAsia. Little attention, however, has been paid to other horrible crises \nthat have occurred, such as the locust damage to crops and livelihoods \nin sub-Saharan Africa, or the devastating floods in Bangladesh and \nHaiti. They have not received nearly as much attention. These crises \nhave drained the international food aid system, and clearly this system \nis now in need of replenishment. That is what this deals with.\n  This month, the U.N. World Food Program announced that it would be \nforced to cut rations in Darfur. Our own U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment has been forced to cut food aid programs in such countries \nas the Sudan, Angola, Nicaragua, Ghana, and Eritrea.\n  We cannot wait for the regular appropriations cycle to replenish the \nfood aid resources that have been expended on the extraordinary \nemergencies that have occurred and are anticipated to occur in the \nremainder of this fiscal year. That is why this amendment was so very \nimportant. Waiting is simply not an option because lives are on the \nline. Waiting for the regular appropriations cycle will simply be too \nlate.\n  We have an opportunity with this amendment and this bill to help show \nthe hungry people of the world that they are not forgotten. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support for this amendment. It is important that \nwe maintain it in conference. It will, in fact, make a difference.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his assistance and my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what we are doing \nand why we are doing it and the overall evaluation of this bill.\n  We are going to run at least a $600 billion deficit this year, a real \ndeficit. What is said out there is that it is going to be $410 billion, \nbut it is not. We are going to take $150 billion worth of Social \nSecurity money and spend that, and then we are going to have this \nsupplemental, which is now at $81 billion. So we are going to be at \nabout $630 billion, $640 billion in deficit.\n  What is that deficit? That deficit is money we don't have today, that \nwe are going to go borrow, but we are going to ask our grandchildren to \npay it back. I don't want anybody to have any misunderstanding. I \nbelieve we need to have an emergency supplemental appropriation right \nnow. I believe it ought to be designed for emergencies--true \nemergencies. That is what it is here for. I believe we ought to do \nwhatever is needed for our troops and our efforts in the war on \nterrorism. I also believe we need to meet the commitments in terms of \ncatastrophic weather events and the tsunami.\n  I think we ought to pass out of this body what can truly be spent on \nthat in the near term. What I don't think we should be doing--and I \nrealize I am in a minority--is spending money and authorizing money to \nbe spent from 2007 to 2012 that is surely and obviously not an \nemergency. I will have a hard time going home and looking at some of \nthe poor children in Oklahoma when we spend this extra $21 billion out \nof this emergency. Each one of those poor children, when they grow up, \nis going to have to pay back about $5,000. That is what the difference \nis personally to them after 30 years of us borrowing. It is interesting \nto note that we have not truly paid off any of our bills, except for \none short period of time, around 1999, 2000. So when we borrow the \nmoney, it continues to go up and it continues to compound and it \ncontinues to undercut the standard of living of future generations of \nthis country.\n  If there is anything our heritage teaches us, it is that the prices \nthat were paid for us to have the opportunity we have today is \nsomething that we ought to transmit to future generations.\n  I understand there are going to be objections to me bringing up my \namendments; they aren't germane. I understand I need to have unanimous \nconsent to be able to bring those up. I am not going to call for them \nat this time, but I will continue to talk about each one of those \nissues. I think it is important that the American public understand \nwhat is in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think amendments have been called up in the regular \norder. I ask the Senator why he would have reluctance to call up these \namendments. If someone objects to it, then I will start objecting to \nthe calling up of other amendments, if that is the way Members want the \nSenate to work. I understand this is a pretty straightforward \namendment. The University of Hawaii's library is going to get $10 \nmillion for free on something that has nothing to do with Afghanistan, \nIraq, the tsunami, or anything else. If somebody wants to object, I \nwould like to inform my colleagues that we will start objecting to \namendments being called up. It is a pretty straightforward amendment \nthat strikes a $10 million earmark for the University of Hawaii library \nand the legislative rider for the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask my friend, why don't we bring them up? If somebody \nobjects, then I will object to other amendments being brought up, \nparticularly ones that are this straightforward.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator have a response?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will call them up and we will see what happens. I want \nto set the field a little bit more.\n  I think it is important that the American people understand what is \nin this bill, and there are legitimate things in this bill that we need \nto have to fund the war on terrorism. I don't want to debate this issue \nor delay it. I want us to pass it. I don't want us to have to vote on \nevery amendment I put up.\n  I think it is incumbent upon us to be honest with the American \npeople. When we call something an emergency, it ought to be an \nemergency. This bill has $21 billion in it that is going to eventually \ncost our children $100 billion in the next 30 years, and it is not an \nemergency. It should go through the regular appropriations process. It \nis important for the American people to also understand if it is \nregular stuff that is in the emergency, the budget rules don't count. \nSo we are going to spend $20 billion that should be taken out of next \nyear's budget requirement, and we are going to sneak it in now so we \ncan spend $20 billion more next year. That is what it is about.\n  We need to be honest. We are never going to solve our budgetary \nproblems or spending problems, or we are never going to have the \nprocess work in this country where the pressure comes on this body to \nnot spend our children's\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nfuture, unless we are honest about what is in the budget and how the \nappropriations process works.\n  Let's take, for example, the embassy in Iraq. This is a $500 million \nembassy--$500 million, a half-billion dollars. It is not just an \nembassy. It is the whole thing there, to give credit. It is going to \nhave greater requirements than any other embassy we have, but it is a \nhalf-billion dollars.\n  In this appropriation bill, only $106 million of it is going to be \nspent over the next 2 years; $385 million is going to be spent from \n2007 to 2012. That is not an emergency. What you will hear from the \nAppropriations Committee is they have to let the contracts. It is only \n3 months between now and the time we start the regular appropriations \nprocess. We can let a contract and the conditional authority for a $500 \nmillion embassy. We should not move that up now.\n  There are also some good questions about whether we ought to be \nspending $500 million on an embassy complex in Baghdad. That needs to \nbe looked at. That needs to be talked about before we commit our \nchildren's future. That is one example of the areas in which we need to \nbe making sure the American public knows what is going on.\n  The purpose of an emergency wartime supplemental is to immediately \nfund ongoing emergency needs for our troops or for disaster--emergency \nneeds. My objection to this bill is it has $19 billion to $20 billion \nin it that is not emergency. It does not have anything to do with an \nemergency, but it has to do with outyear spending we can now put into \nthis bill which has to pass to fund our troops.\n  Let me just give some history. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has \npassed four individual supplemental bills in ongoing efforts to fund \nthe war against terror. In those bills was $56 billion that did not \nhave anything to do with the war on terror or homeland security. Think \nabout that, $56 billion. When we add this up, we are going to be at $72 \nbillion over the last 4 years in money that is not emergency and money \nthat is not about the war on terrorism and that is not money about \nhomeland security.\n  Why is that? It is because our process is broken. The only way it \nchanges is for the American public to become informed about how the \nprocess works. This is not to question the motives of any of our \nMembers. They want us to control spending as well, but they also want \nto satisfy the demands that are placed on them, the office, for all the \ndemands that come in from across this country.\n  The fact is, we are our own worst enemy because we have trouble \nsaying no to those we care about, even though we do not have the money \nto do it or do not recognize we are really stealing a standard of \nliving from our children and our grandchildren.\n  There is $10 million, as Senator McCain mentioned, for a library. \nThere is no question that the University of Hawaii has an emergency. By \ntheir own quoted statements, the president of the University of Hawaii \nsaid the damage is about $50 million. With this $10 million and what \nthe State legislature has done there, they are going to collect over \n$100 million for a $50 million damage, and with the requirements under \nFEMA for having a 75-percent/25-percent grant, even though it was \nrequired, we are now going to supply that.\n  It may not be a one on one, it may not be their intent, but the fact \nis $10 million is fungible, which is exactly their matching grant to \nget it repaired. Is it an emergency? Is it something that needs to be \ndone or is it something that is going to be covered already? Is it \nsomething we, as Congress, should be supplying or is it something for \nwhich the people of Hawaii should be responsible? It is a legitimate \nquestion, and if it should be there, then it ought to go through the \nappropriations process where it can be looked at, not stuck in a bill \nthat is a ``must pass'' bill. That is something about which we need to \ntalk.\n\n  Mr. President, 6 years ago, the Capitol Police were told they needed \nto move out of their storage and receipt building in southeast \nWashington, DC. We now have $23 million in this bill to move the \nCapitol Police receiving station out of the area so we can build a \nbaseball stadium. I have a whole lot of trouble thinking that comes \nanywhere close to the emergency requirements of our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It is almost laughable that we would put that in as an \nemergency.\n  I understand people have a very different opinion of that than I do, \nbut I think a baseball stadium pales in comparison to what the need of \nan emergency appropriation is. I think it is wrong to have money in an \nemergency appropriation to do something such as that. It can come \nthrough the regular order, especially since they have had 6 years to \nhave done it.\n  I must say the chairman of this committee has been very kind to me in \nanswering questions and working with me. I think he has brought what he \nthought the body could pass and get back to the President. I do not \nwant to cast any direction against any individual, but I believe we \nhave to have a challenge, and one of the reasons I came to the Senate \nis so I can look at what we are doing so I can help educate the \nAmerican people on what is really happening.\n  I call up my amendments Nos. 450, 467, 506, and 471, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the reading of the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that I be allowed to call up four \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, I object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that I be allowed to call up three \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 450, 467, and 471, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendments Nos. 450, 467, and \n471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes amendments \n     numbered 450, 467, and 471, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 450\n\n             (Purpose: To remove a non-emergency provision)\n\n       On page 166, strike lines 8 through 20.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 467\n\n              (Purpose: To remove non-emergency spending)\n\n       On page 202, strike lines 1 through 13.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 471\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce appropriations for the Iraqi embassy to reduce \n        outlays expected to occur in fiscal year 2007 or later)\n\n       On page 172, strike ``$592,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$106,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the first amendment deals with contracting \nin the Defense Department. There is no objection or intent to label \nanything other than the process under which we allow $40 million of \nexpenditures to go out that does not go through a true competitive \nbidding process. There is no question it will benefit what we are \ndoing. There is no question it is a need in terms of what we had. The \nquestion in bringing this amendment up is because of the process and \nthe lack of open, competitive bidding associated with $40 million of \nthe taxpayers' money.\n  I have no question that possibly the person who has this contract or \nwill get this contract under the present bill may be the best, but the \nAmerican people and future generations of this country need to make \nsure that is what happens and it happens every time so that we do not \nspend any money unwisely.\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\n  I believe it is tremendously prudent on our part, in reassessing \nwhere we are and the tremendous risks facing our economy from the \nvaluation of the dollar, our deficit spending, and the difficulties we \nare going to be facing on Social Security and health care, that we pay \nattention to every detail. This was noted in the report language. There \nmay be a much better explanation for it.\n  Without losing control of the floor, I yield to my chairman, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nyielding to permit me to respond to the amendment which he has filed.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma commented earlier about the need to \nhold down the deficit, I am in complete agreement with what he had to \nsay. The amendment pending does not have any expenditure at all. It is \na clarification of a preexisting allocation which was in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill last year, and it was in a proper bill. It was not \ndesignated as emergency spending; it was an appropriations bill.\n  This money is being allocated to develop the port facilities in \nPhiladelphia to accommodate a very new kind of ship which will compete \nwith air travel and which has very substantial military as well as \ncommercial purposes.\n  There is a long history to this particular item. Originally, there \nwas an effort to have the construction undertaken partly in the United \nStates, and this $40 million was to be a loan guarantee. Without going \ninto a very elongated history, the manufacturers of the ship worked it \nout to have it done overseas. It is a loss to the United States. We had \na meeting with members of the Armed Services Committee and the \nSecretary of the Navy. Secretary English tried to work it out and could \nnot. Then the decision was made that the $40 million that already had \nbeen appropriated would be directed toward the port facility in \nPhiladelphia to accommodate these ships.\n  There is no other port facility that can take these ships. This is \npart of a larger expenditure where the Port Authority is putting up $75 \nmillion of its own. So there is nobody in the market here to say we \nhave $75 million and we would like to have access to this $40 million \nthat has already been allocated.\n  In broader terms, I think it is fair to characterize this expenditure \nand reallocation. The Navy is prepared to do it, but they want to have \nthe language so they are complying with the congressional direction. \nThis is part of the effort to make up for the Philadelphia industrial \nbase, what happened when the Philadelphia navy yard was closed some \nyears ago. That yard was closed with fraudulent misrepresentations made \nby the Department of the Navy, not something I am saying today for the \nfirst time. I filed a lawsuit in the Federal court of Philadelphia \nbecause they had concealed opinions, letters, from two admirals who \nsaid the navy yard should be maintained but downsized.\n  I argued the case personally in the district court and went to the \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit and lost it in the Supreme Court \nwhere the Supreme Court was faced with the alternative of disallowing \nsome 300 base closures if they were to upset the Philadelphia navy yard \nclosure. It was the basis of delegation of constitutional authority.\n  It would be my hope that my colleagues in the Senate would allow this \ncommittee report to stand because it is not an expenditure, it does not \nburden the deficit. It is clarification so that the Secretary of the \nNavy can act in accordance with congressional wishes, and it has a \nmilitary as well as a commercial purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I happen to have been at the meeting that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania--whom I admire and respect enormously--\nhad with the Secretary of the Navy. I was so proud of the Secretary of \nthe Navy because unequivocally the Secretary of the Navy said: No, we \ndo not want this money, we do not have the technology, we do not have \nthe design for this, this is not one of our requirements, and we do not \nwant to spend $40 million in this fashion. It was as strong a statement \nas I have ever heard from the Secretary of the Navy.\n  This is basically a $40 million giveaway of the taxpayers' dollars to \na private corporation that has nothing to do with the war in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. It has nothing to do with it. The language of the bill \nsays ``support'' high-speed military sealift and other military \npurposes.\n  Maybe there are other military purposes. There is no design today for \na high-speed military sealift. I wish there were. It is affordable. But \nthe fact is that there is not. The fact is the Navy unequivocally said \nthey do not want taxpayers' dollars, defense dollars, spent on this \nport in the city of Philadelphia, another legislative rider.\n  This has nothing to do with Afghanistan, it has nothing to do with \nthe tsunami, it has nothing to do with Iraq, and it has nothing to do \nwith the Navy's requirements for a high-speed military sealift \ncapability. This is really an egregious example of what happens in \nappropriations bills because there has never been a hearing before the \nArmed Services Committee nor any consideration in the Armed Services \nCommittee of this particular request and would not be because it is not \nsomething we would rationally consider. But we put it on--$40 million \nworth on an appropriations at a time when the GAO says:\n\n       If we continue on our present path, we'll see pressure for \n     deep spending cuts or dramatic tax increases.\n\n  And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says:\n\n       It falls on the Congress to determine how best to address \n     the competing claims.\n\n  Which is our trade deficit as well as our burgeoning Federal deficit.\n  We do not need to spend the $40 million. I appreciate the efforts \nSenator Specter has made, over many years, for the city of Philadelphia \nand the Navy yard. I can guarantee the Senator from Philadelphia that a \nlawsuit will probably hire some more lawyers. But if he thinks it is \ngoing to reverse a BRAC decision and reopen the Philadelphia Navy \nShipyard as a naval shipyard, it will be one of the more fantastic \noutcomes in the history of the United States of America.\n  Again, I respect his advocacy for the Port of Philadelphia. I respect \nhis belief that somehow we are going to come up with a high-speed \nmilitary sealift. That vision and view is not shared by the Armed \nServices Committee nor by the Secretary of the Navy nor the Secretary \nof Defense. I hope we will be able to pass this, and I am sure we \nprobably will not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am a little at a loss to hear the \nSenator from Arizona talking about reopening the Navy shipyard. Maybe \nit is a good idea but it is not my idea. It is not my idea today.\n  This $40 million has already been appropriated. It was done in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill last year in regular order. So contrary to \nwhat the Senator from Arizona says, we are not talking about \nappropriating $40 million. What we are talking about is clarifying the \npurpose for which $40 million has been appropriated.\n  While the Senator from Arizona may not think there is the realism of \na high-speed military sealift, these fast ships can move military cargo \nas fast as they can be transported by air.\n  I hate to repeat myself. I have already done it once. There is no \noutlay of money. This money has been appropriated. It is a direction to \nthe Department of the Navy as to how it is being expended for a very \nimportant purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. It was in last \nyear's Omnibus appropriations bill, it was not in the Defense \nappropriations bill. It was not authorized in the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Let me tell you what is so egregious about it. In the appropriations \nbill, in the Omnibus appropriations bill, it says, blah, blah, blah:\n\n       . . . for a grant to Philadelphia Regional Port Authority, \n     to be used solely for the purpose of construction, by and for \n     a Philadelphia-based company. . . .\n\n  Here we are in an Omnibus appropriations bill we passed last year \nthat not only designates $40 million that needs\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nto be spent but without competition, without scrutiny, without \nexamination:\n\n       . . . by and for a Philadelphia-based company established \n     to operate high-speed, advanced-design vessels for the \n     transport of high-value, time-sensitive cargoes in the \n     foreign commerce of the United States, of a marine cargo \n     terminal and IT network for high-speed commercial vessels \n     that is capable of supporting military sealift requirements.\n\n  Last year, it was astonishing that we would put in an omnibus \nappropriation a requirement that $40 million be spent by and for a \nPhiladelphia-based company. In other words, a company in Seattle or a \ncompany in Charleston or a company in Oklahoma, they couldn't compete \nfor this. It had to be a Philadelphia-based company. What is it about \nPhiladelphia-based companies that warrants them receiving a $40 million \ncontract without competition from anybody else?\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, this is egregious. We should \nnot be designating certain cities as a base for any company to compete \nfor any contract of any kind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to make certain everybody \nunderstands. This was appropriated. It was not directed clear enough \nfor the Department of Defense to want to spend the money. What we are \nseeing is they want a clearer direction. I do not fault the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania at all for trying to give them a clearer direction. I \nwould like to do that for some companies in my area as well.\n  The fact is, it is not the way to run an airline, it is not the way \nto run a company. The omnibus appropriations process is not the way to \nrun a country either, and it is my hope we don't get there this year \neither.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware--I misspoke. This is the language in \nthis bill designating it for a Philadelphia-based company. Designating \nit for a Philadelphia-based company is in this legislation before us. I \nhope that is clear.\n  Mr. COBURN. The reason it is there is because they wanted the \ndirection on where to spend it. I understand the intention of the \nSenator from Philadelphia, his purpose. The reason I raise this \nquestion is I believe this is the wrong way we should be doing things. \nWe need to stop. Our future depends on the integrity of a budgeting and \nappropriations process that is not based on politics but is based on \nhaving the future best will for our country.\n  I don't have anything further to say on this, other than the Senator \nhas given a great explanation. I understand what it is. He is trying to \ndo something. The problem is, the military doesn't necessarily want to \ndo that.\n  I yield to my chairman, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of very brief reply: There is no \nother competitor which has $75 million put up and which is in a \nposition to accommodate these fast ships. This matter came up last \nyear. It seems to me it is a decided matter. It is not quite a \nprinciple of res judicata. If there is to be an objection--perhaps \nthere was an objection. I don't recall last year. There were many \nobjections raised to expenditures in the appropriations bill. But if \nthere was an occasion to defeat it, that was the time, not on what is \nessentially a technical amendment to accommodate the Department of the \nNavy so they know precisely what they are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I view this as a technical amendment to \nlast year's bill. Last year, we provided these funds for the maritime \ncargo terminal, primarily because it is going to present us now with \none of the most high-speed, advance-design capabilities of handling \nmilitary sealift requirements. This provision clarifies the intent of \nthe funds provided in prior fiscal years and provides authority to the \nNavy to execute those funds as we intended. The Navy says it needs this \namendment in order to do that. We tried to clarify this issue in the \n2004 bill but the Navy lawyers again said it wasn't sufficient. They \nwant the greater authority to execute the funds in the way that is \nnecessary for this port authority. Our language in the bill has been \nnow reviewed by the Navy. The Navy now agrees with this language. If we \nfinally enact this language, it will be sufficient to carry out our \noriginal intent.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona is on the floor. It is my intention to \nmake a motion to table this amendment but I would be pleased to yield \nto the Senator. I do not want to offer my motion in a manner that would \nreduce his right to speak on the amendment.\n  Does the Senator wish time on this amendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senator from Oklahoma has four \namendments--three more?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Two more.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Two more. I think they are all to the Defense portion of \nthe bill. Are they? Is this the only one to the Defense portion of the \nbill?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not want to take any more of the \nbody's time. I would point out this provision appeared in the \nconference report of the Omnibus appropriations bill, which meant I \nnever had a chance to propose an amendment to strike that $40 million \nbecause it was in the conference report. It was never in the original \nomnibus which would have been--or Defense Appropriations Committee bill \nand considered on the floor of the Senate. So I had no opportunity.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania asked why we didn't object then. It is \nbecause I couldn't. I had an up-or-down vote on a bill that was \n``that'' high. We had, I believe, less than 24 hours to act on that, \nmuch less read it.\n  If there is any objection to me or consternation about me objecting \nto it now, I didn't have the opportunity to object to it because $40 \nmillion, along with tens of billions of dollars of pork, was stuffed in \nit last year in this egregious and outrageous process we have evolved \ninto called the Omnibus appropriations bill, and this was stuck in it.\n  I want to say again, it is not appropriate to designate ``by and for \na Philadelphia-based company'' any money, any of our tax dollars. Our \ntax dollars should be competed for.\n  With respect to the chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, when he says ``the Navy agrees,'' of course the Navy \nagrees because it is there. But the Navy did not agree in a meeting the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and I had with the Secretary of the Navy, \nwhere they adamantly refused to agree to have this money spent because \nthey have no fast ship even on the drawing boards, much less any that \ncould be based in Philadelphia.\n  We are going to pass this. I do not believe we can beat it. But now \nwe are in the practice of designating a locality-based company to spend \n$40 million of American taxpayers' dollars. That is not right.\n  I will bet there is expertise around the country--even if this were \nnecessary--to be able to compete for this $40 million contract. But now \nwe are designating it to the city of Philadelphia. I wonder if people \nout in the county might be able, or maybe someone in Pittsburgh might \nbe able to compete for it. Probably not.\n  This is a wrong way to legislate. In these times of burgeoning fiscal \ndeficits, for us to designate money to be spent by a local-based \ncompany is just the wrong way to designate, and I think most Americans \nwould agree.\n  I do not intend to extend this debate any further. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for a voice vote on the amendment, amendment No. \n450.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in order to request a voice vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss amendment No. 471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 450\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the regular order on amendment No. 450.\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now the regular order.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to ask for a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 450) was rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 471\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to visit amendment No. 471, which \nreduces funding in the supplemental for the Iraqi Embassy. According to \nthe report language on this bill, $592 million is to be appropriated \nover the next 7 years for an embassy in Iraq. I do not have any \nobjection. I think there ought to be tremendous hearings on the amount \nof money expended on that, but $592 million? Mr. President, $106 \nmillion of that is all that will be expended over the next 2 years. So \nwhat is going to happen is we are going to have $486 million hanging \nout there that will be rescinded and spent on something else.\n  First of all, we had a vote in this body, of which 61 Members of this \nbody voting on the Byrd amendment this week agreed that the President \nought to put everything that he sought for the war in Iraq and for its \nneeds in the regular budget and the regular appropriations request he \nsends to the Congress.\n  By far, 61 Members out of 100 of this body will agree with the \nprinciple that I am bringing forward. They voted for it. The idea with \nthis amendment is to trim the appropriations from what is expected to \nbe spent for the next 2 years. And it is even questionable whether that \nis an emergency.\n  I also note that the House, in passing the supplemental bill, \neliminated the ability of this money to be spent for an embassy. I will \nstate that the purpose of the emergency wartime supplemental ought to \nbe to fund operations and projects that are emergencies. Money that is \ngoing to be needed for this embassy and complex in 2007, 2008, 2009, \n2010, 2011, and 2012 can be appropriated at that time. It can be \nauthorized before then, but it can be appropriated at the proper time.\n  Again, quite simply, the emergency supplemental should only contain \nitems we need right now in order to fight the war on terror.\n  I will have trouble finding somebody who will actually debate on why \nwe need to spend $586 million on an embassy complex, and we need to do \nit now rather than run it through the regular appropriations process.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a response to \nthat statement?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator suggested he does not know anyone who would \ndebate the issue or support the funding that is contained in the bill. \nThe Senator is totally incorrect about that. There is a difference of \nopinion as reflected in the House-passed bill and the bill as reported \nby the Senate Committee on Appropriations. We had hearings on this \nissue. We had testimony that was compelling from the Secretary of \nState, Dr. Condoleezza Rice. We had an appeal that was made personally \nto Senators on the committee by the Secretary, which were very \ncompelling.\n  To give some example of what the Secretary said, we have personnel, \nwho are trying to live and stay alive in the Bagdad regions, who are \nrepresenting the interests of the United States, who are trying to \ncontribute toward a democracy being established under very difficult \nand dangerous circumstances. Many of them are located in temporary \nshelters, some are in tents, some are in other structures. We have \npeople trying to carry on the work of our U.S. Embassy in a palace that \nwas formerly occupied by Saddam Hussein that is not safe from mortar \nattacks or other military actions and terrorist activities. There is a \nperimeter that is very difficult to defend that we have all heard about \nand read about in the newspapers and seen on television. And to follow \nthe suggestion of the Senator from Oklahoma to do nothing to try to \nestablish quarters that are safe, that can be protected, that will \npermit our Ambassador to operate safely in a secure environment, we \nwould be neglecting our obligations as representatives of the people of \nthis great country.\n  To say that they are on their own, to continue to try to manage the \nway they have been for the last year and a half, I think that would be \nan absolute abrogation of responsibility for this Senate.\n  Our committee recommended that we approve the request submitted by \nthe administration for these funds. I strongly support the \nappropriation. I will defend the action of this committee on this issue \nas long as the Senator wants to debate it.\n  So to say there is no one who is willing to argue the point is \nabsolutely without basis in fact.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I agree with everything the chairman said \nexcept he didn't talk about the issue I am raising. The issue I am \nraising is spending $400 million in the years 2007 through 2012 should \ngo through the regular appropriations process. I want us to have an \nembassy over there. I want us to do the very things the chairman \noutlined.\n  But, again, we are playing a game with the appropriations process. \nThe administration is playing the same game by requesting it. We have \n$592 million, and only $106 million is going to be spent in the next 2 \nyears to accomplish what the honorable chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee said. Why not run the rest through the regular order? Why put \nthis to the bottom line and not make us do what we need to do in time \nof parity in how it is spent?\n  Again, I think this extra money, this $486 million, ought to go \nthrough the regular order. We are going to go out and borrow and ask \nour kids and our grandchildren to pay it back. When you ask them to pay \nit back, it is going to be at a rate of about seven or eight times what \nwe borrow. We are not paying back money, we are paying interest, and \nthen we are paying interest on the interest. That very well equates to \nus abandoning the vision that we want to give the future of this \ncountry; that is, opportunity and freedom, and we can't do that if we \ncontinue. All of this money in this bill goes straight to debt. None of \nit goes through the budget process. There is no limit. We are going to \ngo out and borrow the money tomorrow. It is going straight to debt.\n\n  I don't disagree with the chairman at all. I appreciate his working \nwith me on this committee in terms of learning, of teaching a new \nSenator the ropes. He has been wonderfully kind to me. But the fact is, \nonly $106 million is going to be expended over the next 24 months after \nthis is put out, and the rest of it ought to go through the regular \norder. That is all I am asking. I am saying it should come through the \nregular appropriations process. That is all I am asking. I am not \nsaying don't do it. I am saying do it in a way in which we are held \naccountable, and we are going to hold our children accountable. It \nisn't just about numbers. It is about the future of our country and \nwhether we are going to change the process in Washington that truly \nrecognizes that we have to start being responsible.\n  The South Korean Government, about a month ago, made one little, \nsmall comment about changing their mix on foreign holdings. The dollar \nfell 1.8 percent that day. We will not be able to hold the value of the \ndollar in the international financial community unless we are seen as \nbeing competent and secure about solving our problems and not spending \nmoney we don't have. This is a good first place to start.\n  There is nothing wrong with sending it through the appropriations \nprocess on the regular order. It makes it a little harder for the \nappropriations team; I understand that. They have already done what \nthey have been asked by the administration to do. But we need to send a \nsignal to the administration to quit asking for money in outyears on \nthe appropriations process so we don't look as bad when we count the \nso-called deficit. Remember, this is going against the deficit. It \nwon't go against the published numbers. It is outside the rules of the \ngame because we call it all an emergency. Money spent on an embassy in \nIraq in 2011 is not an emergency to anybody in this country I\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nknow of. I think we would have trouble finding it.\n  With that, I will cease discussion on that issue and discuss \namendment No. 467.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield before he abandons \nthis issue?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I want to point out that the Department of State \nsubmitted to the committee a letter on April 18, 2005 in justification \nfor proceeding with the funding for the embassy compound and pointed \nout the reasons it was important to approve the full funding now. It is \nnot something we dreamed up or that we are doing to undermine the \nintegrity of our fiscal soundness as a country. It is not irresponsible \nin any way whatsoever.\n  Here is what the letter says in part:\n\n       This funding request in the supplemental is more urgent as \n     a result of the highly successful Iraqi elections. Now that \n     it is clear that Iraq is on the road to full sovereignty, \n     building a permanent United States embassy has become \n     imperative. In order to complete compound construction within \n     24 months construction must start now.\n\n  That is why it is an emergency in any sense of the word. That is why \nour committee was impressed with this argument. This argument wasn't \nmade very well over on the House side of the Capitol. But it was in \nperson by the Secretary in appeals to individual Members. I can recall \nbeing in my State and getting a telephone call from the Secretary of \nState on this subject to emphasize the importance of doing what we are \nrecommending the Senate approve.\n  Here is another sentence from this same letter signed by Nicholas \nBurns. I will have it printed in the Record so Senators will be able to \nread the letter in its entirety.\n\n       We need the Committee-recommended level of funding to \n     ensure that we can adequately house and protect U.S. \n     Government staff for our mission in Baghdad. Less than the \n     full Committee-recommended funding level will delay moving \n     our people into more safe, secure, and functional facilities, \n     causing greater risks to U.S. Government personnel.\n\n  That is good enough for me. I think it is good enough for the Senate, \nand I hope the Senate will reject this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter that I referred to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2005.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, As the Senate considers the President's \n     FY 2005 Supplemental request, I would like to draw attention \n     to the Committee recommendation of $592 million for funding \n     the New Embassy Compound (NEC) in Baghdad. We appreciate the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee including the funding for the \n     NEC and while each element of the President's request is \n     critical and deserves the full support of Congress, I \n     understand that amendments may be offered that would \n     drastically reduce the funding level recommended by the \n     Appropriations Committee to build the new Embassy.\n       On behalf of the Secretary of State, I am writing to \n     support the full funding recommendation of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee. We need the Committee-recommended \n     level of funding to ensure that we can adequately house and \n     protect U.S. Government staff for our mission in Baghdad. \n     Less than the full Committee-recommended funding level will \n     delay moving our people into more safe, secure, and \n     functional facilities, causing greater risks to U.S. \n     Government personnel. The completed NEC, as currently planned \n     and budgeted, will provide personnel from the Department of \n     State and the other civilian agencies with the best possible \n     security situation under the circumstances. We must begin \n     construction of this compound as soon as possible to improve \n     the safety and security of our U.S. Government employees. The \n     current offices and housing in the Palace complex are \n     operationally inadequate, as the facilities were never \n     designed as offices and are only marginally usable as an \n     Embassy. We need an appropriate, secure facility to carry out \n     the U.S. Government's business in Iraq. Furthermore, the \n     Palace complex has symbolic importance to the Iraqi people. \n     We have agreed to return the Palace and other properties to \n     them and returning the Palace will be a symbol of \n     normalization in our relations.\n       This funding request in the supplemental is more urgent as \n     a result of the highly successful Iraqi elections. Now that \n     it is clear that Iraq is on the road to full sovereignty, \n     building a permanent United States embassy has become \n     imperative. In order to complete compound construction within \n     24 months construction must start now. The NEC buildings are \n     being planned with the maximum flexibility so that the \n     mission needs for U.S. Government agencies, including the \n     State Department, can be accommodated upon completion. We \n     have sized the NEC to meet interagency vetted diplomatic, \n     functional, and security requirements. Should we not receive \n     the full Committee recommended funding level in the Senate \n     passed supplemental, we would be unable to build an embassy \n     that meets those safety, security and space requirements. \n     Additionally, without full funding of the Committee \n     recommendation site maintenance costs would be extended and \n     the costs of construction could rise. In the meantime, the \n     high security and operating costs associated with the interim \n     embassy facilities would remain.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with the Congress to \n     secure the funding required for this important project. Thank \n     you for your support of this Supplemental request.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            R. Nicholas Burns,\n\n                                      Under Secretary of State for\n                                                Political Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, again, great words. True. We need to do \nit. But that doesn't address the issue of why that money should not go \nthrough the regular process on the outyears. I understand the tough job \nthe chairman has to do.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 467, withdrawn\n\n  With that, I will move, if I may, to the next amendment, No. 467.\n  Madam President, this is an amendment that ought not have to be \nbrought forward. There is no question that there was, in fact, \nsignificant damage and flooding at the University of Hawaii. There was, \nin fact, significant loss of records and volumes at the University of \nHawaii. There was, in fact, over $30 million in FEMA money that was \nsent to the University of Hawaii. There was, in fact, a $10 million \nmatching contribution from the State of Hawaii for that matching grant. \nThere is at least $25 million in insurance proceeds to go with the \nState assembly that was also trying to actively increase that amount, \nand public statements were made by the president of the University of \nHawaii outlining the damage assessment, with this $10 million that is \nnot truly an emergency anymore in this bill.\n  This is not directed toward the Senator from Hawaii in any way. I \nwanted to talk about this, and then I am going to withdraw this \namendment, if I have a unanimous consent to do it. But I want to use it \nas an example of what we shouldn't be doing.\n  The fact is, they haven't even spent all the money that has been sent \nout there for the repair of this facility right now. On an emergency \nbasis, we are going to appropriate $10 million more. If you total up \neverything, if you take what the University of Hawaii said and others \nhave said about the total cost of the flood, $50 million, there is \ngoing to be $100 million that goes toward the University of Hawaii for \na $50 million flood. That is bad enough. But this is not the way we \nought to be doing this process.\n  I am standing on the floor of the Senate today to offer amendments, \nnot critical of any one individual but critical of the process because \nI believe if we don't have a functional, structural process change in \nhow we appropriate taxpayer dollars in this country, we are going to \nundermine the standard of living for the next few generations. We very \nwell could be the first generation of Americans to leave the next \ngeneration worse off.\n  I believe things that are in an emergency bill ought to be truly \nemergencies. No. 1, they ought to have to be spent out in a short \nperiod of time, and with that comes the authorization for further \nspending so the appropriations committees can have the direction, so \nthey don't have to spend it all and then rescind it.\n  I believe we need to change things. We look around to our children. \nWe see a future, we see hope, we see promise. But we see all of that in \nlight of what we see today. We don't think down the road about what \npotentially can happen to our country--now $9 trillion in debt, with \n$600 billion worth of trade deficit every year with multiple poor \ncountries in the world that export agricultural products holding large \namounts of our dollars that are also dependent on our dollars staying \nat a certain value. We have to think long range about how we do this.\n\n  I am challenging how we think, not to make a mark or to direct \nanything\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\ntoward any individual person. We have to change. I will stand on every \nappropriations bill to come in the future and I will personally read \nthe appropriations report language to find out what is there, and use \nthe privilege granted to me as a Member of this body to raise these \nissues until we change how we do it.\n  It is my hope I don't have to do that. I don't want to have to do \nthat. But it is very important we start down a new road. It is not a \npartisan issue. It does not have anything to do with Democrats or \nRepublicans but it has to do with our children, the future of our \ncountry, the viability of defending ourselves.\n  Every dollar we waste or do not spend appropriately is $1 we cannot \nuse to defend ourselves or create the technology to compete in this \nglobal economy. We have to do what is right for future generations.\n  I will withdraw this amendment, as well, but I want to put my fellow \nMembers on notice that I will be bringing this up. It is time to \nchange. I don't do that with any ill will. I don't do it saying I have \nall the knowledge. But what I do know is I want a future for our \ncountry and for the children. We cannot continue doing what we are \ndoing in terms of spending. We cannot continue either the process or \nthe procedure on how we are doing it.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment numbered \n467.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for withdrawing this \namendment.\n  If I may, for clarification, so the record can be clear, the United \nStates historically has responded expeditiously to all disasters--\nnatural or domestic, manmade--when American communities seek \nassistance. For example, we provided $2 billion for the Midwest floods \nin 1993. We provided $56 million to Oklahoma City for the Murrah \nFederal Building disaster--not for the building itself but for other \nprojects, community development, street alignments, and such. We also \nprovided over $3 billion for Midwest floods in 1997, and for all of the \nhurricanes.\n  This flood in Moanalua Valley on the island of Oahu in Hawaii was one \nof those extraordinary disasters that occurs about once every 100 \nyears. It went down the valley and literally wiped out parts of the \nUniversity of Hawaii. I point out that the university library has not \nreceived any FEMA funds. These funds are beyond what the State has put \nin for construction and reconstruction and rebuilding. This is for \ncleanup. This is for restoration of books so our students can continue \nstudying. We are not asking for anything more than what other \ncommunities have been receiving.\n  I am most grateful to the Senator from Oklahoma for withdrawing his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have an amendment pending numbered 443 \nand I would like to speak to it. I will not call it for a vote because \nthere may be need for debate in the Senate.\n  This is an amendment I am cosponsoring with Senator Levin and Senator \nFeinstein. The amendment requires that none of the funds appropriated \nby this supplemental appropriations bill be expended to subject anyone \nin the custody or control of the United States to torture or cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment.\n  I know the managers of the bill are trying to dispense with \namendments. I understand this amendment has been cleared by the \nmanagers. However, one Senator or another on the other side of aisle \nhas objected, so a rollcall vote might be necessary.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider for a moment what could possibly be \nthe basis for a Senator objecting to an amendment which says we won't \nspend any American taxpayer funds to torture prisoners. We have signed \nall the treaties. We have passed the laws. This is the law of the land.\n  This amendment says, let's remind people again that what happened at \nAbu Ghraib is not American policy. The abuses at Guantanamo Bay are not \nAmerican policy. It is aberrant conduct. It is the kind of conduct \nwhich we do not condone.\n  We should state clearly in this appropriations bill that all the \nmoney being appropriated--$80 billion plus--is not to be used for the \npurposes of torture.\n  This should be an easy amendment. In fact, it has passed twice in the \nSenate by unanimous consent. But now a Senator on the other side of the \naisle has problems with it. I don't understand. It simply affirms our \nNation's very important, longstanding obligation not to engage in \ntorture or other cruel treatment. That standard is in the U.S. \nConstitution and in many treaties ratified by the United States.\n  I wrote this amendment very carefully. I am not putting in any new \nlanguage, new ideas. I am restating existing law that governs the \nconduct of Americans. It is limited to the torture or cruel and inhuman \nor degrading treatment ``that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws \nor treaties of the United States.'' In other words, it prohibits \nconduct already prohibited under U.S. law. It simply restates it. It is \nimportant we do restate it.\n  I am afraid one of the terrible legacies of the invasion of Iraq is \ngoing to be this whole question of how we treated prisoners. We should \nnot mince words. We are opposed to torture and cruel, inhuman, or \ndegrading treatment. We have voted that way before. The American people \nsupport that. We should say so in this supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  This amendment specifically provides:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any \n     person under the Geneva Conventions or whether a person is \n     entitled to protections of Geneva Conventions.\n\n  So the amendment does not extend the protections of the Geneva \nConventions to anyone who does not already have those protections.\n  It is important to note this amendment is virtually identical to an \namendment I offered to last year's Defense authorization bill and an \namendment Senators McCain and Lieberman offered to the intelligence \nreform bill. Both of them were adopted by the Senate by unanimous voice \nvotes. In fact, this amendment is actually more limited than those \nbecause it applies only to funds appropriated and does not contain any \nreporting requirements.\n  Last year, when he accepted my amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill, Senator Warner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nsaid in the Senate:\n\n       The unambiguous policy of this and preceding \n     administrations is to comply with and enforce this Nation's \n     obligations under international law. These obligations are \n     embedded in American domestic law.\n\n  Senator Warner continues:\n\n       So I think it is very important we do the codification, as \n     the Senator [from Illinois] recommends.\n\n  Unfortunately, in conference, the Defense authorization amendment was \nrevised to a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate amendment. The intelligence \nreform amendment was eliminated in conference. That is why I am \noffering this amendment today.\n  It is important. Many around the world, especially in the Muslim \nworld, are watching us, watching the United States, and they want to \nknow whether we will stand by our treaty obligations in this age of \nterrorism. With American troops in harm's way, Congress must send a \nclear signal that we are committed to treating all detainees humanely.\n  The prohibition on torture and other cruel treatment is deeply rooted \nin American history. The Framers of the Constitution made clear they \nintended the Bill of Rights to prohibit torture and other forms of \ncruel punishment. It was un-American then; it is un-American now.\n  These principles guided us during times of war. In the Civil War, \nPresident Abraham Lincoln asked Francis Lieber, a military law expert, \nto create a set of rules to govern the conduct of U.S. soldiers in the \nfield. The result, the so-called Lieber Code, prohibited torture and \nother cruel treatment of captured enemy forces. This was the foundation \nfor the modern law of war, which is embodied in the Geneva Conventions.\n  After World War II, we discovered what had happened in Nazi Germany. \nHorrified by those abuses, the United\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nStates and its allies created a new international legal order based on \nrespect for human rights. One of the fundamental tenets of this new \norder was a universal prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment. The United States took the lead in this effort, \nestablishing a number of treaties that banned the use of torture and \nother cruel treatment against all persons at all times. There are no \nexceptions to this prohibition.\n\n  The United States, along with a majority of countries in the world, \nis a party to the Geneva Conventions, the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights, and the Torture Convention, all of which \nprohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, the exact \nwords in my amendment.\n  Aside from our legal obligations, there are also important practical \nreasons for standing by this commitment.\n  Torture is ineffective. It is an interrogation tactic that produces \nunreliable information. People who are being tortured will say almost \nanything to stop the pain.\n  Resorting to torture will make it harder for us to defeat terror. In \nthe words of the independent 9/11 Commission:\n\n       Allegations that the United States abused prisoners in its \n     custody make it harder to build the diplomatic, political, \n     and military alliances the government will need [to win the \n     war on terrorism.]\n\n  The 9/11 Commission was right.\n  Most importantly, engaging in torture or cruel treatment places our \nbrave service men and women at risk. The U.S. Army knows this. The Army \nField Manual on Intelligence Interrogation says the following:\n\n       Use of torture or other illegal methods is a poor technique \n     that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent \n     collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he \n     thinks the interrogator wants to hear. Revelation of use of \n     torture by U.S. personnel will bring discredit upon the U.S. \n     and its Armed Forces while undermining domestic and \n     international support for the war effort. It may also place \n     U.S. and allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk of \n     abuse by their captors.\n\n  Retired RADM John Hutson served our country 28 years. For the last 3 \nyears he was the Judge Advocate General, the top lawyer in the Navy. \nLast week he sent me a letter in support of this amendment. He wrote as \nfollows:\n\n       Clarion opposition to torture and other abuse by the U.S. \n     will help protect U.S. troops who are in harm's way.\n\n  Former Congressman Pete Peterson, a personal friend of mine, a man I \nserved with in the House of Representatives, was a prisoner of war in \nVietnam for 6\\1/2\\ years. He came to see me recently. He is doing \ngreat. He was our former Ambassador to Vietnam under President Clinton. \nIn a letter of support for this amendment he said:\n\n       Congress must affirm that America stands by its moral and \n     legal obligation to treat all prisoners, regardless of \n     status, as we would want the enemy to treat our own. Our \n     courageous service men and women deserve nothing less.\n\n  As the great American patriot Thomas Paine said:\n\n       He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even \n     his enemy from oppression.\n\n  This year, Congress should affirm that the United States will not \nengage in torture and other cruel treatment.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership on the bill. We are reaching \na point where there are only four or five identified germane amendments \nand this is one of them. I would like to call this amendment for a \nvote. I know there are some on your side who may want to speak to the \namendment so I will not try to do it at this time, but I would hope any \nstaffers or those listening to the debate who know of opposition to \nthis amendment would contact the chairman and let him know when they \nare coming to the floor. I will join them and in short order summarize \nwhat I have said, answer their comments, and ask for a vote. I know the \nchairman is anxious to get this bill completed to send to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to assure the Senator we will \nhave an opportunity to vote on any amendments that require votes. There \nare some Senators who are off the premises right now and I ask they be \ngiven some notice so they can get back. We will confer with the leader \nand I will consult with the Senator from Illinois. I thank the Senator \nfor his assurances.\n\n\n                              REAL ID Act\n\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition to the REAL ID Act. The REAL ID \nAct is a measure the House Republicans attached to the supplemental \nappropriations bill. It has little or nothing to do with appropriations \nfor tsunami victims, or appropriations for our men and women in \nuniform. It is a separate immigration matter, and a very controversial \none.\n  They chose this bill because they know we need this bill. It needs to \nbe signed by the President. So they are hoping to push through this \nchange in immigration law on a bill that is a must-pass bill. We have \nhad no hearings, no debate, no votes in the Senate on this so-called \nREAL ID Act.\n  The Senate Republican leadership has stated it is opposed to \nincluding this act in the appropriations bill. I hope they mean it. The \ntest will come when this bill returns from the conference committee.\n  I want to take a couple minutes to explain why the REAL ID Act is \nsomething we should debate. The proponents of this act claim it is \nsimple, that all it wants to do is prevent illegal immigrants from \nobtaining driver's licenses.\n  Several States across America have decided, in their State \nlegislatures, to allow the issuance of State driver's licenses to \npeople who are not documented. You know the argument: Those people are \ngoing to drive anyway. It is better they are licensed, that they \nclearly have demonstrated they can drive a truck or a car, and they \nhave insurance.\n  Now, we can get into that debate, and it would be an interesting one, \nas to whether those States have made the right decision. This bill says \nall the States that have decided to issue the driver's licenses are \nwrong. So it would prohibit those who are undocumented from receiving \ndriver's licenses.\n  If that were the only issue, it is one we could debate for a little \nwhile and decide whether we ought to preempt all of these State \nlegislatures. But this bill does so much more. The REAL ID Act would \nmean real big problems for the States and a lot of people. It imposes \nvery difficult standards for driver's licenses on the States.\n  When we passed the intelligence reform bill, we carefully crafted \nlanguage--bipartisan language--to establish standards for States \nissuing driver's licenses. We did not tell the States who could receive \na driver's license. That has always been a State decision. But we \nrequired that the Federal Government work cooperatively with the States \nto create minimum Federal standards for driver's licenses. Standards \nwill be established for, among other things, documents presented as \nproof of identity, fraud prevention, and security features included in \ndriver's licenses.\n  The REAL ID bill goes far beyond this intelligence reform provision. \nIts impact will be felt by every American when they go in for a \ndriver's license. It requires that the State DMV verify every document, \nincluding birth certificates, presented by every applicant, including \nAmerican citizens. This means significant expense and long processing \ndelays.\n  If a State, incidentally, fails to comply with the REAL ID provisions \nincluded in the House bill, no resident of that State--listen to this \ncarefully--no resident of that State will be able to use their driver's \nlicense for Federal purposes. So what would that mean? The most common \nform of identification in an airport is a driver's license. If you have \nbeen on an airplane, you know it. People bring out their driver's \nlicense.\n  This provision coming over from the Republican House says if your \nState does not comply with this law, if you are a resident of that \nState, you cannot use your driver's license to get on an airplane. What \nwill you use? If you have a passport, I guess you could use it, but \nmany people do not have a passport. So it goes way beyond what it needs \nto do to make certain we have secure driver's licenses.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have already addressed the issue of \ndriver's license security in the intelligence reform bill. The Federal \nGovernment is already meeting with State governments to negotiate new \nminimum Federal standards for driver's licenses. The REAL ID Act would \nstop this process dead in its tracks by repealing the\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\ndriver's license provision in the intelligence reform bill.\n  Incidentally, the REAL ID Act is opposed strongly by the States. \nEvery Senator has received a letter opposing the REAL ID Act from the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Council of State Governments, and the American \nAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administrators. They have said clearly, \nthis REAL ID Act will ``impose technological standards and verification \nprocedures, many of which are beyond the current capacity of even the \nFederal Government.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 17, 2005.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: We write to express \n     our opposition to Title II of H.R. 418, the ``Improved \n     Security For Driver's Licenses and Personal Identification \n     Cards'' provision, which has been attached to H.R. 1268, the \n     fiscal year 2005 supplemental spending measure. While \n     Governors, state legislatures, other state elected officials \n     and motor vehicle administrators share your concern for \n     increasing the security and integrity of the driver's license \n     and state identification processes, we firmly believe that \n     the driver's license and ID card provisions of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     offer the best course for meeting those goals.\n       The ``Driver's Licenses and Personal Identification Cards'' \n     provision in the Intelligence Reform Act of 1004 provides a \n     workable framework for developing meaningful standards to \n     increase reliability and security of driver's licenses and ID \n     cards. This framework calls for input from state elected \n     officials and motor vehicle administrators in the regulatory \n     process, protects state eligibility criteria, and retains the \n     flexibility necessary to incorporate best practices from \n     around the states. We have begun to work with the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation to develop the minimum \n     standards, which must be completed in 18 months pursuant to \n     the Intelligence Reform Act.\n       We commend the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     for their commitment to driver's license integrity; however, \n     H.R. 418 would impose technological standards and \n     verification procedures on states, many of which are beyond \n     the current capacity of even the federal government. \n     Moreover, the cost of implementing such standards and \n     verification procedures for the 220 million driver's licenses \n     issued by states represents a massive unfunded federal \n     mandate.\n       Our states have made great strides since the September 11, \n     2001 terrorists attacks to enhance the security processes and \n     requirements for receiving a valid driver's license and ID \n     card. The framework in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 \n     will allow us to work cooperatively with the federal \n     government to develop and implement achievable standards to \n     prevent document fraud and other illegal activity related to \n     the issuance of driver's licenses and ID cards.\n       We urge you to allow the provisions in the Intelligence \n     Reform Act of 2004 to work. Governors, state legislators, \n     other state elected officials and motor vehicle \n     administrators are committed to this process because it will \n     allow us to develop mutually agreed-upon standards that can \n     truly help create a more secure America.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raymond C. Scheppach,\n       Executive Director, National Governors Association.\n     Linda R. Lewis,\n       President and CEO, American Association of Motor Vehicle \n     Administrators.\n     William T. Pound,\n       Executive Director, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n     Dan Sprague,\n       Executive Director, Council of State Governments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. COL Margaret Stock, who is a law professor at West Point, \npoints out that military personnel around the world will be \ndramatically impacted if their State driver's licenses are not accepted \nby the Federal Government. It is not simply a matter of getting on an \nairplane. For our men and women overseas it can be much worse. She \nwrote:\n\n       This law threatens to disrupt thousands of routine yet \n     official acts that occur daily on every military post in the \n     world. . . .The proposed law threatens vital functions of the \n     Department of Defense, and promises unforeseen headaches for \n     military personnel and their family members.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             The ``REAL ID'' Act--A Real Nightmare for DoD\n\n                    (By LTC Margaret D. Stock, USAR)\n\n       If you watched or heard the congressional debate over H.R. \n     418, the ``REAL ID Act of 2005,'' you might have thought this \n     proposed law--which passed the House of Representatives \n     Friday, February 11, 2005, by a vote of 261-161--was all \n     about stopping terrorists from getting on airplanes. But you \n     would be wrong. This bill--which sets new rules for state \n     motor vehicle departments (DMVs)--promises to be more of a \n     nightmare for DoD than a deterrent to any terrorists.\n       Consider this language, which is found in the section \n     creating federal standards for state driver's licenses and \n     identification cards:\n       ``Beginning 3 years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, a Federal agency may not accept, for any official \n     purpose, a driver's license or identification card issued by \n     a State to any person unless the State is meeting the \n     requirements of this section.''\n       No state currently meets the requirements of the proposed \n     law, and it's unlikely that many will be able to comply \n     within three years. the ``REAL ID'' Act would require, among \n     other things, that each state create an expensive new \n     computer system for issuing state driver's licenses and \n     identification cards; obtain security clearances for its DMV \n     employees; verify with the issuing agency the validity of \n     each document offered by an applicant in support of a \n     driver's license application; put digital photos on all \n     licenses; print the principal residence of the applicant on \n     the face of the license; ensure that all prior licenses have \n     been terminated before issuing a new one; verify the \n     immigration status of all applicants; and color-code licenses \n     to show that the state has complied with the law. While all \n     these goals may be laudable, achieving them any time soon is \n     almost impossible, particularly within three year. And yet \n     any license issued in violation of this law cannot be used \n     ``for any official'' federal purpose unless a special waiver \n     is granted by the secretary of homeland security.\n       Here are some ``official'' federal purposes for which state \n     driver's licenses and identification cards are commonly used \n     by military members, their families, and their friends:\n       Enlisting in the military; obtaining an initial military \n     identification card; Obtaining a U.S. passport; voting in a \n     federal election; registering a vehicle on a military \n     installation; entering a military installation; driving on a \n     military installation; entering a federal building; writing a \n     check to a federal agency; obtaining federal firearms \n     licenses; boarding an airplane; boarding an Amtrak train; or \n     obtaining federal hunting or fishing licenses.\n       If this law passes, military members and their families \n     won't be able to do any of these things with their state \n     driver's licenses and ID cards--unless they are lucky enough \n     to be residents of a state that manages to meet the three-\n     year deadline for compliance.\n       Military personnel will be harmed by this law in other ways \n     as well: Deployments often prevent soldiers from renewing \n     their licenses in a timely manner, and many states give them \n     ``automatic extensions.'' These extensions would be barred. \n     Many states currently issue licenses to military members that \n     are ``valid without photo.'' This practice will not be barred \n     by federal law. The REAL ID Act on its face also bars \n     military police and other federal law enforcement officials \n     from using state driver's licenses and ID cards to identify \n     criminal suspects.\n       At a time when federal and state budgets are under \n     tremendous pressure, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     estimates the cost of complying with ``REAL ID'' to be in \n     excess of $120 million--$20 million more than the cost of \n     complying with the legislation enacted last year in Public \n     Law 108-458, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004. This CBO estimate, however, is probably a vast \n     underestimate of the true cost of the proposed law. Worse, \n     Congress has not agreed to pay for the required upgrades to \n     state DMV systems, making ``REAL ID'' yet another ``massive \n     unfunded mandate,'' according to both the National \n     Governor's Association and the American Association of \n     Motor Vehicle Administrators. If the federal government \n     isn't going to pay to implement this law, most states \n     won't be able to pay for it without raising taxes--and all \n     of their residents will be punished accordingly.\n       Indirectly, however, DoD will suffer--because this law \n     threatens to disrupt thousands of routine yet official acts \n     that occur daily on every military post in the world. Those \n     who already have military ID cards or who carry a passport \n     around at all times can avoid some of the problems with this \n     law--but a US passport or military ID doesn't give a person \n     the right to drive on a military base. Also, anyone without a \n     passport or other Federal ID prior to the effective date of \n     the law will have difficulty obtaining one unless she can \n     produce some other valid government-issued picture \n     identification, such as a foreign passport. Strangely, this \n     law will make it easier for foreigners or naturalized \n     citizens to travel than native-born Americans: The law allows \n     the use of a foreign passport, but bars the use of American\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\n     state-issued licenses and identification cards.\n       REAL ID's sponsors claim the law will stop terrorists from \n     getting on airplanes. The flaw in this logic is that the 9/11 \n     terrorists did not need state driver's licenses to board the \n     airplanes they hijacked--they could have used their foreign \n     passports, and at least one of them did. Is meeting a false \n     ``security gap'' a reason to spend millions forcing the \n     states to conform to the ``REAL ID'' requirements?\n       REAL ID's sponsors are seeking support in the Senate. Their \n     bill, however, goes far beyond the common-sense driver's \n     license provisions enacted last year in Public Law 108- 458, \n     the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. \n     The ``REAL ID'' Act almost completely preempts state \n     regulation of driver's licenses and effectively creates a \n     national ID card by federal fiat. The proposed law threatens \n     vital functions of the Department of Defense, and promises \n     unforeseen headaches for military personnel and their family \n     members. The reforms enacted late last year by Congress were \n     sensible and worthy, but the ``REAL ID'' Act is a recipe for \n     chaos.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Separate and apart from the driver's license issue, the \nREAL ID Act goes into other equally important and controversial issues. \nIt would dramatically raise the standards for receiving asylum. This \nprovision is supposedly aimed at terrorists but applies to all asylum \napplicants. Current law already prohibits--already prohibits--suspected \nterrorists from obtaining asylum. That is not an issue.\n  In Illinois, there is a wonderful social-services agency called \nHeartland Alliance. One of the things they do is provide assistance to \nrefugees who have come to Illinois from all over the world. Heartland \nAlliance is not a political organization. They are down in the trenches \ndoing important work for people in need. So when I received a letter \nfrom them telling me the REAL ID Act would hurt the people they serve, \nI paid attention.\n  Let me tell you what they said:\n\n       REAL ID threatens to eliminate relief for immigrants most \n     in need of protection--those fleeing persecution in their \n     home countries. REAL ID is inconsistent with our commitment \n     to international agreements relating to refugees, and it \n     violates some of the rights that we, as a nation of \n     immigrants and a global leader of human rights, cherish.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Heartland Alliance,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 25, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: At the opening of the 109th Congress, \n     national security and immigration reform concern Americans as \n     never before. In response to these concerns, the House of \n     Representatives introduced legislation that, if passed into \n     law, would undermine the asylum provisions of immigration law \n     while doing nothing to effectively advance national security \n     REAL ID (HR 418) will not provide the immigration reform \n     needed or advance national security, but it will force us to \n     turn our backs on asylum seekers.\n       REAL ID is not Congress' first attempt to dismantle the \n     asylum system in an effort to further national security. \n     These ill-conceived changes to asylum law were proposed as \n     part of the intelligence reform bill last year, but Congress \n     (following the lead of the 9/11 Commission which found no \n     fault with the current asylum system) wisely excluded these \n     changes from the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. \n     Despite the findings of the 9/11 Commission, REAL ID \n     threatens to eliminate relief for immigrants most in need of \n     protection--those fleeing persecution in their home \n     countries. REAL ID is inconsistent with our commitments to \n     international agreements relating to refugees, and it \n     violates some of the rights that we, a nation of immigrants \n     and a global leader of human rights, cherish.\n       REAL ID Eviscerates Due Process Protections In the Asylum \n     Adjudication Process:\n       Judicial oversight guarantees a full and fair process in \n     proceedings that can literally mean life or death to asylum \n     applicants. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized \n     that ``caseload pressures and . . . resource constraints'' \n     can cause errors in Immigration Courts; the growing dockets \n     make these errors more inevitable. However, because all \n     immigrants are ``entitled to a national analysis of the \n     evidence,'' judicial review must exist to maintain this \n     standard.\n       REAL ID would suspend habeas corpus review for many \n     immigrants, denying them one of the most cherished \n     protections from government abuse. This provision would \n     prevent parole for immigrants challenging unwarranted \n     detention or deprivation of fundamental freedoms.\n       REAL ID eliminates stays of removal pending judicial \n     review. Stays of removal exist to allow asylum seekers to \n     remain in the United States while petitioning for relief. The \n     7th Circuit has explained that this right is especially \n     ``vital when the alien seeks asylum or contends that he would \n     be subject to torture if returned,'' but by deporting asylum \n     seekers, REAL ID would make it impossible for these asylum \n     seekers to see their case to its judicial end.\n       REAL ID Will Result in the Denial of Asylum to Those Who \n     Are Persecuted:\n       REAL ID raises the burden of proof for asylum applicants by \n     requiring them to prove that the central reason for their \n     persecution is one of the five protected grounds. Applicants \n     can rarely prove the unspoken intent of their persecutors. \n     Moreover, persecution rarely happens for one specific reason. \n     The current law recognizes this limitation and grants asylum \n     to many individuals who have suffered persecution for complex \n     or multiple reasons. Women fleeing female genital \n     mutilation, domestic violence, and honor killings, and \n     victims from political contexts where economic or sexual \n     violence such as extortion, kidnapping for ransom, and \n     rape are political tools can find safe haven in the United \n     States. REAL ID would eliminate asylum for these and other \n     deserving individuals.\n       Under current law and longstanding international authority, \n     individuals may be granted asylum based solely on their \n     credible testimony explaining their well-founded fear of \n     persecution. The law relects the reality that refugees cannot \n     obtain documents from their persecutors. REAL ID would give \n     Immigration Judges wide discretion to deny relief from \n     removal simply because the immigrant lacks corroborating \n     evidence, even when the applicant's testimony is found to be \n     credible. For example, under this provision, a refugee may be \n     denied protection if his country lacks sufficient \n     infrastructure to issue official documentation.\n       Because credibility determinations are notoriously \n     subjective, judges must substantiate their findings in \n     reasoned judgments, and they may not make negative \n     credibility findings based on minor inconsistencies in \n     testimony. REAL ID eliminates these safeguards. It would \n     allow judges to determine credibility based on any alleged \n     inconsistency with any prior statements, even if that \n     inconsistency is immaterial to the person's claim. Judges \n     could also use an applicant's demeanor, perceived candor, or \n     responsiveness as a basis for a credibility finding.\n       REAL ID will damage asylum seekers' right to protection \n     while doing nothing to enhance our national security. The \n     current U.S. asylum system screens all applicants using \n     thorough background checks and allows the U.S. State \n     Department to comment on all applications. Under the existing \n     system, asylum is granted only to those who establish that \n     they are refugees and who have no ties to criminal or \n     terrorist organizations. If REAL ID is passed in its current \n     form, many deserving applicants will be denied refuge in this \n     country.\n       If Congress truly wishes to address the link between \n     immigration and national security, it must turn its full \n     attention to the problem. Because of their piecemeal nature, \n     the asylum provisions of REAL ID are ineffective. \n     Furthermore, attempts to tack on these provisions as \n     amendments to appropriations bills reflect an unwillingness \n     to recognize the need for immigration reform. We need a \n     better system for tracking arriving and departing non-\n     citizens; we need to improve security screening while \n     reducing backlogs that keep families separated for years and \n     U.S. employers short of labor. We do not, however, need to \n     throw out an effective system and replace it with harmful \n     provisions in REAL ID.\n       As a representative of the people of Illinois and a Senate \n     leader, we appeal to you to vigorously oppose REAL ID and to \n     encourage your colleagues to do the same. We hope you will \n     work as our ally to ensure that the bill docs not pass. \n     Moreover, we hope to continue working with you to ensure \n     comprehensive reform that improves our immigration system, \n     strengthens our national security, and reflects the will of \n     the general public and our common values; REAL ID docs none \n     of these. We would welcome an opportunity to talk to you \n     further about the REAL ID and will contact your office within \n     the next few days to arrange a meeting with you or your \n     staff.

I have heard Members of Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, Senators and Congressmen, step forward and \ntalk about religious persecution in other countries. I have heard \npeople on both sides of the aisle lamenting some of these human rights \nabuses in other countries where people who are simply expressing their \npoints of view are imprisoned.\n  We have said, and I believe, that the United States is in favor of \nfreedom around the world. So the victims of oppression, the victims of \ntyranny, the victims of dictatorships, when they escape, come to the \nshores of the United States and ask us if we will give them refuge \nuntil their country changes. And we have done it. It is one thing to \nsay you stand for freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom \nof the press; it is another to prove it by accepting these refugees.\n  This bill, the so-called REAL ID Act, will make it much more \ndifficult for those refugees to come to our shores. If this becomes \nlaw, it will become very difficult for individuals fleeing persecution \nand torture to receive asylum in the United States. If we shut the door \nto the most vulnerable, how can we continue to preach to the rest of \nthe world about our commitment to democracy?\n  Remember President Reagan's vision of our Nation. He called it ``a \nshining city on a hill.'' Here is what he said:\n\n       If there have to be city walls, the walls have doors and \n     the doors are open to anyone with the will and heart to get \n     here. . . . The city is a beacon . . . a magnet for all who \n     must have freedom, for all pilgrims from all the lost places \n     who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.\n\n  Like me, President Reagan was the son of an immigrant. We had very \ndifferent political philosophies, but President Reagan understood that \nour great country has always been a sanctuary for those fleeing \npersecution and oppression.\n  Even the conservative Wall Street Journal is opposed to the REAL ID \nAct. In an editorial they called the driver's license provisions \n``costly and intrusive.'' They said:\n\n       It's not hard to imagine these de facto national ID cards--\n\n  Which they believe this bill would create--\n\n     turning into the kind of domestic passport that U.S. citizens \n     would be asked to produce for everyday commercial and \n     financial tasks.\n\n  They also called the asylum provisions ``dubious.'' That is the Wall \nStreet Journal. Listen to what they said:\n\n       The last thing a terrorist would want to do is apply for \n     asylum. Not only would he be bringing himself to the \n     attention of the U.S. government--the first step is being \n     fingerprinted--but the screening process for applicants is \n     more rigorous than for just about anyone else trying to enter \n     the country. . . . Raising the barrier for asylum seekers at \n     this point would only increase the likelihood of turning away \n     the truly persecuted.\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal, not known as a bleeding-heart \npublication. They think the REAL ID Act makes no sense in fighting \nterrorism.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 17, 2005]\n\n                           National ID Party\n\n       Republicans swept to power in Congress 10 years ago \n     championing State prerogatives, and one of their first acts \n     was to repeal Federal speed-limit requirements. Another was \n     aimed at ending unfunded State mandates. So last week's House \n     vote to require costly and intrusive Federal standards for \n     State drivers' licenses is a measure of how far the party has \n     strayed from these federalist principles.\n       More important, it reveals a mindset among some that more \n     enforcement alone will bring better border security and \n     reduce illegal immigration. The bill that passed the House \n     last week and now goes to the Senate is known as the Real ID \n     Act, and the driver's license requirements may not even be \n     the worst part of the legislation. Also included are \n     unnecessary provisions that would make it much more difficult \n     for foreigners to seek asylum in the U.S.\n       House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, who authored \n     the bill, insists that his goal is to reduce the terrorist \n     threat, not immigration. But it just so happens that the \n     bill's provisions have long occupied the wish list of anti-\n     immigration lawmakers and activists. Mr. Sensenbrenner \n     produced a photo of Mohammed Atta during the floor debate \n     last week, arguing that the 9/11 hijackers' ability to obtain \n     drivers' licenses and use them to board airplanes represents \n     a security loophole.\n       His solution is to force States to issue federally approved \n     drivers' licenses with digital photographs and ``machine-\n     readable technology.'' In theory, states can opt out, but if \n     they do their drivers' licenses will no longer be accepted as \n     identification to board planes, purchase guns, enter Federal \n     buildings and so forth. It's not hard to imagine these de \n     facto national ID cards turning into a kind of domestic \n     passport that U.S. citizens would be asked to produce for \n     everyday commercial and financial tasks.\n       Aside from the privacy implications of this show-us-your-\n     papers Sensenbrenner approach, and the fact that governors, \n     State legislatures and motor vehicle departments have \n     denounced the bill as expensive and burdensome, there's \n     another reality: Even if the Real ID Act had been in place \n     prior to 9/11, it's unlikely that the license provisions \n     would have prevented the attacks.\n       That's because all of the hijackers entered the U.S. \n     legally, which means they qualified for drivers' licenses. \n     The Real ID Act wouldn't change that. Moreover, you don't \n     need a driver's license to fly. Other forms of \n     identification--such as a passport--are acceptable and also \n     were available to the hijackers. Nothing in the Sensenbrenner \n     bill would change that, either.\n       The biggest impact will be on undocumented workers in the \n     U.S., which is why the immigration restrictionists are \n     pushing for the legislation. But denying drivers' licenses to \n     illegal aliens won't result in fewer immigrants. It will \n     result in more immigrants driving illegally and without \n     insurance.\n       Mr. Sensenbrenner's claims that tougher asylum provisions \n     will make us safer are also dubious. The last thing a \n     terrorist would want to do is apply for asylum. Not only \n     would he be bringing himself to the attention of the U.S. \n     government--the first step is being fingerprinted--but the \n     screening process for applicants is more rigorous than for \n     just about anyone else trying to enter the country. In the \n     past decade, perhaps a half-dozen individuals with some kind \n     of terrorists ties have applied for asylum. All were \n     rejected.\n       The Real ID Act would raise the bar substantially for \n     granting asylum to people fleeing persecution. But this is a \n     solution in search of a problem. A decade ago the U.S. asylum \n     laws were in fact being abused by foreigners with weak claims \n     who knew they would receive work permits while their cases \n     were pending.\n       But in 1994, the Clinton Administration issued regulations \n     to curb this abuse. The law now says that asylum seekers \n     cannot receive work permits until they have won their case. \n     Applications per year subsequently have fallen to about \n     30,000 today from 140,000 in the early 1990s. This was the \n     biggest abuse of the system, and it's been fixed. Raising the \n     barrier for asylum seekers at this point would only increase \n     the likelihood of turning away the truly persecuted.\n       But the bigger problem with Mr. Sensenbrenner's bill is \n     that is takes our eye off the ball. Homeland security is \n     about taking useful steps to prevent another attack. It's not \n     about keeping gainfully employed Mexican illegals from \n     driving to work, or cracking down on the imagined hordes \n     gaming our asylum system.\n       President Bush realizes this and is pushing for a guest-\n     worker program that would help separate people in search of \n     employment from potential terrorists. If the Republican \n     Congress doesn't realize that, perhaps a Presidential veto of \n     the Real ID Act would focus its attention.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, clearly, the REAL ID Act is a Draconian \npiece of legislation that would impose unnecessary hardships on the \nStates and the American people and lead us to turn away deserving \nrefugees who are fleeing persecution.\n  I sincerely hope the Senate Republican leadership, which has said \nthey do not want this provision in this bill, will oppose its inclusion \nin the conference report.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: Relating to the aircraft carriers of the Navy)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n                     aircraft carriers of the navy\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Funding for Repair and Maintenance of U.S.S. \n     John F. Kennedy.--\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n     Of the amount appropriated to the Department of the Navy by \n     this Act, necessary funding will be made available for such \n     repair and maintenance of the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy as the \n     Navy considers appropriate to extend the life of U.S.S. John \n     F. Kennedy.\n       (b) Limitation on Reduction in Number of Active Aircraft \n     Carriers.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be obligated or expended to reduce the number \n     of active aircraft carriers of the Navy below 12 active \n     aircraft carriers until the later of the following:\n       (1) The date that is 180 days after the date of the \n     submittal to Congress of the quadrennial defense review \n     required in 2005 under section 118 of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) The date on which the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     certifies to Congress that such agreements have been entered \n     into to provide port facilities for the permanent forward \n     deployment of such numbers of aircraft carriers as are \n     necessary in the Pacific Command Area of Responsibility to \n     fulfill the roles and missions of that Command, including \n     agreements for the forward deployment of a nuclear aircraft \n     carrier after the retirement of the current two conventional \n     aircraft carriers.\n       (c) Active Aircraft Carriers.--For purposes of this \n     section, an active aircraft carrier of the Navy includes an \n     aircraft carrier that is temporarily unavailable for \n     worldwide deployment due to routing or scheduled maintenance.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, is this amendment germane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This amendment is germane.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. The amendment is germane; therefore, \nit can be made a part of the business pending before the Senate and, \nhopefully, it will be acted upon by a record vote and included as a \npart of the underlying bill. I will seek that at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that follows on an amendment that \nI earlier put in on this bill, which understandably failed to meet the \ngermaneness test, and therefore just early this morning it was \nstricken. Nevertheless, I have carefully crafted this, and now it is \nconfirmed by the Parliamentarian that this amendment is germane.\n  This amendment applies to the question of the USS John F. Kennedy, a \nvery famous and historic ship of the U.S. Navy, which recently was \ndesignated to be retired by the Department of Defense as a consequence \nof a restricted budget that was placed in the waning hours of the \nbudget process on the Department of the Navy. Quite unexpectedly, the \nDepartment of the Navy departed from its steadfast opinions, published \nstatements, and records that this Nation required 12 aircraft carriers \nin our fleet. It came as a complete surprise to the Congress. I didn't \nfeel that we had any particular consultation. Nevertheless, the \nexecutive branch has the right to make budget decisions, so that \nhistory is behind us.\n  I believe it is imperative that the Congress--and now, at this time, \nthe Senate--examine this situation and determine whether at this point \nin time this ship should be stricken from the active force and \ndesignated for mothballs. I say that because the Department of Defense \nis well along in its Quadrennial Defense Review. The Congress has 180 \ndays, once that is completed, to look at that report. Therefore, the \npurpose of this amendment is to say that this ship stays in the fleet \nin an active status until two things happen: the Department completes \nits Quadrennial Defense Review and the Congress has had 180 days to \nstudy the results of that review; and the Secretary of Defense \ncertifies to the Congress that necessary agreements have been entered \ninto with other nations to provide for the permanent forward deployment \nof aircraft carriers in the Pacific necessary to carry out the mission \nwithin the Pacific Command area of responsibility.\n  The reasons I am offering this amendment are simple. Congress has a \nconstitutional role and mandate to maintain a navy. I will repeat that. \nUnder the Constitution, we raise armies in time of need, but we \nmaintain a navy. As I have heard many colleagues say--and I recently \nheard my colleague, Senator McCain, speaking to a group--a warship \nreally has two purposes. It has its underlying missions to deter \naggression and, if necessary, to repel aggression, but it also has a \nvery valuable role as a silent ambassador wherever it is beyond the \nshores of the United States. Particularly when the magnificence of an \nAmerican ship is in a harbor beyond our shores, people from that \ncountry come from all over to take a look. It is a silent way of saying \nAmerica is there to help protect freedom. It is called ship diplomacy. \nIt is well documented in the long history of this country. We being, in \nmany respects, an island nation, we have always depended upon our \nmaritime arm of defense to play a role in diplomacy and, if necessary, \nto take up arms.\n  The funds for the Kennedy's scheduled maintenance were authorized and \nappropriated in previous bills. Money to do the work that is necessary \nto keep this ship active in the fleet is in the coffers of the U.S. \nNavy today. For that reason, we are not trying to touch a single dollar \nthat is in this bill. We will maintain the Kennedy in the fleet until \n2018. The ship will be quite old; nevertheless, in the opinion of the \nsailors who sail it today and the sailors who will sail it tomorrow, it \ncan be an effective ship and be counted upon as a full partner in the \nfleet of some 12 carriers.\n  All analyses presented to the Congress, to include the last two \nQuadrennial Defense Reviews, in 1997 and 2001, set the minimum number \nof aircraft carriers at 12. There has been no analysis to support \nreducing the aircraft carrier fleet to 11--that is, formal analysis. I \nrealize there are working documents in the Department of the Navy, but \nI have not seen that type of analysis that I believed fully justified a \ndecision of this importance. I think that analysis will be done in the \nforthcoming 2005 review.\n  Next, the reason the Department submitted the budget request with the \ndecommissioning of an aircraft carrier was because the Navy was handed \na budget cut in December, somewhat unexpectedly. The Navy's original \nbudget submission included the Kennedy. I point that out. Throughout \nthe budget process, that particular process, and the budget of the \nDepartment of Defense, the Kennedy was always included with the 12 \ncarriers. Then, with the flick of a wrist and some very brief analysis \nI have seen, out she went.\n\n  The Kennedy, as I say, is in good material condition. In the words of \nthe battle group commander who just returned on this ship from a 6-\nmonth deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in December, it \nis in ``outstanding material condition.''\n  With the scheduled decommissioning of the USS Kitty Hawk in fiscal \nyear 2008, the Kennedy would be the only, assuming this amendment \nprevails, conventionally powered aircraft carrier available in the \nPacific Command area of responsibility where there are nations that \nsimply will not allow a nuclear warship to enter its waters.\n  Again, I believe Congress should now show its responsibility--I \nrepeat, its responsibility--in making force structure decisions and go \nback and review what the Navy has done and say to the Department of the \nNavy: Not at this time should we be decommissioning this ship. We \nshould await the normal processes of the QDR, the BRAC process, and \nother ongoing congressional and active procedures until such time, and \nthen the decision can be made, in a balanced way, as to the fate of the \ncarrier.\n  Mr. President, I thank my principal cosponsor, the distinguished \nSenator from Florida. We are joined in this matter by Senator Allen, \nSenator Martinez, and Senator Talent, who is chairman of the Armed \nServices Seapower Subcommittee. This is a bipartisan approach. It is \nnot a political matter. We are simply here in the best interests of the \nDepartment of Defense and this country in suggesting strongly to our \ncolleagues we should have a voice in this matter, and to do so, the \nSenator from Florida and I and others are bringing this amendment to \nthe attention of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I express my personal \nappreciation to the senior Senator from Virginia, who has, just like \nthe old Navy man he is, risen again to the call to duty of what he \nthinks is in the best defense interest of this country.\n  It is one thing for the senior Senator from Florida to make this \nargument when it is perceived as an argument in this Senator's \nparochial interest because the John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier is \nstationed in Mayport in Jacksonville. I could argue all of the \nspecifics Senator Warner has, and it would still be interpreted that it \nwas\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nthe position of the Senator from Florida looking out for his \nconstituency. Certainly, that is a part of my motivation. But a part of \nmy motivation also is that in my title is ``United States Senator,'' \nand a very fortunate and proud member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am trying to make decisions that are in the best defense \ninterests of our country.\n  That defense interest is clearly that we, the United States, must \nhave a carrier homeported in Japan. We simply do not know, since it is \nnot a decision of the central Government of Japan--it is a decision of \nthe local municipal governments that influence the decision--whether \nthey will be receptive to a nuclear-powered carrier. If some time \nbetween now and 2008, when the conventionally powered carrier, the \nKitty Hawk, that is residing in Japan, is scheduled to be \ndecommissioned, if at some time in that time period Japan says no to a \nnuclear carrier, suddenly we are without an aircraft carrier homeported \nin Japan.\n  I remind the Senate what the Chief of Naval Operations, the four-star \nchief admiral of the Navy, testified to before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee: With the rising threat of China, one carrier in \nJapan is worth a great deal to him as opposed to other carriers that \nare stationed elsewhere around the world.\n  If I could get the attention of the Senator from Virginia, I want him \nto hear my appreciation because he has, in his independent and expert \njudgment, come to this conclusion. He has stepped forth and offered \nthis amendment so it would be led by the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and many of his bipartisan membership who have \njoined with him.\n  Mr. President, I say to all Senators, listen to the chairman. He \nknows what he is talking about. Then on down the road, if because of \nnew capabilities of ships we are able to lessen the carriers from 12 to \n11, we will be in a position where we will not have this window of \nvulnerability for projecting our force structure in the Pacific area of \noperations.\n  I plead with the Senate. This should not be a fight. We ought to be \nlistening to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if the time is appropriate for \nthe Senator from Florida and me to ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida. I think other Senators desire to speak on this amendment. I \nyield to the good judgment and fair judgment of the senior members of \nthe Appropriations Committee as to the timing of the vote on this \namendment. I do urge Senators to come and express their views on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. \nTherefore, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 516\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act in \n2001, the Enhanced Border Security Act of 2002, and the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress recognized, on a \nbipartisan basis, the need to provide more people and more resources to \npatrol and secure our borders.\n  The PATRIOT Act called for tripling the number of Border Patrol \nagents and Immigration and Customs investigators on our northern \nborder. The Enhanced Border Security Act called for an additional 200 \ninvestigators a year--on top of the PATRIOT Act increases--for fiscal \nyears 2003 through 2006. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act authorized the hiring of an additional 2,000 Border \nPatrol agents and 800 new ICE immigration investigators, and provided \nfor another 2,000 detention bed spaces per year for 5 years. Together \nthese laws reflect a consensus in the Congress that more needs to be \ndone. But a consensus and a series of authorization bills produces only \npromises of progress, but promises do not make our borders more secure.\n  In written testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on \nFebruary 16, the Department's then-Deputy Secretary, Admiral James Loy, \ncited recently received intelligence as the reason for his concern \nabout the threat facing the Mexican border. He said the intelligence \n``strongly suggest(s)'' that al-Qaida ``has considered using the \nSouthwest border to infiltrate the United States. Several al-Qaida \nleaders believe operatives can pay their way into the country through \nMexico and also believe illegal entry is more advantageous than legal \nentry for operational security reasons.''\n  On March 10, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said:\n\n       There is no secret that al-Qaida will try to get into this \n     country. . . . They're going to keep trying on our southern \n     border. They're going to keep trying on our northern border.\n\n  In his December 6, 2004, letter to Congress urging final passage of \nthe Intelligence Reform Act, the President said:\n\n       I also believe the Conference took an important step in \n     strengthening our immigration laws by, among other items, \n     increasing the number of border patrol agents and \n     detention beds.\n  Remarkably, despite the threat to our borders as enunciated by senior \nadministration officials, despite the clear intent of Congress in three \nseparate authorization laws, and despite the President's commendation \nof the intelligence reform conferees for increasing the number of \nBorder Patrol agents and detention beds, the President included \nvirtually nothing in his budget to actually hire and train those Border \nPatrol agents or to hire and train immigration investigators or to \npurchase or construct detention facilities for illegal aliens.\n  Our citizens are concerned about the security gaps along our borders. \nIt has reached such a fever pitch in some locations that private \ngroups, such as the self-proclaimed ``Minutemen,'' are banding together \nto form watch groups along the borders to act as additional ``eyes and \nears'' and report suspicious border crossings to the Border Patrol for \nappropriate response. While perhaps not reaching the level of vigilante \nactivity, this is a clear expression of the frustration felt by many \ncitizens along the border areas that the Federal Government is asleep \nat the switch and failing to address a key Federal function.\n  Even our military is concerned about border security. According to an \nApril 7 CNN report, Marines preparing for combat in Iraq or Afghanistan \nhave lost significant amounts of training time because undocumented \nimmigrants from Mexico have constantly wandered onto a bombing test \nrange at the Marine Corps air station near Yuma, AZ. The range has been \nshut down more than 500 times over this past 6 months for a total of \n1,100 training hours lost. Last year, more than 1,500 illegal \nimmigrants were caught in the training area. In the first 3 months of \nthis year, more than 1,100 have already been apprehended.\n  Today, I am offering a bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senator \nCraig of Idaho, that will fund the real work of securing our borders. \nThe amendment provides $389.6 million for border security, and the \namendment is paid for by reducing funding for diplomatic and consular \nprograms the Department of State has indicated is not necessary until \nfiscal year 2006.\n  The amendment begins to address the security gap on our borders by \nfunding the hiring of 650 new Border Patrol agents, and this number may \nfall short of the authorization goals set by the various acts, but it \nis a responsible level which Customs and Border Protection can meet in \nthe coming months.\n  During an April 4, 2005, interview on C-SPAN's Washington Journal, \nCustoms and Border Patrol Commissioner Robert Bonner said, ``The Border \nPatrol is almost . . . being overwhelmed by illegal immigration. This \nis like a sinking ship with a hole in it. You've got to plug the hole. \nYou've got to stop the illegal migration into the United States. . . \n.''\n  The agency responsible for enforcing our immigration laws, known as \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, has been forced to endure a \nhiring freeze and funding shortfall for more\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\nthan a year. Vehicles are not being replaced. Body armor is not being \npurchased. Travel to pursue immigration investigations has been \ncurtailed. ICE continues to lose personnel, and the agency has not been \nable to fill those positions because of a hiring freeze. Through the \nend of January alone, ICE lost a total of 299 personnel.\n  My amendment--and it is cosponsored by several senators--would give \nICE the resources that are so vital to beginning the process of hiring \nand training the personnel it needs to enforce our immigration laws.\n  This amendment also provides funds for deploying unmanned aerial \nvehicles along the Southwest border. The Border Patrol has tested and \noperated, for a limited period of time this year, unmanned aerial \nvehicles, UAVs, along the Southwest border. Using funds provided to it \nby the Congress, the Border Patrol conducted successful tests using \nUAVs to assist in the surveillance and detection of individuals \nattempting to enter the U.S. illegally. The operation, known as the \nArizona Border Control Initiative, used these drones to monitor and \npatrol a 350-mile long swath of the desert border. More than 350,000 \nillegal immigrants crossing into the U.S. were apprehended during the \noperation. Regrettably, this program was shut down on January 31 of \nthis year. The funds provided in this amendment would allow for the \nimmediate resumption of these surveillance and detection operations.\n  Finally, the amendment includes funds for the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center Border Patrol Academy in Artesia, NM, to train the new \npersonnel.\n  The case for this amendment is clear; the need for it is critical; \nand the support for it should be bipartisan. This amendment is focused \nand targeted to address key border security shortfalls. The Border \nPatrol's role is to apprehend those illegally entering this country. \nThey also work with ICE investigators to crack down on illegal \nimmigration. They then turn over those who are here illegally to ICE, \nwhich needs the detention bed space and to deportation officials to \nhold, process, and then remove these individuals.\n  We must start now. This cannot wait.\n  The job of our immigration officers is staggering, and their \nresources are meager.\n  Along the 2,000 miles of land border with Mexico, the United States \nhas deployed only 1,700 agents at any given time. That is one agent, \njust one, guarding more than one mile of border.\n  Of the 10 million illegal aliens in the country, 2,000 interior \nenforcement agents are charged with locating and arresting them. That \nis one agent, just one, charged with locating and arresting 5,000 \nillegal aliens.\n  Of the 10,000 border patrol agents authorized in the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act, the President's budget included \nfunds to hire just 210. Of the 4,000 interior enforcement agents \nauthorized, the President's budget included funds to hire only 500 of \nthem. Of the 40,000 detention beds authorized, the President's budget \nincluded funding for a mere 5 percent of them. However, in every case, \nthe very modest proposed increases for 2006 will barely make up for the \n137 border patrol positions lost during the first two quarters of \nfiscal year 2005, the 299 ICE personnel lost and the 2,000 detention \nbeds that do not exist, for lack of funding.\n  We ask how and why illegal aliens continue to pour into our country, \nand the answer lies in every border patrol increase we do not fund, \nevery agent we do not hire, and every illegal alien we release due to \nlack of detention space.\n  This is our opportunity to reverse that sorry record. This is our \nopportunity to strengthen our border defenses. This is our opportunity \nto support a substantive, concrete effort to address the alarming rise \nin illegal immigration.\n  Sir Edward Coke wrote that a man's house is his castle, for where \nshall a man be safe if not in his own home?\n  The United States is home to 296 million people. They, by right, \ndemand that their Government secure their castle against the unknown \nthreat seeking to infiltrate its sanctuary.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. It is cosponsored by Senators \nCraig, Baucus, Dorgan, Lieberman, Obama, Leahy and Feinstein.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will soon have a time for a recorded \nvote. I will yield the floor at the appropriate time, if the Chair will \nnotify me when it is time to start that vote.\n  Mr. President, there are a series of amendments now that have been \nfiled on this bill to earmark money in the portion of the supplemental \ndealing with Defense. Our subcommittee and the full Appropriations \nCommittee did not earmark any money in the Defense portion of this \nbill. It was my position and the position of the Senator from Hawaii, \nMr. Inouye, that this is, after all, supplemental money on an emergency \nbasis to deal with the problems of those who are in combat now: Iraq \nand Afghanistan and the war against terror.\n  We have urgent needs of those people. This money must be approved and \nmust be available to them no later than the first week in May. Under \nthose circumstances, I have come to the floor to tell the Senate now we \nare going to oppose any amendment that would earmark money in this \nbill.\n  There are some legitimate desires here on the floor for the \nDepartment to spend some of the money it has for specific purposes. I \nthink a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in most of those instances would \ncall that matter to the attention of the Department, and to a great \nextent I believe the Department would follow the suggestion of the \nSenate--of the Congress, if you want to make it a sense-of-the-\nCongress, as an amendment to this bill. We can change the amendments \ninto a sense-of-the-Senate concept. But we cannot start taking these \namendments. We turned down the amendments that came to us in \nsubcommittee. We turned down the amendments that came to us in markup \nin the subcommittee. We turned down the amendments when they came to \nthe full committee. Now to have them come to the floor in a cloture \nsituation I think exacerbates the situation.\n\n  This is to say it is my intention to move to table any amendment that \nwill attempt to earmark money in this bill or elsewhere for \nnonemergency purposes. I know of none of them I have seen that are \nemergencies that have been filed on this bill. But I assure the Senate \nwe are sympathetic to many of the amendments. As a matter of fact, I \nthink I may have cosponsored one or two of them myself in connection \nwith previous bills, the annual appropriations bills for Defense.\n  But this is a supplemental. It is primarily designed to provide \nemergency funds. This is not the time for us to be taking up policy \nquestions that should be addressed in the authorization bill or \namendments that should be offered to the bills when we bring the bills \nout of the committee dealing with fiscal year 2006.\n  I believe it is almost time for the vote that is scheduled. Again, I \nurge my friends who have offered these amendments to stay on the floor \nand discuss them with us. Again, I say, many of them are very well \nintentioned. I personally would support them in many circumstances, but \nI cannot in good conscience do that now. We should take this bill as \nclean as possible to conference and get it out of conference as quickly \nas possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now is \non agreeing to the motion to table the Coburn amendment No. 471. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDorgan as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about this \namendment because I believe it is very important to our Reserve and \nGuard units who have been called upon to serve their country during \nthis time of war.\n  This amendment is based on a bill I introduced last month with \nSenator Dorgan. It provides a financial safety net for the families of \nour service members proudly serving in our Nation's military Reserve \nand National Guard.\n  Today, our National Guard and Reserve units are being called upon, as \nyou well know, more than ever and are being asked to serve their \ncountry in a very different way than they have in the past. The global \nwar on terror and the high operational tempo of our military require \nthat our Reserve components play a more active role in the total force.\n  These long tours and frequent activations have a profound and \ndisruptive effect on the lives of these men and women and on the lives \nof their families and loved ones. Many of our reservists suffer \nsignificant loss of income when they are mobilized, forcing them\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nto leave often higher paying civilian jobs to serve their country. Such \nlosses can be compounded by additional family expenses associated with \nmilitary activation, including the cost of long distance phone calls \nand the need for additional childcare. These circumstances create a \nserious financial burden that is extremely difficult for reservists' \nfamilies to manage.\n  I believe we can and we should do more to alleviate the financial \nburden; therefore, the amendment I am discussing this afternoon would \nprovide a completely refundable income tax credit of up to $20,000 \nannually to a military reservist called to active duty. The amount of \nthe tax credit would be based upon the difference between wages paid by \nthe reservist's civilian job and the military wages paid upon \nmobilization. The tax credit would be available to members of the \nNational Guard or Ready Reserve who are serving for more than 90 days \nand would vary according to their length of service.\n  Now is the time to recognize the service and sacrifice of the men and \nwomen in the Guard and Reserves. I believe the Congress should focus on \nthis issue. It is important to thousands of service members who are \nserving their country and their families who are struggling \nfinancially.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that the emergency supplemental before us \ntoday may not be the best place to begin a discussion about this \nsubject, so I urge my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the Finance Committee to not only study but to work with me and \nSenator Dorgan to act on this issue this year. This is very important \nto thousands and thousands of families in this country.\n  At a time when the Nation is calling our guardsmen and reservists to \nactive duty to execute the war in Iraq, fight the war on terrorism, and \nto defend our homeland, I believe it is imperative that Congress \nrecognize their vital role and acknowledge that the success of our \nmilitary depends on these troops. It is not too much to ask of our \nNation and, more importantly, I believe it is the right thing to do.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 466, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I want to withdraw my amendment because I don't think \nthis is the proper place for it on the supplemental, but it is the \nproper place to begin the debate in the Senate. I ask unanimous consent \nto withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself and \n     Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 482.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To require a report assessing the feasibility and \n  advisability of implementing for the Army National Guard a program \n similar to the Post Deployment Stand-Down Program of the Air National \n                                 Guard)\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\nreport on implementation of post deployment stand-down program by army \n                             national guard\n\n       Sec. 1122.

The Secretary of the Army shall \n     prepare the assessment in consultation with the Secretary of \n     the Air Force.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may add \nSenator Pryor as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, first of all, I compliment Chairman \nCochran for all of his hard work on this bill, and I appreciate so many \nof the Members who I have been able to work with for a better \nunderstanding in how we approach the ability we have to help our \nservice men and women. That is exactly the intention of my amendment--\nto provide the Army the ability to study some of the tools that are \nused in other branches of the armed services in order to be able to \nprovide the correct direction on the leave policies that they have.\n  We all certainly share our pride and our gratitude for the service \nmen and women from our Guard units and Reserve units in our home States \nwho have portrayed such courage and dedication to our Nation and to the \nfreedoms for which they fight. As they return, we want to ensure that \nevery opportunity is made available to them, and certainly we want to \ngive them everything they need to readjust and transition back into \ntheir communities. So I am delighted to be able to offer this study. It \nis giving the Army National Guard the opportunity to study what the Air \nNational Guard and Air Force do in their leave policy. I hope we can do \nmore with the leave policy of our Guard and Reserve as they return \nhome.\n  I appreciate the work the chairman has done. I look forward to the \nopportunity to be able to move our amendment forward. We got an OK from \nour side and, apparently, got the OK from the other side. Hopefully, we \ncan move it forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is my understanding that the Senator's amendment is \nbefore the Senate at this time.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 475 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Baucus, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 475.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds to restrict the issuance of general \n    licenses for travel to Cuba in connection with authorized sales \n                  activities, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 231, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       Sec. 6047. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, beginning in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, none of \n     the funds made available by this Act shall be used to pay the \n     salaries or expenses of any employee of any agency or office \n     to implement or enforce section 908(b)(1)(A) of the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7207(b)(1)(A)) or any other provision of law in a \n     manner other than a manner that permits payment by the \n     purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product to the \n     seller, and receipt of the payment by the seller, at any time \n     prior to--\n       (1) the transfer of the title of the commodity or product \n     to the purchaser; and\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\n       (2) the release of control of the commodity or product to \n     the purchaser.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     beginning in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, none of the \n     funds made available by this Act shall be used to pay the \n     salaries or expenses of any employee of any agency or office \n     that refuses to authorize the issuance of a general license \n     for travel-related transactions listed in subsection (c) of \n     section 515.560 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, for \n     travel to, from, or within Cuba undertaken in connection with \n     sales and marketing, including the organization and \n     participation in product exhibitions, and the transportation \n     by sea or air of products pursuant to the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     beginning in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, none of the \n     funds made available by this Act shall be used to pay the \n     salaries or expenses of any employee of any agency or office \n     that restricts the direct transfers from a Cuban financial \n     institution to a United States financial institution executed \n     in payment for a product authorized for sale under the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. Its \npurpose is to limit the use of funds to restrict the issuance of \ngeneral licenses for travel to Cuba in connection with authorized sales \nactivities and for other purposes.\n  This amendment responds specifically to an action by the Department \nof Treasury in a new rulemaking process that dramatically curtails the \npotential of agricultural trade with the nation of Cuba. A group of \nus--one of my colleagues who is on the Senate floor, Max Baucus, and \nothers--sent a letter to our Secretary of Agriculture. We know \nagricultural trade is extremely important for American agriculture. \nLast year, there was a surplus of $9.5 billion. That is going to drop \nprecipitously this year to as much as $2.5 billion.\n  Trade with Cuba has been growing. This amendment dramatically \nrestricts that trade by the unwillingness of the Treasury Department to \noffer the necessary licenses for agricultural traders to travel to Cuba \nfor that purpose.\n  I hope we can consider it. It is very straightforward. I understand \nmy colleague from Montana has a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CLARIFICATION OF PAYMENT TERMS UNDER TRADE SANCTIONS \n                   REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 908(b)(1) of the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n     7207(b)(1)) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (B) \n     the following:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the term \n     `payment of cash in advance' means the payment by the \n     purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product and the \n     receipt of such payment by the seller prior to--\n       ``(i) the transfer of title of such commodity or product to \n     the purchaser; and\n       ``(ii) the release of control of such commodity or product \n     to the purchaser.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to sales of agricultural commodities made on or \n     after February 22, 2005.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 549, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a modification to my amendment. It \nchanges the effective date. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified with the text I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``Sec.'', and insert the following:\n\n     6407. CLARIFICATION OF PAYMENT TERMS UNDER TRADE SANCTIONS \n                   REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 908(b)(1) of the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n     7207(b)(1)) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (B) \n     the following:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the term \n     `payment of cash in advance' means the payment by the \n     purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product and the \n     receipt of such payment by the seller prior to--\n       ``(i) the transfer of title of such commodity or product to \n     the purchaser; and\n       ``(ii) the release of control of such commodity or product \n     to the purchaser.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to sales of agricultural commodities made on or \n     after October 28, 2000.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which I think is \nagreeable all the way around. It addresses the basic problem we are \nfacing where the U.S. Government is essentially changing the rules of \nthe game. I hope the Senate will adopt this amendment so we can \noverturn the Treasury Department ruling.\n  This is for farmers, this is for ranchers, this is for agricultural \ncooperatives, and this is for shipping companies and port authorities \naround our country. It is not only my State of Montana but Mississippi, \nAlaska, Alabama, and others. Farmers in all of our States are looking \nfor new markets. That is clear. They are asking Congress to expand \ncurrent markets and open up new markets overseas, including the country \nof Cuba.\n  Last year alone, Cuba was worth $400 billion of U.S. agricultural \nexports, making it the 25th agricultural export market. This amendment \nI worked on with Senator Chambliss and Senator Craig would overturn a \nrecent Treasury Department rule that restricts the payment terms of \nagricultural sales to Cuba. That rule cuts across $200 million worth of \nopen contracts, including sales of Montana wheat and beans.\n  These contracts are now on hold. The shipments cannot be made. Why? \nBecause of the recent Treasury ruling which we all think has gone way \nbeyond the intent of legislation. I do not think we should sit idly by \nas Government bureaucrats down at Treasury try to shut down a promising \nexport market that, again, Congress purposely opened.\n  Congress, in the 2000 act, opened trade to Cuba for agriculture and \nmedicine on a cash basis. This amendment does nothing to change that. \nIt makes sure we live up to that intent. Congress purposely opened the \nmarket of Cuba to U.S. exporters when it passed the Trade Sanctions and \nExport Enhancement Act of 2000. While I think there is a lot more we \ncan do and should do to make our exporters more competitive in the \nCuban market, this amendment does nothing more than deal with the \nemergency they are now experiencing.\n  Agricultural trade with Cuba will remain on a one-way cash basis \nonly. We do not seek to change that here. But why should we turn down \nopportunities to sell even on a cash basis from Cuba? We should not. \nProducers, port authorities, and shipping companies alike urgently need \nthis rule overturned if they are going to remain competitive in the \nCuban market.\n  I remind my colleagues, every other country in the world freely ships \nproducts to Cuba. We are the only country in the world that is \nrestricted. Other countries' trade is some indication we should perhaps \ntrade as well. This amendment does not deal with lifting the travel \nban. It does not deal with the embargo or anything else, except it \nmakes clear the act we passed in the year 2000 is lived up to. That is \nall this is.\n  Our farmers and ranchers face mounting pressures of a tricky trade \nsurplus. We should be working to open, not close, export markets with \nthem.\n  I thank my colleagues for working this out. I see Senator Chambliss \nin the Chamber. I thank him and I thank Senator Craig. I thank the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, and others \nwho are trying to make sure our agricultural producers are able to get \nmarkets they justly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment and\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nthe second-degree amendment thereto. I thank my friend from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, as well as Senator Craig from Idaho. All three worked \nvery hard to come to a compromise on this very sensitive issue.\n  What we are doing is basically restoring the normal trade discourse \nbetween our two countries to what it was before this change in a \nregulation that occurred about 2 months ago. We think the regulation \ndoes not state what Congress intended with the act that was passed 4 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. President, 4 years ago, we did pass the Trade Sanctions Reform \nand Export Enhancement Act which allows sales of food and medicine only \nto Cuba for the first time in nearly four decades. The act did not \nsignal an end to the embargo, exactly as Senator Baucus said, or \nefforts to do so but merely exempted food and medicine from unilateral \nsanctions that harm populations.\n  U.S. exporters require payment before turning over title and control \nof the goods. That is a standard operating procedure in the shipping \nbusiness. The exporters routinely ship U.S. goods to Cuba where they \nremain under the custody of the seller until such time as the seller \ncertifies full payment. Only then are goods released to Cuba. At no \ntime is credit extended in any form to Cuba. I cannot overemphasize \nthat because that is exactly what the act requires.\n  This standard method of doing business has been in practice since \nsales to Cuba began. This amendment will overturn OFAC's new definition \nof ``cash in advance.'' The legislation allows exporters to resume \nnormal trading and does not include any extraneous provisions that are \nunrelated to the immediate problem.\n  I again thank my colleagues for working on this issue and coming to a \ngood resolution to return to the way trading was done prior to the \narbitrary change in the regulation by OFAC. I thank Senator Cochran for \nhis cooperation in letting us get this to the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I strongly support the second-degree \namendment. I think it has been well spoken by the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Baucus. He has detailed exactly what we \nintend to do. The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee has \nechoed that very clearly. I support reinstating the 2000 act, in its \nclarity, in its simplicity, to allow agricultural and medical supply \ntrade with Cuba. To see that changed by a regulatory process in the \nTreasury Department was not, nor is it, in my opinion, the intent of \nCongress.\n  I thank my colleagues for their collective effort in reinstating this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second degree \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 549, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 549), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 475, as amended.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have been notified that there is a Senator who wants \nto be heard on the issue of germaneness on this amendment--or on the \nissue itself.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 443\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the pending amendment be set aside temporarily to \nconsider my pending amendment No. 443.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge the adoption of amendment No. 443.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is called up.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 443) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point I return to the pending \namendment subject to the wishes of the chairman--the previous pending \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 \ntoday the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments; provided further that no second-degree amendment also be in \norder to the amendments prior to the vote: the Byrd amendment No. 516 \non border security, the Warner amendment No. 498 on carriers; further, \nthat there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, is there any objection \nto add to that list the Landrieu amendments Nos. 414 and 479?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, those amendments have not been offered \nyet. These are amendments that have been offered and debated. We are \nsimply proceeding to dispose of them.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I would like to add \nafter that vote Senator Landrieu would be allowed to take up amendments \nNos. 414 and 479.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I add that as part of the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The request is so \nmodified.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Warner has offered an amendment \nrelating to delaying the decommissioning of the John F. Kennedy \naircraft carrier CB-67. Is that the pending amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 516\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Byrd amendment, \nNo. 516.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Warner amendment scheduled for a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Byrd amendment is scheduled to follow the \nWarner amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent the vote on the Warner amendment \nbe scheduled to accompany the next vote requested by the Senate. I have \nbeen unable to make the statement I wanted to make on this amendment. I \nhave been taken away for several other problems. I don't know when the \nnext vote will be scheduled. But I do wish some time to discuss the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote is currently scheduled on the Warner \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that be postponed until the next \namendment that is scheduled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, do I have a couple of minutes before the \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided before the \nvote on the Byrd amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Byrd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 65, nays 34, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--65\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Jeffords\n       \n  The amendment (No. 516) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the name of \nSenator Bingaman be added as a cosponsor of the amendment just agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 498\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the Warner amendment the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That had been the pending amendment. The \nSenator obtained consent to postpone its consideration.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have come to the Senate to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were to be 2 minutes equally divided at \nthis time on the Warner amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not had the opportunity to speak \non this amendment. I seek to oppose it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have 15 minutes on each side on this \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to oblige the distinguished \nchairman. May I hear the request again.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I asked unanimous consent that we have 15 minutes on \neach side, and I intend to oppose the amendment. I assume the Senator \nfrom Virginia would have another 15 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am perfectly agreeable to an equal division of the \ntime. If the Senator needs 15, we have had the opportunity, Senator \nNelson, myself, and others, and I believe the Presiding Officer may \nwish to speak, and Senator Allen. So that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator yield for a second first to take care of a procedural matter?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Alaska \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have two Senators on the floor who wish \nto argue about who gets the floor, but I have the floor. The Senator \nfrom Nevada wishes to have an opportunity to do something.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to allow the Senator from \nNevada to make his presentation without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection. The Senator from Alaska \nretains the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I regret that the Senator from Nevada is unable to do \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor now to oppose the \namendment offered by my friend from Virginia. He is the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and I do so very reluctantly. However, at \nhearings held by the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the Secretary \nof the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations have opposed the goal of \nthis amendment, which is to maintain 12 carriers in our fleet.\n  I want to read from that transcript. I said this to the Secretary:\n\n       Are you going to be terribly disturbed if we tell you to \n     keep the Kennedy where it is?\n\n  The Secretary of the Navy said:\n\n       Yes, sir, we would be terribly disturbed to keep the \n     Kennedy where it is. First of all, the money is out for the \n     Kennedy. It is not in our budget. If we have to keep the \n     Kennedy, then something else has to go. So we don't have the \n     money in the budget for the Kennedy. It's gone. It is $1.2 \n     billion and it is 40 years old. It has never been through a \n     major upgrade. It is a Reserve carrier. So we have always had \n     the expense and serious issues in keeping the Kennedy \n     properly maintained. Frankly, it is so expensive for us and \n     it has marginal capability. As the CNO said, our carriers are \n     4 times more capable than they were during Desert Storm. We \n     are about to double capability by 2010 and, frankly, we do \n     not need this carrier.\n\n  We have a disagreement of opinion between the Senator from Virginia \nand myself caused by the testimony. Parenthetically, I say to my \nfriend, I hope he will look at the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, will you entertain a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has read from a transcript. We have had a \ndiscussion about it. Wouldn't you say that the Chief of Naval \nOperations expressed a different view at a different time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been so informed by the Senator \nfrom Virginia, but he has not said that in my presence. Let me note for \nthe Senator, the way this amendment is drafted, the money to maintain \n12 carriers would come out of this bill, the supplemental \nappropriations, to be used for nonemergency purposes. Whatever happens \nto my objection, I hope that you will look at this amendment because we \nare informed that this would take $288 million out of the funds in this \nbill.\n  From a policy point of view, decommissioning the Kennedy as the Navy \nproposes in the fiscal year 2006 budget will have minimal near-term \noperational impact due to a previously scheduled complex overhaul that \nwas scheduled to begin in May of this year. This complex overhaul would \nresult in 2 years of nonavailability for the ship.\n  Decommissioning the Kennedy also has minimal near-term industrial \nbase impacts and allows the Navy to free resources necessary to fight \nthe global war on terrorism while preparing to face future challenges.\n  The Navy's plan to decommission the Kennedy will save $1.2 billion \nover fiscal years 2006 through 2011. These savings are critical for \nmodernizing our Naval forces, and for providing the necessary resources \nfor the Navy's shipbuilding account.\n  The Kennedy was chosen for decommissioning because of its material \ncondition and operational readiness. The Kennedy has never been through \na major upgrade. It served as a Reserve carrier from 1995 to 1998. The \nNavy has always had expenses and issues keeping the Kennedy properly \nmaintained. It is expensive for the Navy and it is of marginal \ncapability.\n  The Kennedy was scheduled to go through a complex overhaul from May \n2005 to August 2006. It would be 40 years old coming out of this \noverhaul with the intent of extending it to 50 years of age.\n  The Navy now believes it would be difficult to maintain this platform \nwithin reasonable cost even after the complex overhaul given that it \ndid not go through a mid-life service life extension program.\n  The overhaul risk in reducing the number of carriers from 12 to 11 is \nmitigated by several improvements realized in the multimission \ncapabilities\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\nof today's carrier strike groups. For example, carrier aircraft such as \nthe F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets, are transitioning to the fleet \nwith improved capabilities to hit multiple targets on a single sortie.\n  Our carriers today are at least four times more capable, as measured \nin number of targets serviced per day, than they were during Desert \nStorm. The Navy is expected to almost double this capability by 2010 as \nwe bring on new airplanes, more precision weapons, and increased sortie \nrates with future carriers currently in development.\n  The Navy's fleet of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers has significant \ncapabilities over conventional carriers, such as the Kennedy. Nuclear-\npowered carriers have greater range and speed, and can operate at full \nspeed for indefinite periods without the need for refueling.\n  During flight operations, conventional carriers will need to refuel \nand re-arm every 2 to 3 days, compared to nuclear-powered carriers \nwhich will only need to re-arm and refuel every 7 to 10 days. The \nnuclear carriers have the capacity to carry 35 percent more fuel and \nordnance than conventional carriers. Therefore, nuclear carriers are \nfar less reliant on logistics support.\n  The Navy is also transforming how they operate and extracting more \nreadiness out of the force. The Navy's fleet response plan is \nrevolutionary and is providing greater availability of carrier strike \ngroups.\n  The fleet response plan is supportable with an 11-carrier force as \nthe emphasis is on enhanced readiness, speed of response, and increased \ncarrier employability. These precepts continue to apply even with fewer \ncarriers, as the Navy has ensured me that they will be fully able to \nmeet combatant commander's requirements in key regions.\n  The Department has already begun to implement mitigation strategy to \naddress the impact of the Kennedy's complex overhaul workload \ncancellation. Approximately $28 million has been expended in supporting \nthe Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility to \nexecute required maintenance on the USS John C. Stennis, CVN-74.\n  Norfolk Naval Shipyard personnel are also executing work on the USS \nGeorge Washington, CVN-73, currently undergoing a docking phased \nincremental availability at Newport News.\n  Approximately $26 million has been obligated to Norfolk Naval \nShipyard and the private sector to accomplish this additional required \nmaintenance.\n  Additionally, there are other nonrecoverable costs totaling $47.1 \nmillion. Some of these are planning costs that will be required to be \nspent again if the complex overhaul of the Kennedy is reinstated, \nthereby increasing the original cost estimate of the complex overhaul.\n  The Navy also informs me that workload disruptions throughout all \nshipyards would be severe if their workload mitigation plans were \nchanged at this point in the fiscal year.\n  I repeat that. They have told me workload disruptions throughout all \nnaval shipyards would be severe if their workload mitigation plans were \nchanged at this point in the fiscal year.\n  I will try to respond to my colleagues who suggest the Kennedy would \nbe available to replace the USS Kitty Hawk, which is currently forward \ndeployed and permanently homeported in Japan, if the Kitty Hawk was not \navailable for operations.\n  The Navy assures me the Kennedy would not be moved to Japan if \nsomething happened to the Kitty Hawk. The Navy leadership believes the \nKennedy does not provide the capabilities required to meet the mission \nfor that area of responsibility.\n  Although the Kennedy is older than the Kitty Hawk, the Navy provides \nregular upgrades and maintenance on the Kitty Hawk to keep her in \nexcellent material condition. If the Kitty Hawk becomes unavailable for \noperations, the Navy will rotate a nuclear carrier into the region \nuntil the Kitty Hawk would be repaired.\n  Finally, I know many Senators are concerned that the retirement of \nthe Kennedy will negatively impact base realignment and closure \ndecisions, BRAC decisions, regarding Mayport, FL, and possibly leave \nthe Nation with only one port facility on the east coast capable of \nsupporting large-deck, deep-draft vessels.\n  I can tell those Senators the Navy is committed to retaining two \nstrategic ports capable of accommodating large-deck, deep-draft ships \non each coast.\n  To this end, Mayport continues to be a critical large-deck-capable \nport. In the near term, the Navy will look at homeporting a large-deck \namphibious ship in Mayport to mitigate the impact to the community for \nthe loss of the Kennedy.\n  As I said, I am here to oppose this amendment because of the cost it \nwill impose on the Navy and the risk it will impose on future \ncapabilities being developed for our naval forces.\n  There is no question in my mind this is the wrong way to go. The Navy \nhas stated that to us very clearly in statements made to the \nAppropriations Committee, following the time of the comments to the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  I want to again say Secretary English, with the Chief of Naval \nOperations sitting by him, said this to our committee:\n\n       So we fully support taking out the Kennedy, and, Mr. \n     Chairman, if we are required to keep the Kennedy, then we're \n     going to have to take money out of someplace else because we \n     do not have the money to keep the Kennedy.\n\n  The impact of this amendment is it will be taking money out of this \nsupplemental appropriations for this purpose. My good friend from \nVirginia I do hope will take, in any event, a look at his amendment \nbecause I do not think this emergency money ought to be diverted to a \nchange in a policy decision and overruling the Secretary of the Navy \nwith regard to how many carriers there are in our fleet.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend the funds needed, \nto the extent funds are needed, to keep this ship in an operational \nstatus are in the 2005 budget. The only reason we had to make reference \nwith the sentence ``of the amount appropriated for the Department of \nNavy by this act'' was to get it germane so we could get it to the \nfloor so the Senate of the United States can make a decision.\n  I say to the Senator most respectfully, the funds that are needed to \nput this ship in such condition to continue are there. However, just \ntoday the admiral, who was the battle fleet commander who brought this \nship back from its most recent deployment, said as follows:\n\n       If improvements made to the JFK avionics maintenance \n     facility prior to deployment--\n\n  The access to this ship. And he concludes by saying:\n\n       The results from our aggressive self-sufficiency and superb \n     technical support, mostly via aviation technology, enabled us \n     to return from the deployment in outstanding material \n     condition.\n\n  That is the status of the ship. The reason we are trying to keep this \nin is not a political one, it is not relating to our various \njurisdictions. It is for the interest of this country to keep a ship in \nport in Japan which is nonnuclear, while the Japanese Government and \nthe local mayoral government--I think it is called a precept--make the \ndecision as to whether they will ever allow a nuclear carrier in there.\n  I think there is adequate testimony in our records of the Armed \nServices Committee to the effect the Navy believes keeping a ship in \nthat area of operation, particularly at this time of heightened \ntension, is in the interest of our national security and our ability to \nwork with our allies and friends in that region.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to underscore so Senator \nStevens can hear what Senator Warner said. The funds were provided in \nthe 2005 Defense appropriations bill. There were funds in excess of \n$300 million in that bill. To the best of my recollection, it was $317 \nmillion for the purpose of dry dock. Some of those funds have already \nbeen expended for the planning of the dry dock. However, there are \napproximately $288 million already appropriated in the 2005 bill for \nthe drydocking of the John F. Kennedy. This is not the expenditure of \nmoneys in the supplemental bill.\n  I want to underscore also what the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee has said in quoting Admiral McCollum, \nthe battle\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\ngroup commander of the John F. Kennedy, which has just returned from \noperation, and what he quoted from the written testimony of the \nadmiral. I was at that committee meeting.\n  I just came from a committee meeting. I said: ``Admiral,'' and I read \nthe statement the chairman just read to the Senate, ``are you saying \nthat the John F. Kennedy is seaworthy?''\n  He said: Yes, sir.\n  Thirdly, I emphasize what the distinguished chairman has said, and \nthat is, this all boils down to a matter of defense of our interests \nwith a rising threat from China in the Pacific area of operations. It \nis clear, in testimony after testimony by four-star admirals, we have \nto have a carrier homeported in Japan so they can get to an area of \nconflict quickly. Between now and when the Kitty Hawk is going to \nretire in 2008, we do not have any assurance the municipal government \nin Japan is going to say: We will accept a nuclear-powered carrier. \nTherefore, out of prudent and conservative planning for our projection \nof forces in the Pacific region, we should keep this conventional \ncarrier alive.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, can I inquire of the time remaining under \nmy control? My understanding is there were 15 minutes to Senator \nStevens and 15 minutes given to my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the opinion of the chair that agreement \non time was never formally reached. However, the Senator from Virginia \nhas used 3 minutes and the Senator from Alaska 10.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think, in the interest of moving this along, that we \nadhere to the request there be 15 minutes to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That was my understanding of the situation at the time. \nI think there have been more requests for time.\n  Mr. WARNER. We failed to achieve an agreement. So can I reinstate the \noriginal request, 15 minutes to each side--it is now less the amount of \ntime consumed by both sides--so the Senate can get on with its \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Nelson and my colleagues, \nit is clear this decision to take the Kennedy and put it in a situation \nwhere it is going into mothballs was made in the final hours of the \nbudget process.\n  It was driven by the budget. The Chief of Naval Operations had \ntestified before our committee, which testimony is before the Senate, \nthat he always wanted 12 carriers. If we are to make a decision to go \nfrom 12 carriers to 11, that should be done in the QDR process which is \nunderway now, which will be concluded this year, possibly impacted by \nthe BRAC process which likewise is underway, and consequently there are \norderly procedures legislated by the Congress by which a decision of \nthis magnitude should be made.\n  There are three Senators who desire to speak, and I will yield 2 \nminutes to each of them: Senator Allen, 2 minutes; Senator Martinez, 2 \nminutes, and Senator Talent, 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my good colleague Senator Warner \nfor his great leadership on this matter. This is a bipartisan effort.\n  Let us recall what this amendment is about. It is to provide our Navy \nwith the maximum flexibility to project our power in East Asia. The \nSenator's amendment says before we mothball the JFK, two things have to \nhappen. There is the Quadrennial Defense Review to determine how this \nmixture should be, and actually 180 days thereafter, and also assure us \nwe can have a nuclear carrier ported in Japan, which prohibits nuclear-\npowered ships in their land.\n  A little over 2 years ago, Admiral Clark said: The current force of \n12 carriers and 12 amphibious groups is the minimum we can have to \nsustain the operations we are in. In the 2002 naval posture statement: \nAircraft carrier force levels have been set at 12 ships as a result of \nfiscal constraints. However, real-world experience and analysis \nindicate that a carrier force of at least 15 ships is necessary to meet \nthe warfighting Commander in Chief's requirements for carrier presence \nin all regions of importance to the United States.\n  What has happened in the last 2 years? Nothing to restrain or think \nthat these threats are less than they were before. We are still in the \nwar on terrorism. China is building up their navy. They are passing \nanticession laws, threatening Taiwan more than ever. So while we are \nstanding down, to some extent, our building of a navy, then reducing a \ncarrier which would not be available to be in Japan in that theater of \nconcern, it is illogical to take away this flexibility of protecting \nour security interests in the Indian Ocean as well as, for that matter, \nthe Pacific Ocean. I believe a plan to mothball the Kennedy at this \ntime is shortsighted, especially in this time of war and with the rapid \nbuildup of the Chinese Navy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the total time \nremaining under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 7 minutes \nremaining and the Senator from Alaska has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 30 additional seconds to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. The threats in the western Pacific are greater than they \nwere before. Even last year, the funding was put in for this year for \nthe refurbishment and the maintenance of the JFK. For the sake of our \nsecurity and the flexibility we need for projecting our power, \nprotecting our interests in the Far East, the wise thing to do is \naccept the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, which is shared by \ncosponsors from Florida and elsewhere.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Warner's \namendment. I believe it is of crucial importance to our Nation that we \nmaintain the readiness of our carrier force.\n  I thank my colleagues from Virginia, and also the senior Senator from \nmy State, Mr. Nelson, who has been so dogged in his fight in this \neffort. I believe we have made a lot of progress since we began to talk \nabout keeping the Kennedy and keeping 12 carriers in the fleet.\n  The thing that has impressed me as this discussion has proceeded is a \ncommentary from the Secretary of the Navy, as well as the Chief of \nNaval Operations as they have discussed the need for readiness of 12 \ncarriers, as well as the fact there is a need for maintaining \noperations on the east coast of the United States with two ports \navailable to our Navy.\n  I believe as this debate and this discussion has ensued, it has \nbecome increasingly clear that at a time of great stress upon our Armed \nForces, at a time when we expect our global reach to be just that, \nglobal, we cannot make do with 11 carriers to satisfy short-term \nbudgetary goals.\n  The fact is our Nation is best served by a 12-carrier force. Our \nNation is also best served by having two ports on the east coast that \ncan handle nuclear carriers. I believe we should move forward in that \nregard as well to allow that diversity and that opportunity.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. I am \nthe chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, which is kind of strange \ngiven that I am from Missouri. It is not as though we have ports or \nshipyards in Missouri, although we do build the planes that go on these \ncarriers.\n  I want to endorse this amendment, which I have cosponsored, and \nendorse what other Senators have said in support of it and briefly give \nthe Senate the broader picture. Several years ago the Chief of Naval \nOperations opined that we needed about 375 ships in the U.S. Navy to \nmeet the national military strategy, basically to protect our security. \nWe now have around 288.\n  A Quadrennial Defense Review is underway. It is going to be completed \nnext year. We are looking very carefully in the Armed Services \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S3992]]\n\nat how many ships we need and what we need to do to the shipbuilding \nbudget and what we need to do to demand more efficiency from our \nshipyards and our shipbuilders.\n  I am very hopeful in the next year or so we will move forward with a \nmajor package in this area. I know the chairman of the full committee \nfeels the same way.\n  In the meantime, especially given the rising tensions in the western \nPacific, I think allowing the Navy to go from 12 to 11 carriers would \nsend exactly the wrong statement. We need to make the point to everyone \naround the world that we are going to sustain naval strength at the \nlevel necessary to protect the security of the United States. So we as \na Congress need to begin resolving now that we are going to do what is \nnecessary to accomplish that, which means in part, yes, not allowing \nthe number of carriers to shrink, at least not before the Quadrennial \nDefense Review is finished, but also it means sustaining the \nshipbuilding and conversion account at a funding level that is \nnecessary to buy the ships we need to sustain a 300-ship or more Navy.\n  There is going to be more on this next year. We have to stand by on \nthat. I am sympathetic with the concerns of the Senator from Alaska, \nbut I sponsored the amendment and I support it now. Passing it would be \nthe prudent thing to do.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Please notify me when I have 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to rule VI, paragraph 2, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Byrd be considered necessarily absent and he be \nexcused from any further service of the Senate for the remainder of \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment says the money will come \nout of this bill. Now, it is true that for 2005 we did appropriate \nmoney to the Navy for the CV-67, the John F. Kennedy. But I have in my \nhand the cancellation of the complex overhaul. We know exactly where \nthe money has been reallocated. It has been reallocated to a series of \nfunctions. Some of those functions are already prepared.\n  I say to my colleagues, no matter what we do, the money will come out \nof this bill because the money that was allocated in the 2005 bill has \nbeen used for the Stennis, for the George Washington, support travel \nfor the CVN-73 and 74, for the USS Truman, CVN-75, for additional work \nat Hampton Roads, for the USS Charlotte, which is the SSN-766, a \nsubmarine, and for work inactivation of the carrier at Mayport. As a \npractical matter, they have already spent the $288 million in the 2005 \nbill--at least obligated it. The Senator from Virginia, I understand, \ndisputes that. But that is the information we have received.\n  What I am saying, for our committee I oppose this amendment of \nSenator Warner because it, No. 1, will preserve 12 carriers; No. 2, it \nwill take money from this bill or somewhere to go back and reinstate \nthe basic complex overhaul which, as I said to the Senate, the Navy now \nbelieves is unwarranted because of the age of this vessel. This vessel \nis so old and it did not have a midlife service program. So there is no \nreason to suspect it will have 10 years' service after this overhaul is \ncompleted.\n  What this will do, if we spend the money, we are going to delay the \nmodernization of the Navy. We know throughout the world nations are \nbuilding more ships. We cannot keep up with them. We cannot keep up \nwith them because we are keeping old hulls. It is time we woke up. We \nneed smaller, faster, more capable vessels than these vessels we are \ntalking about. To prolong their life is wrong.\n  The Secretary of the Navy and the CNO have taken a different position \nthan they did 6 months ago on this issue. They finally came to the \nconclusion they could not do what they wanted to do, and they told us \nthat in our committee. I am reporting that to the Senate.\n  The choice of the Senate is to support the Navy's position now as \nexpressed by the Secretary and the Chief of Navy Operations and spend \nthis money the way they want to spend it for the future, or to go back \nand reverse that decision and try to maintain a 40-year-old carrier and \nextend its life for 10 years when the experts say you can spend all \nthis money and it still will not be a serviceable vessel to meet the \nneeds of the Navy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my good friend in a very \ndispassionate, calm way, you read from a document that is only 10 days \nold. They learned that I differed with them, and they have done \neverything they can to build a case to stop it. But not a dollar has \ngone out of the Navy Treasury. It is still there. You will see that \nthat was done just 10 days ago.\n  I say to my good friend, they made the decision to keep this in the \nbudget. It was in the budget up until the last 2 days when down came a \ncut in dollars and they decided to go to where they maybe cut a few \nbucks out. They can restore them and that ship can stay alive and that \nship can be added to address any problem to defend our interests in \nthat area for an indefinite period of time because it is in good \ncondition as certified today--am I correct, Senator?--by the admiral in \ncharge of that ship?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is absolutely correct; just 30 \nminutes ago from the admiral.\n  Mr. WARNER. So as a former Secretary of the Navy myself, I feel very \nstrongly. I do not know of any Senator who stood on this floor more \ntimes to defend the Department of the Navy--I say with a sense of \nhumility--than I. But I believe this time the decision was driven by \nthe budget, and it is not a correct one given the status of forces in \nthat area, given the uncertainty about the ability to continue the \nhomeporting of a Navy carrier in our expensive base that we have \nmaintained--as a matter of fact, as Secretary I put it together--in \nYokosuka.\n  If there is more time, I yield the time back and suggest the Senate \nwork its will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret being here with this argument \nbecause I have such deep respect for Senator Warner, the Senator from \nVirginia, the former Secretary of Navy. But I think this year I am \ngoing to be at this desk saying this again and again. We are in a \nprogram of reshaping our military. We are looking out to the future, \nbased on the lessons we have learned in Afghanistan and Iraq and the \nwar on terrorism.\n  We note some of the failures of our system. One of them is the \nfailure to modernize in time. We got behind. The very fact that this \n40-year-old vessel is out there with overhaul appropriations was wrong \nto begin with. We should be looking to the future and to the needs of \nthis Navy. I congratulate the Secretary of the Navy and the CNO for \nbeing willing to reverse their stand and come to us and say: Please \noppose this amendment. Keep the schedule we have decided on and let us \nmodernize the Navy.\n  That is the decision before the Senate. Are we going to go forward \nwith the people making the tough decisions? Are we going to do it after \nBRAC? Are we going to do it for the Air Force? We are going to have \nsome tough ones for the Air Force. Are we going to do it for the Army? \nWe are going to have some tough decisions on the Army. Every single \npart of the military is going to be realigned in terms of spending this \nyear, and this is the beginning.\n  I leave it to the Senate. Make the decision. Shall we follow the \nChief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of Navy, their current \nposition, or shall we follow the position they had just 6 months ago?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask Senator Collins be added to those as cosponsor, and \nthat the list remain open because we\n\n[[Page S3993]]\n\nhave received a lot of calls from people who want to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Jeffords), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  The vote was announced--yeas 58, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 106 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n  The amendment (No. 498) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 414.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 414.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To encourage that funds be made available to provide \n            assistance to children affected by the tsunami)\n\n       On page 194, line 13, after ``tsunami:'' insert ``Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading, \n     not less than $25,000,000 should be made available to support \n     initiatives that focus on the immediate and long-term needs \n     of children, including the registration of unaccompanied \n     children, the reunification of children with their immediate \n     or extended families, the facilitation and promotion of \n     domestic and international adoption for orphaned children, \n     the protection of women and children from violence and \n     exploitation, and activities designed to prevent the capture \n     of children by armed forces and promote the integration of \n     war affected youth:''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 483, as modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and that amendment No. 483 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the amendment \nto the desk and ask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendment being \nmodified?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, which amendment is this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment previously offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico----\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No. 483.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 483.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 202, lines 22 through 24, strike ``recent Supreme \n     Court decisions and recently enacted legislation, \n     $60,000,000'' and insert ``increased immigration-related \n     filings, recent Supreme Court decisions, and recently enacted \n     legislation, $65,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this modification would provide that \ninstead of the $60 million that is in the bill now for the operation of \nour Federal courts, there would be $65 million, and that the additional \nfunding could be used for both responding to recent Supreme Court \ndecisions, responding to recently enacted legislation, and responding \nto the increased immigration-related filings in the Federal court. This \nis a good amendment. It is one that is important, particularly for the \nStates where these immigration-related filings are happening. I believe \nthis is an acceptable amendment to both sides, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it. I believe it can be agreed to on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 483, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 483), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 414, As Modified\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am glad I was able to accommodate our \ncolleague. At this time I send a modification to amendment No. 414 to \nthe desk and ask unanimous consent that we discuss this slightly \nmodified version.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 194, line 13, after ``tsunami:'' insert ``Provided \n     further, That of the funds appropriated under this heading, \n     not less than $25,000,000 should be made available to support \n     initiatives that focus on the immediate and long-term needs \n     of children for protection and permanency, including the \n     registration of unaccompanied children, the reunification of \n     children with their immediate or extended families, \n     assistance to improve the capacity of governments and \n     appropriate private entities to facilitate domestic and \n     international adoption of orphaned children, the protection \n     of women and children from violence and exploitation, and \n     activities designed to prevent the capture of children by \n     armed forces and promote the integration of war affected \n     youth:''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we continue to discuss the \nsupplemental bill, it is not the largest bill in terms of dollar \namounts that we have talked about on the Senate floor. Of course, we \nmanage to move through 13 appropriations bills most years. That is \nbillions and billions of dollars in priorities that we are trying to \nreflect on behalf of our constituents in our States and around the \nNation.\n  One of the important components of this $80 billion supplemental bill \nis about $1 billion for relief for tsunami victims. We remember all too \nvividly and dramatically and traumatically when on Sunday, December 26, \na wave of about 50 feet hit several countries in the Indian Ocean, \nprimarily Indonesia, and within a few hours or a few days, 120,000 \npeople were dead, some of them children who were simply unable to get \nout of the way of the wave; there was no warning.\n  The Senators who have forwarded this supplemental are very aware of \nthe needs. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Craig and myself \nbecause part of the effort to reconstruct this region is to help not \nonly rebuild\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\nthe roads, rebuild the houses, rebuild the schools, reinvest in the \nhealth and education infrastructure. I argue that it is most important \nfor us to rebuild the families. We talk about nation rebuilding. We \ntalk about building nations. We talk about reconstruction. All of that \nis wonderful and terrific, but I don't know if people are understanding \nthat nations are built, communities are built, cities are built on \nfamilies.\n  When I read through the many pages of this very well put together \nbill, one of the problems was there was not a mention under the title \nfor USAID of this Government's efforts to reunite orphans and parents, \nto establish strong programs or initiatives to help reunite children \nwith parents who are still alive or with extended family relatives so \nthat those family units can be strong.\n  I can tell you, I know from experience--and I think every Republican \nand Democrat on this floor would agree with me--you can build the \nstrongest buildings in the world. You can build the mightiest \ninterstate systems. You could have the finest school buildings and the \nfinest universities. But if you don't have strong families, the nation, \nthe community, is not going to thrive, and there will be no future. The \nfuture is passed from parent to child, from grandparent to grandchild, \nnot from a bureaucratic government. Governments do a lot of things \nwell, but let me stand here on behalf of the Coalition on Adoption, \nwhich represents 180 Members of Congress, to say, governments do a lot \nof things well. Raising children is not one of them. Parents raise \nchildren.\n  Senator Craig and I--and I see the Senator on the floor, and I would \nlike him to add his insights--want to strongly go on the record saying \nthat if we are going to spend a billion dollars to help tsunami \nvictims, certainly we can carve out of that money, not adding money to \nthis, $25 million for the express purpose of strengthening families, \nidentifying those children who have been orphaned, working to see if \nsome relative would adopt them. If that relative who wants to adopt has \nlost their fishing boat and is no longer able to provide for their \nsurviving children and the orphans of the sister or brother who was \nlost next to them in the wave, then these programs we are establishing \ncould help to reunite that family and keep them together and not pull \nthese children out of these family units and send them to be raised in \nan orphanage or in a boarding school and give them food.\n  They need more than food. They need emotional support. They need \nspiritual support. They need care. I could go on and on for hours, \nwhich I won't do, to give you documents that are alarming to me from \npeople whose salaries we pay saying that this is not important.\n  I want to say to the Members--and all of us feel it is quite \nimportant--it is a real problem when these pages do not reflect that \nprinciple and that priority.\n  I know Senator Craig's time may be short. Let me yield at the moment \nto him. He may want to add a word. I am hoping we can get this adopted \nwithout a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has made the \npoint so very clearly. We are sending a billion dollars to the tsunami \nregion and the tsunami victims. We speak not once about reuniting \nfamilies.\n  The Senator from Louisiana traveled with our majority leader to the \ntsunami area immediately following that tragedy. She saw firsthand the \nphenomenal difficulties. I was in India recently on behalf of the \ncongressional coalition on adoption and children and once again heard \nabout the tremendous problems that are real to this region.\n  One of the things that both the Senator from Louisiana and I know, \nbecause we immediately extended our assistance and opened our arms and \nsaid, Americans are ready to adopt these orphan children, we got a very \nnice, polite response: No, we will work to take care of our own.\n  The reason that response was appropriate was because in those regions \nof that part of our world, in those cultures and religions, the \nextended family is phenomenally important. They work very hard at \ntaking care of their own under most difficult situations of the kind we \nhave seen. It isn't just that they can reach out their arms for love \nand care; it is that they have the resources to assume those children \ninto their families who are part of the extended family.\n  I do believe this is an appropriate amendment. It does some targeting \nwithin. It is not adding money to; it is not taking money away from; it \nis simply defining and shaping a very important use. I would hope we \ncould agree on that and accept this amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana as an appropriate amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his insight and his \naddition to the record. Let me make two additional points. As we know, \nPresident Bush has asked former President Bush and former President \nClinton to head up an international private sector effort, so the money \nthat we lay down, the $1 billion, is sort of a guide to the private \ndollars being raised.\n  This Congress cannot, with the power that we have, let this budget go \nout without a mention or a specific dedication or at least an \nunderscore that we in the Congress think families are important, we \nwould like to send that message out to private donors saying: Please, \nlet's rebuild the highways, let's rebuild the schools, let's rebuild \nthe hospitals. But while we are doing that, let's respect the family. \nLet's honor the family. Let's try to keep children within families \nthrough extended kinship adoption, through adoption domestically and, \nif not, through international adoption with all the proper safeguards.\n\n  Second, we have spent a lot of time coming up with new rules and \nregulations about child trafficking, child exploitation. It is terrible \nto see children sold into the sex trade, and many of these children are \nsold into the sex trade because they don't have parents who are \nwatching them and protecting them. Yet in some cultures it is \nunfortunate that even children have children and the parents are not \nstrong enough, either economically or in a strong enough physical \nposition, to protect these children from these exploitations.\n  So I say to my friends in this room, if we want to protect children \nfrom exploitation, if we want to protect children from child \ntrafficking, then, heavens, help them find a parent. Parents do a lot \nbetter job of protecting children than any army in the world. Nobody \ncould get my children out from underneath my watchful eye. So I know. \nWe all hover around our children and protect them. The least our \nGovernment can do is honor the work parents in the United States of \nAmerica do in trying to protect their children, and when their parents \nare killed or separated from them, move them to adoptive parents who \nwill protect them and keep them away from the traffickers.\n  So I say to the leaders, the managers of the bill, we are not adding \nmoney to the bill; $25 million is not that much money when you are \ntalking about continents and nations and hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies that could benefit. Please consider accepting this amendment. \nIf not, you can understand why Senator Craig and I would have to ask \nfor a vote. We are not asking for any more money. We have mentioned \neverything in this bill--physical disabilities, mental illness, loss of \nfishing boats, highways, houses, schools. I have read every page of it, \nand I am on the Appropriations Committee. I cannot find a mention in \nhere about the U.S. Government--after many of us have traveled to the \nregion and taken pictures with orphans and with the families and \npromised aid, I don't see why we cannot earmark and set as a priority \n$25 million, which is a small amount of money, to this end.\n  That is basically the argument. I hope the leadership will accept it. \nI thank the chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, for his great help \nand support. I know it is a difficult bill to move through. Whether he \nwants to vote now or if he wants to stack it for later, I am open to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other requests for debate on \nthe amendment. I have no objection to our proceeding to a voice vote on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 414), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 475\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 475 and make a point of order that the amendment is \nnot germane under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken and \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me say how disappointed I am that the \naction taken by the Senator from Nevada has just happened. We were \nworking very hard to solve a very specific problem that the \nadministration had chosen to rule by regulation, what I believe is a \ntotal subversion of a law that was critically necessary and helpful to \nour agricultural people. But that has now happened, and the Senator was \nin his right, as disappointed as I am, by what I believe is a near \nbushwhack, but then again that is chosen.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 472, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent \nto call up amendment No. 472, as modified, which is at the desk.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLugar, Roberts, Harkin, Dorgan, Enzi, and Johnson be added as \ncosponsors of amendment No. 472, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendments Nos. 388 and 406.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 520\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 520.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 520.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To appropriate an additional $213,000,000 for Other \n  Procurement, Army, for the procurement of Up-Armored High Mobility \n               Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (UAHMMWVs))\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n         up-armored high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles\n\n       Sec. 1122. (a) Additional Amount for Other Procurement, \n     Army.--The amount appropriated by this chapter under the \n     heading ``Other Procurement, Army'' is hereby increased by \n     $213,000,000, with the amount of such increase designated as \n     an emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of the \n     conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 95 (108th \n     Congress).\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Of the amount appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this chapter under the heading \n     ``Other Procurement, Army'', as increased by subsection (a), \n     $213,000,000 shall be available for the procurement of Up-\n     Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles \n     (UAHMMWVs).\n       (c) Reports.--(1) Not later 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter until the \n     termination of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees \n     a report setting forth the current requirements of the Armed \n     Forces for Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled \n     Vehicles.\n       (2) Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report setting forth the most effective \n     and efficient options available to the Department of Defense \n     for transporting Up Armored High Mobility Multipurpose \n     Wheeled Vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I call up this amendment to address what has \nbeen a chronic and pressing need on the part of our military forces in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. President, there is an old saying we are all familiar with: Fool \nme once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n  Mr. President, fool me nine times, and it qualifies as an emergency \nthat must be addressed, particularly when the lives and limbs of our \nmilitary men and women are at stake. Specifically, I refer to the fact \nthat the United States Army has now, on nine consecutive occasions, \nunderestimated the need for uparmored humvees in the theater of Iraq. \nThis has been a matter of some public attention in Newsweek Magazine \nand elsewhere. It is a chronic need we need to address now.\n  The figure the Army indicates they currently need--and allegedly have \nmet--would not have been met at all if, last year, we had not taken \nsimilar action to do what I am currently requesting. They would have \nhad funding for thousands of fewer vehicles and not met the need that \ncurrently they suggest is imperative. The figure they are saying is \nsufficient today includes--think about this--a range of attrition of \n226 vehicles throughout the combat in Iraq. They have only lost 226 \nuparmored humvees throughout the last 2 years in that theater. This is \nbelow the attrition rate of 10 to 15 percent, suggesting strongly that \nthey are erring yet again--for the tenth time.\n  I ask my colleagues, when it comes to something this important, with \na track record of underestimating the need this clear, should we not \nerr on the side of doing more, rather than less, when it comes to \nprotecting the lives and safety of our military men and women?\n  I note some of my colleagues, who I esteem greatly on the other side \nof the aisle, will suggest the generals are simply saying we don't have \nan additional need at this time. Mr. President, that is not what the \ntroops are saying. Do you remember the one brave soldier who brought to \nthe attention of the Secretary of Defense the fact that they were \nhaving to resort to what he called ``hillbilly armor'' for their \nprotection? We should not allow this deplorable condition to continue.\n  I remind my colleagues again, in spite of what the generals are \ncurrently saying in a letter circulating, they have been wrong nine \nconsecutive times. The credibility on this issue is not that great. It \nis also suggested perhaps we should take our resources--and I \nunderstand they are scarce--and allocate them instead to have striker \nvehicles instead of uparmored humvees.\n  Mr. President, I submit this is a false choice. When it comes to \nprotecting our troops, we should do whatever it takes to get the job \ndone and not leave some exposed to unnecessary harm while choosing \ninstead to protect others. We can afford to do both.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my comments by saying how much I respect \nSenator Cochran and Senator Stevens but the track record here is very \nclear. On nine consecutive occasions, the Army has underestimated the \nneed. The need wouldn't be met today for the number of vehicles \nsuggested in their letter if we had not acted last year. Let us err on \nthe side of doing more rather than less. Let us take this action to \nprotect our troops. It is the very least we can do when they are in \nharm's way on our behalf.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, myself, and others, I \nask we take this action.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the global war on terrorism requirement \nfor these uparmored humvees is 10,079 units. I have a letter from the \nDepartment of the Army signed by David Melcher, Lieutenant General, \nU.S. Army, and James Lovelace, Lieutenant General, Deputy Chief of \nStaff, which states the amount already appropriated and supported in \nreprogramming actions will fund the total requirement of 10,079 humvees \nby June of this year.\n  Without any money from this supplemental request, the total \nrequirements have been set down for this system for this fiscal year.\n  This, after all, is a supplemental request, and we will be dealing \nwith the Army's 2006 requirements in the full bill for the fiscal year \n2006. We have appropriated and programmed moneys to\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nmeet the requirements. As a matter of fact, the funds we put up already \nwill exceed that requirement by 266 vehicles. The manufacturer is \ncurrently producing these humvees at the maximum capacity of 550 per \nmonth and will exceed the Department's requirements in June.\n  I am sad to oppose my good friend from Indiana, but the requirement \nfor these uparmored humvees is not going to expand, in our judgment. \nThe Army maintains they do not need more uparmored humvees in \nAfghanistan because they are too heavy to maneuver in the mountainous \nAfghan terrain. In the areas where they are capable of being used, we \nare bringing more and more critically needed equipment, such as the \nStrikers, into Iraq.\n  We should focus on the total funding for validated global war on \nterrorism requirements. These requirements were validated by the Army \nthrough its team system. There is no question that the procurement we \nhave already paid for is sufficient to meet the total needs of the Army \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  As I said, we are going to look at this in terms of 2006. The Army \nprocurement request so far for 2005 has been sufficient. We do have \ncritical force protection requirements, but we also have the problem of \nrecapitalization of equipment used in operation and equipment that is \ncoming up for rotation.\n  This is a very expensive time for the Army with the rotations that \nare going on. If we fund unvalidated requirements as proposed by this \namendment at this time, that will come at the expense of validated \nrequirements that have not been met.\n  We will look at this again in conference, I promise the Senator from \nIndiana. There is no question this is a system we provided in recent \nmonths for the global war on terrorism. This capacity of 550 per month \nis an enormous amount of production. We commend the manufacturer for \nincreasing its rate of production, but what happens when you increase \nrate of production is you get to the end sooner.\n  We validated these requirements. We have met the requirements, and we \ndo not need any additional money from this emergency bill to be spent \nfor uparmored humvees.\n  I do not know if anyone else wishes to speak on the matter, but I \noppose it. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Again, at the request of the Department of Defense and the Department \nof the Army I oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  If there is no further debate, I am pleased to have the vote on this \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BAYH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote ordered \non this amendment commence at 5:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                EPILEPSY AND RETURNING WOUNDED SOLDIERS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska for \njoining me to discuss an issue of growing importance for our service \nmembers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am pleased to join the Senator from Illinois to \ndiscuss this issue.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Recently, USA Today reported that many of our injured \nsoldiers are returning from Iraq with a condition known as traumatic \nbrain injury, or TBI. Even though new technology and better body armor \nare helping soldiers survive bomb and rocket attacks, the blasts are \nstill causing brain damage to them. As of January, 437 cases have been \ndiagnosed in Army hospitals alone, and some doctors are saying that it \ncould become the ``signature wound of the Iraq war.''\n  TBI is the greatest risk factor for developing epilepsy. In fact, a \nstudy of Vietnam vets showed that 51 percent of those who suffered TBI \nwent on to develop this disorder. That is why I filed an amendment to \nprovide $1 million to the Department of Defense Peer Reviewed Medical \nResearch Program for epilepsy research--including research on the \nrelationship between TBI and epilepsy. The Epilepsy Foundation of \nAmerica supports the amendment.\n  However, I understand that this important issue is more appropriately \naddressed in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations process. With that \nunderstanding, I will not offer the amendment at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the Senator not offering the amendment at \nthis time.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I look forward to working with the Senator from Alaska on \nthis issue. Because epilepsy is a disorder that remains latent for many \nyears, it is important that we work now to better understand the \nrelationship between TBI and epilepsy and prevent the onset of epilepsy \nin these service members.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I look forward to working with the Senator from Illinois \non this issue during the appropriations process and ensuring that the \nneeds of our service members are being met.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 440, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 440 and ask that \nit be brought before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 440\n\n       On page 169, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n\n       sense of senate on funding for vaccine health care centers\n\n       Sec. 1122.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My amendment is designed to correct a flaw in the \ncurrent law that unintentionally but severely restricts the number of \nfamilies of injured servicemembers that qualify for assistance to \ntravel to the bedside of their wounded loved ones.\n  This issue came to my attention when Tina Justice, the wife of \nWisconsin Army National Guard 1LT Christopher Justice, contacted my \noffice late last fall. First Lieutenant Justice and eight other members \nof Company B of the 118th Medical Battalion were traveling in a three \nvehicle convoy near Baghdad on September 12, 2004 and were waiting to \nclear a roadblock when they noticed a suspicious vehicle racing towards \nthem. Members of Company B quickly responded, but the driver was still \nable to blow up his vehicle. The swift reaction undoubtedly saved many \nlives that day, but eight of the nine members of Company B still \nsustained injuries from the powerful blast, three severe enough to \nrequire evacuation to the United States.\n  First Lieutenant Justice was one of the three soldiers seriously \ninjured and evacuated, first to Germany, and finally to Walter Reed, \nwhere he underwent several surgeries for his injuries. All three \ninjured Wisconsin guardsmen received exceptional medical care from the \noutstanding medical staff at Walter Reed. The guardsmen were also very \ngrateful to be able to see their families who quickly rushed to be with \nthem during this very traumatic time. Tina Justice was one of those who \nimmediately went to Walter Reed to be with\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nher husband, bringing along her 4-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son.\n  Congress has enacted legislation to help family members of injured \nservicemembers like First Lieutenant Justice. We have passed a law that \nprovides Federal assistance to help pay for the travel and \ntransportation costs of family members of very seriously or seriously \nill or injured servicemembers. With her husband being injured seriously \nenough to require evacuation to Germany and then Walter Reed, Mrs. \nJustice naturally assumed that she would qualify for help under this \nprovision. However, she found something quite different. According to \nthe Army, her husband's injuries, which required evacuation to Europe \nand then to the U.S., did not qualify as ``serious,'' and therefore she \nwould not be eligible for reimbursement. Despite her many attempts to \nreverse this decision, the Army continued to deny her claim.\n  After much frustration, Mrs. Justice contacted my office. When I \nheard about the case, I believed there must have been some sort of \nbureaucratic mix-up. After all, it makes no sense that the Army would \nspend all that money to evacuate personnel out of the theater, on to \nGermany, and finally to the United States if that person was not \nseriously injured. However, my inquiries to the Army and to Secretary \nof Defense Donald Rumsfeld did not satisfactorily resolve Mrs. \nJustice's problem.\n  The Justices are not alone. I was also recently contacted by the \nCarter family from Ladysmith, WI. Their son, SPC Andrew Carter, \nsustained shrapnel injuries to his legs and feet while serving his \ncountry in Iraq and was evacuated to Walter Reed. He and his family \nwere also frustrated by the fact that they did not qualify for travel \ncost reimbursement because Specialist Carter's injuries weren't \nclassified as serious by the Army.\n  The Army Surgeon General's office finally helped shed some light on \nthe problem. Although the law provides travel benefits for family \nmembers of very seriously or seriously injured military personnel, what \nconstitutes a very serious or serious injury to the Army is very \ndifferent from what the average American may think. The Army's \ntechnical definition of very seriously ill or injured, VSI, is that the \nsoldier is in imminent danger of death. In order to be classified as \nseriously ill or injured, SI, the soldier must require a very high \nlevel of care, such as being in the intensive care unit, but be \nexpected to survive. All other injuries, including those that may \nrequire extensive and multiple surgeries and months of hospital care \nare listed as not seriously ill or injured, NSI.\n  Now I think that the average American would agree with the VSI \nclassification. However, if someone has taken major shrapnel and other \nwounds from a suicide car bomber requiring several surgeries and is \nevacuated all the way to the United States from Iraq, my guess is that \nthe average American would call that pretty serious. I know I did and I \nknow that Mrs. Justice, the Carters, and others have as well. I also \nthink that Congress, in passing laws to allow family members to visit \ntheir injured loved ones, had a definition of VSI and SI in mind more \nclosely aligned to that of the average American rather than the \ntechnical definition used by the Army. What we have, therefore, is a \nwell-intentioned law that is creating expectations that just aren't \nbeing met because our definitions don't match up.\n\n  The denial of travel benefits, known as Invitational Travel Orders, \nITO, to families like the Justices and Carters, because their loved \nones' injuries aren't bad enough comes at the absolute worst time for \nthe injured men and women and their families. They are in the midst of \nan extremely traumatic time, trying to come to grips with what has \nhappened and working to heal physically and emotionally. They need to \nbe concentrating on these important tasks, not worrying about whether \nor not they can even afford to be there and fighting the bureaucracy \nfor travel cost reimbursement.\n  The unfortunate and avoidable aftereffect of the current policy is \nthat the injured troops and their families feel unappreciated by the \nDefense Department and by the country for which the servicemember \nalmost lost their life.\n  The amendment I introduce today will help rectify this problem and \nmore closely align expectations with what families are provided. This \nlegislation would make an addition to current law by allowing for one \nITO for up to three family members of a servicemember medically \nevacuated from a war zone to the United States, whether that injured \nperson is listed as VSI, SI or NSI. It is important that families get \nthis first trip and don't have to worry about whether or not they can \nafford to pay for it. This amendment would provide that first trip.\n  During that first trip, families can also acquaint themselves with \nthe many fantastic public and private programs there to help them. The \nRed Cross, Fisher House, Operation Hero Miles, many veterans and \nmilitary service organizations, the list goes on, all provide those \ninjured in the line of duty and their families with many resources. \nFamilies can use that first trip to learn about and tap into these \nresources to assist them with future needs. I know the Justices and \nCarters deeply appreciated the help from these and other organizations.\n  Some may be worried that this amendment will simply crowd out the \ngood work being done by private organizations with another Government \nprogram. This is an understandable concern. However, after consulting \nwith some of these organizations, I am confident that this legislation \nwill not do so. It will, in fact, complement current private efforts to \nassist servicemembers and their families. The experiences of the \nJustices and Carters also show that this proposed legislation fills a \nvoid in the current assistance efforts.\n  We are all very conscious of supporting our troops and making sure \nthat those who have been injured receive the best possible medical \ncare. This should be a priority. At the same time, we must not forget \nthe families of these servicemembers. They, too, make great sacrifices \nand must cope with the changes in their lives brought about by the \ninjuries and recovery of their loved ones. The amendment I introduce \ntoday will help reduce some of the burden faced by injured troops and \ntheir families so that they can concentrate on the important work of \nhealing.\n  I ask the managers if they are willing to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we commend the Senator for his \nmodification and this necessary amendment. It deals with travel by \ndependents and loved ones with those who are seriously ill or injured \nor in a situation of imminent death. I do think the modification meets \nthe increasing needs of our service men and women and their families. \nSo we are pleased to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their support. \nI hope they will be willing to work to keep this small but important \namendment in the conference report.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 416), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I again thank the managers very much. I \nwould like to make a brief statement about another amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator mind reconsidering that amendment at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 459\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also want to speak very briefly \nregarding an amendment that I had filed, amendment No. 459. Chairman \nCochran raised a point of order against the amendment today, but I want \nto spend just a few minutes to explain what this amendment was about, \nbecause it concerns the success or failure of the U.S. effort in Iraq, \nand it concerns every American taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\n  In 2003 I offered an amendment to the supplemental bill for Iraq and \nAfghanistan that established an inspector general for the Coalition \nProvisional Authority so that there would be one auditing body \ncompletely focused on ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and \nefficiently, and that this effort is free of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Then the CPA phased out and, happily, Iraqi sovereignty was \ntransferred back into Iraqi hands. Congress agreed that continued \noversight of the reconstruction effort was important, and agreed to an \namendment that I offered last year to turn the CPAIG into the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. But even today, many months \nafter that change, in many ways the reconstruction effort has only just \nbegun. According to the Congressional Research Service, as of about a \nmonth ago, only a little more than $6 billion of the nearly $21 billion \nreconstruction fund had actually been expended. The work of the Special \nInspector General must continue.\n  My amendment is simple and largely technical. This amendment would \nadjust the termination date for the Special IG to link to expenditures \nrather than obligated funds. Obligations are dramatically outpacing \nexpenditures in the reconstruction effort today. If we let the Special \nIG sunset after the bulk of the money is obligated but not expended, we \nwill not have a clear picture of what these billions of U.S. taxpayer \ndollars actually achieved on the ground. The imminent disappearance of \nauditors can also create a real incentive for cutting corners in \nactually implementing projects. So we need to make sure that Congress \nsignals its support for the Special IG continuing to see this \nreconstruction effort through.\n  Transparency and accountability in the reconstruction effort is not \nabout finding new things to criticize. It is about responsible \nstewardship of taxpayer resources, and it is about getting \nreconstruction right. Ultimately, it is about achieving our goals in \nIraq. Congress appropriated reconstruction funds in an emergency \nsupplemental. Congress created this IG in an emergency supplemental. It \nis entirely appropriate to make these technical changes to the IG's \nmandate in this supplemental to ensure that Congressional intent--which \nis to have ongoing, vigorous, focused oversight of the reconstruction \neffort--is respected.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the managers of this bill did not see \nfit to devote any effort to this important amendment. The amendment had \nbeen cleared on the Democratic side, but apparently there was some \nproblem, or some lack of interest, that prevented this amendment from \nbeing accepted. This is troubling. It is difficult to understand why \nanyone would oppose solid oversight of the reconstruction effort. The \nIG's team needs some sense of certainty as the obligation rate soars \nand their termination grows closer and closer, yet the bulk of \nreconstruction funds remain unexpended. The Senate addressed this issue \nin the $87 billion 2003 supplemental for Iraq, and then made an \nimportant adjustment by unanimous consent last year while we considered \nthe DOD Authorization bill. This needs to get done, and I will continue \nto work to make sure that happens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 429 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as the Senate is aware, I proposed an \namendment identified as No. 429, which is still pending in the Senate. \nThat amendment is verbatim the amendment that came out of the House of \nRepresentatives with regard to the REAL ID and came to us on the \nsupplemental appropriations emergency bill.\n  I am about to ask unanimous consent to withdraw that amendment. Prior \nto doing so, I want to be clear for the record I believe the House \nposition on the REAL ID, the 9/11 Commission position, which is where \nthat came from, and the security of our borders is truly an emergency \nsituation and an appropriate place for that amendment to be on the \nemergency supplemental for Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I respect those who had differences, and I respect those who have \nwithdrawn amendments to this bill. Because of that, and because we are \nreaching a conclusion, I will respectfully ask unanimous consent my \namendment be withdrawn with the express understanding that I sincerely \nhope the conferees and the conference committee, before this bill \nfinally comes to rest, will have agreed that position is correct; that \nREAL ID will have been included, and they will have addressed the \nsecurity of our borders and the identification of those entering the \nUnited States of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent amendment No. 429 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 429) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to the \ninclusion of the so-called REAL ID bill in the emergency supplemental \nappropriations conference report. That bill is harmful and unnecessary. \nThe Intelligence Reform Act we approved overwhelmingly last year \nprovides real border security solutions. The so-called REAL ID bill \ncontains controversial provisions we rejected last year and should \nreject again. It's a false solution on border security. There's no need \nto revisit these issues again, and they serve no purpose except to push \nan anti-immigrant agenda.\n  The supporters of the REAL ID bill continue to say that loopholes \nexist in our immigration and asylum system that are being exploited by \nterrorists, and this bill will close them. In fact, it does nothing to \nimprove national security, and leaves other big issues unresolved.\n  Asylum seekers would find no refuge. Battered women would be exposed \nto abuse. Many Americans would have problems getting driver's licenses, \nand law enforcement would be outsourced to bounty hunters. All of our \nlaws, including labor laws, would be waived to build a wall. For the \nfirst time since the Civil War, habeas corpus would be prohibited.\n  Each year, countless refugees are forced to leave their countries, \nfleeing persecution. America has always been a haven for those \ndesperate for that protection. At the very beginning of our history, \nthe refugee Pilgrims seeking religious freedom landed on Plymouth Rock. \nEver since we've welcomed refugees, and it's made us a better nation. \nThey represent the best of American values. They have stood alone, at \ngreat personal cost, against hostile governments for fundamental \nprinciples like freedom of speech and religion. With this legacy, we \nhave a responsibility to examine our asylum policies carefully, to see \nthat they are fair and just.\n  The REAL ID bill would trample this noble tradition and make it \ndevastating for legitimate asylum-seekers fleeing persecution. It would \nmake it more difficult for victims fleeing serious human rights abuses \nto obtain asylum and safety, and could easily lead to their return to \ntheir persecutors.\n  Supporters of the REAL ID bill want us to believe that its changes \nwill keep terrorists from being granted asylum. But current immigration \nlaws already bar persons engaged in terrorist activity from asylum. \nBefore they receive asylum, all applicants must also undergo extensive \nsecurity checks, covering all terrorist and criminal databases at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the CIA.\n  Another section of the REAL ID bill contains a provision that would \ncomplete the US-Mexico border fence in San Diego. But it goes much \nfurther than that. It would require DHS to waive all laws necessary to \nbuild such fences, not just in San Diego, but anywhere else along our \n2,000 mile border with Mexico and our 4,000 mile border with Canada. \nThis unprecedented and unchecked power covers all Federal or State law \ndeemed necessary to build the barriers, even child labor laws, worker \nhealth and safety laws, minimum wage laws, and environmental laws. It \nwould even take away the rights of Native Americans to control their \nland.\n  The cost of building such fences is into the hundreds of millions of \ndollars, and still won't stop illegal immigration. Immigrants who can \nfind jobs in the U.S. and have no legal visas to\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nenter will simply go around these walls. What we need are safe and \nlegal avenues for immigrants to come here and work, not more walls.\n  The REAL ID driver's license provisions don't make us safer either. \nThe Intelligence Reform Act sets up a process for States and the \nFederal Government to work together to establish Federal standards for \ndriver's licenses and identification cards, and progress is being made \nto implement these important measures. The REAL ID bill would repeal \nthe driver's license provisions and replace them with highly \nproblematic and burdensome requirements. According to the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the REAL ID prescribes ``unworkable, \nunproven, costly mandates that compel States to enforce federal \nimmigration policy rather than advance the paramount objective of \nmaking State-issued identity documents more secure and verifiable.''\n  The bill does nothing to address the threat of terrorists or to \naddress legitimate security concerns. It would not have prevented a \nsingle 9/11 hijacker from obtaining a driver's license, or a single \nterrorist from boarding a plane. All 13 hijackers could have obtained \nlicenses or IDs under this proposal, and foreign terrorists can always \nuse their passports to travel.\n  The REAL ID bill contains other broad and sweeping changes to laws \nthat go to the core of our national identity. If enacted, it would deny \njudicial review and due process which could result in devastating \nconsequences for immigrants and refugees.\n  By restricting judicial review and habeas corpus, it could force \npeople to be deported before they can challenge basic errors made in \ntheir cases. It would deny the constitutionally protected writ of \nhabeas corpus, which has not been changed since the Civil War. Habeas \ncorpus is a fundamental principle of American justice. It's called the \n``great writ'' for a reason--because it's brought justice to people \nwrongly detained.\n  Just as absurd, the bill will outsource law enforcement by giving \n``bounty hunters'' unprecedented authority to apprehend and detain \nimmigrants, even if a bond has not been breached. Bonding agents would \nbe given the discretion and decision-making power that belongs to \njudges who have the necessary legal training to make these \ndeterminations.\n  A major additional problem in the REAL ID bill is that it could \nresult in the deportation even of long-time legal permanent residents, \nfor lawful speech or associations that occurred twenty years ago or \nmore. It raises the burden of proof to nearly impossible levels in \nnumerous cases.\n  A person who made a donation to a humanitarian organization involved \nin Tsunami relief could be deported if the organization or any of its \naffiliates was ever involved in violence. The burden would be on the \ndonor to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he knew nothing \nabout any of these activities. The spouse and children of a legal \npermanent resident could also be deported too based on such an \naccusation, because of their relationship to the donor.\n  The provision could be applied retroactively, so that a permanent \nresident who had once supported the lawful, nonviolent work of the \nAfrican National Congress in South Africa, Sinn Fein in Northern \nIreland, the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, or the contras in \nNicaragua would be deportable. It would be no defense to show that the \nonly support was for lawful nonviolent activity. It would be no defense \nto show that the United States itself supported some of these groups.\n  More than 600 organizations across the political spectrum oppose this \nlegislation. A broad coalition of religious, immigrant, human rights, \nand civil liberties groups have expressed their own strong opposition. \nAlso opposing the bill are the National Governors Association, the \nAmerican Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, and the National \nConference of State Legislators, and a 9/11 family group, the September \n11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows.\n  In these difficult times for our country, we know that the threat of \nterrorism has not ended, and we must do all we can to enact genuine \nmeasures to stop terrorists before they act, and to see that law \nenforcement officials have the full support they need. The REAL ID bill \nwill not improve these efforts. It will not make us safer or prevent \nterrorism and it is an invitation to gross abuses.\n  It is a false solution to national and border security. I urge the \nSenate to oppose the REAL ID bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are many Members on both sides of the \naisle with strong objections to the REAL ID Act, which the House \nincluded in its version of the emergency supplemental and which Senator \nIsakson has offered as an amendment. I oppose the REAL ID Act because I \nvalue our Nation's historic commitment to asylum, and do not want to \nsee severe restrictions placed on the ability of asylum seekers to \nobtain refuge here. I oppose it because I value States rights, and side \nwith the National Governors Association, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, and the Council of State Governments in objecting \nto the imposition of unworkable Federal mandates on State drivers \nlicense policies. And I oppose the REAL ID Act because I support \nenvironmental protection and the rule of law, both of which the act \nwould subvert by requiring the DHS Secretary to waive all laws, \nenvironmental or otherwise, that may get in the way of the construction \nof border fences or barriers, and by forbidding judicial review of the \nSecretary's actions.\n  Although I oppose the REAL ID Act, I respect Senator Isakson's desire \nto debate it in the Senate. The Senate should have a debate and vote on \nhis amendment, and state clearly where we stand. I fear that if we do \nnot, the Senate's silence will be treated as acquiescence by the \nRepublican conferees from both Chambers. As a result, we will see this \nhighly objectionable legislation included in an unamendable conference \nreport. Such a backdoor approach may be the preferred course of action \nfor the Senate's Republican leadership, but it is no way for us to \nconduct our business.\n  In addition to my substantive objections to the Isakson amendment, I \noppose it because it would deprive the Judiciary Committee of the \nopportunity to consider and review these wide-ranging provisions. If \nthe majority party believes this is good legislation, it should \nschedule committee consideration and move it through the regular order.\n  The majority leader has indicated in recent weeks that the Senate \nwill be considering immigration reform this year. The provisions in the \nREAL ID Act should be considered at that time and in conjunction with a \nbroader debate about immigration. We should consider the Isakson \namendment and we should vote it down.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nHouse legislation known as the REAL ID Act and to urge that it not be \nincluded in the conference report for this spending bill. Last year \nCongress enacted comprehensive antiterrorism legislation, the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which implemented the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Some of the most important \nprovisions we enacted strengthen our borders against terrorist \ninfiltration and provide the government with new weapons in tracking \nterrorist travel around the globe. The act also requires minimum \nFederal standards to ensure that State-issued drivers' licenses are \nalways secure and reliable forms of identification.\n  The REAL ID Act would repeal much of our work from last year, and \nreplace it with provisions that impose on State governments unworkable \nstandards for drivers' licenses. The REAL ID Act also includes punitive \nimmigration provisions that we rejected last year, and that have no \nplace on an emergency spending bill. Do not be fooled. Our nation is \nsafer if we implement the protections we passed just last December. We \nmust not allow an ideological debate over immigration policy to derail \ninitiatives vital to the war against terrorism.\n  Last year I was privileged to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and in both Chambers to develop antiterrorism and \nintelligence reform legislation of which we can all be proud. Among \nother things, the Intelligence Reform Act called for large increases in \nthe numbers of Border Patrol agents, immigration enforcement agents, \nand detention beds. It strengthened consular procedures for screening\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\nvisa applicants. It closed a gaping vulnerability by requiring people \nentering the United States at our land borders to show a passport. And \nit required minimum Federal standards to ensure that State-issued \ndrivers' licenses are always secure and reliable forms of \nidentification.\n  At the same time, I joined with my fellow conferees to ensure that \nthe intelligence reform bill focused on genuine antiterrorism measures \nand excluded extraneous measures. In particular, in conference we \nrejected a number of antiasylum and anti-immigration provisions. The \nREAL ID Act simply recycles several of the controversial immigration \nprovisions which we rejected last year. When the REAL ID Act was \ndebated on the House floor this year many of its supporters claimed \nthat these provisions had been recommended by the 9/11 Commission, and \nare essential to the war on terrorism. That is simply not the case.\n  Last October, the 9/11 Commissioners made clear that the immigration \nprovisions in the House bill were irrelevant to fighting terrorism. I \nwould like to quote from a letter the conferees received from Gov. \nThomas Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton, a letter that reflected the \nunanimous view of the commissioners. Referring to the House provisions \non immigration, they said, ``We believe strongly that this bill is not \nthe right occasion for tackling controversial immigration and law \nenforcement issues that go well beyond the Commission's \nrecommendations. We note in this regard that some of these provisions \nhave been advocated in response to Commission recommendations. They are \nnot Commission recommendations.'' The commissioners then added, ``We \nbelieve we are better off with broad bipartisan agreement on key \nrecommendations of the Commission in support of border security than \ntaking up a number of controversial provisions that are more central to \nthe question of immigration policy than they are to the question of \ncounterterrorism.''\n  As the commissioners made clear, the provisions in the REAL ID Act \nhave more to do with immigration than with national security. These are \ncontroversial provisions that need to be fully considered by our \nJudiciary Committee. The legislation would make it harder for refugees \nfleeing oppressive regimes to get asylum. That provision does not \ntarget terrorists because current law already states that no member of \na terrorist organization can be eligible for asylum. The REAL ID Act \nwould suspend habeas corpus review in deportation proceedings. Not \nsince the Civil War has habeas corpus been suspended. The House bill \nwould allow the Department of Homeland Security to waive all laws so \nthat fences and barriers can be built on any of our land borders. There \nis no limitation as to what laws can be waived environmental laws, \nlabor laws, laws allowing property owners to be compensated for the \nconfiscation of their land. These provisions have serious negative \nconsequences and should be more carefully considered. I do not believe \nthey could ever be enacted if they were carefully considered with our \nnormal procedures.\n  I would also like to address the provisions in the REAL ID Act that \nwould establish new Federal standards for drivers' licenses. My \ncolleagues no doubt remember that just last December Congress enacted \nstandards for drivers' licenses, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission, \nto ensure drivers' licenses are secure and identities are verified. The \nstandards are now being implemented through a rulemaking, in which \nstate governments are given a seat at the table to share their \nexpertise. These legislative standards were a great accomplishment, a \nresult of fine work done by Senators McCain, Durbin, Collins, \nAlexander, and other colleagues. Last year the administration declared \nthat the Senate's provisions were preferable to those drafted by the \nHouse, and the 9/11 Commission endorsed them.\n  The REAL ID Act would repeal the work Congress did last year. It \nwould replace our provisions with much more rigid provisions from last \nyear's House bill. The provisions are so unrealistic that States could \nnot implement them. All Americans applying for drivers' licenses would \nhave to wait for weeks while State DMVs tried to confirm the \nauthenticity of paper birth certificates and other records, records \nfiled away at county offices across the country. State governments \nwould have no opportunity to provide input for the regulations, as they \nhave under current law.\n  That is why the State government organizations think the REAL ID Act \nis a terrible idea. The National Governors' Association, the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, and \nthe American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators have all \nannounced their strong opposition to the REAL ID Act. The organizations \nhave written to congressional leadership that the REAL ID Act would \nimpose requirements on state governments which, ``are beyond the \ncurrent capacity of even the federal government.'' The State government \ngroups have asked that the law we passed last December be given a \nchance to work. I ask unanimous consent that a joint letter from these \nfour organizations be printed in the Congressional Record following the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, when the State governments of our \nNation say that these drivers' license provisions are unworkable, we \nneed to take notice. State governments have been issuing drivers' \nlicenses for decades. They are the experts, and we will need their \ninput and coordination if we are going to implement the drivers' \nlicense standards recommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the REAL ID Act. We must ask our \nSenate conferees not to allow such a controversial measure to be pushed \nthrough Congress on an emergency spending bill. The REAL ID Act \ncontradicts our historic identity as a nation that provides a haven for \nthe oppressed. The REAL ID Act would not make us safer. It would make \nus less safe. It would repeal provisions enacting a central \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission, and it would undermine a vital \ncounterterrorism initiative.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 17, 2005.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: We write to express \n     our opposition to Title II of H.R. 418, the ``Improved \n     Security For Driver's Licenses and Personal Identification \n     Cards'' provision, which has been attached to H.R. 1268, the \n     fiscal year 2005 supplemental spending measure. While \n     Governors, state legislatures, other state elected officials \n     and motor vehicle administrators share your concern for \n     increasing the security and integrity of the driver's license \n     and state identification processes, we firmly believe that \n     the driver's license and ID card provisions of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     offer the best course for meeting those goals.\n       The ``Driver's Licenses and Personal Identification Cards'' \n     provision in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 provides a \n     workable framework for developing meaningful standards to \n     increase reliability and security of driver's licenses and ID \n     cards. This framework calls for input from state elected \n     officials and motor vehicle administrators in the regulatory \n     process, protects state eligibility criteria, and retains the \n     flexibility necessary to incorporate best practices from \n     around the states. We have begun to work with the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation to develop the minimum \n     standards, which must be completed in 18 months pursuant to \n     the Intelligence Reform Act.\n       We commend the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     for their commitment to driver's license integrity; however, \n     H.R. 418 would impose technological standards and \n     verification procedures on states, many of which are beyond \n     the current capacity of even the federal government. \n     Moreover, the cost of implementing such standards and \n     verification procedures for the 220 million driver's licenses \n     issued by states represents a massive unfunded federal \n     mandate.\n       Our states have made great strides since the September 11, \n     2001 terrorists attacks to enhance the security processes and \n     requirements for receiving a valid driver's license and ID \n     card. The framework in the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 \n     will allow us to work cooperatively with the federal \n     government to develop and implement achievable standards to \n     prevent document fraud and other illegal activity related to \n     the issuance of driver's licenses and ID cards.\n       We urge you to allow the provisions in the Intelligence \n     Reform Act of 2004 to work. Governors, state legislators, \n     other state elected officials and motor vehicle \n     administrators are committed to this process because it will \n     allow us to develop mutually\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\n     agreed-upon standards that can truly help create a more \n     secure America.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raymond C.

The Secretary of Labor shall convey to the State \n     of Michigan, for no consideration, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the real property \n     known as the ``Detroit Labor Building'' and located at 7310 \n     Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan, to the extent the right, \n     title, or interest was acquired through a grant to the State \n     of Michigan under title III of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 501 et seq.) or the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et \n     seq.) or using funds distributed to the State of Michigan \n     under section 903 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1103).\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, may I enquire of the Senator from Michigan \nwhat his amendment seeks to accomplish?\n  Mr. LEVIN. My amendment will release the 55-percent equity position \nof the Department of Labor in the State-owned Detroit Labor Building in \nanticipation of its sale.\n  Mr. ENZI. It is my understanding that the equity the Department of \nLabor has acquired is attributable to Federal grants extended to the \nState and used for leasehold improvements over the last 50 years. These \ngrants were provided under the auspices of Federal jobs programs \nincluding job training and unemployment compensation. Before consenting \nto this amendment, I seek assurance that the portion of the sale \nproceeds in question be used solely for job training purposes by the \nState of Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have been assured by the Office of the Governor of \nMichigan that should my amendment be accepted, the entirety of the 55 \npercent of the proceeds from the sale of the building that would have \notherwise been remitted to the Federal Government will instead be used \nby the State of Michigan to provide job training grants.\n  Mr. ENZI. With that assurance, I do not object to this amendment. I \nthank the Senator from Michigan for addressing my concerns.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand this amendment has been \ncleared on both sides. I know it has been cleared by Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 563) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Mississippi for \nhis understanding of this matter. I know it held up the Senate for a \nfew minutes. I greatly appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 537\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 537.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, today I will deliver my third speech in 2 \nweeks on the issue of China's increasing global influence. In these \npast speeches I addressed alarming trends such as China's proliferation \nproblem, the distressing potential that the EU may drop their Arms \nembargo, and other events that have obvious impact on our national \nsecurity.\n  In 2000, Congress established the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and \nSecurity Review Commission to collect and provide Congress with \nauthoritative information on how our relationship with China affects \nour economy and industrial base, the impact of China's military and \nweapons proliferation on our security, and the status of our national \ninterests in Asia. I fear that the Commission's findings have largely \nbeen ignored. I will continue to draw America's attention to the issue \nuntil we address it.\n  As China becomes increasingly interdependent with its Asian \nneighbors, it is presenting its economic rise as a win-win situation \nfor its trade and investment partners. According to political economist \nFrancis Fukuyama:\n\n       Over the long run, [China] wants to organize East Asia in a \n     way that puts them in the center of regional politics.\n\n  The implications of this are disturbing. As the 2004 Commission \nreport points out:\n\n     . . . the United States' influence and vital long-term \n     interests in Asia are being challenged by China's robust \n     regional economic engagement and diplomacy, and that greater \n     attention must be paid to U.S. relations in the region.\n\n  The Commission recommends that the U.S. increase visibility in Asia \nthrough initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to regional \nsecurity. One avenue for this is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \nforum--APEC.\n  A careful look will show that China's regional outreach is at best \ninconsistent. It certainly has not offered win-win benefits to Taiwan \nor Hong Kong. As the tense situation in Taiwan continues to simmer, \nChina's ongoing intimidation of this country seems to undermine the \nrosy picture they are trying to paint. A few weeks ago the Chinese \nCommunist Party formalized a new stance on Taiwan. This is a total \ndiversion from their old policy. The\n\n[[Page S4008]]\n\nfollowing was approved by the National Peoples Congress:\n\n       If possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be \n     completely exhausted, the state shall employ nonpeaceful \n     means and other necessary measure to protect China's \n     sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\n  This represents a change from earlier ambiguous language that would \nhave allowed China flexibility to consider other options should \nconflict arise. As it is, China has taken away its own alternatives.\n  China has also backed itself into a troubling situation with its \nskyrocketing demand for oil; since my floor speeches in 1999 its oil \nimports have doubled, and last year alone surged upwards of 57 percent. \nSome analysts project China's oil needs will double again by 2010 and \nit will use up its reserves within 14 years. China's alarming need for \noil has caused it to look around the world for new sources, sources \nthat are often problematic states with security concerns for the United \nStates.\n  In Venezuela, anti-American President Hugo Chavez announced a $3 \nbillion trade strategy with China, including provisions for oil and \ngas. This came on the heels of his statement, ``We have invaded the \nUnited States, [not with guns] but with our oil.''\n  Beijing recently signed a $70 billion oil/gas deal with Iran, from \nwhom it receives 11 percent of its oil imports. Naturally, China has \ncome out firmly against the U.N. Security Council holding Iran \neconomically accountable for its nuclear program.\n  Likewise, in Sudan, China seeks to defuse or delay any U.N. sanctions \nagainst Khartoum. It hardly seems coincidence that 4 percent of its oil \nimports come from that conflict stricken country, a supply that China \nseems ready to protect at all costs.\n  Keep in mind we are talking about the same area in northern Uganda \nand southern Sudan where they have the terrorist attacks that have \nconsistently gone out, where they abduct these young children, train \nthem to be soldiers, instruct them to kill their parents, and if they \ndo not do it, they cut their arms off, their lips off, and their ears \noff. That makes no difference to China. If it means 4 percent of its \noil imports potential in the future, they are willing to do it.\n  The United States and the European Union have sanctioned Zimbabwe, \nhoping to pressure its corrupt regime into reforms. China, on the other \nhand, has boosted aid and investment, working to blunt the sanctions.\n  The sources China has used to meet its oil needs and increase its \nworld standing are clearly questionable. The Commission makes an \nunpopular but straightforward observation:\n\n     . . . [China's] pursuit of oil diplomacy may support \n     objectives beyond just energy supply. Beijing's bilateral \n     arrangements with oil-rich Middle Eastern states also helped \n     create diplomatic and strategic alliances with countries that \n     were hostile to the United States. For example, with U.S. \n     interests precluded from entering Iran, China may hope to \n     achieve a long-term competitive advantage relative to the \n     United States. Over time, Beijing's relationship-building may \n     counter U.S. power and enhance Beijing's ability to influence \n     political and military outcomes. One of Beijing's stated \n     goals is to reduce what it considers U.S. superpower \n     dominance in favor of a multipolar global power structure in \n     which China attains superpower status on par with the United \n     States.\n\n  And while the search for energy is not yet a zero-sum game, the way \nthe U.S. and China acquire oil is strikingly different. James Caverly, \nof the U.S. Department of Energy states, ``The U.S. strategic framework \nmakes certain that plenty of oil is available in the world market so \nthat the price will remain low and the economy will benefit.'' China, \nin contrast, seeks to ``gain control of the oil at the source. \nGeopolitically, this could soon bring the United States and Chinese \nenergy interests into conflict.'' I have a chart that shows the \ncountries that China has been buying oil from. This is the most up-to \ndate information available. What I would like to point out is how China \nis using whatever leverage it can to find new energy sources, \nparticularly in Africa. If you add up these amounts, China is acquiring \nabout one third of its oil from African countries like Angola, Sudan, \nCongo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Libya. Other countries China has \nbegun seeking oil from are Algeria, Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, and Guinea.\n  I have had occasion to go there. And any of these countries that you \ngo to, you see that China is giving them everything they want.\n  I have been traveling to Africa for many years. I just got back from \na trip through Tanzania, Ethiopia and Uganda. Chinese influence is \neverywhere. I see conference centers and sports stadiums being \nconstructed, donated by the Chinese. China has been expanding its \ninfluence throughout Africa with projects like this. The one thing I \nkeep hearing is, ``The U.S. tells you what you need, but China gives \nyou what you want.'' Has China suddenly become compassionate and \ngenerous? No. One thing consistent with all of these countries where \nthey are building these stadiums, sports complexes, and arenas, if you \ngo to them, is they are places that the Chinese are depending on for \ntheir oil in the future. I think the fact these countries have large \noil and mineral deposits is the reason for their generosity.\n\n  Last year, China spent nearly $10 billion on African oil. As I said, \nthis is nearly one third of its total crude oil imports. To gain access \nto these resources, China shows no qualms about catering to some of the \nworst governments. The fact is that China is ignoring western sanctions \nand redrawing the usual geopolitical map to help it level whatever \nadvantages the U.S. may have.\n  The U.S.-China Comission--again, talking about the Commission that \nspent 4 years looking at this--has been doing an outstanding job in \ntranslating how recent these events affect our national security. Their \nobservations in the 2004 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission report demand our attention.\n  The Commission outlines how China's energy search has both economic \nand security concerns for the United States:\n\n       China's rising energy demand has put added pressure on \n     global petroleum supplies and prices. Indeed, the recent \n     escalation in gasoline prices in the United States has been \n     attributed, in part, to the impact of China's growing \n     pressure on world oil supplies and the absence of any \n     mechanism in place to counter this pressure and maintain \n     stable prices for consumers . . . China's growing energy \n     needs, linked to its rapidly expanding economy, are creating \n     economic and security concerns for the United States. China's \n     energy security policies are driving it into bilateral \n     arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to stabilize \n     oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may involve \n     dangerous weapons transfers.\n\n  I plan on giving another speech highlighting the significance of \nthese illegal weapons transfers, followed by a resolution to effect the \nCommission's recommendations. This is a critical issue and will become \na greater threat as we continue to ignore it; I hope America is \nlistening.\n  I would like to say it goes far beyond that. When you have people \nlike Chavez making statements that they would defeat America not with \nguns but with the economy, or with oil, we have a very serious problem.\n  I was disturbed over the last few years with not just the nuclear \ncapabilities that China has and is trading with other countries, such \nas North Korea and Iran, but also with their conventional weapons. It \ntook a lot of courage back in 1998 for General John Jumper to stand up \nand say publicly that now the Russians have a better strike vehicle \nthan we have in the United States--better than our F-15s and F-16s, \nspeaking of the SU-30 and SU-31 series. Yet China purchased about 240 \nof these vehicles. It is not just their nuclear and economic capability \nin trading with countries that are potentially dangerous to the United \nStates but also their nuclear and conventional base.\n  I will look forward to delivering a floor speech on China.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4008-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Madam President, I rise to talk about the overdue need for \na long-term domestic energy plan, one\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\nthat reflects the needs of a 21st century economy that will depend on a \nreliable, modernized electric grid.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced bipartisan, \ncomprehensive energy legislation in each of the three previous \nCongresses and, as a member of that body's Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, examined and investigated the energy crisis in California \nand the massive blackouts in the Northeast two summers ago.\n  Out of these two fiascoes emerged a common theme: Without an \naggressive rehabilitation and modernization of this Nation's \ntransmission grid, we are bound for more brownouts, blackouts, and \nforced outages, and an inability to deal with the capacity needs of an \neconomy that grows in the future.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced, along with Senators Landrieu and \nLott, S. 498, the Interstate Transmission Act, which addresses the \nfundamental elements necessary for a successful electricity policy. The \nbill sets out to achieve three goals:\n  No. 1, to ensure reliability;\n  No. 2, to modernize the transmission grid;\n  No. 3, to reaffirm the role of State and Federal regulators.\n  In this year's State of the Union Address, President Bush challenged \nthe Congress to pass an energy bill that modernizes the electricity \ngrid. S. 498 achieves exactly that goal. How do we do it?\n  No. 1, mandatory reliability standards. The Interstate Transmission \nAct makes a mandatory set of reliability standards for the electric \ngrid. Currently, the North American Electric Reliability Council, or, \nas we call it, NERC, has standards and guidelines and criteria for \nassuring the transmission of electricity through the system is secure \nand reliable. However, compliance with the standards of NERC is \nvoluntary. It is not subject to any Government oversight.\n  The standards in our bill are the product of consensus and \ncooperation, and the language is identical to the reliability language \nfrom the energy conference report that received 58 votes in the Senate.\n  In its 2004 report on the U.S.-Canadian blackout of 2003, the \nbilateral committee tasked with investigating the blackout made as its \nNo. 1 recommendation that Congress enact mandatory reliability \nstandards.\n  Without mandatory rules on the books for reliability standards, we \nwill continue to leave our grid and our country vulnerable to another \nmassive blackout like the one the Northeast experienced.\n  No. 2, we need to attract new investment in transmission. While \ninvestment in the generation sector of electricity has resulted in the \nconstruction of new powerplants, these gains in supply are negated by a \nsubstandard electric transmission grid. It is estimated that the \ntransmission investment over the past 25 years has declined at a rate \nof $115 million per year.\n  Additional research further indicates that there needs to be an \ninvestment of at least $56 billion in the transmission sector to \nupgrade existing lines and add additional capacity in order to meet \nexisting peak electricity demands over the course of the next decade. \nIt is currently projected, however, that the industry will only spend \nan average of $3 billion each year during the decade on upgrades and \nnew transmission lines.\n  Wall Street is not promoting the transmission sector as a worthy \ninvestment. Why? Because it is not particularly profitable to invest in \ntransmission today because it takes over 30 years to realize gains on \ntransmission investments. Even with the good news we continue to hear \nabout the economy, people can invest in other places and realize \ngreater profits and quicker returns on their investment. Thus \nregulators must implement policies that ensure quicker, more attractive \nreturns on investment in transmission.\n  The legislation I have introduced allows FERC to adopt transmission \nrules to promote capital investment in the system, improve operation of \nthe system, and allow for returns to investors reflecting financial, \noperational, and other risks inherent in transmission investments.\n  Let me give you a great example of how innovative capital investments \ncan spur the upgrade of the grid. It is estimated that electricity \nconsumption in the West has grown 60 percent in the last 20 years. Yet \ntransmission capacity has only grown 20 percent.\n  Last week, the Governors of California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming \nunveiled the ``Frontier Line Project,'' a series of new transmission \nlines spanning 1,300 miles from Wyoming to California. Knowing of how \nfast southern California and Nevada are growing, it would seem that as \nan investor, one would naturally be drawn to providing capital to build \nout this project. Yet these Governors are relying on State money and \nmatching funds from DOE to make up the $2 billion it will cost to have \nthe lines up and running by 2011. Granted the utility customers \nreceiving the power will pay back the States for the project, but is \nthe rate of return on what looks like such a needed project so low that \nwe have to ask cash-strapped States to put money upfront to pay for \nthese lines?\n  Mr. President, I sense the need to conclude. I believe my colleagues \nunderstand just how severe the challenge and the threat is to this \ncountry. We have to address these three things. We have to have a \nvibrant transmission grid. The Interstate Transmission Act will \naccomplish all these goals.\n  In the State of the Union Address, the President made it clear that 4 \nyears of debate is enough; Congress needs to pass legislation that \nmakes America more secure and less dependent upon foreign energy. I \nagree with the President that 4 years is enough. A fundamental, sound \neconomy is only as stable as a fundamental, sound energy policy. I urge \nmy colleagues to support S. 498. Let's get back on track and be \nprepared for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4009-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL PARKS WEEK\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, one of the things that all of us enjoy a \ngreat deal and are very proud of are our national parks. I call \nattention to this week, which is National Parks week, April 18 to 24. \nIt is the time when we can recognize all of those wonderful places that \nhave been set aside. We will have a number of events take place this \nweek to commemorate our national parks.\n  Famed western author Wallace Stegner once said:\n\n       National parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely \n     American, absolutely democratic--they reflect us at our best \n     rather than our worst.\n\n  Our uniquely American idea began with the creation of Yellowstone \nPark, the world's first national park, in 1872. I am very proud to say \nthat this park is in Wyoming, my home State. As a matter of fact, I \ngrew up 25 miles out of the gates of Yellowstone Park, and I certainly \nbelieve it is one of the great parks we have.\n  Since that time, of course, we have adopted more. We have exported \nand adopted worldwide this idea of parks, something of which we can be \nvery proud. America's gift to the world is the theme of our National \nParks Week this year, a very fitting theme.\n  Each year, more than 260 million people from all over the world visit \nour 388 national park units in our national park system. Collectively, \nof course, these sites reflect our heritage. We have an amazing array \nof resources, whether it is Teton Park, the Everglades of Florida, or \nAlaska, and the Service includes natural resources, cultural resources, \nhistoric sites commemorating events, significant people and places in \nour history, and memorials to fallen defenders of our Nation. Visitors \nto the parks enjoy these through the services provided by employees \nand, increasingly, the park volunteers and partners. I am amazed at the \nnumber of people who volunteer to not only show people around the parks \nbut to do much of the work there.\n  I recognize and thank these employees, these volunteers, the partners \nwho work in organizations that support the foundations of our parks. I \ncertainly suggest to all of you that you give some thought this week to \nour national parks.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee, I will work to continue to \nassure the national parks meet the standard of our world today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4009-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4009-S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR JIM JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with sadness and appreciation I come \nto the floor today to speak about the announcement my colleague from\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\nVermont, Senator Jeffords, just made this afternoon in Burlington. He \nannounced he will retire from the Senate at the end of his current \nterm.\n  Not surprisingly, Senator Jeffords went back to his native State, our \nnative State, of Vermont to make the announcement. When I called him \nthis morning to talk with him, I said, ``Jim, how are you doing?'' He \nsaid, ``The air is so clear and so nice here in Vermont.'' He was \nspeaking about the fact, of course, that he felt so much at peace. I \nknow that is the case because Jim and I have known each other and we \nhave worked with each other since the days, long ago, when he was the \nattorney general of Vermont and I was prosecuting criminals as State's \nAttorney of Chittenden County.\n  Our wives, Liz Jeffords and Marcelle Leahy, knew each other even \nbefore that from their high school days in Burlington. When Jim and I \nspeak of our wives, we have to admit, we both married way above \nourselves. We both chose extremely well. Our thoughts and thanks today \nare also with Liz and their children, Leonard and Laura.\n  Jim Jeffords is beloved by the people of Vermont, as well as by \nmillions of Americans nationwide who have come to know him through the \ncourage and independence he showed in making the difficult decision to \nbecome an Independent. Since then, Jim has had a national following. He \nhas never had more public support and popularity in Vermont than he \ndoes today.\n  Though many Americans outside of Vermont only came to know of his \nindependence in recent years, the truth is that, throughout his public \nservice, Jim Jeffords has shown that same streak of Vermont \nindependence. It is deep, it is wide, and it is genuine--from his days \nas a State senator from Rutland County, to being Attorney General, to \nbeing a Member of the House of Representatives, to being a Senator.\n  Jim has ably continued the Vermont legacy of national leadership on \nthe environment in the tradition of Senator Bob Stafford of Vermont, \nfrom Jim's early days in the other body, to his chairmanship and now \nbeing ranking member in the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nthis body.\n  Vermonters, no matter what their political affiliation, are good \nstewards of the gorgeous land that surrounds us. With our pristine \nmountains and lush valleys, we have sometimes said we have air so clean \nit has never been breathed. That is the air Jim Jeffords was enjoying \nthis morning in Vermont.\n  So we consider the pollution that creeps across our borders from \ndirty powerplants upwind of our State to be an offense not only against \nour health but against the natural environment we want to enjoy and \npass on to our children and grandchildren. Jim Jeffords has been a \nstalwart national leader in that fight.\n  Jim Jeffords also feels passionately about improving education in \nAmerica and his imprint can be found on innumerable laws and \ninitiatives over the years in pursuit of that goal.\n  Children with disabilities, they especially have had a champion in \nSenator Jeffords.\n  Senator Jeffords of Vermont and I have also been partners in \ndefending the hard-working dairy farmers of our States and--I might \nsay--of a lot of other States. Vermonters and I will miss the seniority \nthat he has gained in this body, which has been put to so many good \npurposes not only for our States but for our Nation.\n  When the time comes for him to carve his initials in his desk and \nretire from the Senate, Jim Jeffords will leave with a legacy of \nprincipled public service of which he and Vermonters can be proud.\n  I know that, for the Senator from Vermont, nothing compares to the \nscarce and precious days he has been able to spend on his farm in \nShrewsbury. We are both native Vermonters and we feel that tug of the \nland. Our colleagues may remember the time years ago when he broke his \nleg doing farm chores.\n  He was doing them instead of hiring somebody else because it felt \ngood. He believed it brought him closer to his native State. Down the \nroad I am sure that my good friend looks forward to a time when those \nprecious days at home will be a little less scarce.\n  So with fondness and with appreciation, I will conclude with a phrase \nthat was often heard from Vermonters, even seen on bumper stickers \nduring his last reelection campaign: Thanks, Jim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee would allow me to say a few words prior to getting back on \nthe important legislation before us, Jim Jeffords, above all else, is a \ngentleman. I am so sorry he is not going to be running for reelection. \nThe people of Vermont would have elected him again, as they have on so \nmany occasions.\n  The reason I mentioned what a gentleman he is, as everyone knows, he \nmade a very important decision a few years ago that changed the balance \nof power in the Senate. I can remember his telling me of the difficulty \nof the decision he made, not because of what he wanted to do--he knew \nit was the right thing--but how it affected his friends with whom he \nhad served for so long. He mentioned specifically Senator Warner.\n  I know the decision he has made today was a difficult one for him, as \nit was when he switched the balance of power in the Senate and in the \ncountry. I am sure he believes, as he indicated to me last night in a \nprivate meeting I had with him, he is making the right decision, but he \nhates to let down his friends. I want everyone to know within the sound \nof my voice that Jim Jeffords has not let us down. He is going to \nfinish this term with dignity.\n  Jim Jeffords is an interesting man. I don't know of a recent Senator \nor House Member who could walk into a restaurant in Washington and \nother places in the country and people would stand and clap for him, \ngive him a cheer. He is a man who is revered and loved around the \ncountry.\n  He was so kind to me in my last reelection. I asked him if he could \nsend a fundraising letter for me. He did. It was the most successful \nfundraising event I did during my whole reelection campaign. He is \nsomebody who is so well thought of around the country.\n\n  He has done a wonderful job as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. The record now is pretty clear. This is his love. But \nto show the dignity and class of this man, that wasn't part of the deal \nin making the arrangements to become part of our caucus. That was done \nafter he had made the decision.\n  He is a fighter. I realized that when, as the chairman of the Energy \nand Water Subcommittee of Appropriations, we didn't put enough money, \nSenator Domenici and I, in that bill for alternative energy. And, \nfrankly, I didn't have a lot of seniority at the time, but it was \nenough to be chairman of that subcommittee. But Senator Domenici had a \nlot of seniority. He was a member of Senator Domenici's party, and he \ntook us both on and won. He offered an amendment on the floor of the \nSenate and opposed Reid and Domenici and Jeffords won.\n  I have great respect and admiration for him as being a person who \nbelieves a certain way, and he won't let anyone get in the way of his \nbeliefs.\n  Those people he met with before he decided to make that decision a \nnumber of years ago, to a man and to a woman because there was at least \none woman there, would acknowledge that he is their friend.\n  I will have more to say about Jim Jeffords at a later time. But I \nwant everyone to know within the sound of my voice that America is a \nbetter place because of Jim Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, not too many years ago, Senator Mike \nMansfield, a great former Senator from Montana, would have breakfast \nevery morning with Senator George Aiken of Vermont. That helped develop \na strong relationship between the two of them. It helped bridge party \ndifferences. In addition to the goodwill of Senator George Aiken of \nVermont, those daily breakfasts contributed to the collegiality in the \nSenate.\n  I like to think that there is something about Vermont, about the \npeople of Vermont, that is basic. They are down to earth. They know \ntheir roots. Their rudder is well set. They are good people, \ncommonsense people. That is why they elected George Aiken to come to \nthe Senate.\n  It must also be why they elected Jim Jeffords because Jim Jeffords is \na\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nreal person. What he says is true. He doesn't speak in long paragraphs \nor long treatises because he doesn't have to. He gets straight to the \npoint. He is a man of few words because he doesn't have to equivocate, \ndoesn't have to qualify, doesn't have to dissemble. He just gets \nstraight to the point.\n  I have found that in my relationship with that wonderful man, Jim \nJeffords. We work together on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Time and time again he turns to me, defers to me, and says: \nMax, whatever you want to do, that is fine with me.\n  I know that he is also saying: Just keep me informed of what you are \ndoing. And I do. It is a wonderful personal relationship. We know each \nother. We trust each other eminently, immediately. We don't have to ask \nquestions such as: What do you really mean? We don't question \nassumptions. We just know.\n  That is Jim Jeffords.\n  It has been said that he believes strongly in a few issues, and he \ndoes. The environment certainly is one. There are other issues in which \nmy friend from Vermont believes. If you will pardon the overworked \nphrase, one might possibly disagree with Jim, but he does so in such an \nagreeable manner that you don't know that there is really a \ndisagreement.\n  It has been said on the floor of the Senate not too long ago that it \nis hard to name a Senator who could walk into a restaurant and get the \nsame applause, stand-up applause, as Jim Jeffords has so many times \naround this country.\n  It is true, he does and he did. It is because people recognize his \nintestinal fortitude. It took a lot of courage for him to decide he \nwas, after all, an Independent and not a Republican. It was a very \ndifficult decision. But he did it. He did it on the basis of principle. \nPeople know that. They see that. They sense that, and they understand \nthat. That is why they stand and applaud Jim Jeffords. It is not just \nthe United States, it is in other cities around the world, where people \nwould stand up and applaud when the U.S. Senator from Vermont would \nwalk into the room. In his usual way, Jim would be very humble about \nit, and it would not go to his head. He would not take it seriously. \nObviously, it was not something he disagreed with, but it didn't go to \nhis head.\n  I am hard-pressed to think of any man I know who is as wonderful as \nmy good friend and colleague from Vermont. I am sad to see him retire. \nThe Senate needs more people like Senator Jeffords. I hope whoever \nreplaces him as Senator from Vermont is in the mold of Jim Jeffords.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4011-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OBSERVANCE OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the victims and \ncommemorate the 90th anniversary of the tragic Armenian Genocide, where \nover 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children were systematically \nkilled, and over 500,000 Armenians were displaced. This was the first \ngenocide of the 20th century, and one where the international community \nfailed to intervene to stop the killing.\n  We have learned a great deal since those dark days. We learned that \nthe world cannot sit on the sidelines as systematic massacres of \ninnocents take place. We learned that the rule of law must be upheld, \nand that violations of law must have consequences. And, we learned that \nthe Armenian people are a strong, proud and persevering people who \ncould not be defeated. Today, hundreds of thousands of Armenian \nAmericans live in the United States, and I am proud to represent a \nthriving Armenian-American population--3,000 strong--in Nevada.\n  But we must never forget the painful lessons learned from the \nArmenian Genocide. This week, events around my State and the Nation \nwill recognize this important anniversary. I am grateful for the strong \nand active work of the Armenian-American community in Las Vegas, who \nwill hold their annual commemoration on April 24. To the Armenian \nAmerican Cultural Society of Las Vegas and to the work of Mr. John \nDadaian, I say thank you for all that you have done for the people of \nNevada, and Armenia.\n  I am also proud of the fine work done by the University of Nevada's \nCenter of Holocaust, Genocide and Peace Studies to inform the public \nabout the horrors of the Armenian Genocide. Raising awareness and \neducating today's generations about the horrors of genocide is crucial \nfor a safer, more peaceful future. That is why I was so proud to join \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Ensign, in cosponsoring a resolution \ncommemorating the signing of the Genocide Convention.\n  The people of Armenia suffered greatly during the 20th century. We \ncannot allow genocide to occur ever again. So today I come to the \nSenate floor to honor the victims of the Armenian Genocide and pledge \nto uphold their sacrifice by standing against genocide and the \nsystematic killing of innocents wherever it may occur again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4011-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4011-S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIVE AMERICAN APOLOGY RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a joint \nresolution that seeks to address an issue that has lain unresolved for \nfar too long. That issue is our Nation's relationship with the Native \npeoples of this land.\n  Long before 1776 and the establishment of the United States of \nAmerica, this land was inhabited by numerous nations. Like our Nation, \nmany of these peoples held a strong belief in the Creator and \nmaintained a powerful spiritual connection to this land. Since the \nformation of the American Republic, there have been numerous conflicts \nbetween our Government and many of these tribes conflicts in which \nwarriors on all sides fought courageously and in which all sides \nsuffered. However, even from the earliest days of the Republic, there \nexisted a sentiment that honorable dealings and peaceful coexistence \nwere preferable to bloodshed. Indeed, our predecessors in Congress in \n1787 stated in the Northwest Ordinance, ``The utmost good faith shall \nalways be observed toward the Indians.''\n  Many treaties were made between this Republic and the American Indian \ntribes. Treaties, as my colleagues in this Chamber know, are far more \nthan words on a page. Treaties are our word, our bond. Treaties with \nother governments are not to be treated lightly. Unfortunately, too \noften the United States of America did not uphold its responsibilities \nas stated in its covenants with the Native American tribes. Too often \nour Government broke its oaths to the Native peoples.\n  I want my fellow Senators to know that the resolution I have \nintroduced this week does not dismiss the valiance of our American \nsoldiers who bravely fought for their families in wars between the \nUnited States and a number of the Indian tribes. Nor does this \nresolution cast all the blame for the various battles on one side or \nanother. What this resolution does do is recognize and honor the \nimportance of Native Americans to this land and to our Nation in the \npast and today--and offers an official apology to the Native peoples \nfor the poor and painful choices our Government sometimes made to \ndisregard its solemn word.\n  This is a resolution of apology and a resolution of reconciliation. \nIt is a first step toward healing the wounds that have divided us for \nso long--a potential foundation for a new era of positive relations \nbetween tribal governments and the Federal Government. It is time--it \nis past time--for us to heal our land of division, all divisions, and \nbring us together as one people.\n  Before reconciliation, there must be recognition and repentance. \nBefore there is a durable relationship, there must be understanding. \nThis resolution will not authorize or serve as a settlement of any \nclaim against the United States, nor will it resolve the many \nchallenges still facing Native peoples. But it does recognize the \nnegative impact of numerous deleterious Federal acts and policies on \nNative Americans and their cultures. Moreover, it begins the effort of \nreconciliation by recognizing past wrongs and repenting for them.\n  Martin Luther King, a true reconciler, once said, ``The end is \nreconciliation, the end is redemption, the end is the creation of the \nbeloved community.'' This resolution is not the end. But, perhaps it \nsignals the beginning of the end of division and the faint first light \nand first fruits of the creation of beloved community.\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\n  In the 108th Congress, I worked with the chairman and ranking member \nof the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell and Senator Inouye, \nin crafting this apology resolution. I also reached out to the Native \ntribes as this bill was being formed, and I continue to receive helpful \nand supportive feedback from them. The resolution I submitted this \nweek, S.J. Res. 15, is identical to the version that was approved \nunanimously by the Indian Affairs Committee last year. I ask that my \ncolleagues in this Chamber, and those in the House of Representatives, \njoin in support of this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4012-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 1915-1923\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this is in observance of the 90th \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide where atrocities were committed \nagainst the Armenian people of the Ottoman Empire during the First \nWorld War. In April 1915, the Ottoman government embarked upon the \nsystematic decimation of its civilian Armenian population. The Armenian \ngenocide was centrally planned and administered against the entire \nArmenian population of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian people were \nsubjected to deportation, expropriation, abduction, torture, massacre, \nand starvation. The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly \nremoved from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was \nsent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\n  Large numbers of Armenians were methodically massacred throughout the \nOttoman Empire. Women and children were abducted and horribly abused. \nAfter only a little more than a year of calm at the end of WWI, the \natrocities were renewed between 1920 and 1923, and the remaining \nArmenians were subjected to further massacres and expulsions. In 1915, \n33 years before the UN Genocide Convention was adopted, the Armenian \nGenocide was condemned by the international community as a crime \nagainst humanity.\n  In 1923, the people of the region overthrew the Ottoman government \nand established modern day Turkey. Since its establishment, the \nRepublic of Turkey has disputed the tragic suffering inflicted on the \nArmenian people during this period. Sadly, it is estimated that 1.5 \nmillion Armenians perished between 1915 and 1923.\n  Affirming the truth about the Armenian genocide has become an issue \nof international significance. The recurrence of genocide in the \ntwentieth century has made the recognition of the criminal mistreatment \nof the Armenians by Turkey all the more a compelling obligation for the \ninternational community. It is a testament to the perseverance and \ndetermination of the Armenian people that they were able to overcome \none of the most egregious acts in history. I support this important \nannual commemoration of a horrible chapter of history so that it is \nnever repeated again. Congress should continue to show support for \nArmenia and their struggle to set the historical record straight on \nthis tragedy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we solemnly remember the men and women \nwho perished in the Armenian genocide 90 years ago. A million and a \nhalf Armenians were systematically massacred at the hands of the \nOttoman Empire and more than 500,000 fled their homeland.\n  When the Armenian genocide occurred from 1915 to 1923, the \ninternational community lacked a name for such atrocities. In January \n1951, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \nGenocide entered into force to affirm the international commitment to \nprevent genocide and protect basic human decency. Today, we have the \nwords to describe this evil, and we have an obligation to prevent it. \nBut we must also have the will to act.\n  During the Holocaust, and later in the former Yugoslavia and in \nRwanda, the world has seen the crimes of ethnic cleansing and genocide \nrecur again and again. Too often, the will to stop atrocities has been \nlacking, or far too late in coming. Today, as we read report after \nreport detailing the horrific plight of the people of Darfur, Sudan, we \nmust muster the will and the sense of urgency required to save lives.\n  The international community has made the first steps, but it has a \nlong way to go in punishing and, especially, preventing genocide. As we \nmove forward, we must learn the lessons of Armenia's genocide. We \ncannot be misled by the rhetorical veils of murderous leaders, thrown \nup to disguise the agenda at hand. We cannot respond to evidence of \nmethodical, brutal violence by wringing our hands and waiting for some \ndefinitive proof that these events qualify as genocide. Enforcing a \ncollective, international commitment to prevent and stop genocides from \noccurring is imperative. We owe the victims of the Armenian genocide \nthis commitment.\n  This is why we must remember the Armenian genocide. To forget it is \nto enable more genocides and ethnic cleansing to occur. We must honor \nits victims by reaffirming our resolve to not let it happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4012-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH FAIRNESS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, of the 27 million working uninsured, 63 \npercent are working in firms with fewer than 100 employees. It is \ncrucial that we develop a comprehensive plan to remedy the problem of \nthe working uninsured. For this reason I support legislation that would \nallow for the creation of association health plans, which would allow \nsmall businesses to band together to purchase health insurance for \ntheir employees.\n  Because of the current structure of the health care industry, too \nmany small business owners and their employees do not have access to \naffordable health insurance. When I talk to small business owners as I \ntravel the State, I have found that most of them want to provide this \nbenefit because it not only helps provide the uninsured with coverage \nbut it also helps small businesses retain good employees.\n  A recent Census Bureau report says slightly more than 45 million \nAmericans now lack health coverage. While Minnesota is out front in \ntackling the issue of the uninsured, with uninsured in my State at \nabout 7 percent, I still believe that providing affordable access to \nhealth care is a critically important national interest, that there are \nno silver bullet solutions, and so we need as many tools to fix this \nproblem as possible. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, employer-\nbased health insurance has decreased markedly from covering 66 percent \nof the non-elderly in 2000 to 62 percent by 2003. The Census Bureau \nsays the drop-off in employer health coverage occurred in the small \nbusiness sector, largely in firms with fewer than 25 employees. It's no \ncoincidence that these events are taking place as the cost of insurance \ncontinues to skyrocket double-digit increases year after year, pricing \nmore and more small firms out of the market.\n  I want to thank the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, \nSenator Snowe, for her strong leadership and sponsorship of S. 406, The \nSmall Business Health Fairness Act of 2005. I also want to thank my \nvery good friend and colleague, Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, who has \nlong championed this issue in the same thoughtful and forward looking \nway that he is renowned for in tackling all important public policy \nissues in which he gets engaged. I look forward to working with members \nof the committee to enact this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4012-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4012-S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORY OF EDWARD MOSKAL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I honor the life and legacy of \nEdward J. Moskal.\n  Edward Moskal was a giant in the Polish-American community. He was \nPresident of the Polish American Congress and the Polish National \nAlliance. These are empowering organizations--rooted in heritage, \nhistory and philanthropy. Their members are humanitarians and \npatriots--dedicated to Polish history and culture, and to strengthening \nthe historic links between America and Poland. Because of Ed Moskal's \nleadership, these organizations have flourished.\n  The Polish American Congress and the Polish National Alliance were \ncreated during one of the darkest periods in Polish history. We know \nthat the history of Poland has, at times, been a melancholy one. Every \nking, kaiser, czar or comrade who ever wanted to\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\nhave a war in Europe always started by invading Poland. But we know \nthat while Poland was occupied, the heart and soul of the Polish nation \nhas never been occupied.\n  The Polish American community never abandoned Poland. We supported \nthem during the long, cold years of Soviet domination. And then in \n1980, when an obscure electrician in the Gdansk Shipyard jumped over a \nwall proclaiming the Solidarity movement, he took the Polish people and \nthe whole world with him, to bring down the Iron Curtain. Ed Moskal and \nthe Polish American community played an important role--sending \nsupplies to the strikers and their families and educating the world \nabout what was going on in Poland.\n  After the fall of the Iron Curtain, I worked with Mr. Moskal for NATO \nmembership for Poland. Mr. Moskal and the Polish American community \nhelped Poland take its rightful place as a member of the family of \ndemocratic nations. Poland is now a full, contributing member of NATO. \nOur Polish allies serve alongside Americans in Afghanistan and in Iraq.\n  Now, after so many years of foreign domination, Poland has made the \ndifficult transition to democracy and a free market. Poland is now a \nreal democracy with a vibrant market economy, as well as a reliable \nNATO ally.\n  And so, today, we in the Polish community mourn the loss of Ed \nMoskal. We send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Wanda Sadlik, and \nto his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4013-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PETER F. FLAHERTY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I rise to reflect on the \npassing of Peter F. Flaherty. On Monday, April 18, 2005, Peter Flaherty \npassed away at his home in Mount Lebanon, PA, after a battle with \ncancer. The Flaherty family has suffered a tremendous loss, and I offer \nthem my condolences and deepest sympathy during this difficult time.\n  Pete Flaherty has had incredible influence over the Pittsburgh region \nand also over his party. As a Democrat, Pete Flaherty did not always \nfollow the party line, which sometimes got him into trouble, but mostly \nmade him an effective leader.\n  Pete's roots extend back to Alpine Avenue in the north side of \nPittsburgh where he was born. He attended St. Peters, a Catholic \nelementary school, went on to Latimer Middle School, and graduated from \nAllegheny High School. His family, devout Irish Catholics, attended St. \nPeters in Pittsburgh, where Pete served as an altar boy.\n  Before attending Carlow University and Notre Dame Law School, Pete \njoined the Army Air Corps and was trained as a navigator. As the war \nwas coming to a close, Pete was shipped to a B-29 squadron in Guam.\n  It was after law school that Pete began his political career. He was \nelected to his first office as city council in 1965. It did not take \nlong for Pete to make his mark on Pittsburgh.\n  In more than 40 years of public service, Pete was three times the \nDemocratic nominee for statewide office, served as deputy U.S. attorney \ngeneral, was mayor of Pittsburgh, and was a county commissioner for 12 \nyears. His career of public service was truly remarkable.\n  Pete Flaherty not only leaves behind a legacy but also a wonderful \nfamily. My thoughts and prayers are with the Flaherty family during the \ndays and months ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4013-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               PAUL DAVIS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Paul \nDavis, who was recently awarded with the 2005 Alabama Press Association \nLifetime Achievement Award. Paul Davis has been in the newspaper \nbusiness for more than 35 years, and his career has been filled with \ncourageous accomplishments.\n  The Alabama Press Association Lifetime Achievement Award honors \noutstanding service in journalism for individuals who have spent a \nlarge percentage of their newspaper career in Alabama. Paul has been \nrecognized for standards of excellence in journalism, courage and \ncontroversy on tough issues, and a voice for those less fortunate.\n  Paul has spent most of his professional career in Alabama. From 1969 \nto 1973, he was a reporter, columnist and then associate editor at the \nTuscaloosa News, my hometown newspaper. Following his time at the \nTuscaloosa News, he moved on to serve as editor of the Selma Times \nJournal and then as vice president and general manager of the Natchez \nDemocrat in Mississippi. From 1983 to 1998, Paul served as editor, \npublisher and president of the Auburn Bulletin, the Spirit Magazine, \nand the Tuskegee News. Today, he serves as the president and publisher \nof Davis Publications of Auburn.\n  I believe that Paul is well-known for his work as a young reporter at \nthe Tuscaloosa News. Through his investigative reporting, he exposed \nthe abuse of retarded youth and adults at Partlow School and the \nhorrific treatment of patients at the state mental institution, Bryce \nHospital. He uncovered the unthinkable details about patients living in \nwards with no air-conditioning during hot Alabama summers with only one \npsychiatrist to care for some 5,000 patients. He reported that \nattendants would dispense pills every hour to keep patients sedated day \nafter day. Even worse, we learned that patients helped construct \ncaskets in the basement and buried their fellow patients in fields \nbehind the hospital, using only numbers to identify the graves. His \nwork on this issue earned him a nomination by his publisher, Buford \nBoone, for the Pulitzer Prize.\n  Paul also played an important role in the Federal case regarding the \ntreatment of mental patients. In this important case, U.S. District \nJudge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. ruled that mental patients have a \nconstitutional right to treatment. Following Judge Johnson's ruling, \nPaul was asked to serve as chairman of the Human Rights Committee at \nBryce Hospital. Indeed, his investigative work in this area helped \nreform Alabama's mental health hospitals.\n  Long before his reporting exposed the horrific conditions of the \nmental hospital in Tuscaloosa, Paul spent many days during his youth at \nPartlow School, visiting and playing games with the residents. Later in \nlife, as president of the Civitan Club in Tuscaloosa, he helped open \nthe first rehabilitation center at Partlow.\n  Paul Davis has also been an outspoken critic of the leadership at \nAuburn University. A devoted Tiger fan himself, he has written numerous \narticles about the school's board of trustees. Supporters and opponents \nalike agree that, while you may not like what he has to say, he is in-\ndepth and thorough in his reporting. He was recently honored with the \nAcademic Freedom Award from the Auburn University chapter of the \nAmerican Association of University Professors for his articles on \ngovernance issues at Auburn.\n  In addition to the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Academic \nFreedom Award, Paul has received numerous professional and civic awards \nand has twice been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Paul is a member \nof the American Political Science Association; Society of Professional \nJournalists, Sigma Delta Chi; and the National Mental Health \nAssociation. He also served as past presidents of both the Alabama \nPress Association and the Alabama Press Association Journalism \nFoundation.\n  His company, Davis Publications, publishes the Tuskegee News weekly, \nand he is a columnist for the Auburn-Opelika News. Paul and his wife \nGayle have five sons, one daughter, and thirteen grandchildren.\n  I have tremendous respect for Paul Davis and his devotion to \nuncovering the truth. He is most deserving of the Alabama Press \nAssociation Lifetime Achievement Award, and I am pleased to \ncongratulate him on this important achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4013-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4013-S4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE CAREER OF ROBERT H. MCKINNEY\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \ncareer of a distinguished civil servant and friend, Bob McKinney, who \nis retiring as chairman of First Indiana Corporation this week. His \nlong career has been filled with acts of conscientious service on \nbehalf of friends, family members, and Hoosiers. The contributions he \nmade through his work in financial services and public service have \ntouched the lives of many across the country.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n  A resident of Indianapolis, Bob is a graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy at Annapolis, the Naval Justice School, and the Indiana \nUniversity School of Law. He served his country in the Navy in the \nPacific following his graduation and again during the Korean war.\n  Bob's career has been long and illustrious. Throughout it, his \ncommitment to the public good has been remarkable. Bob retires from his \npost as the chairman of First Indiana Corporation, a publicly traded \nbank holding company, which operates First Indiana Bank, the largest \nbank based in Indianapolis. Bob was previously chairman of the Somerset \nGroup. He is also a founding partner of Bose McKinney & Evans LLP, one \nof the largest law firms in Indianapolis.\n  These posts are impressive on their own, and yet Bob also devoted \nhimself to a number of philanthropic and nonprofit organizations. Aside \nfrom his duties as the chairman of First Indiana Bank, he has served as \nthe trustee or director of the Hudson Institute, the U.S. Academy \nFoundation, the Indiana University Foundation, the Sierra Club \nFoundation, the Indianapolis Economic Club, the Indiana Chamber of \nCommerce, the Chief Executives Organizations, Inc., the World \nPresidents' Organization, and the Indianapolis Committee on Foreign \nRelations. He is also a member of the Presidential Advisory Board for \nCuba and a director of Lynx Capital Corporation, a minority investment \nfund. In honor of his service to the community, Bob was the recipient \nof a number of awards including the Indianapolis Archdiocese Spirit of \nService Award.\n  Bob's career shows his belief in the power of public policy to \nimprove people's lives. I can personally attest to Bob's talent as a \npublic servant, as I worked with him during my gubernatorial and \nsenatorial campaigns. As Governor, I frequently called on Bob to serve \nthe State of Indiana, and he was always responsive. As Senator, I was \nlucky enough to have the honor of appointing Bob to the Naval & \nMerchant Marine Academy Selection Committee.\n  His involvement in national politics dates back to 1960, and since \nthen he has chaired the Indiana campaigns of Presidential candidates \nKennedy, Muskie, Carter, and Mondale. He served under President Carter \nas Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Home Loan \nMortgage Corporation, the Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation, \nand the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.\n  Bob is a man who walks with kings but has never lost the common \ntouch. It is a rare man who can make such an impact on so many people \nover the course of a career. Bob McKinney is admired by those who know \nhim professionally and personally for his great integrity, commitment \nto serving the community, his concern for those less fortunate than \nhimself, his unswerving loyalty and dedication to his friends, family, \nand country. We will continue to recognize Bob as a loving friend and \nan incredible leader and colleague. As he retires from First Indiana, \nand leaves the corporation in his daughter's capable hands, he is \nmerely moving on to the next great challenge, which--like all of his \nwork--will undoubtedly make the world a better place.\n  I am proud to honor Bob McKinney, a truly great man, and enter his \nname in the Congressional Record on the occasion of his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4014-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING HEATHER BOLEJACK\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the \nattention of my colleagues the appointment of Heather Bolejack to the \nposition of executive director of the Indiana Criminal Justice \nInstitute, CJI. I am pleased that Governor Mitch Daniels has nominated \nher to this important position, and I am confident that she will serve \nmy home State of Indiana with distinction.\n  A product of Indianapolis, Heather graduated with high honors \nincluding being named a Fund for Hoosier Excellence Lugar Scholar, an \nhonor bestowed upon the top minority students in Indiana. Heather \nattended Butler University and graduated with a degree in Spanish and \njournalism. She then went on to earn a law degree from the Indiana \nUniversity School of Law, Indianapolis, where she received the Zazas \nAward, a full academic merit based scholarship. Heather served as \nGeneral Corporate Council for McFadden Solutions Group, a law clerk and \nassociate for Bingham McHale, and since 2004 has worked as a litigation \nassociate at Ice Miller, an Indianapolis law firm, where she \nconcentrated on practicing in the areas of drug and medical devices, as \nwell as insurance coverage. I am pleased that she is not only a member \nof the 2004-2005 Richard G.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Fair Oaks \nFarms for winning the 2005 U.S. Championship Cheese Contest. Fair Oaks \nFarms was founded in 1999 and is a large dairy operation in northwest \nIndiana committed to producing the highest quality milk and dairy \nproducts.\n  The U.S. Championship Cheese Contest included more than 1,000 entries \nfrom 25 different states. Despite such tough competition, Fair Oaks \nFarms took home first prize with Randy Krahenbuhl's 45-pound wheel of \nnutty Emmenthaler Swiss. The cheese was awarded a score of 98.55 out of \na possible 100. Randy Krahenbuhl's sweet Swiss also won honors as the \nsecond gold-medal cheese in the championship round.\n  Although nearly half of the entries for top honors were from \nWisconsin, Krahenbuhl put Indiana on the cheese map with his incredible \nquality cheeses. I come from a tradition of family farming, so I know \nfirsthand that Indiana's farmers have played a key role in Indiana's \nrich history. Our farms have long been recognized as some of the best \nin the country and this contest is yet another example of Hoosier \nfarming representing the very best of Indiana.\n  Randy Krahenbuhl presides over the dairy operation at Fair Oaks Farm, \nwhere he has the chance to design his own cheese and ice cream factory, \nand the freedom to run it as he pleases. I am pleased to congratulate \nRandy Krahenbuhl and Fair Oaks Farm on winning such an honor and \nbringing recognition to Indiana. We are proud to have him in the \nHoosier State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4014-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4014-S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to \ncommend Dakota State University in Madison, SD, for its outstanding \ncommitment to the national security of the United States through Dakota \nState University's information assurance program. The program has \ndeveloped important technologies to protect community banks from \ninformation breaches, simultaneously training its undergraduate and \ngraduate students to be leaders in this highly technical field.\n  In 2004, DSU was one of 10 universities receiving National Security \nAgency designation for this bank-focused program and DSU is the only \nNational Center of Academic Excellence in information assurance that \ntailors its information assurance curriculum to the banking industry. \nRecent security breaches by information brokers and financial \ninstitutions highlight the importance of DSU's work in this area. I \nbelieve strongly that the future of information security will include a \ncombination of careful review and oversight of laws, but also looking \nto security innovators like DSU and other institutions around the \ncountry to protect our financial information.\n  As security innovators, graduates and employees of Dakota State \nUniversity have engineered a new information technology security \ncompany called Secure Banking Solutions, SBS. With 93 banks in South \nDakota, SBS will soon be able to provide IT security to most of the \ncommunity banks in my home State, as well as to protect the personal \ninformation of the hardworking South Dakotans that bank at those \ninstitutions.\n  The Independent Community Bankers of South Dakota and I have \nencouraged the replication of the SBS model\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\nin other States. The security of banking in all of South Dakota has \nbeen greatly enhanced by the university's commitment to innovation in \nthe area of IT security, and I thank Dakota State University for its \npioneering leadership in this arena.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4015-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND T.

Mr. President, today I mourn the passing of a great \nNorth Carolinian. Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines of Winston-Salem, NC \npassed away yesterday at the age of 81. He is survived by his lovely \nwife, Clara, and by his two children, Lisa and Clarence, Jr. All of \nNorth Carolina mourns his passing and our thoughts, prayers, and \nblessings are with his family.\n  Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines was an institution in Winston-Salem, \nwhere he coached at Winston-Salem State University for 47 years. Coach \nGaines won 828 basketball games during his 47 years, fifth best of all \ntime. To understand just how successful a coach he was, Gaines won more \ngames than legends John Wooden and Phog Allen, and finished not too far \nbehind Dean Smith. Perhaps Gaines' most successful season came in 1967 \nwhen he coached the Rams to a 31-1 record and an NCAA Division II \nNational Championship.\n  His was the first predominantly black college team to win an NCAA \ntitle and he became the first black coach to be named NCAA Coach of the \nYear. He went on to win eight Central Intercollegiate Athletic \nAssociation titles and was named the CIAA's Coach of the Year five \ntimes. Coach Gaines was named to the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in \n1982. Winston-Salem State University honored Clarence Gaines by naming \nthe Athletic Department facility and the school's Hall of Fame for him.\n  It would be a mistake, however, to merely list his coaching \naccomplishments. Clarence ``Big House'' Gaines was more than a coach. \nHe was a community leader, an educator, a mentor and a father figure. \nHis most important achievement was the near 80 percent graduation rate \nof his student athletes, a legacy that all college coaches should look \nto emulate.\n  Coach Gaines taught school up to his retirement from coaching in 1993 \nand continued to involve himself in the lives of the young people at \nWinston-Salem State. His marriage and family served as an example to \nthe young people he coached. In his memoirs, published last year, \nClarence Gaines wrote that ``When these boys, most growing into old men \nthemselves, continue to call their old coach and thank him for helping \nthem get a college degree, it makes me proud to answer to the nickname \nof Big House.'' He will not be forgotten in North Carolina or in the \nhearts and memories of the many young lives he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4015-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LEXINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to the sale of land in Nevada to \n     lower the federal deficit; to the Committee on the Budget.\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 2\n\n       Whereas in 1998, Congress passed the Southern Nevada Public \n     Land Management Act, Public Law No. 105-263, which allows the \n     Bureau of Land Management to sell certain federal lands in \n     Clark County, Nevada, for possible development, which also \n     allowing for the acquisition, conservation and protection of \n     environmentally sensitive lands in the State of Nevada; and\n       Whereas at the time of the passage of the Act, and to this \n     day, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area was the fastest growing \n     urban area in the United States, and the Act was passed in \n     response to that growth in an effort to offset negative \n     environmental impact on national recreational and \n     conservation areas surrounding the Las Vegas Valley; and\n       Whereas under the provisions of the Act, 5 percent of the \n     profits from sales of the land is allocated to fund education \n     in Nevada, 10 percent is allocated for water and airport \n     infrastructure projects, and the remaining 85 percent is \n     deposited into an account to acquire other environmentally \n     sensitive land in Nevada, to develop a multispecies habitat \n     plan, to develop parks and trails and to provide for other \n     conservation initiatives; and\n       Whereas the passage of the Southern Nevada Land Management \n     Act was intended to replace lost state revenue resulting from \n     84 percent of the land in the State of Nevada being owned by \n     the Federal Government at the time of the passage of the Act, \n     uniquely depriving this State of receiving any tax proceeds \n     from a substantial majority of the land located in this \n     State; and\n       Whereas in addition to the benefits provided in Southern \n     Nevada and in other areas of the State where environmentally \n     sensitive lands have been acquired, the Lake Tahoe Basin is \n     now benefiting from a 2003 amendment to the Act which \n     allocated $300 million to be administered for the \n     preservation of the Lake Tahoe Basin, the first installment \n     of which was received in August 2004; and\n       Whereas since the first auction of land in 1999, this \n     program has generated approximately $1.6 billion, which has \n     assisted the State of Nevada in funding education and \n     numerous land and water conservation projects, and in \n     acquiring environmentally sensitive lands; and\n       Whereas in the face of a soaring federal deficit, estimated \n     at $527 billion, President Bush has proposed to change \n     federal law and reallocate 70 percent of the profits from the \n     land sales, generously approximated to reach $70 million in \n     future years, which would do little to offset the deficit; \n     and\n       Whereas the loss of such a substantial source of revenue \n     for this State would have a direct and devastating impact on \n     the State, negatively impacting dozens of ongoing and future \n     projects: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge President \n     Bush to reverse his position on this matter, abandoning his \n     proposal to divert from this State profits from the sales of \n     land in the State of Nevada that rightfully belong in this \n     State to replace lost revenue resulting from the uniquely \n     high percentage of federally owned property in this State; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress is similarly urged to reject this \n     portion of President Bush's budget proposal and to allow the \n     State of Nevada, its residents and visitors to be the sole \n     beneficiaries of the proceeds from the sales of land in \n     Nevada; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, and each member of the Nevada \n     Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-45.

and\n       Whereas the revested Oregon and California Railroad (``O & \n     C'') grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant \n     lands, which are managed predominantly by the Bureau of Land \n     Management, were once in private ownership but were returned \n     to federal ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise \n     approximately 2,600,000 acres of federal lands, all of which \n     are in Oregon; and\n       Whereas Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure \n     these lands in federal ownership, the counties across the \n     United States where these lands are situated, of which 33 \n     counties are located in Oregon, would be deprived of \n     opportunities for economic development and of tax revenues \n     they would otherwise receive if the lands were held in \n     private ownership; and\n       Whereas these same counties have expended public funds year \n     after year to provide services such as road construction and \n     maintenance, search and rescue, law enforcement, waste \n     removal and fire protection that directly benefit these \n     federal lands and the people who use these lands; and\n       Whereas to accord a measure of compensation to these \n     affected counties for the critical services they provide to \n     county residents and to visitors to these federal lands and \n     for the lost economic opportunities stemming from federal \n     ownership as compared to private ownership, Congress \n     determined that the federal government should share with \n     these counties a portion of the revenues the United States \n     receives from these federal lands; and\n       Whereas Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a \n     law that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived \n     from the National Forest System lands be paid to the states \n     for use by counties where the lands are situated for the \n     benefit of public schools and roads; and\n       Whereas Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended \n     the O & C Art (50 Stat. 874; 43 U.S.C. 1181 et seq.) that \n     requires that revenues derived from the O & C grant lands and \n     the Coos Bay Road grant lands be shared with the counties in \n     which those lands are situated and be used for a broad range \n     of essential public services as other county funds are used; \n     and\n       Whereas Oregon counties dependent on and supportive of \n     these federal lands received and relied on shared revenues \n     from these lands for many decades to provide essential \n     funding for schools, road maintenance and other critical \n     public services; and\n       Whereas in recent years, the principal source of these \n     revenues, federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed, \n     and as the volume of timber sold annually from the federal \n     lands in Oregon has decreased substantially, so too have the \n     revenues shared with the affected counties, adversely \n     affecting funding for education, road maintenance and other \n     public programs and services; and\n       Whereas in the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act of 2000, Congress recognized this trend and \n     temporarily mitigated the adverse consequences by providing \n     annual safety-net payments through 2006 to counties across \n     the United States, including all counties in Oregon that \n     traditionally shared in timber receipts from national forest \n     lands, O & C grant lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands; \n     and\n       Whereas the authority for these safety-net payments will \n     expire in 2006, and, if that occurs and thereafter revenue \n     sharing is based on actual federal timber receipts, Oregon \n     will experience a net loss of more than $230 million per year \n     in payments for schools and counties under Titles I and III \n     of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination \n     Act of 2000, with associated losses of essential programs and \n     services and thousands of jobs in both the government and \n     private sectors, and will lose an additional $26 million per \n     year that is currently spent by counties on special projects \n     under Title II of the Secure Rural Schools and Community \n     Self-Determination Act of 2000, for a total loss of more than \n     $512 million per biennium, most of which is currently spent \n     on programs and services that the state would have no ability \n     to replace; and\n       Whereas there is a need to maintain funding for education, \n     road maintenance and other public services through \n     predictable payments to the affected counties, as well as job \n     creation in those counties and other opportunities associated \n     with restoration, maintenance and stewardship of federal \n     lands available under the Secure Rural Schools and Community \n     Self-Determination Act of 2000: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of the State of \n     Oregon, That we, the members of the Seventy-third Legislative \n     Assembly, respectfully urge the Congress of the United States \n     to pass legislation that will reauthorize and extend the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of \n     2000 for an additional 10-year period through federal fiscal \n     year 2016, and that the Act be continued in its present form \n     and be funded through a mandatory, continuing appropriation; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this memorial shall be sent to the \n     President of the United States, to the Senate Majority Leader \n     and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to each \n     member of the Oregon Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-46. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming relative to the funding match for a \n     flood control feasibility study in the Bear River Basin; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                           Joint Resolution 1\n\n       Whereas the ongoing drought in the State of Wyoming and \n     surrounding states has a profound impact throughout the area, \n     including Bear River Basin. Bear Lake is the major reservoir \n     for containing floodwaters of the Bear River within the Bear \n     River Basin. The effects of drought in the Bear River Basin \n     could be significantly reduced in the event alternative \n     storage sites were available; and\n       Whereas the Bear River Basin encompasses a portion of the \n     State of Wyoming. Originating in Utah's Uintah Mountains, the \n     Bear River crosses state boundaries five times, has \n     tributaries in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, and ultimately \n     discharges into the Great Salt Lake; and\n       Whereas the Bear River did not naturally divert into Bear \n     Lake. The Utah Sugar Company and the Telluride Power Company \n     first proposed diversion of the Bear River into Bear Lake for \n     water storage in 1898. That project was taken over by Utah \n     Power and Light for the purpose of producing hydropower. The \n     project, which included a diversion dam on the Bear River, a \n     canal, and a pumping station was completed in 1918; and\n       Whereas a multi-state compact between the states of Idaho, \n     Utah and Wyoming, known as the Bear River Compact, was \n     entered into in 1958 and amended in 1980. The Compact governs \n     the operation of Bear River and, for management purposes, the \n     Compact divides the river into three segments. The three \n     segments are known as the upper division, located in Utah and \n     Wyoming, the central division, located in Wyoming and Idaho, \n     and the lower division, located in Idaho and Utah. The Bear \n     River Commission, made up of three members from each of the \n     Compact states, a Chairman appointed by the President of the \n     United States, and engineer/manager, manage the day-to-day \n     operation of the river; and\n       Whereas as a result of two lawsuits against Utah Power and \n     Light Company during the 1970s, which claimed damaged to \n     crops due to flooding along Bear River, the power company is \n     under court order to keep Bear River within its banks. Based \n     on the court order, in the event the irrigation season ends \n     with Bear Lake above five thousand nine hundred eighteen \n     (5,918) feet in elevation, water is released downstream to \n     make room in Bear Lake for the spring runoff; and\n       Whereas since the 1970s, millions of acre-feet of water \n     have been released from Bear Lake to provide capacity for \n     flood control. The most recent releases were in 1997, 1998, \n     and 1999; and\n       Whereas lowering the elevation of Bear Lake for flood \n     control potentially also impacts water users in the upper and \n     central divisions. Under the Compact, storage allocations \n     under the amended Bear River Compact located in the upper \n     division are not allowed to fill whenever the elevation of \n     Bear Lake is below five thousand nine hundred eleven (5,911) \n     feet above sea level; and\n       Whereas dredging has been necessary to provide water for \n     irrigation releases from Bear Lake due to low lake levels; \n     and\n       Whereas if alternative storage sites were available, water \n     that is usually available during the spring runoff, could be \n     stored and could prevent any flooding of the Bear River. The \n     water could then be used for irrigation, domestic and \n     commercial development and recreation. Alternative storage \n     sites would provide for the conservation, preservation and \n     best utilization of the water to which the state is entitled. \n     This storage is desperately needed to allow residential, \n     commercial and municipal development in the Bear River \n     drainage without reducing irrigated agricultural lands; and\n       Whereas the United States Army Corps of Engineers is the \n     federal agency responsible for flood control. The Corps has \n     indicated a willingness to conduct a feasibility study or \n     possible water storage sites upstream of Bear Lake, which \n     could be used for flood control of the Bear River. Costs of \n     the study could range from six hundred thousand dollars \n     ($600,000.00) to two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) \n     depending on the areas the study would include. The study \n     will require an equal match of federal and nonfederal funds. \n     However, with congressional approval, past local expenditures \n     may be used as the local match; and\n       Whereas past local expenditures that have been made include \n     one hundred seventy-four thousand dollars ($174,000.00) by \n     the State of Wyoming for the Cokeville Reservoir Project on \n     Smith's Fork, three hundred fifty thousand dollars \n     ($350,000.00) by the State of Wyoming for the Bear River \n     Plan, and over two million ($2,000,000.00) of state funds \n     from Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah throughout the Bear River \n     Commission for stream gaging; and\n       Whereas concerned citizens of the Bear River Drainage, \n     including the Bear Lake County Commissions, the Bear Lake \n     Regional Commission, Lake Watch, Inc., and Love Bear Lake, \n     Inc., are asking for Congressional approval to recognize past \n     expenditures as the local match to make the Corps\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\n     of Engineers feasibility study possible: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That Congress is urged to pass and vote for \n     legislation that will authorize and fund a feasibility study \n     by the United States Corps of Engineers relating to the \n     possibilities, benefits and costs of providing flood control \n     above Bear Lake.\n       Section 2. That Congress is urged to allow and approve past \n     local expenditures, equivalent to fifty percent of the total \n     cost of the allowed and approved one hundred seventy-four \n     thousand dollars ($174,000.00) by the State of Wyoming for \n     the Cokeville Reservoir Project on Smith's Fork, three \n     hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) by the State of \n     Wyoming for the Bear River Basin Plan and two million dollars \n     ($2,000,000.00) of state funds from Idaho, Wyoming and Utah \n     for stream gaging.\n       Section 3. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress and to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-47. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Jersey relative to the \n     Passaic River Restoration Initiative; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          Senate Resolution 75\n\n       Whereas the Passaic River Restoration Initiative (PRRI), a \n     new cooperative approach to restore the Passaic River, will \n     utilize the leadership of the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers, in partnership with the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and various concerned \n     federal, state and local agencies; and\n       Whereas the Passaic River and its surrounding wetlands have \n     been degraded as a result of commercial growth in the State \n     that brought industrial development to the shores of the \n     Passaic River and surrounding properties; and\n       Whereas the Passaic River, which traverses New Jersey \n     through Newark, is an ideal pilot project to showcase \n     nationally the restoration of urban waterways, wildlife \n     habitat, and one of America's most historic rivers; and\n       Whereas the PRRI, the United States Army Corps of Engineers \n     will engage in a cooperative project planning and development \n     process to identify and apply feasible solutions to achieve \n     environmental restoration and economic revitalization of the \n     Passaic River; and\n       Whereas the results of the project development process will \n     be incorporated in a report to Congress from the Chief of \n     Engineers as project implementation will require \n     authorization by Congress; and\n       Whereas the PRRI is related to several other current major \n     federal initiatives, such as those under brownfields \n     redevelopment, the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary Program, and the \n     Natural Resources Damage Assessment and Restoration Program; \n     and\n       Whereas on April 11, 2000 the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure in the United States House of \n     Representatives approved a resolution authorizing the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers to conduct the Passaic River \n     Environmental Restoration reconnaissance study, which is \n     currently underway by the New York district of the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers; and\n       Whereas it is in the best interest of the State to support \n     the enactment of the Passaic River Restoration Initiative in \n     order to restore and preserve healthy environmental and \n     economic conditions in and along the Passaic River: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This House urges the United States Congress to support \n     the Passaic River Restoration Initiative in order to restore \n     and preserve the Passaic River to healthy environmental and \n     economic conditions, and to provide the funding for the \n     federal share of the project development process and the \n     necessary study funds of the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers to advance the Passaic River Restoration \n     Initiative.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the majority and minority leaders of the \n     United States Senate and the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of Congress elected from \n     this State.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-48. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to highway reauthorization legislation; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                          House Resolution 31\n\n       Whereas the sixth short-term extension of the federal road \n     and transit funding authorization act known as the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA 21, \n     expires on May 31, 2005. The uncertainty regarding long-term \n     federal funding hampers Michigan's ability to effectively \n     plan investments in infrastructure and may contribute to \n     delays in critical highway and transit projects; and\n       Whereas Michigan has long been a ``donor state,'' \n     contributing a greater share to the Federal Highway Trust \n     Fund and Mass Transit Account than the share of federal \n     transportation funds returned for use in Michigan; and\n       Whereas last session, the United States Senate passed \n     highway reauthorization legislation that would have provided \n     $318 billion for highways and transit systems nationwide over \n     six years and increased Michigan's rate of return on our \n     federal transportation taxes from 90.5 percent to 95 percent. \n     In addition, the bill would have provided up to $300 million \n     more for Michigan transportation systems each year, and could \n     have created several thousand new jobs. The House passed \n     reauthorizing legislation that would have provided $284 \n     billion for highways and transit systems and would have \n     reduced Michigan's rate of return below the current level of \n     90.5 percent. The Conference Committee narrowed the funding \n     difference to between $284 and $299 billion, but left \n     unresolved the question of funding equity for donor states \n     such as Michigan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House, That we memorialize Congress to \n     enact highway reauthorization legislation with a level of \n     funding that closes the gap between federal fuel tax dollars \n     paid by Michigan motorists and dollars received to address \n     Michigan's transportation needs; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-49.

Yet fraternal housing faces \n     several unique challenges in accommodating student \n     populations, particularly the lack of funds to install badly \n     needed safety upgrades; and\n       Whereas the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act (S. \n     1246/H.R. 1523), introduced in April 2003, would allow tax-\n     deductible charitable contributions to fraternity and \n     sorority foundations to be used to add such fraternal housing \n     improvements as fire sprinklers, new roofing and security \n     equipment, along with other infrastructure improvements. The \n     passage of this important\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\n     legislation would allow fraternal educational foundations to \n     use tax-deductible charitable contributions to make the same \n     student infrastructure improvements that colleges and \n     universities currently can make with tax-deductible funds; \n     and\n       Whereas the Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act is \n     critical to ensuring the long-term availability and safety of \n     collegiate and university housing nationwide.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, prays:\n       1.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine relative to the reform of Social Security \n     offsets of the government pension offset and the windfall \n     elimination provision; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas under current federal law, individuals who receive \n     a Social Security benefit and a public retirement benefit \n     derived from employment not covered under Social Security are \n     subject to a reduction in the Social Security benefits; and\n       Whereas these laws, contained in the federal Social \n     Security Act, 42 United States Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter \n     II, Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n     Benefits, and known as the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision, greatly affect public \n     employees, particularly women; and\n       Whereas the Windfall Elimination Provision reduces by a \n     formula the Social Security benefit of a person who is also \n     receiving a pension from a public employer that does not \n     participate in Social Security; and\n       Whereas the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision are particularly burdensome on the \n     finances of low-income and moderate-income public service \n     workers, such as school teachers, clerical workers and school \n     cafeteria employees, whose wages are low to start; and\n       Whereas the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision both unfairly reduce benefits for those \n     public employees and their spouses whose careers cross the \n     line between the private and public sectors; and\n       Whereas since many lower-paying public service jobs are \n     held by women, both the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision have a disproportionately \n     adverse effect on women; and\n       Whereas in some cases, additional support in the form of \n     income, housing, heating and prescription drug and other \n     safety net assistance from state and local governments is \n     needed to make up for the reductions imposed at the federal \n     level; and\n       Whereas other participants in Social Security do not have \n     their benefits reduced in this manner; and\n       Whereas to participate or not to participate in Social \n     Security in public sector employment is a decision of \n     employers, even though both the Government Pension Offset and \n     the Windfall Elimination Provision directly punish employees \n     and their spouses; and\n       Whereas although the Government Pension Offset was enacted \n     in 1977 and the Windfall Elimination Provision was enacted in \n     1983, many of the benefits in dispute were paid into Social \n     Security prior to that time; and\n       Whereas bills are present in Congress in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, known as ``The Social \n     Security Fairness Acts,'' that would amend the federal Social \n     Security Act, 42 United States Code, Chapter 7, Subchapter II \n     and totally repeal both the Government Pension Offset and the \n     Windfall Elimination Provision: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, your memorialists, request that the \n     President of the United States and the United States Congress \n     work together to support reform proposals that include the \n     following protections for low-income and moderate-income \n     government retirees:\n       1. Protections permitting retention of a combined public \n     pension and Social Security benefits with no applied \n     reductions;\n       2. Protections permanently ensuring that level of benefits \n     by indexing it to inflation; and\n       3. Protections ensuring that no current recipient's benefit \n     is reduced by the reform legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States; \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States; and each \n     Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho relative to the Pocatello Proton Accelerator \n     Cancer Treatment Facility in Pocatello, Idaho; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                         House Joint Memorial 3\n\n       Whereas proton therapy is a form of radiation that provides \n     numerous advantages over conventional radiation and surgery \n     in the treatment of many cancers, some of which are not \n     otherwise treatable, based on the fact that it is \n     noninvasive, painless and is performed on an outpatient \n     basis. Protons provide a superior dose to tumors while \n     sparing surrounding healthy tissue, eliminating painful and \n     life-impairing side effects associated with surgery and other \n     forms of radiation therapy; and\n       Whereas Loma Linda University Medical Center located in \n     California, established a research team in 1987 for the \n     purpose of developing and designing the world's first proton \n     beam treatment center. The research team, now known as \n     ``Optivus,'' maintains exclusive worldwide rights to the Loma \n     Linda University Medical Center proprietary technology. In \n     over a decade, the facility at Loma Linda University Medical \n     Center has delivered in excess of 200,000 patient treatments \n     and the market for the technology continues to grow; and\n       Whereas the concept of a proton accelerator cancer \n     treatment facility in Pocatello, Idaho, has been under study \n     for a number of years; and\n       Whereas the Portneuf Medical Center, located in Pocatello, \n     Idaho, is in the process of an eight-year expansion program \n     with a goal of providing a single hospital facility with many \n     services decentralized into five centers of excellence; and\n       Whereas Optivus has the expertise to deliver, operate and \n     maintain a proton beam treatment center, with FDA cleared \n     technology, capable of delivering a high volume of patient \n     treatments each year in Pocatello, Idaho; and\n       Whereas the City of Pocatello, Bannock County, Portneuf \n     Medical Center, and other available resources have agreed, in \n     concept, to provide support for the development of the \n     Pocatello Proton Accelerator Cancer Treatment Facility at or \n     near the campus of the new Portneuf Medical Center; and\n       Whereas the facility will provide state-of-the-art medical \n     services to the communities of rural Idaho, the surrounding \n     states, and other national and international markets for \n     cancer treatment, as well as create numerous high paying jobs \n     and generate significant revenue for the local economy; and\n       Whereas funding for the facility will be secured through a \n     combination of funds, debt and/or financial guarantees: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the \n     Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate concurring therein, That we urge the President \n     and Congress to vigorously support the campaign to develop \n     the Pocatello Proton Accelerator Cancer Treatment Facility in \n     Pocatello, Idaho, supporting the concept that rural health is \n     a significant issue affecting every rural community in this \n     nation and that the development of the Pocatello Proton \n     Accelerator Cancer Treatment Facility will not only provide \n     much needed medical care to rural Idaho, but also to \n     surrounding states and other national and international \n     markets; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Jersey relative to the \n     reauthorization of the assault weapons ban; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4021]]\n\n                          Senate Resolution 84\n\n       Whereas the provision included in the federal Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which banned the sale \n     of semi-automatic assault weapons is set to expire on \n     September 13, 2004; and\n       Whereas the assault weapons covered by the ban are not \n     designed for sport use, but incorporate military features \n     intended for combat in a war setting; and\n       Whereas the ban not only required domestic gun \n     manufacturers to stop producing semi-automatic assault \n     weapons and ammunition clips which held more than 10 rounds, \n     except for military or police use, but also halted imports of \n     assault weapons not already banned; and\n       Whereas prior to their ban, semi-automatic assault weapons \n     had become the ``weapon of choice'' for drug traffickers, \n     gangs and paramilitary extremist groups; and\n       Whereas many major national law enforcement organizations \n     support the federal assault weapons ban, in light of their \n     high firepower and ability to penetrate body armor; and\n       Whereas one in five police officers slain in the line of \n     duty during the years 1998 through 2001 were killed with an \n     assault weapon; and\n       Whereas assault rifles have been used in some of the \n     nation's most shocking crimes, including the Stockton \n     schoolyard massacre, the CIA headquarters shootings, and the \n     Branch-Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas; and\n       Whereas the continuing confiscation of assault weapons from \n     crime scenes will result in criminals having less access to \n     these dangerous weapons; and\n       Whereas there are various bills pending in Congress which \n     would have the affect of reauthorizing the assault weapons \n     ban, including a proposal to postpone the sunset of the \n     provision for ten years and another to repeal the sunset date \n     entirely: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. The President and the Congress of the United States are \n     urged to enact a reauthorization the assault weapons ban. The \n     members of this State's Congressional delegation are urged to \n     work diligently to achieve the enactment of this legislation.\n       2.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 853. A bill to direct the Secretary of State to establish a \nprogram to bolster the mutual security and safety of the United States, \nCanada, and Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the North American \nCooperative Security Act, NACSA. The purpose of this bill is to enhance \nthe mutual security and safety of the United States, Canada, and Mexico \nby providing a framework for better management, communication and \ncoordination between the Governments of North America. To advance these \ngoals, this bill would: Improve procedures for exchanging relevant \nsecurity information with Mexico and Canada; improve our military-to-\nmilitary relations with Mexico; improve the security of Mexico's \nsouthern border; establish a database to track the movement of members \nof Central American gangs between the United States, Mexico, and \nCentral American countries; require U.S. government agencies to develop \na strategy for achieving an agreement with the Mexican government on \njoint measures to impede the ability of third country nationals from \nusing Mexico as a transit corridor for unauthorized entry into the \nUnited States.\n  Our Nation is inextricably intertwined with Mexico and Canada \nhistorically, culturally, and commercially. The flow of goods and \npeople across our borders helps drive our economy and strengthen our \nculture. The Department of Transportation reports that goods worth more \nthan $633 billion crossed our land borders in 2004. According to the \nCensus Bureau more than 26 million of the 39 million individuals of \nHispanic-origin who are legal residents in the United States are of \nMexican background.\n  But our land borders also serve as a conduit for illegal immigration, \ndrugs, and other illicit items. Given the threat of international \nterrorism, there is great concern that our land borders could also \nserve as a channel for international terrorists and weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The threat of terrorist penetration is particularly acute along our \nsouthern border. In 2004, fewer than 10,000 inividuals were apprehended \nentering the U.S. illegally through our 5,000 mile land border with \nCanada. This compared with the more than 1.1 million that were \napprehended while trying to cross our 2,000 mile border with Mexico. \nThe Department of Homeland Security reports that about 996,000 of these \nindividuals were Mexicans crossing the border for economic or family \nreasons.\n  The Homeland Security Department refers to the rest as ``other than \nMexicans,''--or ``OTMs.'' Of the approximately 100,000 OTMs \napprehended, 3,000 to 4,000 were from so-called ``countries of \ninterest'' like Somalia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, which have \nproduced or been associated with terrorist cells.\n\n  A few of the individuals who have been apprehended at our southern \nborder were known to have connections to terrorists or were entering \nthe U.S. under highly suspicious circumstances. For example, one \nLebanese national, who had paid a smuggler to transport him across the \nU.S.-Mexican border in 2001, was recently convicted of holding a \nfundraiser in his Michigan home for the Hizbollah terrorist group.\n  Last July, a Pakistani woman swam across the Rio Grande River from \nMexico to Texas. She was detained when she tried to board a plane to \nNew York with $6,000 in cash and a severely altered South African \npassport. Her husband's name was found to be on a terrorism watch list. \nShe was convicted on immigration charges and deported in December 2004.\n  Since September 11, 2001, progress has been made in deterring cross-\nborder threats, while maintaining the efficient movement of people and \ncargo across North America. The United States signed ``Smart Border'' \nagreements with Canada and Mexico, in December 2001 and March 2002, \nrespectively. These agreements seek to improve pre-screening of \nimmigrants, refugees, and cargo. They include new documentation \nrequirements and provisions for adding inspectors and updating border \nsecurity technologies. We also have established Integrated Border \nEnforcement Teams to coordinate law enforcement efforts with Canada.\n  Additional initiatives are included in the Presidents' Security and \nProsperity Partnership of North America Agreement announced on March \n23, 2005, at the North American Summit meeting in Texas. But, \nadditional work lies ahead. We must sustain attention and \naccountability at home for enhancing our Continental security, and \ncontinue to press our neighbors for improved cooperation in combating \nsecurity threats.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 853\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss legislation I am \nintroducing that would protect ginseng farmers and consumers by \nensuring that ginseng is labeled accurately with where the root was \nharvested. The ``Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2005'' is similar to \nbills that I introduced in previous Congresses and developed after \nhearing suggestions from ginseng growers and the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to discuss American ginseng and \nthe problems facing Wisconsin's ginseng growers so that my colleagues \nunderstand the need for this legislation. Chinese and Native American \ncultures have used ginseng for thousands of years for herbal and \nmedicinal purposes. As a dietary supplement, American ginseng is widely \ntouted for its ability to improve energy and vitality, particularly in \nfighting fatigue or stress.\n  In the U.S., ginseng is experiencing increasing popularity as a \ndietary supplement, and I am proud to say that my home State of \nWisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence. Wisconsin \nproduces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United States, and 85 \npercent of the country's ginseng is grown in just one Wisconsin county, \nMarathon County. Ginseng is also grown in a number of other States such \nas Maine, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, \nand West Virginia.\n  For Wisconsin, ginseng has been an economic boon. Wisconsin ginseng \ncommands a premium price in world markets because it is of the highest \nquality and because it has a low pesticide and chemical content. In \n2002, U.S. exports of ginseng totaled nearly $45 million, much of which \nwas grown in Wisconsin. With a huge market for this high-quality \nginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at \nhome, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future \nahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious\n\n[[Page S4027]]\n\nproblem--smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is \nconsidered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go \nto great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as \n``Wisconsin-grown.''\n  Here's how the switch takes place: Wisconsin ginseng is shipped to \nChina to be sorted into various grades. While the sorting process is \nitself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers too often \nuse it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with Asian- or Canadian-\ngrown ginseng considered inferior by consumers. The lower quality \nginseng is then shipped back to the U.S. for sale to American consumers \nwho think they are buying the Wisconsin-grown product.\n  There is good reason consumers should want to know that the ginseng \nthey buy is American-grown considering that the only accurate way of \ntesting ginseng to determine where it was grown is to test for \npesticides that are banned in the United States. The Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin has been testing some ginseng found on store shelves, and in \nmany of the products, residues of chemicals such as DDT, lead, arsenic, \nand quintozine (PCNB) have been detected. Since the majority of ginseng \nsold in the U.S. originates from countries with less stringent \npesticide standards, it is vitally important that consumers know which \nginseng is really grown in the U.S.\n  To capitalize on their product's preeminence, the Ginseng Board of \nWisconsin has developed a voluntary labeling program, stating that the \nginseng is ``Grown in Wisconsin, U.S.A.'' However, Wisconsin ginseng is \nso valuable that counterfeit labels and ginseng smuggling have become \nwidespread around the world. As a result, consumers have no way of \nknowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase--\nwhere it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains \ndangerous pesticides.\n  My legislation, the Ginseng Harvest Labeling Act of 2005, proposes \nsome common sense steps to address some of the challenges facing the \nginseng industry. My legislation requires that ginseng, as a raw \nagricultural commodity, be sold at retail with a label clearly \nindicating the country that the ginseng was harvested in. ``Harvest'' \nis important because some Canadian and Chinese growers have ginseng \nplants that originated in the U.S., but because these plants were \ncultivated in a foreign country, they may have been treated with \nchemicals not allowed for use in the U.S. This label would also allow \nbuyers of ginseng to more easily prevent foreign companies from mixing \nforeign-produced ginseng with ginseng harvested in the U.S. The country \nof harvest labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers \nto make an informed decision.\n  These common sense reforms would give ginseng growers the support \nthey deserve and help consumers make informed choices about the ginseng \nthat they consume. We must ensure that when ginseng consumers reach for \na high-quality ginseng product--such as Wisconsin-grown ginseng--they \nare getting the real thing, not a knock-off.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the security of the Nation's ports by \nproviding Federal grants to support Area Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Plans and to address vulnerabilities in port areas identified \nin approved vulnerability assessments or by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Port \nSecurity Grants Act of 2005. This legislation would establish a \ndedicated grant program within the Department of Homeland Security to \nenhance terrorism prevention and response efforts at our ports. It \nwould provide the resources needed to better protect the American \npeople from attack through these vital yet still extremely vulnerable \ncenters of our economy and points of entry.\n  I am very pleased that my partner in this effort, Representative Jane \nHarman, today is introducing the same legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. Congresswoman Harman knows well the vulnerability of \nour Nation's ports. Indeed, earlier this year, I accompanied her to the \nports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to witness first hand the \nincredible volume of activity that occurs at these thriving economic \ncenters--and the incredible security challenges that they pose. \nCongresswoman Harman's dedication to the security of our ports and our \nNation as a whole makes her one of Congress' acknowledged leaders on \nhomeland security matters. I am pleased that we have been able to join \nforces on this important initiative.\n  Funding to date to address security needs at our ports has been \nwoefully inadequate. The Coast Guard estimates that implementing the \nprovisions of the Maritime Transportation Security Act and similar \nrequirements for international port security will cost $7.3 billion \nover the next decade. Yet, since MTSA was enacted, only the fiscal year \n2005 budget request contained a line item for this crucial need, and \nthat at a mere $46 million. Although the Administration's fiscal year \n2006 budget request includes $600 million for infrastructure \nprotection, it does not contain a dedicated line item for port security \ngrant funding.\n  As a point of comparison, the Transportation Security \nAdministration's fiscal year 2006 budget dedicates $4.9 billion for \naviation security. As Dr. Stephen Flynn of the Council on Foreign \nRelations testified at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee hearing in January, port security has received approximately \n5 cents on the dollar--with the remaining 95 cents going to aviation \nsecurity.\n  The legislation we propose will break the hand-to-mouth cycle that \nports have faced for years. It does the following: First, it creates a \ncompetitive grant program administered by the Office of State and Local \nGovernment Coordination and Preparedness at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This is the same office that administers the State Grant and \nUrban Area Security Initiative programs.\n  Second, under our bill, grant funds will be used to address port \nsecurity\n\n[[Page S4028]]\n\nvulnerabilities identified through Area Maritime Transportation \nSecurity Plans, currently required by Federal statute, or through other \nDDS-sanctioned vulnerability assessments. In other words, grant dollars \nmust be spent consistent with an established plan, not through a \nprocess divorced from efforts already underway.\n  Authorized uses of these grant funds include: acquiring, operating, \nand maintaining equipment that contributes to the overall security of \nthe port area; conducting port-wide exercises to strengthen emergency \npreparedness; developing joint harbor operations centers to focus \nresources on port area security; implementing Area Maritime \nTransportation Security Plans; and covering the costs of additional \nsecurity personnel during times of heightened alert levels.\n  Third, we require DHS to prioritize efforts to promote coordination \namong port stakeholders and integration of port-wide security, as well \nas information and intelligence sharing among first responders and \nfederal, state, and local officials.\n  Fourth, we authorize funding for port security grants at $400 million \nper year for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. This steady, dedicated \nstream of funding would represent a substantial down payment on the \nbillions of dollars of port security needs identified by the Coast \nGuard. It is also the amount the American Association of Ports \nAuthorities believes needs to be dedicated annually to port security in \norder to begin addressing serious vulnerabilities.\n  Under our bill, port security dollars will originate from duties \ncollected by Customs and Border Protection, and--with exceptions made \nfor small or extraordinary projects--recipients will be required to \ncontribute 25 percent of the cost. This cost-sharing requirement has \nprecedents in other transportation funding and will ensure the \ndevelopment of true partnerships between the federal government and \ngrant recipients.\n  Fifth, our legislation includes strong accountability measures--\nincluding audits and reporting requirements--to ensure the grant funds \nawarded under the bill are properly accounted for and spent as \nintended.\n  This legislation does call for a major commitment of resources. I am \nconfident, however, that my colleagues recognize, as I do, that this \ncommitment is fully proportional to what is at stake.\n  Approximately 95 percent of our Nation's trade, worth nearly $1 \ntrillion, enters through one of our 361 seaports on board some 8,555 \nforeign vessels, which make more than 55,000 port calls per year. \nClearly, an attack on the U.S. maritime transportation system could \ndevastate our economy.\n  The potential for this devastation was amply demonstrated by the 2002 \nWest Coast dock labor dispute, which cost our economy an estimated $1 \nbillion per day, affected operations in 29 West Coast ports, and harmed \nbusinesses throughout the country. An unanticipated and violent act \nagainst a cargo port could result in economic costs that are \nincalculable, not to mention a potential loss of life that would be \nhorrifying.\n  Much of the discussion regarding port security revolves around the \nsecurity of inbound containers. At his confirmation hearing, Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Chertoff stated that his major concern is the \nintroduction into the United States of chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, or explosive threats via a shipping container. \nSecretary Chertoff is absolutely correct in identifying this as a major \nvulnerability.\n\n  But there are many other threats against ports. Just last month, the \nState Department issued a warning concerning information that \nterrorists may attempt to mount a maritime attack using speedboats \nagainst a Western ship, possibly in East Africa. This isn't the first \ninstance of this type of attack--the USS Cole in 2000 and the French \ntanker Limberg in 2002 were both attacked by this method. The repeated \nuse of suicide bombers and truck bombs around the world also raises \ngreat concern about our ports, and the critical infrastructure and \npopulation centers located around them.\n  Coming from a State with a strong maritime tradition and vital \nmaritime industry, I am keenly aware of what is at stake. Maine has \nthree international cargo ports. Each is a vital and multi-faceted part \nof our economy: State, regional, and even national.\n  The Port of Portland, for example, is the largest port by tonnage in \nNew England and the largest oil port on the East Coast. Ninety percent \nof its foreign cargo was crude oil. In addition, Portland has a booming \ncruise-ship industry, a vigorous fishing fleet, and an international \nferry terminal. This wide range of activity provides economic \nopportunity and also provides terrorism vulnerability.\n  It is not my intention to suggest that our security agencies and \nports are at a standstill. Indeed, much has been done to improve port \nsecurity. The Coast Guard's Sea Marshals program places armed units on \nships at sea to ensure their safe arrival and departure. The Container \nSecurity Initiative Bureau of Customs and Border Protection works with \nforeign governments to target high-risk cargo and to prevent terrorists \nfrom exploiting cargo containers. Detailed information is now required \non each ship and its passengers, crew, and cargo. To upgrade security \nat international ports, the United States worked with the International \nMaritime Organization for the adoption of the International Ship and \nPort Security Code, the first multilateral port security standard ever \ncreated.\n  It is, however, my intention to assert that we must do more to \nimprove port security on the front lines--the ports that line the \nharbor of cities and towns along our vast coastlines, the Great Lakes, \nour immense inland river network and in Alaska and Hawaii.\n  We observed this week two anniversaries that bear upon this issue. \nMonday was Patriot's Day, the 230th anniversary of the ride of Paul \nRevere. While I am not suggesting ``one if by land, two if by sea'' be \nadopted as a funding formula for homeland security, that famous phrase \ndoes remind us of the bond between security and transportation that has \nexisted since our nation's very first days.\n  On a far more somber note, Tuesday was the 10th anniversary of \nOklahoma City. As we paused to reflect on that horrific attack, we once \nagain were confronted with the harsh reality that terrorists--whether \nforeign or domestic--will strike wherever they see vulnerability.\n  Our seaports are vulnerable. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation that will help deny terrorists an \nopportunity to strike at a vulnerable target.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 858.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nincome tax credit for the provision of homeownership and community \ndevelopment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community \nDevelopment Homeownership Tax Credit Act. I am very pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Kerry, Smith, Stabenow, Allard, and \nSarbanes, who are original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Homeownership is a key component of the American Dream. Many people \naround this country dream of and plan for the day they can buy a home \nof their own in which to raise their children, to settle down in a \ncommunity, and to build equity and wealth. They see the importance of \nhomeownership and the stability it can bring to families and \nneighborhoods. It is often homeownership that financially anchors \nAmerican families and civically anchors our communities. But I believe \nour focus on homeownership also returns our attention to the basic \nideals of the American Dream. Ensuring access to homeownership is among \nthe most significant ways we can empower our citizens to achieve the \nhappy, productive and stable lifestyle everyone desires.\n  Having a house of one's own that provides security and comfort to \none's family and that gives families an active, vested interest in the \nquality of life their community provides is central to our collective \nideas about freedom and self-determination. As a nation, we know that \nhomeownership helps the emotional and intellectual growth and \ndevelopment of children. We know that homeowners show greater interest \nand more frequent participation in civic organizations and neighborhood \nissues. We know that when people own homes, they are more likely to \naccumulate wealth and assets and to prepare themselves financially for \nsuch things as their children's education and retirement.\n  In America today, homeownership is at a record high. Unfortunately, \nthere remains a significant homeownership gap between minority and non-\nminority populations, leaving homeownership an elusive financial \nprospect for many. According to the Census Bureau, in 2004, the \nhomeownership rate for non-Hispanic whites reached 76 percent, compared \nto 49.1 percent for African-Americans and 48.1 percent for Hispanics or \nLatinos.\n  The bill I introduce today enjoys strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate and will encourage increased homeownership rates, more stable \nneighborhoods and strong communities. This legislation would give \ndevelopers and investors an incentive to participate in the \nrehabilitation and construction of homes for low- and moderate-income \nbuyers. It will also spur economic development in low- and moderate-\nincome communities across our country and provide an important stimulus \nfor the development of our nation's economy.\n  This proposal is modeled after the very successful low-income rental \ntax credit. It will allow states to allocate tax credits to developers \nand investors to construct or substantially rehabilitate homes in \neconomically disadvantaged communities, including rural areas, for sale \nto low- or moderate-income buyers. These tax credits will help bridge \nthe gap between the cost of developing affordable housing and the price \nat which these homes can be sold to eligible buyers in low-income \nneighborhoods where housing is scarce. It provides investors with a tax \ncredit of up to 50 percent of the cost of home construction or \nrehabilitation. It is estimated that this legislation will encourage \nthe construction and substantial rehabilitation of up to 500,000 homes \nfor low- and moderate-income families in economically distressed areas \nover the next ten years.\n  President Bush has long supported the creation of a homeownership tax \ncredit as have the majority of both the House and Senate in the last \nCongress. This proposal also has the backing of a large and broad \ncoalition of housing-related groups, including the National Association \nof Home Builders, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, and \nthe National Association of Realtors. In addition, this initiative has \nthe backing of major non-profit groups, including Habitat for Humanity, \nas well as the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise \nFoundation.\n  This important legislation addresses a key issue facing many \nAmericans today, housing affordability. It also addresses the community \ndevelopment needs of many neighborhoods. It continues to have strong \nbipartisan support, and I am hopeful that it will be enacted this year. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in supporting homeownership by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 860. A bill to amend the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress Authorization Act to require State academic assessments of \nstudent achievement in United States history and civics, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``American \nHistory Achievement Act'' and am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts. This is part of my effort to put \nthe teaching of American history and civics back in its rightful place \nin our\n\n[[Page S4032]]\n\nschools so our children can grow up learning what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  The ``American History Achievement Act'' gives the National \nAssessment Governing Board (NAGB) the authority to administer a ten \nState pilot study of the National Assessment of Education Progress \n(NAEP) test in U.S. history in 2006. They already have that authority \nfor reading, math, science, and writing. The bill also includes a new \nprovision that would permit a 10-state pilot study for the Civics NAEP \ntest if funding is available.\n  This modest bill provides for improved testing of American history so \nthat we can determine where history is being taught well--and where it \nis being taught poorly--so that improvements can be made. We also know \nthat when testing is focused on a specific subject, states and school \ndistricts are more likely to step up to the challenge and improve \nperformance.\n  We could certainly use improvement in the teaching of American \nhistory. According to the National Assessment of Education Progress \n(NAEP), commonly referred to as the ``Nation's Report Card,'' fewer \nstudents have just a basic understanding of American history than have \na basic understanding of any other subject which we test--including \nmath, science, and reading. When you look at the national report card, \nAmerican history is our children's worst subject.\n  Yet, according to recent poll results, the exact opposite outcome is \ndesired by the American people. Hart-Teeter conducted a poll last year \nof 1300 adults for the Educational Testing Service (ETS), where they \nasked what the principal goal of education should be. The top response \nwas ``producing literate, educated citizens who can participate in our \ndemocracy.'' Twenty-six percent of respondents felt that should be our \nprincipal goal. ``Teach basics: math, reading, writing'' was selected \nby only 15 percent as the principal goal of education. You can't be an \neducated participant in our democracy if you don't know our history.\n  Our children don't know American history because they are not being \ntaught it. For example, the state of Florida recently passed a bill \npermitting high school students to graduate without taking a course in \nU.S. history.\n  And when our children are being taught our history, they're not \nlearning what's most important. According to Harvard scholar Samuel \nHuntington, ``A 1987 study of high school students found that more knew \nwho Harriet Tubman was than knew that Washington commanded the American \narmy in the Revolution or that Abraham Lincoln wrote the Emancipation \nProclamation.'' Now I'm all for teaching about the history of the \nUnderground Railroad--my ancestor, the Reverend John Rankin, like \nHarriet Tubman, was a conductor on the Underground Railroad--but surely \nchildren ought to learn first about the most critical leaders and \nevents in the Revolution and the Civil War.\n  Let me give a few examples of just how bad things have gotten:\n  The 4th grade NAEP test asks students to identify the following \npassage: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are \ncreated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \nunalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness. . . .'' Students were given four choices for the source \nof that passage: (a) Constitution, (b) Mayflower Compact, (c) \nDeclaration of Independence, and (d) Article of the Confederation.\n  Only 46 percent of students answered correctly that it came from the \nDeclaration of Independence. The Declaration is the fundamental \ndocument for the founding of our Nation, but less than half the \nstudents could identify that famous passage from it.\n  The 8th grade test asks students to ``Imagine you could use a time \nmachine to visit the past. You have landed in Philadelphia in the \nsummer of 1776. Describe an important event that is happening.'' Nearly \nhalf the students--46 percent were not able to answer the question \ncorrectly that the Declaration of Independence was being signed. They \nmust wonder why the Fourth of July is Independence Day.\n  We can't allow this to continue. Our children are growing up without \neven learning the basics of our Nation's history. Something has to be \ndone. This legislation aims to help in that effort.\n  The pilot program authorized in the bill should collect enough data \nto attain a state-by-state comparison of 8th and 12th grades student's \nknowledge and understanding of U.S. history. That data will allow us to \nknow which States are doing a better job of teaching American history \nand allow other States to model their programs on those that are \nworking well. It will also put a spotlight on American history that \nshould encourage States and school districts to improve their efforts \nat teaching the subject.\n  I suspect that the pilot program will tell us that history programs \nlike those of the House Page School, right here on Capitol Hill, are \nthe model to follow. On January 25, the College Board announced that \nthe House page school ranked first in the Nation among institutions \nwith fewer than 500 pupils for the percentage of the student body who \nachieved college-level mastery on the advanced placement exam in U.S. \nhistory. The page school achieved this result not only by teaching \nAmerican history, but also because teachers highlight American history \nin all of their classes--from science to literature--as well as taking \nstudents on field trips around the Washington area, from Monticello to \nthe American History Museum here in Washington, to historical sites in \nPhiladelphia. The House Page School's success is evidence that we can \nsucceed in teaching our children the history of this great Nation. I \nsuspect we will uncover more effective models for the teaching of \nAmerican history with the enactment of this legislation.\n  Our children are growing up ignorant of our Nation's history. Yet a \nrecent poll tells us that Americans believe the principal goal of \neducation is ``producing literate, educated citizens who can \nparticipate in our democracy.'' It is time to put the teaching of \nAmerican history and civics back in its rightful place in our schools \nso our children can grow up learning what it means to be an American. \nThis bill takes us one step closer to achieving that noble goal. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Alexander \nagain this year in introducing the American History Achievement Act. \nThis bill is part of a continuing effort to renew the national \ncommitment to teaching history and civics in the Nation's public \nschools. It lays the foundation for more effective ways of teaching \nchildren about the Nation's past and the value of civic responsibility. \nIt contains no new requirements for schools, but it does offer a more \nfrequent and effective analysis of how America's schoolchildren are \nlearning these important subjects.\n  Our economy and our future security rely on good schools that help \nstudents develop specific skills, such as reading and math. But the \nstrength of our democracy and our standing in the world also depend on \nensuring that children have a basic understanding of the nation's past \nand what it takes to engage in our democracy. An appreciation for the \ndefining events in our nation's history can be a catalyst for civic \ninvolvement.\n  Helping to instill appreciation of America's past--and teaching the \nvalues of justice, equality, and civic responsibility--should be an \nimportant mission of public schools. Thanks to the hard work of large \nnumbers of history and civics teachers in classrooms throughout \nAmerica, we're making progress. Results from the most recent assessment \nunder the NAEP show that fourth and eighth graders are improving their \nknowledge of U.S. history. Research conducted in history classrooms \nshows that children are using primary sources and documents more often \nto explore history, and are being assigned historical and biographical \nreadings by their teachers more frequently.\n  But much more remains to be done to advance the understanding of both \nof these subjects, and see to it that they are not left behind in \nclassrooms.\n  A recent study by Dr. Sheldon Stern--the Chief Historian Emeritus at \nmy brother's Presidential Library--suggests that State standards for \nteaching American history need improvement. His research reveals that \n22 States have American history standards that are either weak or lack \nclear\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\nchronology, appropriate political and historical context, or sufficient \ninformation about real events and people. As many as 9 States still \nhave no standards at all for American history.\n  Good standards matter. They're the foundation for teaching and \nlearning in every school. With the right resources, time, and \nattention, it's possible to develop creative and effective history \nstandards in every State. Massachusetts began to work on this effort in \n2000, through a joint review of history standards that involved \nteachers, administrators, curriculum coordinators, and university \nprofessors. After monthly meetings and three years of development and \nrevision, the state released a new framework for teaching history in \n2003. Today, our standards in American history and World history \nreceive the highest marks.\n  School budget problems at the local level are also a serious threat \nto these goals.\n  Other accounts report that schools are narrowing their curriculums \naway from the social sciences, arts, and humanities, in favor of a more \nconcentrated approach to the teaching of reading and math in order to \nmeet the strict standards of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Meeting high standards in reading and math is important, but it \nshould not come at the expense of scaling back teaching in other core \nsubjects such as history and civics. Integrating reading and math with \nother subjects often gives children a better way to master literacy and \nnumber skills, even while learning in a history, geography, or \ngovernment lesson. That type of innovation deserves special attention \nin our schools. Making it happen requires added investments in teacher \npreparation and teacher mentoring, so that teachers are well prepared \nto use interdisciplinary methods in their lesson plans.\n  Our bill today takes several important steps to strengthen the \nteaching of American history and civics, and raise the standing of \nthese subjects in school curriculums. Through changes to the National \nAssessment for Educational Progress, schools will be better able to \nachieve success on this important issue.\n  First, we propose a more frequent national assessment of children in \nAmerican history under the NAEP. For years, NAEP has served as the gold \nstandard for measuring the progress of students and reporting on that \nprogress. Students last participated in the U.S. history NAEP in 2001, \nand that assessment generated encouraging results. But the preceding \nassessment with which we can compare data--was administered in 1994--\ntoo long before to be of real assistance.\n  It makes sense to measure the knowledge and skills of children more \nfrequently. This bill would place priority on administering the \nnational U.S. history NAEP assessment, to generate a more timely \npicture of student progress. We should have an idea of children's \nknowledge and skills in American history more often than every 6 or 7 \nyears, in order to address gaps in learning.\n  The bill also proposes a leap forward to strengthen State standards \nin American history and civics, through a new State-level pilot \nassessment of these subjects under NAEP. The assessment would be \nconducted on an experimental basis in 10 States, in grades 8 and 12. \nThe National Assessment Governing Board would ensure that States with \nmodel standards, as well as those that are still under development, \nparticipate in this assessment.\n  Moving NAEP to the State level does not carry any high stakes for \nschools. But it will provide an additional benchmark for States to \ndevelop and improve their standards. It's our hope that states will \nalso be encouraged to undertake improvements in their history curricula \nand in their teaching of civics, and ensure that both subjects are a \nbeneficiary and not a victim of school reform.\n  America's past encompasses great leaders and great ideas that \ncontributed to our heritage and to the principles of freedom, equality, \njustice, and opportunity for all. Today's students will be better \ncitizens in the future if they learn more about that history and about \nthe skills needed to participate in our democracy. The American History \nAchievement Act is an important effort toward that goal, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 861. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntransition funding rules for certain plans electing to cease future \nbenefit accruals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Rockefeller to \nintroduce the Employee Pension Preservation Act of 2005. This bill \nseeks to eliminate the threat that airline employees are facing to \ntheir earned pensions as a result of funding laws that make pension \nfunding schedule volatile and unpredictable. The Employee Pension \nPreservation Act of 2005 would allow their employers to make the \nrequired pension payments in a more predictable and manageable way. \nThis common sense, industry specific approach is supported by airline \nemployees and their employers.\n  We are giving airlines the ability to fund their pension obligations \nto their employees on a more manageable and stabilized 25-year schedule \nusing stable long-term assumptions. It is analogous to refinancing a \nshort-term adjustable rate mortgage to a more predictable long-term \nfixed rate mortgage. It protects the interests of the American taxpayer \nby capping the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation's liabilities at \ncurrent levels, and ensures that a uniform evenhanded policy is taken \nwith respect to the entire industry. Finally, this must be a joint \ndecision made by the airline and its employees.\n  We are establishing a payment schedule for unfunded liabilities that \nis both affordable and practical, while properly protecting the \ninterests of airline employees, airlines, and the American taxpayer. I \ncommend Senator Rockefeller for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation, and look forward to its passage so that we can \nprovide stability to airline employees with regards to the funding of \ntheir earned pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the U.S. airline industry continues \nto teeter on the brink of financial collapse. The industry lost over $9 \nbillion in 2004 and the airlines are expected to lose another $1.9 \nbillion in 2005. Our Nation cannot afford to let this vital part of our \neconomy collapse. Our economic prosperity is tied to a healthy and \ngrowing aviation industry.\n  As we saw after the events of September 11, 2001, the shutdown of our \naviation systems caused a massive disruption to the flow of people and \ngoods throughout the world. Without a healthy airline industry, our \neconomy will not grow. I do not believe the significance of aviation to \nour economy can be overstated. I do not think many in Congress and \nacross the country realize that over 10 million people are employed \ndirectly in the aviation industry. For every job in the aviation \nindustry, 15 related jobs are produced. In my State of West Virginia, \naviation represents $3.4 billion of the State's gross domestic product \nand directly and indirectly employs 51,000 people.\n  The airline industry has been hard hit in recent years by high oil \nprices, weak revenue, and low fare competition. Since 2001, the airline \nindustry has lost more than $30 billion collectively, and while \naviation analysts expect 2005 will be a significant improvement over \nrecent years, most estimates assume oil prices drop significantly from \ncurrent levels--a matter that increasingly remains in doubt.\n  Many airlines have aggressively cut costs through a number of means, \nmost notably by reducing labor expenditures and through decreasing \ncapacity by cutting flight frequencies, using smaller aircraft, or \neliminating service to some communities.\n  Despite the airlines' efforts, they have not been able to return to \nfinancial stability. The Federal Government is faced with serious and \ndifficult choices in how to ensure both the short-term and long-term \nviability of the Nation's aviation industry. The one choice we do not \nhave is the choice not to act. Although Congress cannot restore \nprofitability to the airline industry with a law, we can create the \natmosphere for the industry to succeed, grow, and bring people back to \nwork. If we fail to act, tens of thousands of employees will lose their \njobs on top of the 200,000 that have already lost their jobs, small \ncommunities will lose their\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nair service, and the United States will lose its global leadership in \naviation.\n  One of the greatest threats to the future financial viability of the \nairlines is pension funding. Congress needs to reform the pension rules \nto provide the tools airlines need to maintain their pension plans. As \na step in the right direction, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday with Senator Isakson that protects the retirement plans airline \nemployees depend on.\n  The Employee Pension Preservation Act of 2005 provides critical \npension funding relief to the commercial airline industry by allowing \nthe airlines to fund their pension obligations over a 25-year time \nhorizon. Last year, recognizing that the airlines were facing \nextraordinary circumstances, Congress provided airlines a temporary \nreprieve from deficit reduction contributions.\n  However, when that temporary relief expires at the end of the year, \nairlines will face immediate and crushing pension bills. Congress needs \nto provide permanent, appropriate remedies that enable airlines to \nmaintain their pension plans. If we do not provide any flexibility in \npaying the pension obligations, then certainly more airlines will be \nforced to terminate their plans altogether. The legislation that \nSenator Isakson and I are offering enables airlines to meet all of \ntheir pension obligations on a reasonable schedule.\n  Some people may worry that by granting airlines an extended payment \nperiod we are increasing the risks to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, which insures the airlines' defined benefit plans. \nHowever, I am hopeful that by making the funding rules more flexible \nthis bill will actually decrease the likelihood that pension plans will \nbe terminated and the PBGC saddled with unfunded obligations. Let me be \nclear, this legislation requires airlines to fully fund all of their \npast and future pension promises. It merely provides a more reasonable \nschedule for recovering from the recent downturn that hurt many pension \nplans.\n  Moreover, the bill includes provisions to limit the liability \npotentially faced by the Government insurance agency. In contrast to \nthe status quo, any pension plans that take advantage of the funding \nrelief offered by our legislation would accrue no additional PBGC \nobligation. To the extent that any additional pension benefits are \nearned by employees, the benefits would have to be immediately and \nfully funded by the employer.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have been working for \nyears to improve our defined benefit pension system. I recognize that \nthere are few easy answers or quick fixes. And I do not suggest that \nthe legislation we are introducing today is a silver bullet for the \nairlines' defined benefit plans. Still, I am pleased to support this \nbill because it is a responsible compromise agreed to by both the labor \nand management representatives in the airline industry. That is very \nimportant to me, because this legislation will require some difficult \nsacrifices especially on the part of workers who may no longer accrue \nguaranteed benefits. While I have reservations about any agreement to \nlimit the PBGC guarantee of pensions, I have been assured that in this \nparticular case employees support this compromise and see it as the \nbest opportunity to save their hard earned retirement benefits.\n  I hope that my colleagues will carefully examine this proposal and \njoin Senator Isakson and me in a debate about how we can better secure \nthe pensions of airline employees. I appreciate that our legislation is \nnot likely to pass the Congress without negotiation and compromise. \nIndeed, I welcome opportunities to improve this legislation. But I do \nnot believe that we can ignore the plight that the airlines face, and I \nwill work to enact prudent reforms as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. McCain, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 863. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the centenary of the bestowal of the Nobel Peace \nPrize on President Theodore Roosevelt, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with Senator \nAllen, and 27 of our colleagues, the Theodore Roosevelt Commemorative \nCoin Act, which would commemorate the centenary of the bestowal of the \nNobel Peace Prize on President Theodore Roosevelt. This bill authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins bearing the \nlikeness of Theodore Roosevelt. The sales of these coins would support \nprograms to educate the public about the impressive achievements of our \n26th President.\n  President Roosevelt is one of our most celebrated presidents. Among \nhis many achievements, Roosevelt received the Congressional Medal of \nHonor for leading a daring charge up San Juan Hill, which turned the \ntide in that battle near Santiago, Cuba.\n  North Dakota has a special connection with Theodore Roosevelt. \nRoosevelt liked to say that the years he spent in the Badlands of North \nDakota were the best of his life. He even attributed his success as \nPresident to his experiences as a hunter and rancher in western North \nDakota.\n  It is with great pride that I introduce the Theodore Roosevelt \nCommemorative Coin Act, which honors President Roosevelt's foreign \npolicy achievements and commitment to conservation in this country. In \nparticular, the bill highlights his success in drawing up the 1905 \npeace treaty ending the Russo-Japanese War. This accomplishment earned \nhim the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize--making him the first citizen of the \nUnited States to receive the Peace Prize. The bill also pays tribute to \nhis enduring respect for our nation's wildlife and natural resources. \nDuring his tenure as President, Roosevelt established 51 Bird Reserves, \n4 Game Preserves, 150 National Forests, 5 National Parks, and 18 \nNational Monuments, totaling nearly 230 million acres of land placed \nunder public protection.\n  It is fitting that the proceeds from the surcharge associated with \nthe coin be used for educational programs at two very important sites \nin the life of Theodore Roosevelt--his home in New York, Sagamore Hill \nNational Historic Site, and the national park that bears his name and \nhonors his conservation efforts, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, \nlocated in Medora, North Dakota. These two sites played a significant \nrole in the development of Teddy Roosevelt's policies and offered him \nrefuge away from the stress associated with public life.\n  As a North Dakotan and an American, it is my hope that this bill will \nrenew interest in the life of Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt's courage, \npatriotism, optimism, and spirit reflect what is best about our \ncountry, and he is remembered not only as a great statesman, but also a \nfriend to the environment. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation to honor Theodore Roosevelt's contributions to \nU.S. foreign and domestic policy and build upon his efforts to promote \nrespect for our Nation's lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 864.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas in 1905, Drs. Olser, Trudeau, Janeway, and Knopf, \n     leaders in the fight in the United States against \n     tuberculosis, created the American Sanatorium Association, an \n     organization dedicated to the improvement of tuberculosis \n     care and treatment at tuberculosis sanatoriums in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in 1939, the name of the American Sanatorium \n     Association was changed to the American Trudeau Society, \n     honoring Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau and recognizing the \n     growing scientific interest in the study of lung diseases \n     beyond tuberculosis, and in 1960 the American Trudeau Society \n     became the American Thoracic Society in keeping with the \n     evolution of the medical specialty area from phthisiology to \n     pulmonology, that is, from tuberculosis to the whole range of \n     respiratory disorders;\n       Whereas in 1917, to fulfill its mission as a scientific \n     society, the American Sanatorium Association began the \n     publication of an academic journal, the American Review of \n     Tuberculosis, a text that carried articles on the \n     classification of tuberculosis, diagnostic standards, and \n     related topics on the diagnosis, treatment, cure and \n     prevention of tuberculosis, and in the following years, the \n     journal was renamed the American Review of Tuberculosis and \n     Pulmonary Disease, and finally, the American Journal of \n     Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine;\n       Whereas in 1989, the American Thoracic Society began \n     publication of the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and \n     Molecular Biology to recognize the contribution of basic \n     research to the field of respiratory medicine;\n       Whereas the American Thoracic Society hosts the largest \n     global scientific meeting dedicated to highlighting and \n     disseminating research findings and clinical advances in the \n     prevention, detection, treatment, and cure of respiratory \n     diseases;\n       Whereas the American Thoracic Society continues to meet its \n     clinical and scientific mission through its publication of \n     academic journals and clinical statements on the prevention, \n     diagnosis, treatment, and the cure of respiratory-related \n     disorders, and through providing continued medical education \n     in respiratory medicine; and\n       Whereas the American Thoracic Society has a long tradition \n     of working in collaboration with the Federal Government to \n     improve the respiratory health of all Americans: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the scientific, clinical, and public health \n     achievements of the American Thoracic Society as its members \n     and staff commemorate and celebrate the milestone of its \n     100th anniversary;\n       (2) recognizes the great impact that the American Thoracic \n     Society has had on improving the lung-related health problems \n     of people in the United States and around the world; and\n       (3) congratulates the American Thoracic Society for its \n     achievements and trusts that the organization will continue \n     to offer scientific guidance on lung-related health issues to \n     improve the public health of future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4036-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4036-S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 115--DESIGNATING MAY 2005 AS ``NATIONAL CYSTIC \n                       FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. \nDole, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 115\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis, characterized by chronic lung \n     infections and digestive disorders, is a fatal lung disease;\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is 1 of the most common genetic \n     diseases in the United States and 1 for which there is no \n     known cure;\n       Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are unknowing \n     carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene and individuals must \n     have 2 copies to have the disease;\n       Whereas 1 of every 3,500 babies born in the United States \n     is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has been \n     implemented by 12 States and facilitates early diagnosis and \n     treatment which improves health and longevity;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and \n     the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommend that all States \n     consider newborn screening for cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States \n     have cystic fibrosis, many of them children;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is in the mid-thirties, an improvement from a \n     life expectancy of 10 years in the 1960s, but still \n     unacceptably short;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of people who have the \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug therapies \n     beneficial to people who have the disease;\n       Whereas this innovative research is progressing faster and \n     is being conducted more aggressively than ever before, due in \n     part to the establishment of a model clinical trials network \n     by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation;\n       Whereas the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation marks its 50th year \n     in 2005, continues to fund a research pipeline for more than \n     2 dozen potential therapies, and funds a nationwide network \n     of care centers that extend the length and the quality of \n     life for people with cystic fibrosis, but lives continue to \n     be lost to this disease every day; and\n       Whereas education of the public on cystic fibrosis, \n     including the symptoms of the disease, increases knowledge \n     and understanding of cystic fibrosis and promotes early \n     diagnosis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 2005 as ``National Cystic Fibrosis \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to promote \n     awareness of cystic fibrosis and actively participate in \n     support of research to control or cure cystic fibrosis, by \n     observing the month with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities; and\n       (3) supports the goals of--\n       (A) increasing the quality of life for individuals with \n     cystic fibrosis by promoting public knowledge and \n     understanding in a manner that will result in earlier \n     diagnoses;\n       (B) encouraging increased resources for research; and\n       (C) increasing levels of support for people who have cystic \n     fibrosis and their families.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President. I rise today to submit a bipartisan \nresolution deeming May 2005 as ``National Cystic Fibrosis Month.'' I \nwish more than anything that this resolution were not necessary, and \nthat we had already cured this terrible disease. But CF continues to \nhaunt thousands of families, and with this resolution, the Senate is \nsaying to those families that we hear your suffering and we are going \nto do all we can to ensure we help stop it.\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\n  I have seen many advances in medicine since my childhood on the ranch \nin Conejos County, CO. These advances have opened up opportunities for \npeople living with disabilities and debilitating disease. People are \nliving longer and healthier lives, even as they face debilitating \ndiseases.\n  One such disease is Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disease that leads to \nlife-threatening lung infections. Through advances in medication and \nother treatments, people with CF are living longer lives. In the 1950s, \npeople with CF rarely lived to school age. Today, life expectancy for \npeople with CF has reached into the thirties. That is an improvement--\nand as a result people with CF get many more years to spend with their \nfamilies and to follow their dreams--but it is not good enough.\n  This resolution supports the CF Foundation's goal of increased \nscreening of newborns for CF. The earlier the disease is detected, the \nmore likely that treatments can extend life. It also applauds the \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation's work to create and maintain communication \namong researchers on Cystic Fibrosis across the nation. As a result of \nthe CF Foundation's efforts, close to 200 centers across the nation are \nsharing information. That research and experience can improve lives.\n  Following the tradition of my predecessor and fellow Coloradan, Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, I have submitted this resolution to send a clear \nsignal to the country that we are dedicated to defeating this disease. \nThe resolution has broad and deep bipartisan support, and I thank my \ncolleagues for the dedication to health research on Cystic Fibrosis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/20/senate-section/article/S4037-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 116--COMMEMORATING THE LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND \n                  CONTRIBUTIONS OF FREDERICK C.
