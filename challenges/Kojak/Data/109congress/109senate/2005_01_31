Mr. President, today we are in a period for morning \nbusiness with Senators permitted to speak and introduce legislation. We \nare hoping to confirm the nomination of Samuel Bodman to be Secretary \nof Energy. We expect that nomination to require little or no debate and \na rollcall vote is not anticipated. Therefore, we do not expect any \nrollcall votes today.\n  In addition to the Bodman nomination, this week we expect to consider \nthe nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United \nStates. I have been discussing with the Democratic leader the prospects \nfor an agreement for debate and a vote on the Gonzales nomination. I \nunderstand Members wish to talk on that nomination, but at some point I \nhope we can reach an agreement as to a reasonable period for debate and \na time certain to vote.\n  I will continue to discuss this matter with the Democratic leader, \nand I hope to lock in a consent agreement at the earliest time. We have \ntalked about it this morning and we will be talking about it over the \ncourse of the day and tomorrow.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary designate, Mr. Chertoff, is also \nexpected to be reported by committee later this week. Following that, \nas soon as possible we would like to consider this nomination as well.\n  As a reminder to our colleagues, the President will deliver the State \nof the Union Address on Wednesday evening. Senators are asked to begin \ngathering in the Senate Chamber at 8:30 on Wednesday so we can proceed \npromptly at 8:40 to the Hall of the House of Representatives for the 9 \np.m. address.\n  I do want to thank everyone for their attention and will have further \nupdates on the schedule at the close today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S615-6", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S615-S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HISTORIC DAY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly I will comment on what has \nbeen a very historic occasion in Iraq, something that has been \nsymbolized on television and by pictures so vividly by the image of \nthat blue ink-stained index finger which is being held up in triumph. \nTwo days ago, people did not even think of that image and today it \nsymbolizes freedom and liberty, those basic elements of democracy that \nwe all cherish.\n  Yesterday, the Iraqi people, 8 million strong, went to the polls to \nparticipate in the first free Iraqi election in decades. We were in \nIraq 3 weeks ago, and before we went to Iraq even at that time people \nwere saying there is no way these elections are going to be successful, \nnobody is going to show up for these elections, and to jump 3 weeks \nahead to today and yesterday and to see those ink-stained fingers in \nthe air and the fact that approximately 8 million voted is truly \nspectacular. I think all of us should feel real pride for the \ncourageous men and women who risked their lives for freedom. Those \npictures on the news really captured it.\n  The people who voted came by foot, bus, van. They were old and they \nwere young. They were men and women. It was all in defiance of the \nintimidation by terrorists, thugs, and assassins. In spite of the \ncritics and the doubters,\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nmillions of Iraqis stood in line and cast their vote. As they came out, \nwe saw those pictures of those ink-stained index fingers, the symbol of \nthe power that is captured in that vote of freedom and democracy.\n  The Iraqi people yesterday showed their bravery, their boldness, \ntheir courage, and their heart. They showed the world that Iraqis, like \nall people, do yearn to be free. Baghdad's mayor was so overcome with \nemotion that he told one news agency:\n\n       I cannot describe what I am seeing. It is incredible. This \n     is a vote for the future, for the children, for the rule of \n     law, for humanity, for love.\n\n  This morning, and over the course of yesterday, I received numerous \ne-mails, letters, and written communication. The following letter from \nan Iraqi voter describing his elation at participating in this historic \nmoment for his country really captures the essence of what the \nelections were all about. He writes:\n\n       Allow me on this historical opportunity to tell you how \n     happy I am, and all those who I know. It is a great victory \n     for Iraq, the United States and all freedom-loving people in \n     the world. This is the event that children of future \n     generations will read about in history books with great pride \n     and appreciation to all who made it happen.\n       Today a new Iraq was born. This is the first seed of true \n     democracy and freedom in our country and indeed the whole \n     Arab world. Thanks to all who participated in, contributed \n     to, protected and supported this historical event.\n\n  I also will want to applaud President Bush and the American people \nfor their steadfast commitment, support, and encouragement of freedom \nin Iraq. Peace has not come and is not coming easily. We have suffered \ntough days and we all know there will be tough days ahead. We know the \nterrorists are committed to their violent campaign, but they will not \nsucceed.\n  As we saw yesterday, Iraq is moving forward with the heartfelt \nsupport of free peoples all around the world. One of the people who \nwill be instrumental in helping Iraq secure its freedom is our new \nSecretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice. Last week, this Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to support her confirmation, and that was a proud and, \nindeed, historic moment. We are all fortunate to have a leader of her \ntalent and intellect helping Iraq take each momentous step toward \ndemocracy.\n\n  It was a meaningful and productive week, as I look over the last \nseveral days. The Senate also confirmed former RNC Chairman Jim \nNicholson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Michael \nLeavitt to lead Health and Human Services. Both are talented, gifted, \nand highly qualified men, and I know we all look forward to working \nwith them.\n  Great tasks indeed are before us. We have much to accomplish, \nincluding, as I mentioned earlier, the confirmation of Judge Alberto \nGonzales.\n  As we think about the week ahead on this Monday, it is appropriate to \npause and take note of yesterday's historic achievement for the Iraqi \npeople and for the cause of democracy. As the President said in his \ninaugural address:\n\n       The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on \n     the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for \n     peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the \n     world.\n\n  Yesterday, we did come one step closer to realizing this great \nvision. Yesterday in Iraq we saw that liberty can light even the \ndarkest corners and inspire great acts of bravery. We saw the proof of \nour deepest held principle: That all people do aspire to be free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I, too, feel inspired and in fact moved to \ncomment on the elections in Iraq and also some other things that I have \nwitnessed during the last 2 days. I felt very emotional as I watched \nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice yesterday morning, during one of \nseveral interviews on television.\n  Specifically, I am speaking of Chris Wallace's interview of our new \nSecretary of State. It was one of the most impressive interviews I \nbelieve I have ever seen in my life. This is obviously a highly \ntalented, qualified, thoughtful, articulate person who has been sworn \nin to be Secretary of State. I have never seen a more moving interview \nin my many years in Washington, in fact over 36 years, than I witnessed \nduring the interchange between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and \nChris Wallace.\n  Actually, I found myself to the point of tears as I listened to what \nshe had to say, and how she said it. I was captivated by how she \nresponded not only to the world given the very important position that \nshe holds in answering those questions, but also on a personal basis by \nrepresenting what is good in America. This is a lady who came from \nBirmingham, AL, an African-American, who grew up at a time when \nBirmingham was segregated and it was difficult for her to get the \neducation, the experience, and the opportunities that she needed for \nlife.\n  She persevered, as did her family, friends, and neighbors, and she \nhas now risen to one of the most important positions in the world that \nanybody could have. She will be the face of America to the leaders of \nall of the rest of the world, and it is one that I believe they, as I, \nwill be impressed with.\n  I will read one part of what she had to say in that \ninterview. Interviewer Chris Wallace noted that he would play a clip \nfrom earlier this week at the White House when Condoleezza Rice was \nsworn in as Secretary of State and she referred to her relatives from \nAlabama who were there in the audience, and he asked his viewers to \ntake a look. Secretary Rice said:\n\n       They represent generations of Rices and Rays who believed \n     that a day like this might somehow be possible.\n\n  And then Wallace continued:\n\n       You have gone from a little girl in the segregated South to \n     being the chief representative of this country to the world. \n     What does that say about the United States?\n\n  At that point I felt sure that tears would well up in her eyes and \nshe would have difficulty responding, but she kept her composure while \nshe said this:\n\n       It says that the United States is a place that is living up \n     to its principles, that has had a struggle to do that. I[t] \n     also said in that, Chris, it was Thomas Jefferson who said \n     that the God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same \n     time and, of course, didn't himself personally carry that out \n     perfectly. . . .\n       It just shows that democracy, if you have the right \n     principles in place, if you have the right institutions in \n     place, it may take a long time, but eventually the \n     aspirations for one society unified despite race and gender \n     and religion can start to come into being.\n       We still have a lot of work to do in America. I look out \n     and I see that work. But I do believe that in a world where \n     difference is a license to kill, to look across and to see \n     people like me or Al Gonzales or others says that America is \n     trying desperately and, in some sense, succeeding, in living \n     up to those principles.\n\n  I thought that was a magnificent testament to her life, what she \nexperienced, what others are dealing with, but also what it means about \nour country and the hope for a lot of young boys and girls who see \nCondoleezza Rice in the position she is in and recognize that they can \nsucceed, too, in the American dream.\n  I continued to watch television, many different networks, and I \nstarted seeing the results of the Iraqi elections. It appears that it \nwas a good election with a good turnout. I don't know what the exact \nturnout percentages are. Reuters reported it as being perhaps as much \nas 72 percent, I believe. In some parts of the country it was more than \nthat, I would presume, and in others much less than that, but still an \nincredible turnout. Maybe it will be 60 percent, maybe it will be 58, \nmaybe it will be 62, but the people of Iraq, under the threat of \nintimidation or death or future abuse, went into those polling places \nin huge numbers, stuck their finger in that little bottle of dye, and \ncame out and showed it off proudly.\n  By the way, they are going to have to come to live with their dyed \nfinger the\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nnext couple of days. There will not be any hiding. If you voted in Iraq \ntoday, your finger will be stained today and tomorrow, but your life \nwill be changed henceforth.\n  Maybe we can learn from them. We didn't have a 60- or 70-percent \nturnout in our election. I don't know exactly what the turnout was, but \nI am sure it is much less than that in America where we don't vote if \nthe weather is not good or the traffic is too bad. But in Iraq they \nwalked to the polling places, they put their lives on the line, and \nthey were thrilled to be able to be a part of a historic event, of \ndemocracy in action, and they came out and danced in the streets. They \nsaid: We are very happy. They also said: Thank you, America.\n  A lot of credit can be passed out. It begins with the people of Iraq \nfor what they did yesterday, to the men and women who are trying to \nmake Iraq safe, their own policemen and national guard, and their own \nmilitary. But a lot of credit goes to our military men and women who \nhave done a marvelous job on the ground in Iraq. Even yesterday, they \nwere there. They helped provide as much security as they could, but \nthey were not interfering with the voters. They backed away. They left \nit to the people of Iraq and to their military and police and others.\n\n  I cannot give enough credit to the young men and women who have been \nthere and their officers and noncoms, all of them, soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and Coast Guard. Obviously, they have all been a part \nof this. When I have talked to the young troops we have there, they are \nproud of what they are doing. They feel patriotic about what they have \nhelped to do there.\n  Then, yesterday, they saw this begin to bear fruit. It doesn't mean \nthe Iraqi people are free from terrorism. It doesn't mean everything \nhas been done perfectly. It doesn't mean it is going to be perfect from \nhere on. We don't know yet who won their election. It was a very \ncomplicated process. They had to figure out who to vote for or what \nlist of people to vote for, and what number to identify. They still \nhave a long way to go in cultivating their democracy. But for me, it \nwas an inspiration. I was thrilled by what I saw, what I witnessed \nthrough the media. Not just one network or one station, all the \ndifferent ones that were there in the country, showing democracy at \nwork.\n  But also I believe credit has to go to our own Congress and the \nAmerican people for showing patience and forbearance and giving of \ntheir treasure and American blood for a distant place, for people you \ndon't really know. Many wonder, I am sure, sometimes, is it worth it? \nWhy are we there? How long are we going to be there? All those \nquestions come forward. But what struck me again yesterday was how \npeople react to freedom, how people react to democracy, being able to \ngo and cast their vote. It is liberating.\n  The President was right when he talked about the power of freedom and \ndemocracy and how it is a flame that is igniting a fire all around the \nworld over the last 20 years. We have gone from about 20 democracies in \nthe world to 118 countries all over the world, in every continent, in \nplaces where you would not have thought it would be possible: Mongolia, \nelections in Ukraine, elections by the Palestinians. There is something \nvery special going on here. I do believe it is contagious and that it \nwill continue to grow, and not only the American people but the people \nof the world will benefit.\n  The odds of having an attack from people in a country where there is \na democracy are much less than those who come from places where there \nis an oppressive government, dictatorship, or authoritarianism. \nDemocracy is not perfect; it is evolutionary. We know that from what we \nexperienced. But yesterday was a special moment. I hope the American \npeople saw it, felt proud of what they were witnessing and the part we \nhave played in making that day possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S617-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S617-S618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the future of \nSocial Security. In recent weeks we have heard a lot about the \nPresident's intent to establish private accounts under the program. \nWhile no details have been shared with Members of Congress regarding \nhis proposal, the limited information we have does indicate that the \nadministration will only push and support a long-term solvency fix if \nit is married with a plan to divert payroll taxes to individual private \naccounts.\n  Beyond the private account issue, it is unclear what the other \ndetails of the Bush plan will include. I am willing to work with the \nPresident and Members of Congress to improve the long-term outlook of \nthis program, but the American people need to be clear in their \nunderstanding of the facts. The fact is, Social Security is not in \ncrisis and private accounts will do nothing to help with the program's \nsolvency. Yes, we do need to think about the future of this program. I \nam willing to hear the President's thoughts and work with him on this \nissue, but I will not support any efforts to dismantle a program that \nhas protected millions in this country from poverty, and provided a \nguaranteed benefit for our most vulnerable citizens in their time of \nneed.\n  Social Security is the most important social insurance program ever \ncreated by this great nation, and it has provided seniors with the \nassurances they need in old age.\n  In South Dakota, one in five people count on this program to put food \non their table, buy their prescription drugs, and keep the heat running \nduring the long cold winters. The program protects millions from \npoverty, and without it, the number of seniors living in poverty would \nrise from 10 percent to 50 percent. This is the mark of a strong safety \nnet program and we must fight to ensure its longevity.\n  While in the long-term we do need to find a sound solution to protect \nthe solvency of the Social Security program, one thing must be \nprotected now--the guarantee to retirees that they do not have to worry \nabout living in poverty in old age, no matter what they made during \ntheir working years or how long they live. Seniors must be given the \nsecurity to know to the dime what they will receive under this program, \nrather than having to worry about the climate on Wall Street.\n  Since President Bush began his campaign for private accounts under \nSocial Security, he has tried to convince the American people that the \nprogram is in crisis. This manufactured crisis is merely fiction and \nwhen you begin to look at the real numbers, you learn very quickly that \nhis numbers just do not add up.\n  The administration has been trying to tell an alarming story in which \nthe program is broke in 2019. Reality tells us that in 2019 we will \njust begin to dip into the $3.7 trillion dollar trust fund to pay the \nSocial Security bills and we will be able to draw on that fund for a \nlong time--until 2052 according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  At that point in time, seniors will still receive 80 percent of \nprojected benefits, and still more in dollars adjusted for inflation \nthan what beneficiaries get today.\n  The real fiscal crisis facing our Government today is not in the \nSocial Security program, but rather in the Federal budget, which \naccording to the administration will reach a deficit of $427 billion \ndollars in 2005. This is the result of the irresponsible decisions of \nthe administration that has pushed tax cuts for the wealthy during time \nof war and continued to fight to make those tax cuts permanent. I was \nalarmed to learn that in fact the entire Social Security shortfall over \nthe next 75 years is about one-fifth the cost of the Bush tax cuts if \nmade permanent. Beyond these problems, the rising costs of our health \ncare programs will continue to threaten our budget stability. This is \nthe real crisis we are facing right now.\n  At the end of the day, when you look at the numbers and the financial \noutlook for Social Security, we are in good shape for at least the next \n50 years if not longer. When I look at the budget deficit today and a \npotential crisis 50 years from now, I am more concerned about ensuring \nthat our Government can continue to pay its bills now and restore \nfiscal sanity to the Federal Government so we can honor our commitments \nin the near term--for soldiers in Iraq, for insurance coverage for the \npoor and for prescription drugs for seniors.\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\n  In the short term, the administration's plan to establish private \naccounts will actually increase our budget deficit and cost the Federal \nGovernment approximately $2 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. He \nhas not indicated how he would pay for that, and so that number just \ngets added onto the Federal debt, not even accounting for whatever \nprivatization will cost us in the following years. Estimates indicate \nthat this increased borrowing, primarily from foreign nations--Japan, \nChina and others--could potentially double our publicly-held debt by \n2041, further increasing our dependence on foreign creditors.\n  Yes, any long-term savings the administration plan might create will \nbe at the expense of providing seniors and all Americans a guaranteed \nbenefit.\n  I do believe that we should at least start a discussion about the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and we should explore all options \nfor addressing this issue. I support encouraging Americans to establish \nprivate accounts only that are above and beyond what we do in Social \nSecurity right now. All of our citizens deserve a shot at a comfortable \nlife in their old age.\n  To get there we need to create a sturdy stool--a retirement security \nstool that provides a solid leg through a secure, guaranteed Social \nSecurity benefit; another leg helps protect the health and long-term \nhealth care needs of all people; and a third encourages individuals to \nsave money for their retirement years, through private accounts, \npensions and other programs. These are the things we should be thinking \nabout as we look to the future.\n  So what we have is a Social Security program right now that is solid, \naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, through the \nyear 2052, through the middle of this century. Even at the end of 2052, \nthose payments for young people today would actually be higher, \nadjusted for inflation, than the monthly payments that today's \nrecipients get. So is this a crisis? No. There is a problem, but there \nis not a crisis in the long term for Social Security.\n  What concerns me is that I think some of the proposals I am hearing \nabout have more to do with ideology, more to do with trying to move the \nGovernment away from providing that safety net than it does to actually \nsolving what problems that may exist.\n  I believe our seniors in South Dakota and across this country deserve \nto have a Social Security program with a defined benefit, that they \nwill know to the dime what it is they are going to get when they \nretire, and that it is not contingent on whether the market had a good \nyear or bad year in their runup time prior to their retirement. That \ndefined benefit ought to be the cornerstone, ought to be the \nfoundation, of every retirement. Whatever else happens, they should \nknow that will be there, and that it does not involve a gamble in the \nstock market.\n  I believe people ought to be saving more; that they ought to be \nprovided better mechanisms to set aside money which they can count on \nthat will be over and above Social Security, that will augment Social \nSecurity. I think we need to have a good discussion about IRAs and \n401(k)s and other kinds of pension mechanisms that will allow for \nprivate savings to augment Social Security.\n  But at the end of the day, the best thing this Government can do for \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security is to get our annual budget \ninto equilibrium so we can get back to where we were only 4 years ago--\nwith budget surpluses rather than utilizing Social Security surplus \ndollars for the ordinary expenses of Government; and, that we put \nourselves in a still stronger position midway through this century to \nmake sure every American gets the benefits to which they are entitled \nand which they expect to have.\n  I look forward to working with President Bush and with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle on ways in which we can assist with the \nnear-term crisis in Medicare, Medicaid, health care, the near-term \ncrisis in terms of the budget deficit which our Nation faces, and the \nlonger term problem that we have with Social Security, but in so doing \nI will not abandon the underlying philosophy of every American having a \ndefined benefit program that will be the foundation of their retirement \nplan and on which they can, in fact, count.\n  I look forward to a constructive and positive debate. Doing nothing \nis not the solution. But concocting false crises with remedies which \nactually make a situation worse than it is now cannot possibly be the \nroad that this Congress, this Senate wants to go down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S618-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S618-S619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHALLENGES BEFORE CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is again time, as we begin this session \nof Congress, when challenges are before us--the opportunity to work on \nprograms, some of which we worked on before and did not complete, some \nof which need to be worked on and haven't; such things as energy \npolicy, of course, which we have worked on for some time. We are \nbecoming more and more dependent as time goes by and as our consumption \nincreases and our production does not.\n  The highway bill we talked about for a good long time. It is most \nimportant for our economy, for our jobs, for our transportation, and we \nhaven't been able to handle it in the last couple of years; to move \ninto something such as the class action activity that we are committed \nto so that we are not moving the liability claims around to different \nStates to find a jurisdiction that is most favorable; and to do \nsomething about tax simplification. We always talk about that. The Tax \nCode is that thick, and yet we continue to have it.\n  We have a real opportunity to do a number of things, and I hope we \nare able to do that. I hope we are able to have an honest debate and \ndiscussion. We did have different points of view, obviously, but I hope \nwe move towards finding solutions to coming together better than \nperhaps we have in the past.\n  In addition--I guess this is really what I would like to comment \nabout briefly today--I think we also have an opportunity and a \nresponsibility to take a look at some of the existing programs, many of \nwhich have been in place far too long a time; indeed, maybe they should \nbe. On the other hand, I think from time to time we need to have some \nkind of a system where we go back and take a look at older programs and \nsee, as time changes, if those programs are still efficient, necessary, \nand as opportune as they were in the beginning.\n  We have new programs all the time, and we tend not to take a look at \nsome of the ones that are in place to see indeed if they are still \nneeded, to see if they do the job as well as they have been, and to see \nif they are as efficient as they can be.\n  I have in my desk a notebook that is nearly that thick with all the \nprograms the Federal Government has in place. There are actually \nthousands of programs that are in place. Some are major and some are \nnot, but nevertheless they are there. We are talking about balancing \nthe budget and so on. Some of that ought to reflect the expenditures \nwhich have been going on for a long time, and still continue to go on.\n  Of course, when you have a program out there, the nature of it is \nthat people get involved and it develops its own constituency which \nmakes it difficult to change from time to time. I hope we can do some \nreevaluations of the ones that we have. We have some programs that \nobviously need to be changed.\n  The Senator from South Dakota was talking about Social Security. \nObviously, it needs to be changed. He argues about whether it is a \ncrisis, but the fact is, for one thing all the money that is in the so-\ncalled trust fund is not in the trust fund at all. There are IOUs in \nthere that have to be repaid. In order to go beyond the 20-, 13-, or \n18-year program that we talk about in order get to the 45-year program, \nthat money has to be in place.\n\n  There are some ideas about doing that. Of course, a number of things \ncould be done. Payments could be attached to the benefits' costs rather \nthan to inflation, and a number of things. They will all be considered, \nof course.\n  There seems to be a lot of reaction to the so-called personal \naccounts. I think one thing that has to be considered by everyone who \nis interested, No. 1, people who are 55 or so are not affected at\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nall and will continue to go on as they have. Furthermore, those who \naren't--the younger people--it is a choice they will make. Those are \nsome of the things that need to be looked at to go forward.\n  I am personally very much in favor of encouraging people to have \nsavings benefits of their own. After all, Social Security was designed \nto be a retirement supplement. In order to make it work really well, we \nhave to have a program that is cost effective.\n  Medicare and Medicaid are in real financial difficulty--not only some \nof the Government programs themselves as they go forward but, because \nthe impact of the cost of health care is not always fully paid by \nMedicaid and Medicare, the costs are shifted to people who have private \ninsurance. That the entire cost is going up, the entire program--a \ngreat health care program in this country--becomes limited in access \nbecause of the costs. We have to do something about that.\n  As I mentioned, we have literally thousands of programs that are in \nplace. I am not suggesting they are not useful. I am suggesting, \nhowever, that there needs to be some kind of a process. It is my \nunderstanding that OMB is talking about something that has some kind of \na commission which would review the programs from time to time. I think \nthat is a great idea. I don't know whether those programs are the ones \nwe ought to have, and whether the Congress ought to appoint a \ncommission, but there ought to be a way of evaluating, No. 1, how \nappropriate it is to continue those programs the same as we did 10 or \n20 years ago, and whether those programs are being as effectively \noperated as they could be.\n  Sometimes when we talk about efficiency, we get a lot of feedback \nfrom people. But why shouldn't there be more efficient Government \nprograms? We ought to ensure that, indeed, they are.\n  I think that is something we ought to take a look at to see if we \ncan't have some kind of evaluation. I know it could be very time \nconsuming. On the other hand, I think we could find ways to take a look \nperiodically at the programs.\n  I wish we had some kind of a criteria for what kinds of programs are \nappropriate for the Federal Government. Particularly with programs that \nhave some political clout for a Member, we find ourselves bringing it \nup and going with it. Some things you would really have a hard time \nsaying they are an appropriate function of the Federal Government. \nThere are so many things that could be done much better by State and \nlocal governments or by the private sector, but if it has some \npolitical appeal, we want to hop in there and do that.\n  I don't know exactly what it would be, but it would seem to me it \nwould make sense if we had some criteria to say these are the kinds of \nconditions that would justify Federal involvement, not only because of \nthe cost but most of us would like to see some control.\n\n  We talk about deficits, but we never seem to talk about holding down \nthe activities and the size of the Federal Government. I know these are \neasy things to talk about but difficult things to resolve.\n  I guess the President is suggesting that as we go about our work we \nhopefully will keep in mind a couple of thoughts. One is periodic \nevaluation of programs to make sure they are, in fact, efficient, \neffective, and still necessary. The other is that we take a look at \nsome of the various prospects which are brought up.\n  For example, I chair a subcommittee which deals with national \nhistoric sites. We have a long list of national historic sites. Some of \nthem, quite frankly, you would have a hard time justifying in terms of \nany national significance. There are very likely to be some things \nwhich are good for the main street of someone's hometown. Of course, we \nall want to do that. But there needs to be some criteria so it fits \ninto this program.\n  These are some of the things I hope we can take a look at and make \nthe Federal involvement a little less widespread and make sure what we \nare doing is done efficiently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my good \nfriend and colleague from my neighboring State of Wyoming.\n  There are common grounds on issues that he has raised. I certainly \nagree that we need to always be on the alert for ways to find \nefficiencies in our Federal budget. However, I think we also need to \nkeep in mind the reality that the domestic discretionary share of the \nFederal budget is now about 16 percent of that budget.\n  As we look at ways to get our Federal budget back into equilibrium, \none of the best solutions I believe would be to return to the budget \nrules which existed throughout the 1990s--the so-called budget rules \nwhich require a Congress any time it attempts to raise the spending \nabove a certain baseline or cut taxes simultaneously to explain how it \nis going to be paid for so that the end result is budget neutrality, \nallowing the Government to grow its way out of budget deficits. That is \nthe reason we had three consecutive years of budget surpluses in the \n1990s. I believe we need to return to that kind of budget discipline. \nRegrettably, the administration opposes that discipline. But I believe, \ngiven the massive size of today's budget deficit, we need to create \nthat structure once again.\n  It concerns me when people allude to the Social Security trust fund \nas though it were some fictitious entity. The Federal Government \nborrows the money currently out of surplus dollars that come in through \nSocial Security taxes--FICA taxes--and then issues to the trust fund a \nTreasury bond. It is no different than all the other borrowing the \nFederal Government does. The Federal Government has never in our entire \nNation's history reneged on its bonded indebtedness. We would never \ndream of doing that and destroying our creditworthiness \ninternationally. It would be, I believe, an immoral act to do so.\n  The only reason there could be a long-term crisis in Social Security \nis if this administration and future administrations determine not to \npay back its bonded indebtedness to the Social Security trust fund. It \nwould be an unprecedented step. We need to make sure that is a step \nthat is not taken. One of the best ways of doing that is to get our \noverall Federal budget back into equilibrium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S619-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S619-S621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Another issue about which I will share some thoughts \nwith my colleagues today is my hope--and I think it is shared by our \nentire Nation--that this election in Iraq is the beginning of a new \nera, beginning of a greater era of stability and opportunity for the \nUnited States to diminish its presence in that very troubled place.\n  My own oldest son served in combat in Iraq, and I appreciate \nprofoundly the sacrifices and the risks and the courage of so many who \nhave served our Nation there and in other dangerous places around the \nworld.\n  We have this hope while at the same time recognizing that one \nelection does not a democracy make; that the potential for ongoing \nviolence, for chaos in many parts of that difficult country remain, and \nthe election will be viewed more credibly by some than by others. I am \npleased the turnout seems to be significant, seems to be supportive, \ncertainly, in the Kurdish and Shiite regions; less so in the Sunni \nareas where most of the violence has centered. Nonetheless, it is our \nhope this is a beginning, a start, at least, to the point where we can \nbegin to take troops at some near rather than later time back home to \nthe United States.\n  We have paid a dear price. We are expending in the range of $2 \nbillion per week in Iraq, in a country that was a regional threat, was \nnot involved in international terror, but which was a regional threat \nto its neighbors at one time. It certainly is our hope the efforts that \nare ongoing there will lead to the ``Iraqification,'' if you will, of \nthat country and the development of some self-governance in Iraq. The \nexpenditure has been immense. We have not seen President Bush's budget \nfor the next fiscal year yet. I am told to anticipate we will be \nspending $1 billion per minute on defense. This is a remarkable \nundertaking, an obligation that we are going to have to deal with. It \nis my hope we will in the future approach these conflicts with a \ngreater\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\neye toward multilateralism, toward cooperation with our allies--whether \nit be NATO, the U.N. or other regional security groups--and that we \nunderstand the reality that it is much easier to win wars than it is to \nwin peace. It is certainly our hope that perhaps today marks some \nbeginning in the progress toward if not peace, at least greater peace \nand greater stability than currently exists in that nation.\n  I commend the troops who have served with such courage and such \ndistinction, their families. I have contacted two South Dakota parents \njust today about the loss of their sons' lives. It is something that \nstrikes home to me in a very profound way because of the experience of \nmy own son. These families will never be the same. These losses are \ndevastating. We sometimes see the numbers in the newspapers and treat \nit as though it were just another daily event, but each and every day \nthese losses constitute a life-shattering experience for so many \nparents, so many families, so many spouses, so many children. We should \nnever look lightly on the contributions, the courage, the distinction, \nthe professionalism exhibited by these troops, and let us, as a Senate, \ndo still more to see to it that to the degree we put these young men \nand women in harm's way we do so selectively where no other recourse is \nrealistic and that when they are in harm's way they have the equipment, \nthe ammunition, the body armor, the other resources they need to \nminimize what is already an enormous risk to each and every one of them \neach day they serve in that country.\n  I express gratitude to our troops, their families, and caution that \nwe still have a long way to go. The administration has indicated we may \nhave troops in Iraq for another 5 years. I hope it is not that long. I \nhope we can see progress that will allow us to get every single one of \nour troops home sooner rather than later; that we can get this massive \nexpenditure off the shoulders of America's taxpayers and be able to \ndevote more of those dollars to the domestic needs we have in the \nUnited States, but at the same time recognizing yesterday was a day of \nsome hope and expectation that perhaps better times will come in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me acknowledge my colleague from the \nState of South Dakota, who is unique in this Chamber. Those who voted \non the question of whether America should go to war in Iraq were \ncertainly representing our constituents in thinking of the American \npeople in that historic and tremendous decision. My colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Tim Johnson, was the only Member of the Senate who \nunderstood that decision would affect his family directly. I am glad \nyour son is home safely. I am glad he is now living in Illinois. I hope \nhe is still enjoying that experience and happy about his recent \nmarriage to a Lithuanian-American woman, and I wish them the very best.\n  For those who ask the question, and it has been asked by some, How \ncan Members of Congress appreciate what a war means if none of their \nchildren are serving, my colleague, Tim Johnson from South Dakota \ncertainly understood that personally as others have in the past.\n  What a great triumph yesterday. There was a possibility that all the \nviolence in Iraq would discourage people from voting. One can \nunderstand that when they are lobbing mortar shells in the green zone, \nthe protected zone in Baghdad where American soldiers a couple weeks \nago were eating a meal. One can understand the vulnerability of life in \nIraq.\n  Each citizen had to make a decision yesterday in Iraq, whether to \nrisk their life to vote. It appears millions were prepared to do so. As \nSenator Lott of Mississippi said earlier, after they voted, they dipped \ntheir finger into this indelible ink, an indication they had already \nvoted so there was no duplication voting, and that ink was on their \nhands today, testimony, as well, for the insurgents that these Iraqis \nhad defied the insurgency to cast a vote for their future.\n  It was a great triumph, a triumph of human spirit, and a triumph for \nthe Iraqi people, all that they have been through, to finally have this \nmoment to have an election. A great deal has to be said for the men and \nwomen of our American military who made it possible. They risked their \nlives again yesterday, as they do every day in Iraq, to try to bring \nthis to a peaceful end. They were successful yesterday in creating the \nzone of safety so that the Iraqi people could be part of this \ntriumphant moment in their history.\n  I thought about that triumphant moment as I reflected on information \nI received over the weekend about two Marine Corps corporals from \nIllinois who died on January 26 of last week in the deadliest day of \nthe war for the United States. That was the day when the Marine Corps \nhelicopter crashed and 31 Marines lost their lives. Among those 31 \nMarines were Hector Ramos of Aurora and Nathaniel Moore of Champaign, \nyoung men in their twenties who volunteered to serve this country, who \nwith great pride joined the Marine Corps, went through the rigorous \ntraining, and went off to risk their lives for America. That story has \nbeen told and retold thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of \nthousands of times, but we do not appreciate how important that \ndecision is by each of the men and women in the military until a \ntragedy occurs, as it did with the crash of this helicopter a few days \nago.\n\n  I read the stories in the paper about the two young men. They were \nexcellent people. I am sorry I did not get to know them. I dropped \nnotes to their families expressing my sorrow about their loss, and I am \nsure everyone in America will join in expressing sorrow for the loss of \nsome 1,400 now, American soldiers, who have made the supreme sacrifice \nin this war in Iraq.\n  What it leads to is this: If yesterday was a turning point in Iraq \nfor their self-governance, the question I am prepared to ask is, Was \nyesterday a turning point in terms of Iraq's security in its future? We \nhave been trying for almost 2 years to train Iraqis to take \nresponsibility for guarding their own country, and we have had a \nterrible time of it. The administration gives us inflated numbers, \n120,000 Iraqis in their army and security force, and yet other military \nexperts say no, only 4,000 will be willing to stand and fight. Many \nmore have gone through the training, but they are not willing to defend \ntheir country.\n  So what happens? One-hundred fifty thousand Americans risk their \nlives just like the marines who went down in that helicopter last week \nand the others who have died since.\n  My question to this administration in the White House here, as well \nas the new government in Baghdad, is this: Now that you have reached \nthis new point in your history of self-governance, of the \nresponsibility of controlling your own future and your own fate, will \nyou now step up and meet with our President and our leaders and discuss \nthe day and how soon it will come when Iraq can defend itself? How soon \ncan we expect Iraqis, trained, well-equipped, to stand in and take the \nplace of American soldiers to come home?\n  Illinois is not unlike a lot of other States. Seventy percent of our \nNational Guard have been activated or have already served in Iraq. I \nhave attended sendoffs and the welcome-homes. They are emotional times. \nI went a few weeks ago to Litchfield, IL, and saw 80 of our National \nGuardsmen who were activated in an infantry unit off for 5 months \ntraining in Ft. Stewart, GA, and for a 12-month deployment in Iraq. \nEmotions ran high in the Litchfield High School gymnasium that Saturday \nafternoon as the troops stood at attention and the families faced them \nand we all wished them the very best and told them they would be in our \nprayers, as they should be.\n  I would like to be able to say to the families who are waiting \nanxiously back in the United States that the election yesterday meant \nsomething. It meant that we have reached a turning point. It meant that \nIraq is now going to take responsibility for its own future. We have \nbeen talking about it for a long time, for over a year and a half, and \nhave little to show for it. Now is the time for concrete results, for \nthis administration to meet with the new Government of Iraq and to \nstart moving in a specific pattern, in a definable\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nschedule, toward a real goal of starting to bring American troops home.\n  When I hear that, then I will be ready to stand up and applaud what \nhappened yesterday; not just for the courage of the voters but the \ncourage and leadership of the new Government in Iraq, that they will \nstand up for their people so that our soldiers can come home safely, \nwhich is what we all pray for.\n  That is what I took from yesterday's election, a great triumph for \nthe Iraqi people. Tragedies that we have seen involving Americans, I \nhope, will diminish now. This administration has to move us beyond the \npromise to the reality of the Iraqis defending themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S621-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the New York Times yesterday, Thomas Friedman, their \nforeign correspondent, made a valuable suggestion that relates both to \nthe Energy Department, which Dr. Bodman will be heading, as well as our \nchallenge in the Middle East. It is a point I have made but not as \neloquently as Thomas Friedman in his article.\n  He said he is now part of what he calls a ``geo green movement,'' and \nhe defined it as follows: The United States of America should be moving \ntoward energy conservation and new renewable sources of energy to \nlessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The vast majority of Americans believe that is a good thing. I \ncertainly do. You would believe that most people in this Chamber would. \nBut not when it comes to the actual votes on better fuel economy and \nbetter fuel efficiency for America's trucks and cars. I have tried \nseveral times unsuccessfully to pass this.\n  How can we honestly talk about reducing our dependence on foreign oil \nwhen we continue to drive these SUVs and trucks and cars with worse gas \nmileage every year? Almost 50 percent of the oil we import goes into \nrefineries in indoor gasoline tanks. And unless or until we use less of \nthat oil, we cannot reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  The point being made by Mr. Friedman in his article is that when \nAmerica needs less foreign oil, and the price of a barrel of oil comes \ndown, then a lot of these countries in the Middle East that supply us \nwith oil will no longer be able to subsidize the lifestyles of \nmonarchies and the governments of inequity. They will be forced to open \nand diversify their economy. Women will go to school. You will have \nmore training of people in the workforce.\n  But as long as we have an inflated cost for a barrel of oil, and they \nare bringing millions if not billions of dollars from the United States \ninto these Middle Eastern countries, there is no impetus or force for \nchange in that society or lifestyle.\n  So Mr. Friedman challenges us in Congress and in this Government to \nmove toward more fuel efficiency and more fuel economy, to lower the \nprice of oil and to create another force toward democratization, toward \nopening the societies and governments of the Middle East. It is hard to \ndo. It is hard to do without Government action.\n  My wife and I were recently looking for a new car, so we kind of laid \ndown some rules: We wanted to buy American. We did not want an SUV. We \ndid not need a big car like that. And we wanted something that is fuel \nefficient.\n  Well, good luck. In America, there were not many choices. We kept \nreading about the Ford Escape hybrid. As we read about this possibility \nof 35, 36 miles a gallon in the city, we went out and put in an \napplication for one. Do you know it took 5 months to get it? Those cars \nare in such high demand now you cannot buy them.\n  So there is a market out there, and we need to encourage that market \nfor fuel efficiency and fuel economy. It is not only good for reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil, it is good for the environment to burn \nless gasoline.\n  I gave a speech 2 weeks ago in Chicago to a group of professional \nengineers and talked to them about energy and about the need for \nconservation. They stood up and said: We can't understand why the \nSenate doesn't get it. Why aren't we moving toward more fuel efficiency \nand more fuel economy?\n  Well, the honest answer is this: The Big Three in Detroit have been \nslow to this issue. Once again, they were scooped by the Japanese who \noffered hybrid automobiles long before Detroit offered them.\n  Why, with all of our great engineering schools, with all of the great \nscientists and departments of science in our major universities, do we \nalways run a distant second when it comes to this new technology on \nautomobiles and trucks? I do not understand it. Detroit seems to be a \nyear behind consumer needs and appetites. I hope that changes, and \nchanges soon.\n  I spoke to Dr. Bodman about this, and he reminded me it is more the \nprovince for the Department of Transportation than the Department of \nEnergy. But when we consider an energy bill Senator Domenici will bring \nto the floor soon, look closely to see if there will be one word in \nthere about fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. The last time there was \nscant reference to this challenge we face.\n  Well, we have to look at that from a new perspective, an honest \nperspective that will not only help us and our environment and lessen \nour dependence on foreign oil but force some changes in the countries \nin the Middle East which, sadly, will not change unless there is some \noutside force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S621-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S621-S623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to an unrelated \nissue but one which has been of great concern to me for some time and \nto many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle; that is, the \nsituation in Darfur.\n  Last week, the United Nations Commission on Inquiry was expected to \nissue its report on the Darfur situation in Sudan. Public releases have \nnow been delayed until the beginning of February.\n  That is unfortunate given the urgency of the crisis on the ground. It \nis one more delay among so many that have cost lives and delayed \njustice.\n  What media attention the Commission's report receives may focus on \nthe question of genocide. That question revolves around whether the \ntens of thousands of killings, the systematic rapes, the destruction \nand bombing of villages, the burning of fields, and the poisoning of \nwells in Darfur constitutes genocide.\n  I believe it does. Congress has called it genocide in a resolution \nwhich we passed on a bipartisan basis last year. President Bush has \ncalled it genocide.\n  The use of that word is significant. President Clinton--and I \nsupported so many parts of his administration--made a serious mistake \nin foreign policy in not referring to Rwanda as a genocide. Many \nAmericans now are seeing through the movies what happened in Rwanda. \nThey read about it, but it was so far away. This movie ``Hotel \nRwanda,'' talks about one man who tried to save so many innocent people \nduring the course of what was clearly a genocide. For reasons I cannot \nexplain, the Clinton administration was reluctant to use the word.\n  Now comes the situation in Darfur in Sudan. And this administration, \nto their credit, has used the word ``genocide.'' Why is that important? \nIt is important because civilized countries of the world agreed, \ndecades ago, that if a genocide should occur, we will not stand idly \nby. Now, why? Because we remember what happened in the holocaust in \nWorld War II.\n  You probably saw the references over the weekend to the anniversary \ncelebration of Auschwitz and some of the surviving prisoners who went \nback, Jewish survivors who came to that same place where so many lost \ntheir lives, remembering what happened 60 years ago, and how they were \nfinally liberated by the Russian soldiers who came to cut the barbed \nwire and free them. That was a genocide of the Jewish people and \nothers.\n  We decided after the knowledge of that incident that we would stand \nas civilized nations and say: Never again. If there is a systematic \nattempt to kill off a people or a population, we will respond. That is \nwhy the use of the word ``genocide'' by Secretary of State Colin \nPowell, by the Congress, and by the President has such historic \nsignificance--not that we are just acknowledging the problem, but we \nare acknowledging a responsibility to do something about it.\n  Think about that. If we accept the moral responsibility of \nrecognizing the problem, do we not have an equally great if not greater \nmoral responsibility to do something about it?\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\n  That word, ``genocide'' was invented in the killing fields of the \n20th century, but it certainly describes Darfur.\n  The use of the word matters. It carries the weight of history in a \nway that no other word can.\n  But calling it genocide by our Government has not stopped the killing \nin Darfur. It has not triggered a meaningful international response \nbecause words, no matter how much they matter, are not actions.\n  The discussion that emerges from this report should not be about \nwords; it should be about action and what we can do to stop the \nkilling.\n  A few weeks ago, Sudan reached a landmark peace agreement. You see, \nthis poor country was driven by two conflicts, one in the south and one \nin the west. Sudan reached a landmark peace agreement relative to the \nnorth-south conflict, the conflict that has racked their country for \ndecades.\n  The Naivasha agreement should be celebrated. But this peace agreement \ndoes not include Darfur, a separate region that is facing its own \ngenocidal conflict.\n  In the last 10 days, over 100 people have been killed and more than \n9,000 were injured by Janjaweed rebels, according to the United \nNations. Reports from the BBC indicate that the Sudanese Air Force may \nhave bombed a Darfur town, killing another 100 people.\n  Today, there are approximately 1,400 African Union troops in Darfur, \na region roughly the size of France or Iraq--1,400 peacekeepers from \nthe African Union. They cannot stop the killing. In fact, that is not \neven their mission. They are supposed to be monitors of the cease-fire \nthat has badly broken down. Their mission is just too limited, and \ntheir resources and numbers are too few.\n  Eleven years ago, we failed to act when the machetes came out in \nRwanda. Eight hundred thousand people paid for our inaction with their \nlives in that African nation.\n  We cannot make the same mistake in Darfur. Americans understand that. \nWhen Americans were asked in a recent poll whether they thought the \nUnited Nations should step in with military force and stop the genocide \nin Darfur, three out of four Americans said yes. The support is \nbipartisan. In fact, Republicans favor intervention even more \nwholeheartedly than Democrats in this poll.\n  Almost two-thirds of those surveyed believe the United States should \nbe willing to contribute troops to an international effort to stop the \ngenocide.\n  Let me just say a word about that. As I would have the troops, \n150,000, start coming home from Iraq, and it would take a small \nfraction of that number to create a presence in the Sudan to make a \ndifference. President Bush demonstrated that in Liberia last year. Just \nthe mere presence of some marines on the ground stopped the killing.\n  When they come to understand--these African rebels, these killers--\nthat the United States will stand up to them, they back off. African \nUnion troops, 1,400 of them, have not been able to convey that message. \nAmericans believe the world should act, but they do not believe it \nwill, according to the same polls. I hope our actions prove their \npessimism wrong.\n  In Sudan, we have seen violence carried out by the Government, in \nsome cases by antigovernment rebels and by the Janjaweed, the \ngovernment-sponsored militia whose name translates roughly as ``evil \nhorsemen.''\n\n  Now, the Book of Revelations in the Bible reads as follows:\n\n       I looked, and there before me was a pale horse. Its rider \n     was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. \n     They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by \n     sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the \n     earth.\n\n  That must be what it feels like to be the people of the Sudan when \nthe Janjaweed ride in.\n  In the New Yorker this summer, Samantha Power, who has written so \nforcefully about genocide in the history of the world, and particularly \nin Rwanda, described a woman named Amina. This 26-year-old mother found \nthe wells of her village stuffed with corpses. One of them might have \nbeen the body of her 10-year-old son. She is not sure. She only found \nhis decapitated head. That is one story among 70,000 in Darfur--70,000 \nstories of men, women, and children who have been killed. And their \nnumbers grow every day.\n  We have to help stop this. The people of Darfur have borne witness to \nall four horsemen of the Apocalypse--conquest, war, famine, and death.\n  The United States needs to forge a long-term strategy toward Sudan \nthat helps that nation build on its north-south peace agreement. It is \nour responsibility, based on international law, strategic interests, \nand moral values.\n  The Convention against genocide spells out our legal obligations. \nStrategically, Sudan is the largest country in Africa. Its influence \nextends well beyond its borders. And from a moral perspective, the \nvictims of conflict in that nation demand mechanisms for justice, \npeace, and reconciliation. We must be our brother's keeper.\n  Darfur represents a turning point for Sudan, for Africa, and, yes, \nfor the world. If we can collectively respond, however belatedly, we \nset a new benchmark, not for death and destruction but for conflict \nresolution and accountability.\n  President Bush, in his inaugural address, said that our freedom in \nAmerica is attached to the freedom of other peoples. Some said he went \ntoo far, that was too broad a mandate. The United States cannot, in \nfact, police the world. And the President answered by saying that is \nour aspiration, our ideal, our goal. It is not a commitment we will do \nin every country where freedom is being lost every day. I think that is \na reasonable response from the President. But certainly in this Darfur \nregion we understand the lack of freedom relates directly not just to \ntyranny but to death.\n  There are a series of concrete steps we ought to take. First, I \nbelieve the President should name a new special envoy for peace in \nSudan. John Danforth, our former Ambassador to the United Nations, \nshowed us how important that position can be. My hope is the President \nwill name another individual of similar stature and ability to direct \nour efforts.\n  Second, the African Union has undertaken a noble mission, but it is \nunderfunded and undermanned. We have to work with the African Union to \nprovide whatever logistical or technical assistance is needed to speed \nup this deployment.\n  The African Union represents the vanguard of conflict resolution on \nthe continent of Africa. Anything we can offer to help it expand its \npeacekeeping capabilities will have repercussions and benefits far \nbeyond the nation of Sudan.\n  Third, the people of Darfur deserve justice. It took too long for the \nworld to pay attention, but the fact is, we have finally awakened.\n  If there is no accountability in Darfur, what hope is there \nelsewhere? Otherwise, the message we send is that one may kill, rape, \nand terrorize with impunity because while the world may call this \ngenocide, it does not act.\n  The International Criminal Court was founded to address ``the most \nserious crimes of concern to the international community.'' What can be \nmore serious, more heinous, than the genocide that has taken place in \nDarfur, that is still taking place in Darfur?\n  The International Criminal Court was designed just for this terrible \nmoment, and I believe the United Nations Security Council should refer \nthis case to the ICC.\n  In a recent editorial in the Washington Post, former Bush \nadministration official Jack Smith argued that support for the ICC was \ninconsistent with U.S. law and administration policy. Smith wrote:\n\n       The Darfur case allows the United States to argue that \n     Security Council referrals are the only valid route to the \n     ICC prosecutions and that countries that are not parties to \n     the ICC (such as the United States) remain immune from ICC \n     control in the absence of such a referral.\n\n  An ICC referral has the advantages of speed and structure, but it is \nnot the only path to justice. The Security Council could instead \nauthorize the creation of an independent tribunal on human rights and \ncrimes in Darfur as it has for Rwanda and other cases. This will cost \nmore money, and it will probably cost time, but it is an option. What \nis more important is that the international community pursues \naccountability in one form or another.\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\n  The United States should also share its evidence of genocide with \nwhatever body is named to seek accountability for the terrible crimes \nin Darfur.\n  President Bush spoke last week in soaring, inspiring rhetoric about \nliberty, freedom, and our place in the world. But there is no liberty \nwithout basic human security. There is no freedom when armed men sweep \ndown upon your village, raping and murdering its inhabitants. And there \nis no justice when the world recognizes all these terrible facts and \nyet does nothing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very pleasant and happy day \nfor the Senator from New Mexico, and I hope for many Senators, \nAmericans, and people who like freedom around the world.\n  I congratulate the President of the United States. He has had a very \npowerful commitment to freedom and democracy in Iraq. There has been \ndiscussion for many months about whether our mission in Iraq would work \nand about why we are there, but I think today we have seen the first \ngiant step toward freedom for the wonderful Iraqi people who have \nsuffered so long under tyranny and were made slaves, whose loved ones \nsuffered, were enslaved, murdered, entombed, and killed. Thousands \nemigrated from that country. This is a great day for them, and I think \nthey showed us that it was a real issue.\n  I am sure many did not believe these people would risk anything \nserious, including their lives, to have a chance at freedom. The \nPresident, by his strength of character and commitment against many \nodds, carried this issue forth to an electorate and an election, and \nhas stayed with it until this great day when we saw grassroots freedom \ncome alive.\n  This is an occasion when some might wonder whether we ought to have a \nfree press over there observing things, especially in a war zone so to \nspeak, but this is an occasion when it is obvious that it worked. Even \nskeptics who were there could not deny reality. The reality was that \npeople, young and old, were not afraid of the threats of terrorism and \nrisked everything for that little idea of exercising their franchise. \nWe saw them putting up their inked finger indicating ``I voted.'' I \nthought it was tremendous. For that, I am very proud that I supported \nthe President in this. I hope he is proud of what he has done.\n\n  I don't want anyone to think the Senator from New Mexico does not \nunderstand there are many pitfalls, and there may still be some that \nare difficult to overcome.\n  Ultimately, freedom and democracy are not the end. You have to have \nsome kind of economic prosperity, stability, and law and order. I have \nsaid democracy and freedom do not work too well if you are hungry, if \nyou are starving. That makes it pretty easy for people who would \noverturn freedom and democracy. The Iraqis are a fortunate people. They \nhave a lot of resources. Let's hope they can develop them to the \nbetterment of all their people.\n  There are three things I am thankful for today. The second is the \nU.S. military. We send our military to do much on behalf of the \nAmerican people and to accomplish missions we think are important. This \none I am sure many people looked at and said: They are just not going \nto be able to do it; this is not a role for American fighting men; they \ncan't help with the voting; they can't get rid of the terrorists in \nsufficient numbers, even with sufficient intelligence and planning, to \nlet an election move on. A lot of people thought that.\n  I submit that those who run the American military at the top, and \nthose whose boots are on the ground and who run the machinery and \nequipment, are sending a signal: You asked us to do something. Give us \nsome time and we will solve the problems and we will do it.\n  Didn't they do that and prove it yesterday? Did anybody think it \ncould be so peaceful in so much of Iraq? There was so much opportunity \nfor people to walk to the polls and not get killed, to see their \nneighbors going and then get sufficient strength and courage to join \nthem because the terrorists were not there. There was some terrific \nplan, with the Iraqi soldiers who were getting trained, and ours, to \ncreate this safe haven, a significant safe haven. I surmise that a lot \nof hard work took place in the rooms where planning is done, in the \nevenings when people work, between our military leaders and the new \nbudding leaders of the Iraqi military and Iraqi law enforcement.\n  I think the Iraqi police and military probably were invigorated by \nthis event, and I would think that they, too, will be stronger and \nbetter for it.\n  Again, as I have on a number of occasions in my years as a Senator--\nit is going on 33, so I have seen a few victories--I have seen a few \ninvolvements where it was very difficult. I have seen the Vietnam war, \nseen the Korean war a little bit; I have seen great achievements and \notherwise, but I think this is a rather significant indication of how \nour military will help us if we will help them.\n  I am so proud we did not get to the point where the naysayers in \nAmerica made it impossible for the military to do their jobs. It was \ngetting ever closer to that, but it did not get there. I think that is \nvery fortunate for freedom, liberty, and the whole Middle East--a \nterribly important part of the world.\n\n  Then, lastly, I congratulate the Iraqi people. Many of those who did \nnot like what was going on over there, many who voted for us to go in \nand changed their minds--there were 77 Senators who voted for us to do \nthat, go in--to some who had just been against it turned and were \naccusatory of our President. Some called him a liar. Some said he had \nmisled. That is for another day, another argument, which I have already \nmade that I think clearly indicates those kinds of things were not \ntrue. There were no weapons of mass destruction, but that doesn't mean \nthere were lies about it.\n  But some said the Iraqi people should have been dancing in the \nstreets as our military marched through and went to Baghdad in such \nfast order, you recall, with very few lives lost in the American \nmilitary, and very few Iraqis. But there was not laughter and joy and \nmarching bands in the streets. But when the day finally came, when the \npeople thought they were really rid of the tyranny of Saddam, they did. \nThey did come forward with joy in the streets and hope in their eyes, \nfeeling very satisfied with the job they were doing by going to vote.\n  So it is a very pleasant task for a Senator to come to the floor \nafter having heard so much negative about that, even negative about our \nmilitary leaders, and to say to them, to the Iraqi people, the \nPresident, to the American people who have supported this effort for \nfreedom--we all have supported it with a lot of our tax dollars, along \nwith our best men and women and a great deal of equipment and other \nthings--Job well done. May the next set of actions that are required \ncome forth and be as good as this for the people there in Iraq and the \nMiddle East. I only hope that as we look at this and are rather pleased \nas Americans, that some of our normal and natural allies in the world \nwho have become pointedly in opposition to what we have done and have \ncarried it even further, to where people seem to think Americans are \nnot their friends and they don't want to be our friends and we have \nqualities and attributes they don't like, I hope this sends a signal \nthat maybe they ought to become more rational and reasonable about what \nwe mean to each other. After all, we have been through a lot together--\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Belgium. We don't have to worry about the \nEnglish. They have been with us all the way. We have been through a lot \nof sweat and blood in the name of freedom with those allies, to our \ncost in lives and to our cost in billions of dollars. It is not that \nthey owe us anything. But I think they might at least say they might \nhave been wrong\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\nin this or at least maybe the American President had a reasonably good \nidea and how we ought to get together and hope that together we will \ntry to make it work. I hope that is not asking too much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to make some remarks today \nregarding the now unfolding debate regarding the future of Social \nSecurity in our country. I don't intend that my remarks will be the end \nof what I have to say about it, but only the beginning. I envision this \nto be a long and serious and involved discussion over the next weeks \nand months regarding Social Security, the future of Social Security, \nwhat we are going to do about it as a country, and what the President \nmight be proposing also.\n  At the outset, let me say that Social Security is the most enduring \nand popular and successful Government program in our Nation's history. \nWhen Social Security was created in 1935, nearly 50 percent of seniors \nlived below the poverty line. Americans did not look forward to \nretirement; they feared it. But today, thanks to Social Security, the \nnumber of seniors living in poverty has been reduced to 10 percent, and \nmost Americans are able to look forward to their retirement as their \ngolden years--years to be spent enjoying their grandkids, their \ncommunity, traveling, and having better health. It is an extraordinary \nachievement for this country to have achieved just since World War II.\n  Now, to understand the success of Social Security, we have to be \nclear about what Social Security is not. It is not a welfare program. \nOnly those who work and pay into Social Security are eligible for its \nbenefits. Likewise, Social Security is not an investment program. For \nthat, we have IRAs, 401(k)s, individual development accounts, IDAs, and \na vast range of private saving and investment accounts.\n  So if Social Security is not welfare and if it is not a retirement \ninvestment program, then what is it? Well, simply put, it is an \ninsurance program. That is why it is called Social Security insurance. \nIt was established in 1935 to provide benefits to workers and their \nfamily members--yes, upon retirement, disability, or death. In fact, \nthe original name for Social Security was the Old Age Survivors and \nDisability Insurance Program, or OASDI, as we have come to know it.\n  Social Security is a social insurance program that embraces almost \nthe entire American family. It is the highest expression of our \nconnection and commitment to one another. It reflects our core values, \nour compassion, our decency, our bedrock belief that no senior, no \norphan, no survivor, no person with a disability, no member of our \nAmerican family will be left behind.\n  I talk about it in terms of our American family because I make the \nanalogy with our own private individual families. In good times, in \nnormal times, the individuals in our own families are independent, \nself-sustaining, going their separate ways, building their individual \ngood futures. But in our own families in times of misfortune, financial \ncrisis, old age, or death that is when individuals in the family pull \ntogether. We come together, sacrificing, if necessary, to give aid, \ncomfort, and support to the family member who is in need.\n  As Americans, we all value the benefits of the free marketplace. We \nall believe in individual responsibility. However, we also know that \nsometimes markets fail. We also know sometimes people fall on hard \ntimes, through no fault of their own. Sometimes people become disabled. \nThat is exactly why we have a social security insurance program, to \nprovide a basic safety net for the elderly, for survivors, and for \nAmericans with disabilities.\n  Social Security has a deep meaning for me and my family, and it is a \nstory I will be telling a little bit today, and I will be enlarging \nupon it later, but it has to do with my family when I was young, but as \nit relates to a lot of families today.\n  I was born in 1939. My father was 54 years old when I was born. My \nmother was 44. When I was 10, my mother died. My father had three kids \nunder the age of 18. My father had only an eighth grade education. He \nworked most of his life in the coal mines in Iowa. Not too many people \nknow we had coal mines in Iowa. During the Depression, he worked on WPA \nprograms. In fact, on the wall of my office I still have his WPA card \nto remind me from where I come.\n  Then during World War II, when my father was in his fifties--the coal \nmines pretty much shut down--he was able to work in an ordnance plant \nand had paid in the requisite quarters to qualify for Social Security.\n  So when my father reached the age of 65, which was in 1951--and I was \nnow 11 years old--he was in bad health. He suffered from what we called \nminer's lung in those days. We did not call it black lung; we called it \nminer's lung. Basically, the most he could do was to work odd jobs, \npainting houses, fixing things up, and other jobs such as that.\n  His total Social Security check at that time was about $120 a month. \nThat was the sole source of income for our family. We had no outside \nincome. He had no savings. We owned no land. We owned no stocks. We \nowned no bonds. We owned nothing except the little house we had. So \nthat $120 a month was our total family income. We lived on that.\n  I relate that story because when we were young and growing up, Social \nSecurity was the only thing standing between us and welfare. We all \nworked as kids, even at 12, 13, 14, 15. We all had jobs, whether it was \nworking on farms or whatever it might have been. But the fact that my \nfather was able to get Social Security when he was 65 and he was unable \nto work--most people in those days were unable to work because they \nworked pretty hard all their lives--was what kept us together as a \nfamily.\n  One might say that was then and today is different. Things have not \nchanged all that much since the 1950s. Today one out of every five \nseniors, 20 percent, rely on Social Security for 100 percent of their \nincome. For two-thirds of our seniors, Social Security is the major \nsource of income. There may be a little bit of something else. In fact, \naccording to the publication of the Social Security Administration, in \nthe year 2000, nearly 48 percent of American seniors would have fallen \nbelow the poverty line if they had not received Social Security. In \nother words, take away Social Security and we are right back to where \nwe were in the 1940s or 1950s with nearly half of America's seniors \nliving in poverty.\n\n  I understand that we have long term problems to deal with in the \nSocial Security program. However, the good news is that Social Security \nis financially strong and will remain strong for decades to come. This \nyear Social Security will run a surplus in the neighborhood of $150 \nbillion. The cumulative Social Security surplus now stands in excess of \n$1.6 trillion. And guess what. Every single one of those dollars is \ninvested in rock solid Treasury securities backed by the full faith and \ncredit of the U.S. Government.\n  What is more, according to the 2004 Social Security Trustees Report, \nin the year 2003, surpluses in the Social Security trust fund earned an \naverage interest rate of 6 percent. By contrast, over the 5 years \nending with 2004, money invested in a stock fund tracking the Standard \n& Poor's 500 Index would have lost an average of 2.4 percent per year.\n  Many people say that money you put into Social Security is gone; it \nis not there; the Government used it. When they devised Social Security \nthey said: Yes, Social Security money has to be invested in Government \nsecurities. Why? Because Government securities are backed by the full \nfaith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n  I have been hearing this nonsense for the more than 25 years I have \nbeen in public life: Oh, Social Security will not be there for me. More \nyoung people today believe in UFOs than they believe that Social \nSecurity will be there for them when they retire. Every time I have a \ntown meeting someone gets up\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nand says: We have to change Social Security; it will not be there for \nme when I retire.\n  I say: Let me ask you this. Do you believe the U.S. Government, the \nUnited States of America will still exist when you retire? Of course, \neverybody says yes. Of course, the United States of America is going to \nexist for a long time.\n  Well, then, I say your Social Security is going to be secure, too, \nbecause it is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment. The United States has never defaulted on a bond, and we \nnever will.\n  So to those who say that somehow Social Security will not be there, \nthe Government is going to default and not pay the bonds, right now \nChina is buying U.S. bonds, loaning us money every year to finance our \ndeficit. Are we telling them, Hey, guess what, China, those bonds may \nnot be any good; we may default on those?\n  Do we tell the private sector that is buying a lot of Government \nbonds for their portfolios, Hey, guess what, it might not be there? The \nreason Government bonds are so good is because it is backed by the U.S. \nGovernment. That is why Social Security will be there. That is the \ntruth that those who want to privatize Social Security are not telling \nus.\n  Does Social Security face a challenge nearly half a century from now? \nYes, it does. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in the year \n2052 the huge surpluses in the Social Security trust fund will have \nbeen used up. But payroll taxes will continue to roll in, allowing \nabout 73 percent of scheduled benefits to be paid indefinitely. \nClearly, the 27-percent shortfall will be a challenge. That is about 45 \nto 47 years from now, and for that reason I welcome the current \ndiscussion of ways to address the current challenge. Now, since I have \nbeen in Congress--and that has been now 30 years--we have adjusted \nSocial Security twice. Since 1935, we have adjusted it several times. \nWith changing times and circumstances, as we look ahead we make \nchanges, and we are going to have to make some changes now, but not as \ndrastic as some people are saying.\n  I am interested in hearing the details of the President's plan in his \nState of the Union speech on Wednesday. Reportedly, at least from what \nI read in the papers, he will propose a partial privatization of Social \nSecurity. Guess how it is going to be financed. By up to $2 trillion in \nnew borrowing over the next decade. Where are we going to borrow that \nmoney? We will have to float bonds.\n  Who is going to buy the bonds? Well, right now the biggest buyer of \nour bonds is China and Japan. Are we going to tell them we may default \non those bonds? No. We are telling them that those bonds are good.\n  According to other reports, the President plans to follow the advice \nof his 2001 Commission on Privatization, which recommended that future \nSocial Security benefits be cut by 40 to 50 percent. Well, with good \nreason Senators from both parties have been very skeptical and critical \nof these approaches. As even conservatives acknowledge, private \naccounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long-term financial \nhealth of Social Security. One person even described private accounts \nas ``a solution in search of a problem.''\n  What is more, the proposal to cut benefits by 40 to 50 percent is not \njust Draconian, it is totally unnecessary. It feeds the suspicion that \nthe President's real aim is not to save Social Security but to \ndrastically shrink it as the first step toward eventually ending it, \nlike Grover Norquist wants to do.\n  I will focus the remainder of my remarks today on one part of Social \nSecurity that is not being talked about. I have one big overriding \nconcern. I am concerned that those who want to privatize Social \nSecurity have almost totally ignored the fate of some 6.2 million \nAmericans with disabilities, people who in many cases desperately \ndepend on Social Security disability benefits.\n  President Bush says he has no current plans to cut disability \nbenefits, but unfortunately the President seems not to understand that \nin our Social Security system both the retirement and disability \nprograms are closely linked.\n  They use the same formula for determining benefits. In an interview \nwith The Washington Post published on January 16, the President \nacknowledged that:\n\n       Frankly, our discussions in terms of reform have not \n     centered on the survivor/disability aspect of Social \n     Security.\n\n  Meanwhile, the President's Commission on Social Security devoted a \nmere two pages out of its 256-page report on the fate of people with \ndisabilities. Many advocates of privatization simply assume that \ndisability benefits will be treated the same as retirement benefits. \nCertainly this was the working assumption of the President's \nCommission.\n  The Associated Press reported on January 18 that in the Commission \nreport, disability benefits get reduced along with retiree benefits, in \nsome cases up to 46 percent. The cuts were used to make the plan's \nfinances add up in a report.\n  Disability benefits get reduced in some cases up to 46 percent. Let \nme quote from the Privatization Commission's report, page 149, if \nanyone is looking it up:\n\n       In the absence of fully developed proposals, the \n     calculations carried out for the Commission and included in \n     the report assume that defined benefits will be changed in \n     similar ways for [both retirement and disability] programs.\n\n  The Commission says it is not necessarily recommending this, but the \nproof is in the numbers. All of the Commission's calculations assume \nthat disability benefits will be cut the same as retirement benefits. \nWithout those cuts, the Commission's numbers simply do not add up.\n  There is at least one other proposal on the table for dealing with \nthe 6.2 million Americans who now receive disability benefits. Some \nadvocates of privatization have suggested that these people be thrown \ninto the Supplemental Security Income Program, SSI. The callousness of \nthese proposals is deeply disturbing.\n  I will state what ought to be obvious to Senators on both sides of \nthis discussion. It is outrageous to treat Americans with disabilities \nas a mere afterthought in this momentous debate. It is unacceptable to \nleave them as collateral damage when the smoke clears and the \ncasualties are counted.\n  Here is the crux of the problem: The President's Commission has \nproposed dramatic cuts in Social Security by calculating future \nbenefits based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. This approach \nposes huge risks to recipients of Social Security disability benefits \nand also to widows and orphans who receive survivor benefits. Bear in \nmind that Social Security currently uses basically the same benefit \nformula for all categories of beneficiaries. So if retirement benefits \nare slashed by nearly half, disability benefits will also be slashed in \nthe same across-the-board fashion with catastrophic \nconsequences. Everyone appreciates that the Social Security payroll tax \npurchases a very good defined benefit upon retirement. What is not \nfully appreciated is that the payroll tax also purchases an excellent \ndisability insurance policy, one that would be difficult, if not \nimpossible, to purchase on the private market.\n\n  I am going to repeat that. What is not appreciated is that our \npayroll taxes buy an excellent disability insurance policy, which would \nbe difficult, if not impossible, for you to buy in the private market.\n  Here are the facts. For the average wage earner with a family, Social \nSecurity benefits are equivalent to a $322,000 life insurance policy or \na $233,000 disability insurance policy. I had my staff look into how \nmuch it would cost to replace those benefits in the private market. The \ncost of the life insurance alone could be substantial. For instance, \nthe cost of a modest $100,000 term life insurance policy--that is just \na term policy--varies from $140 a year for a healthy 25-year-old to \n$3,815 a year for a not-so-healthy 45-year-old.\n  The more shocking news is that you cannot accurately price a policy \nthat would make up for disability. The vast majority of currently \navailable disability policies are group policies. Right now, the only \npeople who buy personal disability insurance are members of small, \nself-selected groups of people who are at a lower risk of becoming \ndisabled, and these group policies are not stand-alone policies; they \nare supplemental policies. They just\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nreplace a percentage of income beyond what Social Security disability \npays. So any change that lowers Social Security disability payments \nwould actually raise the price of private disability insurance, because \nthere would be a larger gap to make up between what people get from \nSocial Security and a minimum replacement level.\n  More to the point, this kind of disability policy would not be \navailable to just anyone. For instance, according to Patricia Owen, the \nformer Associate Commissioner of the Social Security Administration:\n\n       Private insurance generally will not cover the blue-collar \n     occupations. And long-term disability insurance for workers \n     is the least offered. With Social Security disability \n     insurance, all are covered. I would guess that the price of \n     private long-term disability insurance would be at least 4 to \n     5 times higher than the percent of FICA that goes to \n     disability insurance.\n\n  Young people better start thinking about this. They better start \nthinking about what this privatization means in terms of disability.\n  Any one of us on the floor today, anyone watching us--an accident \ncould happen tomorrow and you could be disabled. I am concerned that in \nthe rush to privatize Social Security we are failing to consider \nunintended consequences. Americans with disabilities are at risk under \nthe privatization plans now being discussed. I think what we have here \nis a crisis of mass destruction. Before we went into Iraq we had the \nweapons of mass destruction. We found out they didn't exist. The \nPresident now says there is a crisis in Social Security that justifies \nslashing benefits by up to 50 percent, that justifies borrowing up to \n$2 trillion to partially privatize Social Security.\n  Just as there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, there is \nno crisis in Social Security. But if we go down this path of \nprivatizing Social Security, cutting benefits, making it harder to get \ndisability coverage, we will have mass destruction all right, we will \nhave mass destruction of the American family, our American family, \npulling together, helping each other in time of need by putting us all \nin this great big pool called Social Security insurance.\n  If the President and Mr. Norquist and those privatizers get their \nway, we will have mass destruction all right, here in our country--to \nour way of life, to our American family. We will have mass destruction \nto a future that people can look forward to knowing that if, they \nbecome disabled, they are going to have a safety net to look forward \nto. If the major breadwinner in the family, he or she, gets killed, \ndies unexpectedly, that the survivors will have a safety net to get \nthem through school; looking forward to a future when you retire you \nwill have some golden years and you will know that your future \nretirement years don't depend on whether the stock market goes up or \nthe stock market goes down, that it only depends on one thing, the \nsurvival of the United States of America. That is what Social Security \nis.\n\n  I can tell you that in recent weeks my office has been flooded with \nletters and e-mails from my fellow Iowans who are deeply worried about \nthe reports they are reading. They read about the President's 2001 \nprivatization commission. Many of them know that the calculations \nassume disability benefits will be slashed. They have heard the \nproposals that we will just take people with disabilities and put them \ninto SSI. This is deeply disturbing for people with disabilities who \nrely on Social Security, not just for income but for their dignity.\n  Social Security disability insurance has been a lifesaver for \ncountless Americans. I think of Steven Cook, a former truckdriver from \nIowa City, IA. After a lifetime of working hard, playing by the rules, \nhe found himself unemployed, sleeping in his car, and diagnosed with \nrenal failure. After qualifying for Social Security disability \ninsurance and corollary health benefits, he was able to receive a \nkidney transplant and begin to put his life back together.\n  I don't want to add to the worries and fears of people with \ndisabilities, people such as Steven Cook who rely on Social Security, \nbut we have an obligation to raise these issues now, to discuss them, \nand to find out what those unintended consequences might be of the \nprivatization of Social Security. As I said, the calculations and \nprojections of the President's Commission on Privatization assume that \ndisability benefits will be cut along with retirement benefits. The \nCommission recommended that ``the President address the disability \ninsurance program through a separate policy development process.''\n  That recommendation was made 3 full years ago, but, to my knowledge, \nthere has been no such effort to develop any policy to safeguard the \ndisability insurance program. In the absence of any reassurance from \nthe administration, Americans with disabilities--widows and their \nsurvivors and orphans--have been left with the worst: Their benefits \nare going to be slashed in a draconian fashion. This is not compassion, \nand it is not acceptable.\n  I have come to the Senate floor today to raise these profound issues. \nIt is time to talk about the fate of millions of Americans with \ndisabilities who rely on Social Security benefits. Is the \nadministration developing a plan to protect these people? Does the \nadministration intend to take its cue from the Privatization Commission \nand propose steep cuts in disability benefits? Americans need answers. \nMore than 6 million Americans who rely on disability benefits need \nanswers, as we all do. Any one of us could become disabled and face a \ndire need of this safety net.\n  I urge the President to consider this issue. If the plan is to \nprivatize Social Security on the backs of our most vulnerable people, \nthat is profoundly a moral mistake. Such a plan I hope will be \nunacceptable to Members of this body. I urge the President and his \nadvisers to give very careful consideration to this issue.\n  Yes, we need to address long-term challenges to Social Security. \nHowever, Social Security is sound. It is as sound as the United States \nof America. Will it need changes 50 years from now? Yes. Minor changes \ncan fix it. Does it need to be privatized? No. Do we need to protect \nthe social insurance program for people with disabilities or for people \nlike you and me who are not right now disabled but may be tomorrow? The \nanswer is yes. We can only do it if we have one national social \ninsurance program. It has served us well.\n  Not all old things are bad. The older I get, the more I think about \nthat. Not all old things are bad. Sometimes I see people wanting to \nchange this or change that. For what reason? They say: Well, it is old. \nSo what? The Ten Commandments are pretty old. I don't think they need \nto be changed.\n  Social Security insurance has served us well. It will serve these \nyoung people here today well. It will serve all young Americans well as \nlong as we think about it in terms of the American family. We are all \nin this together. We will all go our separate ways and do our separate \nthings in life, but if trouble falls, if one person becomes disabled, \nif one person dies and the widow or widower and the kids need help, we \nare there. We are there as part of a family. You will not get that if \nyou privatize Social Security.\n  We will fix the long term balance sheet on Social Security. But we \nshould always keep in mind that Social Security is as strong and as \nsound as the United States of America. If you do not believe in \nAmerica, you don't believe in Social Security. If you do not believe in \nthe future of our country, you don't believe in the future of Social \nSecurity. But if you believe in America and if you believe in the \nfuture of our country, you believe we can come together to truly \nprotect Social Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S626-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S626-S628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ELECTIONS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, some of my colleagues are suggesting \nthat as a result of yesterday's election in Iraq, the United States \nneeds an exit strategy, that we should begin to withdraw troops, and \nthat we should set a timetable for bringing the rest of our military \nmen and women home. That is a very appealing thought.\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\n  I can think of about 3,000 families in Tennessee of the 278th Cavalry \nof the National Guard whose husbands and wives and sons and daughters \nhave interrupted their lives for up to 18 months. And they are now in \nnorthern Iraq. Their families would like to have them home. I can think \nof families around Fort Campbell and Nashville. They would like to have \ntheir loved ones home. I think of the $80 billion the President is \ngoing to ask us to spend, and I can think of 80 billion ways to spend \nit on education and improving our competitiveness. It is a very \nappealing thought--to bring the troops home.\n  But we don't need an exit strategy in Iraq. The United States needs a \nsuccess strategy in Iraq. If we are to succeed in Iraq, I am afraid \nthat means those troops are likely to have to stay there for a while \nlonger.\n  Yesterday, the Iraqis did for themselves what we haven't been able to \ndo for them in 22 months: they isolated the terrorists. The count was \nabout 7 million or 8 million to 5,000 or 10,000--voting Iraqis versus \nterrorists.\n  In October of 2003, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote a memorandum \nwhich was widely circulated around Washington. He said:\n\n       It is pretty clear that the coalition can win in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq in one way or another, but it will be a \n     long, hard slog.\n\n  Concerning the overall war on terror, Secretary Rumsfeld went on to \nask:\n\n       Is our current situation such that ``the harder we work the \n     behinder we get?''\n\n  The Rumsfeld memorandum leaked, and some accused the Secretary of not \nhaving all the answers. I am glad we had a Secretary who is willing to \nask the questions that he didn't know the answers to. He was worried \nthat our actions in Iraq and being successful in the war were, in the \npostwar time, inflaming Arab opinion in such a way that we were \ncreating more terrorists than we were destroying.\n  I know a lot of wise people around Washington, DC, who have been \nthinking about Secretary Rumsfeld's question since October of 2003. I \nhave yet to hear one of them come up with a very good answer to his \nquestion.\n  How do we in the postwar conflict keep from creating more terrorists \nthan we are destroying? The answers to the question come from all \nsides.\n  We in Congress have discussed, for example, more public relations, \nmore television, more radio programming, more cultural exchanges. Those \nare all good ideas. They are important parts of effective public \ndiplomacy. I hope we do them. But yesterday we witnessed a much better \nanswer to Secretary Rumsfeld's question: elections; elections giving \npeople a voice and a stake in the future of their own country. Those \nelections yesterday isolated the terrorists. That was the most \nimportant lesson of yesterday. It was 7 million or 8 million for \ndemocracy and 5,000 or 10,000 for the terrorists. It wasn't the \nAmericans who were in the 7 or 8 million; it was the Iraqis. It was the \nIraqis.\n  We discovered that we know how to give people their freedom. We have \na military strong enough to do that virtually anywhere in the world. We \ndid it in Iraq, and with stunning success, in 3 weeks toppling Saddam \nHussein's government. We can give most countries their freedom in a few \nweeks or a few months, but we are being reminded in Iraq that building \na democracy takes a long time. And people have to build a democracy for \nthemselves. We can't do it for them.\n  We should know that from our own history. The Declaration of \nIndependence was written in 1776. Our Constitution was signed in 1787. \nBut women didn't receive the right to vote in America until 1920. It \ntook 133 years. Blacks were enslaved and counted as three-fifths of a \nperson by our Constitution until our Civil War, and they didn't receive \nfull voting rights until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 180 years after \nthe signing of our Constitution. Even today, the United States of \nAmerica is still a work in progress. We are the oldest democracy in the \nworld. There is no such thing as an instant democracy. We, of all \ndemocracies, should understand that.\n  We also could learn some lessons from our role in nation building in \nthe world. We spent 8 years in Germany and Japan. We are still in \nBosnia and Kosovo.\n  According to this book, ``America's Role in Nation Building: From \nGermany to Iraq,'' a RAND study by Ambassador James Dobbins and others, \n``There is no quick route to nation building. Five years seems to be \nthe minimum required to enforce an enduring transition to democracy.''\n  This is a book about nation building in Germany to Afghanistan with \nlessons for Iraq. We have plenty of experience in nation building since \nWorld War II, and the lessons from those experiences are documented in \nthis book and many other places: Any time we decide to engage in nation \nbuilding, it is going to take more troops, more time, more money, and \ncertainly more sacrifice than we at first thought when we invaded Iraq.\n\n  That doesn't mean we should reconsider our presence in Iraq. We are \nthere. We need to finish what we started. We need to get the job done. \nIt does suggest that in the future we should think carefully about the \nnumber of troops, the amount of time, the amount of money, and the \namount of sacrifice it takes when we engage in nation building.\n  I believe the Bush administration as well as the Congress has some \nresponsibilities going forward. First, as far as the administration \ngoes, I would like to see the administration be more specific about its \nsuccess strategy in Iraq. I mentioned last week in the Senate the \nWashington Post op-ed by two former Secretaries of State, Henry \nKissinger and George Shultz. They argue, eloquently and in detail, that \nwe should not set, as some of my colleagues have suggested, a specific \ntimetable for pulling out our troops. We do not need an exit strategy. \nBut they went further than the administration has gone so far in \noutlining the framework for a success strategy. These are the kinds of \nquestions they ask in their framework.\n  Are we waging ``one war'' in which political and military efforts are \nmutually reinforcing? Are the institutions we are helping to build \nsufficiently coordinated? Is our strategic goal to achieve complete \nsecurity in at least some key towns and major communications routes as \nopposed to 100 percent in every town and 100 percent security on every \ncommunication route? Do we have a policy for eliminating sanctuaries in \nneighboring territories, such as Syria and Iran? Are we designing a \npolicy that could produce results for the people and prevent civil \nstrife for control of the state and its oil revenue? Are we maintaining \npublic support of the United States? Are we gaining international \nunderstanding?\n  They went on to conclude:\n\n       An exit strategy based on performance, not artificial time \n     limits, will judge progress by the ability to produce \n     positive answers to these questions.\n\n  That is the administration's responsibility at this stage. We have a \nnew Secretary. We have a new election. We are being asked to \nappropriate 80 billion new dollars. I would like to hear a more \nspecific success strategy.\n  We have our own responsibilities in the Congress. Our responsibility, \nnow that we have authorized this war--we authorized it with 77 votes in \nthis Chamber. Now that we have authorized this war, we have the \nresponsibility to have the stomach to see it through to the end and not \nbegin talking about premature exit strategies before we finish what we \nstarted.\n  The focus should not be on what day in July or August we will get \nout. Instead, we should be asking, for example, what are we willing to \ndo to help provide the security needed so that elections in October and \nDecember are successful?\n  Yesterday's election was the first election. It was the first strong \nsignal from the Iraqis that by a vote of 7 or 8 million to 5,000 or \n10,000, they prefer democracy to terrorism. It did something that we \ncould not do ourselves in 22 months: It isolated the terrorists in \npublic opinion. There will be another election in October. There will \nbe another election in December. And we should be talking about what we \ncan do to help those elections be successful. Let's send another \nmessage isolating terrorists--not the United States, but the Iraqis. We \nwill give them that opportunity two more times.\n  What can we do to train Iraqis to take over their own defense and to \nestablish a constitutional government? What can we do to encourage \nIraqi neighbors to allow a success strategy\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\nto continue? Those are the questions we should be asking, and the \nanswers to those questions will produce a success strategy.\n  At some point, one thing we can do to isolate terrorists in the \nMiddle East is to leave Iraq. Then Iraqis are defending Iraq. All of us \nwant that as soon as possible. Iraqis want that as soon as possible. \nBut to abandon Iraq before we have implemented a success strategy is \nabandoning a country we have led to risk its lives in order to vote, \nand abandoning the brave Americans and those from other countries who \nhave fought, bled, and died to give Iraqis their freedom and to give \nthem an opportunity to govern themselves.\n  In 1994, I met a man named Larry Joyce in Chicago. He worked for the \nAmerican Heart Association. Larry Joyce had been in Vietnam. He was \nabout my age. He sought me out because he wanted anyone who might be in \npublic life to learn the lessons he and his family had learned in \nSomalia. Larry Joyce's son, Casey Joyce, had been killed in Somalia. \nThe lesson Larry Joyce wanted me to know and wanted every Member of \nthis Senate to know and every policymaker to know was this: Before we \nengage in a military mission, we should do three things: One, we should \nhave a specific mission; two, we should have more than sufficient force \nto complete the job; and he said, three, most importantly, we should \nhave the stomach to see the mission through all the way to the end.\n  His greatest complaint about the American Government in Somalia was \nnot the mission, not the force, but that we did not have the stomach to \nsee all the way through to the end the mission in which his son was \nkilled.\n  Larry Joyce himself has now died, but I remember that conversation. I \nthink of his son. When I think about this war and committing American \nmen and women to Iraq or any other place in the world, I think about \nseeing that mission all the way through to the end.\n  That is why I react badly to the talk of my colleagues who suggest an \nexit strategy based on some artificial date. Leaving Iraq prematurely \nwould undermine every objective we have in the war on terror and in the \nMiddle East. I am disappointed to hear talk of an exit approach. I \nwould like to hear more in this Chamber and more from the \nadministration and more in this country about a success strategy in \nIraq.\n  Yesterday's election was a thrilling event. For the first time in 22 \nmonths it answered Secretary Rumsfeld's question of October 2003, How \ndo we isolate the terrorists? If we do not do it, the Iraqi people do \nit, 7 or 8 million of them, versus 5,000 to 10,000 terrorists. They \nisolated the terrorists.\n  We should not be talking about leaving Iraq before we are finished. \nWe should be talking today about those October elections, about those \nDecember elections, and what we can do in our country and in Iraq to \nhelp the Iraqis have the opportunity to build a constitutional \ngovernment and to be in a position in October and December to once \nagain send a message to the world that they prefer democracy to \nterrorism and that they, the Iraqis, are isolating the terrorists by a \nvote of millions of Iraqis to a few thousand terrorists.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday freedom took a giant step \nforward.\n  History will rank January 30, 2005, alongside November 9, 1989, the \nday the Berlin Wall fell, as a day when man's innate desire to be free \nbroke the shackles of tyranny.\n  Millions of Iraqis stood up to the terrorists and told them: We \nreject your credo of violence. We reject your claim that Iraq cannot \njoin the democratic family of nations. We reject your belief that \nIraqis deserve nothing more than to live in fear of oppression.\n  One Iraqi voter, a businessman named Samir Sabih, put it better than \nany of us could. Of yesterday he said:\n\n       Fear has no place in our hearts anymore. We became free.\n\n  The Iraqi elections for the National Assembly must be heralded as a \nmajor success. Turnout has been reported as being anywhere from 60 to \n70 percent, defying all expectations. Thanks to the dedication and \nbravery of our troops, and the Iraqi police that we have trained, there \nwas much less violence than expected. We were all moved by the courage \nof so many ordinary Iraqi citizens, each one risking their life to \nproudly display a purple ink-stained finger.\n  While we do not yet know the results of the election, we can name the \nwinners--the people of Iraq--for enthusiastically embracing democracy; \nthe nations of the Middle East, that can now look to Iraq as a model; \nand the people of every country, who now live in a world more favored \ntoward freedom.\n  Some cynics have missed the point of this election. For instance, \nsome say the vote is illegitimate if not enough Sunnis chose to \nparticipate. But by all reports, the Shiite majority will not let this \nstop Sunnis from having a voice. There will be a place for all \nreligions and ethnicities in the government. Interim Prime Minister \nIyad Allawi, himself a Shiite, has said:\n\n       Let us work together toward a bright future--Sunnis, \n     Shiites, Muslims and Christians, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen.\n\n  I also heard a news reporter ask yesterday whether the election \nresults were good for President Bush. In case this reporter missed it, \nPresident Bush was not on the ballot. Yesterday's historic achievement \nwas not about which party can collect political points. It was about \nthe march of freedom.\n  There is still a lot of hard work ahead before Iraq becomes a stable \ndemocracy. America must stay committed. The Iraqis are counting on us \nto help them in their quest for freedom, and we cannot, and we will \nnot, let them down. We must do what it takes for our security's sake, \nso that Iraq never again becomes a cauldron of terrorism.\n  Many Americans and Iraqis risked everything to help realize the first \nfree vote in Iraq since 1953. Some gave their lives. We should offer \nour thanks and our prayers to those who valiantly sacrificed. We can \nhonor their deeds by completing our task in Iraq.\n  Amidst the joy and celebrations yesterday, one Iraqi woman actually \ngave birth at her polling station. She gave birth at her polling \nstation. Despite her pregnancy, she was determined that nothing would \nstop her from casting her ballot. She named the child after the word \n``election'' in her native language.\n  Mindful of the hard work still ahead, I hope and believe this baby \nwill grow up never knowing tyranny and oppression, never living under \ntotalitarian fear, never seeing a family member spirited away to be \nmurdered.\n  I hope and believe this child will grow up in a free society, with \nthe power to make his own destiny. Let's finish the job and ensure that \nis so.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Bodman, of Massachusetts, to be Secretary of \n     Energy.\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n                    nomination of dr. samuel bodman\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to share some brief comments \nconcerning the nomination of a fellow Illinoisan, Dr. Samuel Bodman, \nfor Secretary of the United States Department of Energy.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to meet Secretary-designee Bodman. I \nlearned he was born in Wheaton, IL, his mother was raised in Coffeen \nand his father grew up in Bement, IL, where main street is actually \nnamed Bodman Street.\n  I expressed to Secretary-designate Bodman a few of my concerns about \nnational energy policy. I stressed my belief that one of our most \nurgent national energy priorities is increasing fuel efficiency \nstandards. This is a critical issue and one that has been visibly \nabsent from the administration's national energy policy. How can we \nclaim to be serious about reducing America's dangerous dependence on \nforeign oil if we don't get serious about encouraging greater fuel \nefficiency?\n  We hear the same excuses all the time for failing to act: Cars will \nbe unsafe. The technology isn't available. The truth is, the technology \nis available and the higher fuel efficient cars are on the road. The \nmajority of them, however, are Japanese.\n  I'm lucky. Fortunately, after 6 months of waiting, we recently \npurchased a Ford Escape hybrid. This car achieves anywhere from 31 to \n36 miles per gallon of gasoline. Clearly, the technology is there.\n  What is needed, I stress again, is comprehensive energy policy that \nplaces greater emphasis on conserving energy and promoting fuel \nefficiency rather than simply drilling more oil wells in ever more \nfragile wilderness areas.\n  I also expressed to Dr. Bodman my strong support for the energy \ndepartment's research and development programs, for advancing energy \ntechnology, and for helping to maintain our Nation's leadership in \nadvanced science.\n  One project I support strongly is the DOE Science Advisory \nCommittee's highest priority recommendation, the construction of a rare \nisotope accelerator. This project is critically important in \nmaintaining our Nation's position as a leader in nuclear research.\n  The Department of Energy is in the process now of finalizing its \ndecision on where to place the rare isotope accelerator. Among the \ncontenders is Argonne National Laboratory at the University of Chicago.\n  I am working closely with my colleagues, Speaker Dennis Hastert and \nCongresswoman Judy Biggert to try to bring the rare isotope accelerator \nto Argonne.\n  First, Argonne has already built a major isotope accelerator and is \nthe only facility in America with the experience and management already \nin place to get this project up and running.\n  Second, Argonne has the necessary infrastructure to support the \nproject. Argonne's existing infrastructure would save the Federal \nGovernment approximately $100 million in project costs. At a time of \ntight budgets and spending constraints, this alone is an appealing \nbenefit.\n  Finally, Argonne is located just 25 miles southwest of the Chicago \nLoop, close to both Midway and O'Hare International Airport, making it \nreadily accessible to researchers around the world.\n  The rare isotope accelerator will allow researchers to delve into the \norigin of elements that make up the world. The research at this \nfacility will provide us the opportunity to advance the application of \nnuclear medicine and enhance our understanding of environmental science \nand the biology of the Earth. This project would be an extraordinary \nasset to Illinois. With an initial investment of $1 billion in \nIllinois's economy, the rare isotope accelerator would bring 1,750 \npermanent jobs and 16,000 temporary construction jobs to Illinois. It \nwould make Illinois a hub for scientific research, discovery and \ncollaboration.\n  I encourage Secretary-designee Bodman to give a good look to \nArgonne's application. I believe strongly that he will find Argonne's \nexpertise, success and cost-saving efforts make it the best site for \nthis facility.\n  Finally, I appreciated the opportunity to discuss with Dr. Bodman my \ninterest and strong support for the Energy Department's FutureGen \nproject.\n  In the 1970's there were 71 operating coal mines in Illinois. Today, \nthere are only 21 active mines. Over the past 30 years the economy in \nSouthern Illinois has slowly collapsed, leaving thousands of people \nunemployed.\n  The FutureGen project will advance energy production into the future \nby creating an integrated sequestration and hydrogen production zero-\nemission fossil fuel plant.\n  Southern Illinois is the perfect location for such a facility. \nIllinois contains more than 25 percent of the Nation's total \nrecoverable bituminous coal reserves, and it also contains deep saline \naquifers, available for the sequestration of carbon dioxide. While \ncreating a use for the high sulfur content coal in the State, the \nFutureGen plant would help revitalize the Southern Illinois coal \nindustry.\n  I am pleased to support Dr. Bodman to be America's next Energy \nSecretary and I look forward to working with him and the Illinois \ndelegation to bring this project to our State and to decrease America's \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering the \nnomination of Dr. Samuel Bodman to be the next Secretary of Energy. I \nunderstand that Dr. Bodman is likely to be confirmed. Though I will \nsupport his nomination, I want to review my understanding of Dr. \nBodman's commitment to several issues that are critical to our Nation \nand specifically to my State of Washington, so that he can begin his \ntenure with a clear understanding of this Senator's expectations.\n  During his confirmation process, I had the opportunity to meet with \nDr. Bodman personally and to engage him and seek his views on the \npolicies of the Department of Energy. Among the issues I raised were \nseveral of critical importance to the State of Washington, such as \nmaintaining the Federal Government's commitment to clean up the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation, considering carefully any changes to Federal \npolicies regarding the Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, and \nadvancing the Federal role in research and development at institutions \nsuch as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. On some of these \nissues, Dr. Bodman stated he needs time to review them early in his \ntenure at DOE, and has committed to me to do so. In other cases, he was \nable to make a more explicit commitment on the issue's merits, such as \nthe enforcement of the Triparty Agreement on cleanup of the Hanford \nNuclear reservation.\n  From our interactions, Dr. Bodman has begun to develop an \nappreciation for just how large DOE's ``footprint'' is in the State of \nWashington and how much is at stake for our economy and environment \nwhen it comes to the many policy decisions he will make when confirmed \nas Secretary of Energy. It is a job that comes with a considerable \nnumber of challenges--but also incredible opportunity. Putting in place \na real, forward-looking energy policy for the 21st century is not only \nessential for this Nation's economic security, it is my belief that it \nwill fuel the next wave of innovation. It is critical for this country \nto take the technology lead in the energy sector. Otherwise, we will \nfind ourselves in 10 to 20 years in exactly the same position we do \ntoday as it relates to our dependence on foreign oil--we will be \nimporting the next generation of energy technology. Instead, we need to \nseize the opportunity before us and recognize that it is the key to \nsecuring our Nation's long-term energy independence.\n  As I have expressed to Dr. Bodman, the Western electricity market \nmeltdown of 2000-2001 has had a profound impact on my State's economy, \nthe pocketbooks and economic well-being of my constituents. Moreover, \nthe Western crisis has brought to the forefront a number of very \nimportant policy questions about the kind of behavior that will be \ntolerated in our Nation's electricity markets, as the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC has continued to pursue its \n``restructuring'' agenda.\n  As the Secretary of Energy, Dr. Bodman will have a very important, \nleading role--defined in the 1977 Department of Energy Organization \nAct--in guiding overall electric regulatory policy.\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\n  The incoming DOE Secretary will need to provide strong leadership and \ncondemn the types of schemes used by Enron traders--manipulation \ntactics with infamous nicknames like Get Shorty, Death Star, and \nRicochet.\n  These are more than just ``theoretical'' concerns for me and my \nconstituents. Not only are Western ratepayers trying to recover some \nsmall fraction of the money they lost to Enron as a result of its \nunscrupulous trading practices, they are trying to avoid paying even \nmore. Right now, Enron is claiming utilities in Washington State and \nNevada alone owe about a half billion dollars more--for power Enron \nnever even delivered. You can understand just how outrageous this seems \nto my constituents, who are already struggling to pay their power \nbills.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Bodman provided assurances that market \nmanipulation cannot be tolerated and pledged to enforce applicable \nFederal statutes. We need to send a strong and unanimous message that \nthese practices will not be tolerated in our Nation's electricity \nmarkets.\n  Unfortunately, justice delayed is justice denied for Enron's victims. \nIt has literally been years now, in which the ratepayers of my State--\nwho have already suffered enough--have been waiting for the other shoe \nto drop. I look forward to working with Dr. Bodman in righting past \nwrongs done to consumers--including those in the State of Washington--\nand putting in place safeguards to prevent future victimization of \nelectric ratepayers.\n  As I referenced earlier in my remarks, I have emphasized to Dr. \nBodman the importance of Hanford cleanup to the residents of Washington \nand the Pacific Northwest as a whole. It has been my experience that \nachieving our mutual goal of an effective and efficient Hanford cleanup \nsuffers when relationships between the States and DOE, the \ncongressional delegations and other stakeholders are damaged by the bad \nfaith actions of one of the parties. Again, I applaud Dr. Bodman for \npublicly committing that the continued cleanup at Hanford will be done \nunder the framework of the Triparty Agreement, TPA.\n  I have also asked Dr. Bodman, and he has agreed, to consult with me \nand other members of the Washington congressional delegation on any \nadministration or legislative proposals regarding tank waste stored at \nthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation. We will not tolerate the same \nsituation that happened last year--when DOE-authored language related \nto the reclassification of high-level nuclear waste was inserted into \nthe fiscal year 2005 Defense authorization bill. This negotiation that \nwas done behind closed doors, in a committee that is not the rightful \nforum for debate on the issue of high-level nuclear waste and how it \nshould be treated and disposed of. This legislative end run was viewed \nby me and the senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, as well as \nthe State of Washington and many of our constituents, as an ill-\nconsidered attempt to take short cuts at Hanford. I hope Dr. Bodman's \ncommitment to consult with me will further his understanding of this \nissue and ultimately lead to an agreement that these bad faith \nmaneuvers will not be continued by the Department of Energy under his \nleadership.\n  Washington is blessed with an incredible system of clean, renewable, \nand cost-effective hydropower. The pitfalls of being 80-percent \ndependent on one particular source for electric generation--subject to \nthe whims of Mother Nature--have been made all too apparent in the past \nfew years.\n  I look forward to ensuring that the Department of Energy and the \npolicies that the incoming Secretary supports will ensure economic \nstability and growth for Washington residents specifically and \nthroughout the Pacific Northwest. In order to meet these goals, the \nDepartment of Energy should be engaged in four broad activities. They \ninclude providing some regulatory certainty to the electric industry, \nat the same time we set some forward-thinking, yet achievable, goals \nfor diversifying our energy sources; rationalizing our energy tax \npolicy, and, in tight budgetary times, target it to support emerging \ntechnologies; we need to promote a vigorous research and development \neffort; and finally we need to make sure we are investing in the \nworkforce, the human infrastructure, which is critical if we are going \nto lead in the global energy economy.\n  I believe that we are using unique Federal resources towards \ncontributing greatly to addressing some of these important challenges. \nAmong its diverse missions within the Department of Energy, the Pacific \nNorthwest National Lab has been a national leader in the development of \n``smart-grid'' R This ``smart-grid'' technology, due to be deployed \nthroughout the Pacific Northwest, will allow a reliable response to \nenergy demand and the propagation of a more distributive energy \ninfrastructure. These types of programs allow us to make our energy \ngrid more reliable, help train and grow our energy workforce for the \n21st century, and sustain and grow our economy. These programs should \nserve as examples of progressive investment of Federal resources \nyielding incredible results. I look forward to working with Dr. Bodman \nto ensuring the future growth of these programs.\n  Dr. Bodman also will be responsible for furthering the investments \nthat incentivize the long-term production of alternative energy \nresources, including wind and biomass. I know that many of these have \nstrong bipartisan support in the Congress and can play a critical role \nin sustainable economic development, especially in rural parts of our \nNation, like most of the Eastern part of Washington State. Again, it is \ninvestments like these that can ensure a more reliable and distributive \ngrid that will ultimately lessen our long term reliance on fossil \nfuels.\n  Finally, I look forward to educating Dr. Bodman on the importance of \nthe long-term stability of the Bonneville Power Administration. The \nincoming Secretary should note that decisions about the future \noperation of the BPA system, including any decision to join a regional \ntransmission organization, or RTO, should be left to stakeholders in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  It is critical that Bonneville be allowed to continue making \nimportant investments in upgrading its transmission infrastructure. \nLast year's budget called for legislation that would have effectively \nended critical transmission upgrades already underway in the Pacific \nNorthwest by effectively exhausting BPA's borrowing authority in 2008. \nI hope that Dr. Bodman's further education on these matters will yield \nhis commitment to ensure that these transmission upgrades can be \ncompleted--a key piece in making our energy system more reliable.\n  Again, I am supporting Dr. Bodman's nomination. As the next Secretary \nof Energy, he will be our Nation's chief energy policymaker. I look \nforward to further educating Dr. Bodman on these issues that are so \nimportant to my State and working with him to address these important \nchallenges. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Bodman's \nresponses to my questions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Questions From Senator Cantwell\n\n       Question No. 180: When we met, we informally discussed the \n     challenges the Northwest faces with respect to electricity \n     rates and our efforts to deal with the aftermath of the \n     Western energy crisis of 2000-2001. I know you recognize the \n     sad fact that the Northwest is far from out of the woods on \n     the rates crisis.\n       Obviously, the Western market meltdown has had a profound \n     impact on my state's economy, the pocketbooks and economic \n     well-being of my constituents--too many of whom have had to \n     make the choice between keeping their heat and lights on and \n     buying food, paying rent, and purchasing prescription drugs. \n     In some parts of Washington State, utility disconnection \n     rates have risen more than 40 percent.\n       People just can't pay their utility bills. So you can \n     imagine, what we've seen and heard since the height of the \n     crisis--as we've learned about the market manipulation and \n     fraud that took place in the Western market, while Enron \n     energy traders laughed about the plight of ``Grandma \n     Millie''--has added tremendous insult to substantial economic \n     injury.\n       Moreover, the Western crisis has brought to the forefront a \n     number of very important policy questions about the kind of \n     behavior that will be tolerated in our nation's electricity \n     markets, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     has continued to pursue its ``restructuring'' agenda.\n       As the Secretary of Energy, you would have a very \n     important, leading role-defined in the 1977 Department of \n     Energy Organization Act--in guiding overall electric \n     regulatory policy.\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\n       As such, before I get into some of the specifics, I want to \n     make sure we are on the same page when it comes to these \n     broader principles and policies:\n       First, do you agree that the types of schemes used by Enron \n     traders--manipulation tactics with famous nicknames like Get \n     Shorty, Death Star and Ricochet, many of which involved the \n     falsification of data and have been deemed illegal by the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)--are practices \n     that must not be tolerated in our nation's electricity \n     markets?\n       Answer: Senator Cantwell, illegal market manipulation \n     certainly cannot be tolerated, and we should vigorously \n     enforce the relevant laws.\n       Question No. 181: Do you also agree that, as a matter of \n     common-sense policy, the victims of these schemes should not \n     have to pay the inflated power prices resulting from market \n     manipulation?\n       Answer: We must take appropriate action to protect \n     consumers against the effects of illegal market manipulation.\n       Question No. 182: Do you also agree that this principle is \n     even more important in instances in which the company \n     perpetrating these schemes has done so while providing false \n     information to federal regulators, making it impossible for \n     those regulators to ensure markets are functioning properly?\n       Answer: Any form of market manipulation, including \n     providing false information to regulators as you have \n     described, is intolerable and we should vigorously enforce \n     the relevant laws. As you know, FERC and/or the courts have \n     the authority to review such cases and make appropriate \n     judgments.\n       Question No. 183: I particularly want to ask you your views \n     about instances where the company perpetrating these schemes \n     has frustrated the efforts of regulators and parties trying \n     to find the truth about the depth of its deceptions, failing \n     to turn over relevant evidence in a timely fashion. Do you \n     believe that, as a matter of national energy policy, a \n     company like that should still be allowed to reap the profits \n     of its market manipulation schemes?\n       Answer: As I am not aware of all the details of current \n     allegations, I cannot comment at this time but I would \n     reassert that I agree that regulatory authorities should act \n     appropriately to protect consumers against unscrupulous or \n     illegal conduct.\n       Question No. 184: Sadly, the theoretical situation I \n     outlined in my first question is not theoretical at all. It's \n     the situation that has been unfolding at FERC for the past \n     few years. Not only are Western parties trying to recover \n     some small fraction of the money they lost to Enron as a \n     result of its unscrupulous trading practices, they are trying \n     to avoid paying even more. Right now, Enron is claiming \n     utilities in Washington state and Nevada alone owe about a \n     half billion dollars more--for power Enron never even \n     delivered. You can understand just how outrageous this seems \n     to my constituents, who are already struggling to pay their \n     power bills.\n       Unfortunately, justice delayed is justice denied for \n     Enron's victims. It has literally been years now, in which \n     the ratepayers of my state--who have already suffered \n     enough--have been waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n       My understanding is that the Secretary of Energy has, under \n     the DOE Organization Act, substantial discretion to intervene \n     in matters pending before the Commission. There is also \n     substantial precedent, as both Secretaries Richardson and \n     Abraham have involved themselves in various ways in matters \n     before FERC. I can understand why. I imagine that any \n     Secretary would have a considerable interest in doing so, in \n     ensuring that regulatory matters are being handled in a \n     manner consistent with national energy policy. I hope that \n     you agree that what I've outlined above--the scenario in \n     which Enron is allowed to collect money for power never \n     delivered, at outrageous rates resulting from market \n     manipulation--is not in the public interest, and is not the \n     energy policy endorsed by this Administration.\n       Will you commit to me that, if confirmed as Secretary, you \n     would use your authority and intervene with FERC to prevent \n     ENRON from collecting these so-called ``termination \n     payments'' which harm Western consumers?\n       Answer: Senator Cantwell, under section 405 of the DOE \n     Organization Act, the Secretary of Energy has the ability to \n     intervene, as of right, in proceedings before FERC. It is my \n     understanding that there currently are matters pending before \n     FERC, as well as in the courts, relating to Enron, and that \n     some of those matters have been going on for several months \n     or years. If confirmed, I will look into the matter and \n     evaluate whether it would be appropriate for DOE to intervene \n     at this point in those proceedings at FERC.\n       Question No. 185: In our previous meeting we also had the \n     opportunity to discuss the importance of Hanford cleanup to \n     the people of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest as a \n     whole. It's also my belief that cleaning up the legacy of our \n     defense efforts must be high on our list of national \n     priorities. Cleanup suffers, however, when relationships \n     between the states and DOE, the Congressional delegation and \n     other stakeholders are damaged by the bad faith actions of \n     one of the parties.\n       I know you are aware of what happened last year, when DOE-\n     authored language was inserted into the Fiscal Year 2005 \n     Defense Authorization bill, behind closed doors, in a \n     Committee that is not the rightful forum for debate on the \n     issue of high-level nuclear waste and how it should be \n     treated and disposed of.\n       This legislative end-run was viewed by myself and Sen. \n     Murray, as well as the State of Washington and many of our \n     constituents, as an ill-considered attempt to take short-cuts \n     at Hanford.\n       Will you ensure that the DOE will not attempt a similar \n     legislative end-run around the State of Washington and its \n     Congressional delegation on the issue of high-level waste \n     reclassification, during your tenure as the Secretary of \n     Energy?\n       Answer: Senator, I appreciated the opportunity to meet with \n     you to hear your views about the Hanford cleanup. I agree \n     with you on the importance of cleaning up the Hanford site in \n     a manner that is protective of human health and the \n     environment. The remediation of liquid radioactive waste \n     stored in aging underground tanks in Washington, Idaho and \n     South Carolina is by far the greatest environmental challenge \n     facing the Department of Energy. It is my understanding that \n     the legislation that was enacted in the last Congress only \n     affects the Department's sites in South Carolina and Idaho. \n     If confirmed, I can assure you that the Department will \n     consult with you and the State of Washington on the cleanup \n     of tank waste.\n       Question No. 186: Among the biggest challenges at Hanford \n     is the cleanup of 53 million gallons of nuclear waste, \n     contained in 177 tanks within 7 miles of the Columbia River. \n     Already, some 67 tanks have leaked an estimated one million \n     gallons of this waste into the ground.\n       Retrieving and disposing of the waste in these tanks is one \n     of the most challenging--yet crucial--components of \n     successful Hanford cleanup. The TriParty Agreement lays out \n     the terms of the relationship between the State of Washington \n     and federal government when it comes to cleanup. In the view \n     of the State of Washington, the agreement vests DOE with the \n     responsibility of retrieving and cleaning up ``everything \n     that is technically feasible but no less than 99 percent'' of \n     the waste in these tanks.\n       As Secretary of Energy, will you commit to abide by this \n     requirement of the TriParty Agreement?\n       Answer: The Department will abide by the terms of the \n     TriParty Agreement.\n       Question No. 187: As you may know, this Administration's \n     previous budgets have proposed withholding certain cleanup \n     funds until DOE has secured what it views to be favorable \n     outcomes in pending litigation or legislation. This has been \n     widely viewed by many as blackmail, with the purpose of \n     getting the State of Washington to back-down on its cleanup \n     requirements at Hanford.\n       Will you commit to me that, as Secretary, you will not use \n     these same tactics?\n       Answer: Senator, I am unaware of the situation you \n     describe. If confirmed, I intend to review the accelerated \n     cleanup program and I would be happy to meet with you and \n     discuss this further.\n       Question No. 188: More generally, are you committed to \n     working collaboratively with Washington State regulators, the \n     affected communities' and workers' representatives, and the \n     members of the Washington State Congressional delegation to \n     ensure that the cleanup is fully funded and completed as soon \n     as possible--in a manner that ensures the equal protection of \n     the workers, the public, and the environment?\n       Answer: Senator, I believe that it is important for the \n     Department to work cooperatively with the congressional \n     delegations that represent the DOE sites, as well as with the \n     State regulators, the local community and the workers' \n     representatives. If confirmed, I would expect this practice \n     to be carried out.\n       Question No. 189: Last year, the National Institute of \n     Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and DOE conducted \n     audits at the Hanford nuclear site on the issue of worker \n     health and safety. Both NIOSH and DOE came up with a long \n     list of recommendations and corrective actions. Many \n     improvements have been made. But I also want to ensure that \n     DOE, as a matter of policy, is doing its job in ensuring \n     adequate health and safety protections on an ongoing basis.\n       As Secretary, what procedures will you put in place to \n     assure that the Department continues to improve its health \n     and safety protection for workers at sites like Hanford?\n       Answer: The safety of the Department's workers will be a \n     top priority for me if confirmed. I will review the safety \n     procedures and determine whether additional measures are \n     needed.\n       Question No. 190: Many major DOE procurement decisions are \n     being challenged and overturned. What will you do to improve \n     the quality, fairness, timeliness, and success of the DOE \n     procurement process?\n       Answer: Offerors that are not awarded contracts have the \n     right to protest the contract award and other decisions to \n     the Government Accountability Office. It is my understanding \n     that, on a relative basis, very few protests are filed \n     against DOE award decisions. If confirmed, I will ensure that \n     DOE has appropriate standards, systems and quality controls \n     in place to guard against irregularities in the contracting \n     process.\n       Question No. 191: Another major concern on the part of many \n     of my constituents is whether DOE is implementing the \n     President's directive to increase government procurements \n     with small business.\n       What will you do to improve and expand DOE procurements \n     that benefit small businesses, particularly those based in \n     the local communities most affected by contamination and \n     which will suffer severe economic\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\n     impacts when cleanup is done if local, sustainable businesses \n     are not developed?\n       Answer: If confirmed, 1 would fully support the President's \n     policy of increasing government procurements with small \n     businesses.\n       Question No. 192: Will you support efforts to expedite \n     evaluations of procurement involving local small businesses--\n     particularly since extended delays are especially harmful to \n     small companies that don't have the resources to keep teams \n     mobilized?\n       Answer: It would be my intent, if confirmed, to review all \n     of the issues surrounding small business procurement and I \n     would be happy at the appropriate time to meet with you to \n     discuss the matter further.\n       Question No. 193: DOE has made a major commitment to the \n     Hanford Vitrification Project. The Defense Board and others \n     have raised questions about the safety of the design and \n     prospect for cost increases and schedule slippage. Given the \n     supreme importance of this project to the future of Hanford \n     cleanup, what do you propose to ensure that this facility \n     stays on track? Is there some value in an independent review?\n       Answer: Senator, I appreciated the opportunity to discuss \n     this issue with you during our recent meeting. I understand \n     the importance of the Hanford cleanup and I share your view \n     that the cleanup must proceed in a timely, efficient manner \n     that is protective of human health and the environment. If \n     confirmed, I will review the Hanford Vitrification Project \n     and would welcome an opportunity to meet with you again to \n     discuss this project further.\n       Question No. 194: The Volpentest HAMMER Training and \n     Education Center at Hanford was built by DOE to ensure the \n     health and safety of Hanford cleanup workers and emergency \n     responders. HAMMER's unique hands-on ``Training as Real as It \n     Gets'' is essential to the safe, cost effective, and \n     successful completion of Hanford cleanup. Further, as the \n     cleanup workforce decreases, more of HAMMER's capabilities \n     will become available for other DOE missions, such as energy \n     assurance and hydrogen safety, and for training law \n     enforcement, security, emergency response, and other homeland \n     security-related personnel.\n       Will you ensure that DOE continues to fully utilize HAMMER \n     to protect the safety and health of Hanford cleanup workers? \n     Will you support the development of new DOE training missions \n     at HAMMER? Will you help with the Department of Homeland \n     Security and other agencies to develop, expand, and support \n     other training missions at HAMMER?\n       Answer: Senator, I am not familiar with this issue. If \n     confirmed, I would review this matter and I would be happy to \n     report to you my thoughts on HAMMER.\n       Question No. 195: When DOE recompetes its major site \n     contracts for complex cleanup projects, the process often \n     takes up to two years with extensive worker and community \n     anxiety. Then, it may take up to another two years for the \n     new contractor management team to get up to speed fully with \n     subsequent impacts on the projects, workers, and communities. \n     None of this is good for DOE, the workers, or the \n     communities.\n       Will you consult to the extent allowed by law with the \n     affected workers' and communities' representatives before a \n     recompete decision is made, to determine the best course of \n     action?\n       Answer: Generally when the government considers contract \n     competition it uses an extensive array of mechanisms to \n     convey public information and obtain feedback from interested \n     parties. If confirmed, I will ensure that DOE employs these \n     mechanisms and practices to the maximum extent practicable.\n       Question No. 196: Dr. Bodman, I also know you are beginning \n     to understand the importance that I, and others in the \n     Northwest delegation, place on the Bonneville Power \n     Administration and the policies that affect its long-term \n     viability. BPA has for decades been the engine of the \n     regional economy. As such, I'm sure we'll be in frequent \n     contact on many BPA-related issues.\n       First, I want to confirm something we've previously \n     discussed. Namely, I want to ensure that you understand that \n     the decision of whether BPA should join a regional \n     transmission organization (RTO) is something that must be \n     decided in the Northwest, after an inclusive stakeholder \n     process that considers the real world costs and benefits of \n     such a change. Can you commit to me that you will not, in \n     your potential capacity as Energy Secretary, force BPA to \n     join an RTO?\n       Answer: Senator, I appreciate your bringing the issue to my \n     attention and while I do not feel I am in a position to make \n     a commitment at this time, I can provide assurances that I \n     will work with you on this issue should I be confirmed.\n       Question No. 197: Second, as you know, Bonneville has the \n     statutory responsibility to maintain the reliability of the \n     Northwest transmission system, of which it currently owns \n     more than 75 percent. Interestingly, the Northwest is one of \n     the few regions in the country where transmission lines are \n     currently under construction. This is due to the unique way \n     in which BPA uses borrowing authority, backed by Northwest \n     ratepayers, to finance these investments. Unfortunately, the \n     President's budget last year called for legislation that \n     would tie Bonneville's hands, and make it virtually \n     impossible for the agency to continue the transmission \n     expansions necessary to maintain the reliability of the \n     Northwest system. Under the proposal, BPA would exhaust its \n     borrowing authority in 2008--well before the region can \n     complete the needed transmission upgrades. Can you commit to \n     me that as Secretary of Energy you will not support \n     legislation that would impair BPA's ability to make these \n     crucial investments?\n       Answer: I am not familiar with the funding levels being \n     requested or other proposals for the Bonneville Power \n     Administration in the FY '06 budget. If confirmed, I will \n     evaluate this matter and I would be happy to meet with you to \n     discuss your concerns further.\n       Question No. 198: For the past two years, the Pacific \n     Northwest National Laboratory has been working with the \n     Department to solve the issue of replacement facilities and \n     lab space in the 300 Area of Hanford. The 300 Area is home to \n     critical on-going research in science and national and \n     homeland security, but the area is scheduled for closure by \n     2009 as part of the DOE accelerated cleanup program. \n     Consequently, PNNL must vacate the area on a tight schedule, \n     and without interrupting critical work for the DOE, NNSA, and \n     DHS.\n       Planning for these facilities has begun, but the most \n     substantial funding needs lie ahead. PNNL is an enduring \n     asset to the state and the entire Pacific Northwest region, \n     and we cannot afford to come up short on this investment. I \n     understand we are in a difficult budget environment, but I \n     would like to seek your commitment for continued funding. \n     Will you commit to keep this effort on track?\n       Answer: I agree with you that the research that takes place \n     at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory 300 Area is important to \n     both science and homeland security issues. It is my \n     understanding that DOE and the Department of Homeland \n     Security are working cooperatively to ensure that a new \n     laboratory is constructed and that the important missions at \n     the laboratory go uninterrupted. If confirmed, I will review \n     this matter and support it as appropriate.\n       Question No. 199: Research and technology applications \n     developed to secure America's electricity grid system are \n     being funded by the Department's Office of Electricity \n     Transmission and Distribution. Many entities in Washington \n     State, including the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, \n     have formed an Alliance that is working closely with the \n     Department to help bring these technologies forward. I \n     strongly support the GridWise and GridWorks programs and seek \n     your support. Do you plan to make research and development \n     through these programs a top priority?\n       Answer: I appreciate your support for the efforts of the \n     Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution and if \n     confirmed, look forward to working with you on programs like \n     the GridWise and GridWorks programs.\n       Question No. 200: As you may know, I sponsored legislation \n     in the last Congress to support the Genomes to Life program \n     at the Department of Energy. I strongly support an expanded \n     program and development of research centers to support this \n     goal. Last year, the Office of Science released a Twenty-Year \n     Facility Outlook that included four Genomes to Life centers. \n     The FY05 Energy and Water Development appropriation includes \n     $10M to begin preliminary design of the first facility. Are \n     you committed to fulfilling the implementation of the 20-year \n     strategy, including the four GTL centers?\n       Answer: I will need to familiarize myself with this 20-year \n     strategy for science facilities, if I am confirmed as \n     Secretary. But, I can assure you that if confirmed, \n     maintaining a robust scientific infrastructure will be an \n     important priority for me.\n       Question No. 201: Last week, the Washington Post reported \n     that the Bush administration's budget request would freeze \n     most spending, including science, and slash or eliminate \n     dozens of federal programs. In my view, this is a very short-\n     sighted approach to ensuring the economic future of this \n     country. In my state, for example, the DOE's Office of \n     Science invests more than $135 million a year in university \n     grants and in support of the Pacific Northwest National \n     Laboratory. Can you share with us your commitment to science \n     and R investments being made at the Department of Energy?\n       Answer: The Department of Energy has a responsibility to \n     maintain America's world leadership in Science. The Pacific \n     Northwest National Laboratory certainly plays a key role in \n     the Department's and the Nation's scientific enterprise and, \n     if confirmed, I will pay very close attention to how we \n     nurture that important asset in your state. While we pursue \n     the President's commitment to deficit reduction, I can assure \n     you that I will also work to maintain and improve upon \n     America's scientific infrastructure that is the envy of the \n     world.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am in support of the nomination of Dr. \nSamuel W. Bodman to be Secretary of Energy.\n  I look forward to working closely with Dr. Bodman as we tackle the \nimportant task of crafting a national energy policy that assures our \nNation's energy independence and energy security and at the same time \nprotects our air, land, and water for future generations.\n  Colorado is blessed with an abundance of natural energy resources, \nand the oil and gas industry is a significant part of our state \neconomy. As long as America is dependent on foreign oil for a \nsignificant part of our energy needs,\n\n[[Page S633]]\n\nhowever, our economy and our national security are at risk. We need to \nmove rapidly toward energy independence. Renewable energy and \nconservation must also play a significant role as, together, we look \nfor ways to diversify our portfolio of energy sources and reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels. As we work to attain energy independence, \nwe can also strengthen our economy, increase our national security, and \nprotect our air, land, and water.\n  During Dr. Bodman's confirmation hearing before the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I had the opportunity to discuss with Dr. \nBodman a few of the many issues affecting Colorado, to which I hope Dr. \nBodman will immediately turn his attention upon being confirmed today.\n  First, Dr. Bodman understands the importance of DOE's environmental \ncleanup at Rocky Flats, and he assures me that he will continue to make \nthis a priority for the Department until the site is cleaned up and a \nlarge portion of it converted to a national wildlife refuge.\n  The cleanup of Rocky Flats serves as a model for the cleanup of DOE \nfacilities nationwide, and it is therefore important to the people of \nmy State and to the country as a whole for DOE to make its plant \nclosure mission at Rocky Flats a priority and to complete environmental \ncleanup, waste management, and decommissioning by December 2006.\n  Second, I specifically requested that Dr. Bodman look into the \nDepartment's refusal, so far, to comply with the State of Colorado's \ninstitutional control laws, which were passed unanimously by the \nColorado legislature and signed into law by our Governor. DOE has \nrefused to put those restrictions in an environmental covenant, as \nrequired under State law. DOE has refused to comply with other States' \ninstitutional control laws as well. This refusal has raised serious \nquestions about the long-term reliability of the cleanup now underway \nat DOE facilities across the country.\n  I strongly urge the Department to adopt a policy to comply with State \ninstitutional control laws. These are valid State laws. They enhance \nthe safety of cleanups, and the cost of compliance is minimal. In my \njudgment, DOE is required to comply with these laws under the Federal \nFacility Compliance Act.\n  Dr. Bodman assured me that he would look into this important matter \npromptly, and I intend to hold him to that promise.\n  Third, Dr. Bodman pledged his support for the Department's National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, CO. As you know, Mr. President, \nNREL is the Department of Energy's primary national laboratory for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. I am a \nproud supporter of NREL and its research projects. Providing NREL with \nthe resources it needs will lead our Nation to greater energy \nindependence and security.\n  In response to my questions, Dr. Bodman assures me the Department \nfully supports the construction of NREL's new Science and Technology \nFacility--the first new research laboratory on the lab's main campus in \nnearly a decade. The new facility will house key elements of NREL's \nworld-class research in hydrogen and other promising renewable energy \ntechnologies and will push the envelope on sustainable, energy \nefficient building design. Construction of the facility is scheduled \nfor completion in early 2007.\n  With these and other answers to my questions, I am pleased to vote \ntoday in support of Dr. Bodman's nomination to be our country's next \nEnergy Secretary. But I want to make clear that I will continuously \nwork to ensure that Dr. Bodman and the Department of Energy live up to \nthese commitments to Colorado--that is my duty and I intend to fulfill \nit.\n  The Congress will work on an energy bill again this year. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and with Dr. Bodman to do everything we can to help \ndevelop a comprehensive and sustainable energy strategy that is also \nprotective of a healthy environment in the West and across the country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate is expected to confirm \nthe nomination of Samuel Bodman to be the next Secretary of Energy.\n  As Secretary of Energy, Mr. Bodman will face challenges that are \ncritically important to our economy and our national security. We \ndepend on a stable supply of energy to keep our economy moving. Yet, \nthe United States continues to rely too heavily on oil imports from \nother parts of the world, especially the Middle East. We import about \n55 percent of the oil we consume, and this percentage is expected to \nincrease to 70 percent by 2025. Similarly, we are relying more and more \non imports of natural gas. This dependency puts us at a strategic and \neconomic disadvantage. The Secretary of Energy must work with the \ndiverse energy interests, the administration, and the Congress to \ndevelop a comprehensive Energy bill that will move us toward energy \nindependence.\n  The Secretary of Energy position is especially important to North \nDakota's energy producers and economy. North Dakota can be a \nsignificant supplier of electricity to the rest of the country. My \nState is blessed with an 800-year supply of lignite coal and the \npotential to be the biggest wind energy producer in the country.\n  The main challenge we face is developing a transmission grid that \nwill allow our electricity producers to fully utilize these resources \nand send power to the rest of the country. We need to invest \nsignificant new resources in finding new ways to upgrade and expand our \ntransmission capacity and reliability.\n  We also need to increase investment in, and more aggressively pursue, \nthe development of clean coal technology. By reducing pollution from \ncoal-burning power plants, clean coal technology will ensure that this \nplentiful, domestic source of energy remains a vital part of our \nnational energy portfolio.\n  The nomination of Samuel Bodman is encouraging. Mr. Bodman has proven \nhimself to be an effective manager as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury \nand Deputy Secretary of Commerce. In addition to his exemplary \nmanagerial skills, Mr. Bodman has the background knowledge and \nintellect to understand the importance of research on, and development \nof, advanced energy technologies. These technologies, including clean \ncoal technology, will help us meet our country's energy challenges. I \nlook forward to working with Mr. Bodman on the funding and development \nof grant programs to bring advanced technology to North Dakota's power \nproducers and transmitters.\n  Today I offer my support for Senate confirmation of Mr. Samuel Bodman \nas our next Secretary of Energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S633-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my native State of Nevada has always honored \nthe brave men and women who fight to defend our Nation's freedom.\n  We have in Nevada a higher percentage of veterans than any other \nstate except Alaska. We are fiercely proud of them, and we recognize \nthat we owe them a tremendous debt.\n  So today, on behalf of all Nevadans, I rise to honor the life and \nmemory of Reuben Law, who died on New Year's Day in Carson City at the \nage of 106.\n  He was a veteran of the First World War . . . one of 4.7 million who \nserved in that conflict.\n  He was the last surviving Nevada resident who served in that war . . \n. and one of fewer than 200 surviving World War I veterans in the \nNation.\n  Reuben Law grew up in Minnesota. He was working at a Ford plant in \nMinneapolis, assembling Model-T Fords, when he as a teenager enlisted \nin the Army.\n  He almost died before he ever set foot in Europe. The great influenza \nepidemic of 1918 was raging, and the flu claimed the lives of more than \n60 soldiers on the transport ship that carried him to France.\n  But Reuben survived, and he served as an Army sergeant in eastern \nFrance in 1918 and 1919, transporting supplies and wounded soldiers to \na military hospital.\n  Reuben and some of his buddies celebrated the end of the war by \npiling into\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\na truck and riding to the nearby town of Allerey. He would later recall \nthat every girl they passed gave them a kiss, because everyone was so \nelated.\n  World War I was a horrible, bloody conflict. It was supposed to be \n``the war to end all wars.'' But only two decades later, the Second \nWorld War broke out.\n  Once again, Reuben Law stepped forward. He tried to re-enlist in the \nArmy, but he was in his early 40s, and officers told him he was too \nold. So he spent World War II as a member of the U.S. Coast Guard \nAuxiliary, piloting patrol boats on the Mississippi River.\n  Between the wars, and after World War II, he had returned to live in \nhis native Minnesota. He moved to Nevada in 1993.\n  Even then, Reuben Law wasn't through living. In his mid 90s, he went \nfor rides in a hot air balloon, and he drove a car until he was 101.\n  Reuben Law spent most of his career working in the Minnesota parks \ndepartment and a landscape architecture firm. In both jobs, he was able \nto spend a lot of time outdoors, which he cited as one reason for his \nlongevity and good health.\n  He also claimed that he had good genes--and I suppose he was right, \nsince his mother and one of his aunts lived to be 109.\n  Reuben was married twice . . . and he was twice a widower. He was the \nfather of four children.\n  In my home State, we celebrate each October 31 as Nevada Day. Last \nOctober, Reuben Law was a special guest in the Nevada Day parade in \nCarson City.\n  Not too long ago, when he was asked about his remarkable life, Reuben \nquoted a saying from his favorite coffee cup:\n\n       I guess I've seen it all, I've heard it all, I've done it \n     all I just can't remember it all.\n\n  Reuben Law couldn't remember everything he did in his long, storied \nlife . . . but the people of Nevada will never forget his brave \nservice.\n  In remembering him, we renew our commitment to honor each one of the \nbrave men and women who put our Nation's security and freedom above \ntheir personal interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S634-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENSURING COLLEGE ACCESS FOR ALL AMERICANS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Ensuring \nCollege Access for All Americans Act. I am pleased to loin Senators \nCorzine and Kennedy as a cosponsor.\n  This legislation would restore cuts to Pell grants, the principle \nFederal financial aid program for lower income college students. \nAlthough the President recently announced his intention to incremental \nincrease the maximum grants available over the next 5 years, his \nadministration has changed the formula for eligibility in a way that \npushes thousands of American young people out of the program.\n  In Illinois, 48,600 students will be affected by this change. That's \na lot of students who are trying to piece together the financial aid \npackage they need to go to school next year. Of those, close to 1,500 \nyoung people will entirely lose eligibility for the program. Thanks to \nthe changes made by this administration, students in Illinois will lose \n$5.5 million in direct Federal grants for college costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep in mind that 90 percent of Pell Grant \nrecipients are considered low-income. Nearly 1.4 million recipients \nnationwide will see a reduction or total loss of their Pell grants. The \nDepartment's new tax tables will eliminate or reduce aid for 26 percent \nof all Pell grant recipients. These are kids--students--who with their \nfamilies are working hard to finance a college education.\n  The students most affected by these changes are likely to work longer \nhours, borrow more money, or reduce their academic course load in order \nto balance any loss of funds. Without grant assistance, low-income \nstudents have to rely more heavily on student loans. Pell grant \nrecipients are already four times more likely than all other students \nto take out loans, and they will graduate with twice as much debt as \ntheir peers.\n  Why is this happening? It has been 17 years since the tax tables were \nlast updated. Yes, we need timely updates, greater accuracy and \nalignment with current state tax policy, but the administration's \nproposal does not even reflect current tax levels. Under the updated \ncalculation, families are getting less credit for their state and local \ntaxes at a time when they are actually paying more taxes. The \nadministration's ``new'' tax tables are based on Fiscal Year 2002 State \ntax information. According to the National Association of State Budget \nOfficers, though, since FY 2002, states have enacted $14.1 billion in \ntax and fee increases. Because the administration's proposal is still \nbased on outdated tax information, it does not take into account these \nsubstantial increases in what families are actually paying in State \ntaxes.\n  The legislation we introduce today restores fairness to the \neligibility process. It restores opportunity for the 1.4 million low- \nand middle-income young people who are registering for classes, paying \ntuition and buying books at a time when tuition costs are rising \nexponentially. Let's make sense of the Pell grant eligibility process, \nprotect the modest grant levels available for students, and extend the \nopportunity that higher education in America provides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S634-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S634-S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF PROCEDURE--SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel.

Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony.

The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9  Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the \n     Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all \n     its members, met and considered the alleged contempt, \n     afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in \n     person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and \n     agreed, by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such \n     recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10  Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, his \n     or her appearance before the Committee.\n\n\n    RULE 9.

An unclassified version of each report may be made \n     available to the public at the discretion of the select \n     committee. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the \n     public disclosure in such reports of the names of individuals \n     engaged in intelligence activities for the United States or \n     the divulging of intelligence methods employed or the sources \n     of information on which such reports are based or the amount \n     of funds authorized to be appropriated for intelligence \n     activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters within \n     the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5. (a) For the purposes of this resolution, the select \n     committee is authorized in its discretion (1) to make \n     investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction, (2) \n     to make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, \n     (3) to employ personnel, (4) to hold hearings, (5) to sit and \n     act at any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and \n     adjourned periods of the Senate, (6) to require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production \n     of correspondence, books, papers, and documents, (7) to take \n     depositions and other testimony, (8) to procure the service \n     of individual consultants or organizations thereof, in \n     accordance with the provisions of section 202(1) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, and (9) with the \n     prior consent of the government department or agency \n     concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to \n     use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any \n     such department or agency.\n       (b) The chairman of the select committee or any member \n     thereof may administer oaths to witnesses.\n       (c) Subpoenas authorized by the select committee may be \n     issued over the signature of the chairman, the vice chairman \n     or any member of the select committee designated by the \n     chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     chairman or any member signing the subpoenas.\n       Sec. 6. No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform service for or at \n     the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the [Select Committee on Ethics]) and of such committee as \n     to the security of such information during and after the \n     period of his employment or contractual agreement with such \n     committee; and (2) received an appropriate security clearance \n     as determined by such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of Central Intelligence. The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of Central Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in which \n     such committee determines the national interest in the \n     disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader the President, \n     unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day period, the \n     President, personally in writing, notifies the committee that \n     he objects to the disclosure of such information, provides \n     his reason therefore, and certifies that the threat to the \n     national interest of the United States posed by such \n     disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs any public \n     interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority \n     Leader and Minority Leader jointly or the select \n     Committee, by majority vote, may refer the question of the \n     disclosure of such information to the Senate for \n     consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed.\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n       Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in \n     closed session, which may not extend beyond the close of the \n     ninth day on which the Senate is in session following the day \n     on which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close \n     of the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the \n     disposition of such matter in open session, without debate, \n     and without divulging the information with respect to which \n     the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of \n     such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses \n     (A), (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. \n     Any vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant \n     to this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member \n     of the Senate or move for reconsideration of the vote within \n     the time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule \n     XIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure \n     of such information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the [Select Committee on \n     Ethics] to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of \n     intelligence information by a Member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and to report to \n     the Senate concerning any allegation which it finds to be \n     substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the [Select Committee on Ethics] shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     [Select Committee on Ethics] determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10. Upon expiration of the Select Committee on \n     Government Operations with Respect to Intelligence \n     Activities, established by Senate Resolution 21, Ninety-\n     fourth Congress, all records, files, documents, and \n     other materials in the possession, custody, or control of \n     such committee, under appropriate conditions established \n     by it, shall be transferred to the select committee.\n       Sec. 11.

Subject to the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     funds shall be appropriated for any fiscal year beginning \n     after September 30, 1976, with the exception of a continuing \n     bill or resolution, or amendment thereto, or conference \n     report thereon, to, or for use of, any department or agency \n     of the United States to carry out any of the following \n     activities, unless such funds shall have been previously \n     authorized by a bill or joint resolution passed by the Senate \n     during the same or preceding fiscal year to carry out such \n     activity for such fiscal year:\n       (1) The activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and \n     the Director of Central Intelligence.\n       (2) The activities of the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n       (3) The activities of the National Security Agency.\n       (4) The intelligence activities of other agencies and \n     subdivisions of the Department of Defense.\n       (5) The intelligence activities of the Department of State.\n       (6) The intelligence activities of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, including all activities of the Intelligence \n     Division.\n       Sec. 13.

Prior to the \n     issuance of each subpoena, the Ranking Minority Member, and \n     any other Member so requesting, shall be notified regarding \n     the identity of the person to whom the subpoena will be \n     issued and the nature of the information sought, and its \n     relationship to the investigation.\n       3.

Statement. Witnesses are required to make an \n     introductory statement and shall file 150 copies of such \n     statement with the Chairman or clerk of the Committee at \n     least 72 hours in advance of their appearance, unless the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member determine that there is \n     good cause for a witness's failure to do so.

Counsel:\n       (a) A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be present \n     during his testimony at any public or closed hearing or \n     depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of his \n     rights, provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       (b) A witness is unable for economic reasons to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee at least 48 hours prior to \n     the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain \n     volunteer counsel for the witness. Such counsel shall be \n     subject solely to the control of the witness and not the \n     Committee Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       5. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     executive and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact, the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by the \n     Committee. The Chairman shall inform the Committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     Committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member or by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days \n     before the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman \n     or presiding Member of the Committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\n                    VI. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness's failure to appear unless the \n     deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n\n                           VII. Subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules. A subcommittee shall be governed by the Committee \n     rules, except that its quorum for all business shall be one-\n     third of the subcommittee Membership, and for hearings shall \n     be one Member.\n\n\n                             VIII. Reports\n\n       Committee reports incorporating Committee findings and \n     recommendations shall be printed only with the prior approval \n     of the Committee, after an adequate period for review and \n     comment. The printing, as Committee documents, of materials \n     prepared by staff for informational purposes, or the printing \n     of materials not originating with the Committee or staff, \n     shall require prior consultation with the minority staff; \n     these publications shall have the following language printed \n     on the cover of the document: ``Note: This document has been \n     printed for informational purposes. It does not represent \n     either findings or recommendations formally adopted by the \n     Committee.''\n\n\n                         IX. Amendment of Rules\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be amended or revised at any \n     time, provided that not less than a majority of the Committee \n     present so determine at a Committee meeting preceded by at \n     least 3 days notice of the amendments or revisions proposed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S643-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S643-S644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, last week marked the 60th anniversary of \nthe liberation of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in southern Poland. \nOn January 27, 1945, Soviet troops freed the prisoners at Auschwitz, \nthe largest Nazi death camp. During that same period, our American \ntroops were freeing prisoners at other death camps.\n  This year, the world noted the significance of this anniversary. On \nMonday, at the request of the United States, Canada, the European \nUnion, Australia, New Zealand, and Russia, the United Nations held the \nfirst-ever General Assembly commemoration of the World War II \nHolocaust. Six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, \nincluding two-thirds of European Jews.\n  As we remember the many who suffered and died at Auschwitz and at the \nother concentration camps, we must not forget the lessons of the past. \nThese awful events revealed what people can do to one another, and we \ncan never forget what happened only 60 short years ago. In not \nforgetting, we must be careful that this form of genocide is never \nrepeated. Even now, in too many countries, anti-Semitism is on the \nrise. The State Department recently released a report indicating it is \ngaining momentum in Europe and the Middle East. In a Wall Street \nJournal commentary, author Adam Zagajewski stated that there is ``a \nsolid, murky stratum of anti-Semitism more and more perceptible in \ndifferent European countries.'' The world must respond to this threat--\nbefore it is too late.\n  Here in the United States, we have always recognized the importance \nof religious freedom. Religious freedom is more than just religious \ntolerance--it is religious pluralism. We must not err on either \nextreme--either to impose one religion on all peoples or, what some \nwould like to see in this country, to banish all expression of religion \nfrom the public square. Rather, we should welcome all religions and \nexpressions of faith. This is the right on which our country was \nfounded, and we must continue to allow people to worship as they please \nand freely live out their faith as good citizens.\n  In his well-known 1790 letter to the Newport Hebrew Congregation, \nPresident George Washington wrote, ``The Citizens of the United States \nof America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to \nmankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of \nimitation. All possess a like liberty of conscience and immunities of \ncitizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it \nwas by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the \nexercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government \nof the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to \npersecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its \nprotection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on \nall occasions their effectual support.''\n  This country has a history of encouraging faith. In 1948, as the \nJewish community in Munich was still rebuilding after the end of World \nWar II, local rabbis asked the United States Armed Forces for \nassistance in obtaining copies of the Talmud. The Nazis had tried to \ndestroy all the copies of the Talmud during World War II and only a \nprecious few were left to study. When requested by the local rabbis, \nthe United States Armed Forces responded, and helped to publish 19 \nvolumes of the Talmud for the use of the community, recognizing the \ngreat importance of the Talmud to rebuilding the displaced Jewish \ncommunity in that region. The title page of the first volume of that \nnew Talmud edition stated that it was published ``with the aid of the \nAmerican Military Command and the American Jewish Joint Distribution \nCommittee in Germany.'' It was dedicated to the ``United States Army,'' \nwhich provided the opportunity and the means for its publication. In \nthis example, the United States Army reached out to help displaced \npersons, who had faced such terrible struggles to survive, to rebuild \nthe community in that land, and it did so by encouraging their faith.\n  In like manner, we should encourage people to live out their faith, \nfor it is faith that teaches us to respect the lives of those around \nus, to love our neighbors, and to care for one another. True religious \nfreedom and pluralism does not mean that we will agree with our \nneighbor on our faith beliefs, but it does mean that we will fight for \nthe right of our neighbor to freely believe what he or she thinks best.\n  Banishing religion from the public square will not result in respect \nfor all but, rather, respect for a few. Ensuring that everyone is free \nto practice one's faith in one's own way is the correct way to build a \nculture that is respectful of differences and mindful of the\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nneeds of others. It is the way to ensure that Auschwitz, Buchenwald, \nand the other death camps are never repeated in other areas of the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S644-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COSPONSORSHIP OF S. 187\n\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Leavitt to be U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Governor Leavitt has had a lengthy career in public service, having \nserved most recently as the 10th Administrator of the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  In 1992, Leavitt was elected the 14th Governor of Utah and was that \nState's longest-serving Governor.\n  During his three terms as Utah's Governor, he was chosen by the \nNation's Governors to represent States in working with Congress on \nwelfare reform, Medicaid and children's health insurance. He chaired \nthe National Governors Association, the Western Governors Association, \nthe Republican Governors Association and Council of State Governments.\n  Governor Leavitt established an innovative welfare reform waiver \nprogram focused on increasing family income using an approach that \nemphasized employment and child support, but also addressed initial \nproblems with families in need such as domestic violence, education, \ntraining, language barriers, and substance abuse issues to promote \nsustainable employment.\n  This year, the HHS Secretary will have the critical task of \noverseeing the implementation of the first ever drug benefit in \nMedicare as well as the implementation of several program \nreauthorizations such as Ryan White, Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, all within \nan ever-constrained budgetary picture.\n  As someone who voted for the Medicare Modernization Act, it is my \nhope that Governor Leavitt will work with me to address some of the \nweaknesses of the bill in addition to ensuring that the more than 41 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries know about this new benefit in Medicare \nand its low-income subsidies.\n  Of greatest concern to me is the cost of prescription drugs. In \nvoting for the Medicare bill, I said on the Senate floor that one of \nthe greatest weaknesses of the bill was that it not only did not do \nenough to control the rising cost of prescription drugs but it \nspecifically prohibited the HHS from using the bulk purchasing power of \nthe Federal Government to negotiate with prescription drug plans to \nlower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. I believe this \nprohibition should be stricken and that there should be a role for the \nHHS Secretary in what Medicare and beneficiaries pay for their drugs.\n  I am committed to working with the HHS Secretary to find real \nsolutions for lowering drug costs for our Nation's seniors.\n  As the Medicare drug benefit is enacted, I am also hopeful that \nGovernor Leavitt will work to ensure access to all needed medications \nfor people living with HIV and AIDS, to allow for adequate transition \ntime for the most vulnerable low-income seniors and to provide \nsufficient incentives and transparency for employers to retain their \nretirees' health care coverage.\n  Governor Leavitt will oversee the Department of Health and Human \nServices at a time of rising deficits and this will require tough \ndecisions. But these decisions must be balanced with the needs of the \nmillions of Americans, young and old, who rely on Medicare, Medicaid \nand SCHIP to provide their health care insurance.\n  Medicaid provides insurance to 40 million Americans, about 8 million \nof whom live in California. It covers 55 percent of all poor children \nand it pays for the births of one-third of all American children. It \nserves 50 percent of all people with AIDS and as many as 90 percent of \nchildren with AIDS.\n  Medicaid is the insurer of last resort. If Medicaid did not exist, \nthese individuals and families would be uninsured.\n  But it is also the biggest budget items in many States. There is no \nquestion we can improve the efficiency and quality of Medicaid to \nensure our dollars are being well-spent but we also cannot lose site of \nthe fact that increases in spending per enrollee from 2000 until 2003 \nwere slower than increases in private insurance spending.\n  There are 45 million Americans without health insurance today. \nArbitrary limits on Federal Medicaid spending will only increase the \nnumber of uninsured, driving up overall health care costs and burdening \nour nation's already overcrowded emergency rooms.\n  There is a great deal of work to be done, and I look forward to a \nproductive working relationship with Governor Leavitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S644-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF DR. CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have followed closely both the \nconfirmation hearing of Dr. Rice before the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the floor debate on her nomination. After considerable reflection, \nI have decided to vote in favor of Dr. Rice's confirmation, although I \nmust state for the record that I do so with some reservations.\n  I intend to support her nomination primarily because I believe the \nforeign policy of the United States must reflect a spirit of \nbipartisanship. Amidst the complex challenges that we face in the war \non terrorism, this country cannot afford enduring divisions on \ninternational issues. We must return to common ground, not least so \nthat the rest of the world recognizes our single purpose and our \nresolve. I should note, parenthetically, that restoring that lost unity \ndepends equally upon the majority party, as upon my party.\n  Dr. Rice has the credentials to be Secretary of State. As National \nSecurity Adviser, she has proven an eloquent advocate for the \nadministration's policies. At her confirmation hearing, she made clear \nour need for effective diplomatic engagement worldwide. I welcomed that \nemphasis. Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Rice has the President's utmost \nconfidence--this will, I am certain, be an asset in her dealings with \nother nations, as well as in working with other agencies in our own \nGovernment.\n  My reservations about Dr. Rice stem not from doubts about her \nabilities, but rather from my concerns about her role in developing \nU.S. policy toward Iraq and in characterizing the threats posed by Iraq \nprior to the conflict. I have concluded that many of the \nadministration's statements on Iraqi weapons, including those of Dr. \nRice, were simply not underpinned by the intelligence available. That \nis troubling, as was Dr. Rice's failure, during the confirmation \nhearing, to acknowledge that mistakes were made, not only in the \nconduct of the war and its aftermath, but in the policies that led us \ninto it.\n  This goes directly to the question of accuracy and accountability--\nwhether this administration will take responsibility for its decisions \nand learn from the past, so as not to repeat the same errors in future. \nI believe that the decision to go to war in Iraq was wrong. \nNevertheless, despite great skepticism among the American people about \nIraq, President Bush was reelected. We must now go forward together to \nachieve stability in Iraq, to bring our forces home, and to restore \nAmerican credibility at home and abroad.\n  The dubious decisions, not the nominee, concern me; however, I will \nnot oppose Dr. Rice because I disagree with the administration's \npolicies. That would not be conducive to the bipartisan foreign policy \nthat I believe is crucial. Rather, I look forward to working with Dr. \nRice to forge consensus on a more balanced approach to national \nsecurity issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S644-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S644-S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TARIFF RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMIES ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support legislation recently \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nby myself, Senator Smith, Senator Baucus, and Senator Santorum to help \nsome of the world's poorest countries sustain vital export industries \nand promote economic growth and political stability.\n  The Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act, TRADE, of \n2005 will provide duty-free and quota-free benefits for garments and \nother products similar to those afforded to beneficiary countries under \nthe Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA. The countries covered by \nthis legislation are the 14 Least Developed Countries, LDCs, as defined \nby the United Nations and the U.S. State Department, which are not \ncovered by any current U.S. trade preference program: Afghanistan, \nBangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, Maldives, Nepal, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Yemen. Given the \nrecent tsunami disaster, the bill includes a special emergency trade \nprovision to assist Sri Lanka in its rebuilding efforts.\n  The beneficiary countries of this legislation are among the poorest \ncountries in the world. Nepal has per capita income of $240. \nUnemployment in Bangladesh stands at 40 percent. Approximately 36 \npercent of Cambodia's population lives below the poverty line. Each \ncountry faces critical challenges in the years ahead including poor \nhealth care, insufficient educational opportunities, high HIV/AIDS \nrates, and the effects of war and civil strife. The United States must \ntake a leadership role in providing much-needed assistance to the \npeople of these countries.\n  Consequently, Senator Smith and I have worked closely together over \nthe past few years to push for substantial increases in our foreign aid \nbudget. We recognize that helping developing countries rise from \npoverty is not only a moral obligation, but a key component in our \nfight against terror. Yet humanitarian and development assistance \nshould not be the sum total of our efforts to put these countries on \nthe road to economic prosperity and political stability. Indeed, the \nkey for sustained growth and rising standards of living will be the \nability of each of these countries to create vital export industries to \ncompete in a free and open global marketplace.\n  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. \nmarket to their exports. Success in that endeavor will ultimately allow \nthese countries to become less dependent on foreign aid and allow the \nUnited States to provide assistance to countries in greater need.\n  The garment industry is a key part of the manufacturing sector in \nsome of these countries. In Nepal, the garment industry is entirely \nexport-oriented and accounts for 40 percent of the foreign exchange \nearnings. It employs over 100,000 workers--half of them women--and \nsustains the livelihood of over 350,000 people. The United States is \nthe largest market for Nepalese garments and accounts for 80 to 90 \npercent of Nepal's total exports every year. In Cambodia, approximately \n250,000 Cambodians work in the garment industry supporting \napproximately 1 million dependents. The garment industry accounts for \nmore than 90 percent of Cambodia's export earnings. In Bangladesh, the \ngarment industry accounts for 75 percent of export earnings. The \nindustry employs 1.8 million people, 90 percent of whom are women, and \nsustains the livelihoods of 10 to 15 million people.\n  Despite the poverty seen in these countries and the importance of the \ngarment industry and the U.S. market, they face some of the highest \nU.S. tariffs in the world, averaging over 15 percent. In contrast, \ncountries like Japan and our European partners face tariffs that are \nnearly zero. On top of this, there is increasing concern that the \nremoval of quotas on textile and apparel articles on January 1, 2005, \nwill severely harm their garment export industries in LDC countries as \nU.S. importers will shift their orders to China, India and other \nsuppliers with cheaper labor markets.\n  Millions of jobs could be lost, threatening economic growth and \npolitical stability. In those countries without a viable garment \nindustry--such as Afghanistan and East Timor--the removal of quotas \nwill severely impact the opportunities to develop industries, \nemployment, and expanded foreign investment.\n  Surely we can do better. This legislation will help these countries \ncompete in the U.S. market and let their citizens know that Americans \nare committed to helping them realize a better future for themselves \nand their families. And the impact on U.S. jobs will be minimal. \nCurrently, the beneficiary countries under this legislation account for \nonly 4 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports, compared to 24 \npercent for China, and 72 percent for the rest of the world. These \ncountries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, but the \nbenefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their export \neconomies.\n  At a time when U.S. standing is at an alltime low in some countries, \nwe need legislation such as this to show the best of America and \nAmerican values. It will provide a vital component to our development \nstrategy and add another tool to the war on terror. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S645-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOANNE BENSON\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in \nhonoring the public life of a Minnesota leader in public affairs and \npublic education, Joanne Benson. Some of us will recognize her as a \nformer lieutenant Governor of Minnesota, or as a Minnesota State \nSenator. But she is known to hundreds of teachers and children as an \neducator of distinction, imagination, and courage. This month marks her \nretirement as the Chief Education Officer of the Minnesota Business \nAcademy charter high school in our capital city of St. Paul.\n  Joanne Benson is considered by friends and colleagues to be one of \nthe most conscientious and hardworking women in Minnesota--a \nconsiderable distinction. She was born in Le Sueur, an agricultural \ncommunity, where she learned early the virtue of service to family and \ncommunity. She and her husband, Robert, are the parents of two \naccomplished adult children, for whom education is both a cherished \nvalue and a professional calling. Her grandchildren are blessed to have \nthe benefit of her loving example and guidance.\n  Minnesota's historic leadership in education proudly points to \nJoanne's degree from St. Cloud State University, and her eventual \nassistant professorship in the University's College of Education. From \nthis service, she went on to become a Minnesota State senator from the \nSt. Cloud region that she calls her home. Her work on behalf of \neducation policy and community safety brought her to the attention of \nGov. Arne Carlson, whom she served with distinction as lieutenant \nGovernor from 1995 to 1999.\n  The State of Minnesota was to have yet greater service from Joanne, \nwhen at the end of the Carlson administration she became the president \nof the nascent Minnesota Business Academy, a business immersion charter \nhigh school in downtown St. Paul. MBA serves some of our State's most \ntalented and challenged students. The school is the first in the Nation \nto be sponsored by a local Chamber of Commerce and is nationally noted \nfor its Star Tracks initiative, teaching and certifying students in the \npersonal traits and behaviors essential to success in the business \nworkplace.\n  With the people of Minnesota, I ask this Chamber to join in \ncelebrating the life and service of Joanne Benson, a woman of great \nhumor and patience, intelligence and grace, as she takes a well-earned \nretirement from the profession of education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S645-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S645-S646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          CHARLES W.

As regional administrator, he has been responsible for \nthe Federal administration of the Medicare and Medicaid programs to \napproximately 4 million beneficiaries residing in Iowa, Kansas, \nMissouri and Nebraska. Prior to joining CMS, then the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, in 1978 he worked in Social and \nRehabilitative Services and the Bureau of Health Insurance.\n  During Mr. Tilghman's tenure as regional administrator, he led many \nCMS efforts that impacted the lives of Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries nationwide.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Dahl \nArts Center in Rapid City, SD for all that it does to expand access to \nthe arts and theatre to the entire Rapid City region. This corner stone \nof the Rapid City community has cultivated contemporary visual arts, \ncommunity theater, and arts education since 1974, when Mr. and Mrs. Art \nDahl bequeathed a generous gift to the Rapid City Arts Council. Not \nonly has the Dahl Arts Center provided a forum for South Dakota artists \nto display their works and talents, but the center's free art galleries \nand art education classrooms provide the Rapid City community and its \nvisitors the opportunity access our shared artistic heritage.\n  The Dahl Arts Center is one of a dozen free attractions on Rapid \nCity's Star Tour. The Center also houses a 200 foot oil-on-canvas mural \npainted by Bernard P. Thomas. This cycloramic mural depicts 200 years \nof American history and is enhanced by a taped narration and special \nlighting effects. A large special viewing room was built to house this \nepic creation and has become a great attraction for visitors of all \nages. The Dahl also houses two galleries that feature paintings, \ncrafts, sculptures and original prints selected from the works of \nregional artists. For the past 30 years, the Dahl has been a wonderful \nvenue to enjoy a variety of art works from people of all ages and \ntalents.\n  I am very pleased that Rapid City has partnered with the Dahl Arts \nCenter to expand this facility, double the seating capacity in its \nperformance theater, expand space for education, rehearsals and \nmeetings, create a children's education gallery and library, and \nprovide climate-controlled space for the Dahl's permanent collection. \nRapid City's generous financial commitments combined with the $2 \nmillion in private donations and pledges that have been collected thus \nfar provide the bulk of the funding required for the Dahl Arts Center's \nexpansion. I was pleased to work with my colleagues in the Senate to \nsecure Federal funding of $250,000 to assist in the expansion effort of \nthe Dahl Arts Center. When completed, this addition will ensure that \nthe Dahl Arts Center will continue to serve as a cultural arts center \nfor generations to come.

The Kresge Foundation cited \nthe quality of the school's faculty, growing popularity, excellent \nfacilities, fiscal responsibility, and effective leadership as \ndeterminants in the selection process.\n  A challenge grant is rewarded on the condition that the recipient \nwill raise a certain amount of its own funds before receiving grant \nmoney. The Kresge Foundation requests that the University raise nearly \n$7 million before October 1, 2005 to be awarded the grant. I have no \ndoubt that Campbellsville University will meet the challenge in the way \nthat it has met all others: on time, on target, and with the money.\n  In considering the effort Campbellsville University puts into \neducating the future of America, I heartily agree with the Kresge \nFoundation that they deserve this grant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S647-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S647-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S647-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROBERTS, from the Select Committee on Intelligence, \n     without amendment:\n       S.

A bill to reduce temporarily the royalty required to be paid \nfor sodium produced on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Soda Ash \nRoyalty Reduction Act of 2005,'' a bill to limit the Federal royalty on \nsoda ash. This legislation, if passed, will put people back to work in \nmy State and address the important issue of maintaining a strong and \nfinancially sound manufacturing base in this country. It will keep jobs \nin America and give workers a fighting chance to compete globally.\n  The State of Wyoming accounts for 85 percent of the natural soda ash \nproduced in the United States. The health of the domestic soda ash \nindustry is now at issue. This legislation goes a long way towards \nassisting the domestic industry to be competitive on a global basis.\n  The bill reduces an excessive tax on natural American soda ash; a tax \nthat is significantly impairing the ability of U.S. exported soda ash \nto compete in important global markets; a tax that has helped create 30 \npercent decline in employment in this industry in Wyoming since 1997. \nThe current 6 percent royalty on each ton of domestically produced soda \nash was imposed in 1995 at a time when our exports of this important \ncommodity, primarily used in the manufacture of glass were rising to \nrecord levels. It was a windfall tax that recognized the industry's \nsignificant expansion.\n  Over the last decade, export growth has been severely impacted, as \nseveral trading partners erected various barriers to U.S. soda ash, \noften to protect their own less efficient domestic producers. One of \nthe most aggressive countries has been China. As recently as 1990, \nChina imported over one million tons of soda ash annually from the U.S. \nToday, China exports two million tons from plants that produce a \nsynthetic grade of this important commodity.\n  The Chinese produce soda ash in far less efficient factories with \nlimited attention to environmental or safety concerns. The average wage \nof a Chinese worker in these plants is less than $5 a day. By contrast \nWyoming soda ash workers can earn on average $35 an hour. Chinese soda \nash producers, which are largely state owned, also benefit from direct \nand indirect forms of state support, as well as the benefits of a fixed \nexchange rate. As a result of these actions, China has supplanted the \nUnited States as the world's largest exporter of soda ash.\n  Wyoming soda ash producers remain the most efficient in the world and \nhave been constantly improving their productivity over the last several \nyears. It is an industry that is reinventing itself to meet the demands \nof fierce global competition.\n  My legislation restores the original royalty the Federal Government \nimposed on soda ash in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. That act set a \n2 percent royalty on soda ash mined on Federal leases. We would \ntemporarily resume that royalty rate consistent with the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act of 1976 that requires the Secretary of the \nInterior to receive ``fair market value'' for the use of public lands \nand their resources. In other words, the legislation simply adjusts \nwhat was a windfall tax back to its original level.\n  The legislation is overdue and keeps our Nation's commitment to U.S. \nbased manufacturing and jobs. The U.S. soda ash industry has been a \ngood partner with the Federal Government, providing additional revenue \nwhen business was flourishing. Now that the industry is fighting for \nits survival, the Federal Government has the opportunity to be a \nresponsible partner and ease its tax burden so it can survive and \nprovide the thousands of jobs that are so important to my State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 204. A bill to establish the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area in \nthe State of Louisiana; to the Committeee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senator Vitter, \nto introduce a bill to establish the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area \nin Louisiana. This legislation has particularly special meaning to \nthose of us from Louisiana because of the importance of the cultural \nand natural resources of the Atchafalaya region to the Nation. It would \nestablish a framework to help protect, conserve, and promote these \nunique natural, cultural, historical, and recreational resources of the \nregion.\n  This legislation, which has been passed by the full Senate 3 times, \nonce during the 107th Congress and twice during the 108th Congress, \nwould establish a framework to help protect, conserve, and promote \nthese unique natural, cultural, historical, and recreational resources \nof the region.\n  Specifically, the legislation would establish a National Heritage \nArea in Louisiana that encompasses thirteen parishes in and around the \nAtchafalaya Basin swamp, America's largest river swamp. The heritage \narea in south-central Louisiana stretches from Concordia parish to the \nnorth, where the Mississippi River begins to partially flow into the \nAtchafalaya River, all the way to the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The \nthirteen parishes are: St. Mary, Iberia, St. Martin, St. Landry, \nAvoyelles, Pointe Coupee, Iberville, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafayette, \nWest Baton Rouge, Concordia, and East Baton Rouge. This boundary is the \nsame area covered by the existing Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage \nArea.\n  This measure will appoint the existing Atchafalaya Trace Commission \nas the federally recognized ``local coordinating entity.'' The \ncommission is composed of thirteen members with one representative \nappointed by each parish in the heritage area. Both the Atchafalaya \nTrace Commission and the Atchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area were \ncreated by the Louisiana Legislature a number of years ago. The \nAtchafalaya Trace State Heritage Area program currently receives some \nState funding, and already has staff working at the Louisiana \nDepartment of Culture, Recreation & Tourism, DCRT, under Lieutenant \nGovernor Kathleen Blanco. State funds were used to create\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nthe management plan for the heritage area, which followed ``feasibility \nanalysis'' guidelines as recommended by the National Park Service. \nTherefore, the recently-completed management plan need only be \nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval as this \nlegislation would recognize an existing local coordinating entity that \nwill oversee the implementation of this plan. We are very proud that \nthis state heritage area has already completed the complicated planning \nprocess, with participation of local National Park Service \nrepresentatives, while using a standard of planning quality equal to \nthat of existing national heritage areas. All at no cost to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Please let me also emphasize that this legislation protects existing \nprivate property rights. It will not interfere with local land use \nordinances or regulations, as it is specifically prohibited from doing \nso. Nor does this legislation grant any powers of real property \nacquisition to the local coordinating entity or heritage area program. \nIn addition, the legislation does not impose any environmental rule or \nprocess or cause any change in Federal environmental quality standards \ndifferent from those already in effect.\n  Heritage areas are based on cooperation and collaboration at all \nlevels. This legislation remains true to the core concept behind \nheritage areas. The heritage area concept has been used successfully in \nvarious parts of our Nation to promote historic preservation, natural \nand cultural resource protection, heritage tourism and sustainable \neconomic revitalization for both urban and rural areas. Heritage areas \nprovide a flexible framework for government agencies, private \norganizations and businesses and landowners to work together on a \ncoordinated regional basis. The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area will \njoin the Cane River National Heritage Area to become the second \nNational Heritage Area in Louisiana, ultimately joining the 23 existing \nNational Heritage Areas around the Nation.\n  The initiative to develop the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is \nan outgrowth of a grassroots effort to achieve multiple goals of this \nregion. Most important among these is providing opportunities for the \nfuture, while at the same time not losing anything that makes this \nplace so special. Residents from all over the region, local tourism \nagencies, State agencies such as the DCRT and the Department of Natural \nResources, the State legislature, Federal agencies including the \nNational Park Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, parish \ngovernments, conservation and preservation groups, local businesses and \nlocal landowners have all participated in this endeavor to make it the \nstrong initiative it is today. These groups have been very supportive \nof the heritage area effort, and as time moves on, the heritage area \nwill continue to involve more and more of the area's most important \nresource, its people.\n  I would also like to give you a brief overview of the resources that \nmake this place significant to the entire country. Not only is it \nimportant to our Nation's history, but it is also critical to \nunderstanding America's future. The name of the place itself, \nAtchafalaya, comes from the American Indians and means ``long river.'' \nThis name signifies the first settlers of the region, descendants of \nwhom still live there today.\n  Other words come to mind in describing the Atchafalaya: mysterious, \ndynamic, multi-cultural, enchanting, bountiful, threatened and \nundiscovered. This region is one of the most complex and least \nunderstood places in Louisiana and the Nation. Yet, the stories of the \nAtchafalaya Heritage Area are emblematic of the broader American \nexperience. Here there are opportunities to understand and witness the \ncomplicated, sometimes harmonious, sometimes adversarial interplay \nbetween nature and culture. The history of the United States has been \nshaped by the complex dance of its people working with, against, and \nfor, nature. Within the Atchafalaya a penchant for adventure, \nadaptation, ingenuity, and exploitation has created a cultural legacy \nunlike anywhere else in the world.\n  The heart of the heritage area is the Atchafalaya Basin. It is the \nlargest river swamp in the United States, larger than the more widely \nknown Everglades or Okefenokee Swamp. The Atchafalaya is characterized \nby a maze of streams, and at one time was thickly forested with old-\ngrowth cypress and tupelo trees. The Basin provides outstanding habitat \nfor a remarkably diverse array of wildlife, including the endangered \nAmerican bald eagle and Louisiana black bear. The region's unique \necology teems with life. More than 85 species of fish; crustaceans, \nsuch as crawfish; wildlife, including alligators; an astonishing array \nof well over 200 species of birds, from waterfowl to songbirds; forest-\ndwelling mammals such as deer, squirrel, beaver and other commercially \nimportant furbearers all make their home here. Bottomland hardwood-\ndependent bird species breed here in some of the highest densities ever \nrecorded in annual North American Breeding Bird Surveys. The Basin also \nforms part of the Mississippi Valley Flyway for migratory waterfowl and \nis a major wintering ground for thousands of these geese and ducks. In \ngeneral, the Atchafalaya Basin has a significant proportion of North \nAmerica's breeding wading birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and \nspoonbills. Some of the largest flocks of Wood Storks in North America \nsummer here, and the southern part of the Basin has a healthy \npopulation of Bald Eagles nesting every winter.\n  The region's dynamic system of waterways, geology, and massive \nearthen guide levees reveals a landscape that is at once fragile and \nawesome. The geology and natural systems of the Atchafalaya Heritage \nArea have fueled the economy of the region for centuries. For decades \nthe harvest of cypress, cotton, sugar cane, crawfish, salt, oil, gas, \nand Spanish moss, have been important sources of income for the \nregion's residents. The crawfish industry has been particularly \nimportant to the lives of Atchafalaya residents and Louisiana has \nbecome the largest crawfish producer in the United States. Sport \nfishing and other forms of commercial fishing are important here, too, \nbut unfortunately, natural resource extraction and a changing \nenvironment have drastically depleted many of these resources and \nforced residents to find new ways to make a living.\n  Over the past century, the Atchafalaya Basin has become a study of \nman's monumental effort to control nature. After the catastrophic \nMississippi River flood of 1927 left thousands dead and millions \ndisplaced, the U.S. Congress decreed that the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers should develop an intricate system of levees to protect human \nsettlements, particularly New Orleans. Today, the Mississippi River is \ncaged within the walls of earthen and concrete levees and manipulated \nwith a complex system of locks, barrages and floodgates. The \nAtchafalaya River runs parallel to the Mississippi and through the \ncenter of the Basin. In times of flooding the river basin serves as the \nkey floodway in controlling floodwaters headed for the large population \ncenters of Baton Rouge and New Orleans by diverting water from the \nMississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. This system was sorely tested \nin 1973 when floodwaters threatened to break through the floodgates and \npermanently divert the Mississippi River into the Atchafalaya. However, \nafter this massive flood event, new land started forming off the coast. \nThese new land formations make up the Atchafalaya Delta, and is the \nonly significant area of new land being built in the United States. \nThese vast amounts of Mississippi River sediment are also rapidly \nfilling in the Basin itself, raising the level of land in certain areas \nof the basin and filling in lakes and waterways. And to demonstrate \njust how complex this ecosystem is, one only needs to realize that just \nto the East of the Delta, Terrebonne parish, also in the heritage area, \nis experiencing some of the most significant coastal land loss in the \ncountry.\n  Over the centuries, the ever-changing natural environment has shaped \nthe lives of the people living in the Basin. Residents have profited \nfrom and been imperiled by nature. The popular cultural identity of the \nregion is strongly associated with the Cajuns, descendants of the \nFrench-speaking Acadians who settled in south Louisiana after being \ndeported by the British from Nova Scotia, formerly known as Acadia. \nTwenty-five hundred to three\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nthousand exiled Acadians repatriated in Louisiana where they proceeded \nto re-establish their former society. Today, in spite of complex \nsocial, cultural, and demographic transformations, Cajuns maintain a \nsense of group identity and continue to display a distinctive set of \ncultural expressions nearly 250 years after their exile from Acadia. \nCajun culture has become increasingly popular outside of Louisiana. \nCulinary specialties adapted from France and Acadia such as etouffee, \nboudin, andouille, crepes, beignets and sauces thickened with roux, \ndelight food lovers well beyond Louisiana's borders. Cajun music has \nalso ``gone mainstream'' with its blend of French folk songs and \nballads and instrumental dance music, and more recently popular \ncountry, rhythm-and-blues, and rock music influences. While the growing \ninterest in Cajun culture has raised appreciation for its unique \ntraditions, many of the region's residents are concerned about the \ngrowing commercialization and stereotyping that threatens to diminish \nthe authentic Cajun ways of life.\n\n  While the Atchafalaya Heritage Area may be well known for its Cajun \nculture, there is an astonishing array of other cultures within these \nparishes. Outside of New Orleans, the Atchafalaya Heritage Area is the \nmost racially and ethnically complex region of Louisiana, and has been \nso for many years. A long legacy of multiculturalism presents \ninteresting opportunities to examine how so many distinct cultures have \nsurvived in relative harmony. There may be interesting lessons to learn \nfrom here as our Nation becomes increasingly heterogeneous. The \ncultural complexity of this region has created a rich tapestry of \nhistory and traditions, evidenced by the architecture, music, language, \nfood and festivals unlike any place else. Ethnic groups of the \nAtchafalaya include: African-Americans, Black Creoles, Asians, Chinese, \nFilipinos, Vietnamese, Lebanese, Cajuns, Spanish Islenos, Italians, \nScotch-Irish, and American Indian tribes such as the Attakapa, \nChitimacha, Coushatta, Houma, Opelousa and Tunica-Biloxi.\n  This heritage area has a wealth of existing cultural, historic, \nnatural, scenic, recreational and visitor resources on which to build. \nScenic resources include numerous State Wildlife Management Areas and \nNational Wildlife Refuges, as well as ten designated state scenic \nbyways that fall partially or entirely within the heritage area. The \nOffice of State Parks operates three historic sites in the heritage \narea, and numerous historic districts and buildings can be found in the \nregion. There are also nine Main Street communities in the heritage \narea. Outdoor recreational resources include two State Parks and a \nmultitude of waterways and bayous. Hunting, fishing, boating, and \ncanoeing, and more recently birdwatching and cycling, are popular ways \nto experience the region. Various visitor attractions, interpretive \ncenters and visitor information centers exist to help residents and \ntourists alike better understand and navigate many of the resources in \nthe heritage area. Major roads link the heritage area's central visitor \nentrance points and large population centers, especially New Orleans. \nMuch of the hospitality industry servicing the Atchafalaya exists \naround the larger cities of Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Houma. However, \nmore and more bed and breakfasts and heritage accommodations, such as \nhouseboat rentals, are becoming more numerous in the smaller towns and \nrural areas.\n  These are just some of the examples of the richness and significance \nof this region. This legislation will assist communities throughout \nthis heritage area who are committed to the conservation and \nappropriate development of these assets. Furthermore, this legislation \nwill bring a level of prestige and national and international \nrecognition that this most special of places certainly deserves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto establish in the State of Louisiana a memorial to honor the Buffalo \nSoldiers; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, One Hundred and Thirty Nine years ago, \nbefore the term Homeland Security was even coined, a group of men \ndevoted themselves to securing the frontiers of this Nation. They \nprotected Americans in their homes; they deterred hostile invaders, and \nthey secured the blessings of liberty for a young country. Even more \nremarkable, they secured these blessings for others, while they could \nnot fully enjoy them themselves.\n  I am referring to the Buffalo Soldiers. These brave men instituted a \ntradition of professional military service for African Americans that \nspans the greater part of American history. African American military \nservice is as old as our nation. There were black soldiers during the \nrevolution, a unit of free black men played a pivotal role in the \nBattle of New Orleans, and the exploits of African Americans during the \nCivil War have been captured in novels and on film. However, it was not \nuntil the Army Reorganization Act of 1866 that soldiering and service \nto country became a realistic option for African Americans seeking to \nimprove their quality of life. In so doing, they raised the bar of \nfreedom, and revealed the injustice of preventing the defenders of \ndemocracy from fully participating in it.\n  The City of New Orleans, and the State of Louisiana have a rich \nhistory. They have given more than their fair share of sons to the \nservice of our Nation. Much of this history is commemorated throughout \nthe State. Yet, these great sons of New Orleans remain unacknowledged \nin their home. For in Louisiana's great military tradition, surely one \nof its greatest military contributions were the 9th Cavalry Regiment \nand the 25th Infantry Regiment.\n  These two forces, recruited and organized in New Orleans, represent \nhalf of all the units of buffalo soldiers. The 9th Cavalry alone \nconstituted 10% of all the American cavalry. Their list of adversaries \nreads like a who's who of the Old West--Geronimo, Sitting Bull, Poncho \nVilla. In movies, when settlers encounter Apaches, the cavalry always \ncomes to the rescue. Yet how many times were the cavalry that rode over \nthe horizon African American? Of course, the reality is that the \nBuffalo Soldiers comprised some of our nations most capable and loyal \ntroops. Despite suffering the worst deprivations known to any American \nsoldiers of the period, they had the lowest desertion rates in the \nArmy. The 9th Cavalry was awarded 10 Congressional Medals of Honor, \nincluding a native Louisianan, Sgt. Emanuel Stance--a farmer from \nCarroll Parish.\n  For these reasons, I am offering legislation today along with Senator \nVitter that would authorize the creation of a suitable memorial in New \nOrleans for these gallant soldiers. There is an excellent statue to the \nBuffalo Soldiers at Fort Leavenworth, KS. It commemorates the 10th \nCavalry Regiment stationed there. However, I believe that these men \ndeserve to be recognized in their home city. Furthermore, it should be \nin an a location where thousands of visitors will have the opportunity \nto come to appreciate the legacy of the Buffalo Soldiers. I believe \nthat the City of New Orleans is the perfect location.\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\n  We have made a number of changes to this legislation after \nconsultations with the American Battle Monuments Commission. I believe \nthese changes should address any concerns that they have expressed. \nFurthermore, we have an able and dedicated organization of individuals \nin the state who desperately want to see this project to completion. \nLast year, I had the pleasure of being in New Orleans with another of \nthis Nation's great military heroes, Senator Daniel Inouye. We \naddressed a group of distinguished veterans from all around the state. \nAmong them was George Jones, President of the Greater New Orleans \nChapter of the Buffalo Soldiers Association. They have been working \nwith Eddie Dixon, the artist for the beautiful Fort Leavenworth \nstatute, to develop an appropriate memorial in the City of New Orleans \nfor over a decade. This bill will fulfill that noble ambition.\n  This Nation has sadly found the need to say thank you to its \nservicemen and women after the fact on more than one occasion. \nUnfortunately, this is another. We are fortunate to have living \nmemories of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments today. The regiments \nwere not disbanded until the conclusion of World War Two, where they \nserved with distinction. We should take this opportunity to honor these \nveterans, and in so doing, honor the principles of liberty, freedom and \ndemocracy for which they fought and sacrificed. They have given so much \nto their nation, we owe them this public expression of gratitude.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers \n     Commemoration Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF BUFFALO SOLDIERS MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The American Battle Monuments \n     Commission is authorized to establish a memorial to honor the \n     Buffalo Soldiers in or around the City of New Orleans on land \n     donated for such purpose or on Federal land with the consent \n     of the appropriate land manager.\n       (b) Contributions.--The Commission shall solicit and accept \n     contributions for the construction and maintenance of the \n     memorial.\n       (c) Cooperative Agreements.--The Commission may enter into \n     a cooperative agreement with a private or public entity for \n     the purpose of fundraising for the construction and \n     maintenance of the memorial.\n       (d) Maintenance Agreement.--Prior to beginning construction \n     of the memorial, the Commission shall enter into an agreement \n     with an appropriate public or private entity to provide for \n     the permanent maintenance of the memorial and shall have \n     sufficient funds, or assurance that it will receive \n     sufficient funds, to complete the memorial.\n\n     SEC. 3. BUFFALO SOLDIERS MEMORIAL ACCOUNT.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The Commission shall maintain an escrow \n     account (``account'') to pay expenses incurred in \n     constructing the memorial.\n       (b) Deposits Into the Account.--The Commission shall \n     deposit into the account any principal and interest by the \n     United States that the Chairman determines has a suitable \n     maturity.\n       (c) Use of Account.--Amounts in the account, including \n     proceeds of any investments, may be used to pay expenses \n     incurred in establishing the memorial. After construction of \n     the memorial amounts in the account shall be transferred by \n     the Commission to the entity providing for permanent \n     maintenance of the memorial under such terms and conditions \n     as the Commission determines will ensure the proper use and \n     accounting of the amounts.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 206. A bill to designate the Ice Age Floods National Geologic \nTrail, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Ice Age \nFloods National Geologic Trail Designation Act of 2005''. I am thankful \nthat Senator Larry Craig of Idaho will again be the lead Republican \ncosponsor and pleased to also be joined by the Senior Senator from \nWashington, (Mrs. Murray), as well as Senator from Oregon, (Mr. Smith).\n  Some 12,000 to 17,000 years ago, at the end of the Ice Age, a series \nof floods swept across the Pacific Northwest. These epic floods \nfundamentally changed the geography and way of life in the Pacific \nNorthwest. The coulees, buttes, boulder fields, lakes, ridges and \ngravel bars they left behind still define the unique landscape of our \nState and our region today.\n  Creating a National Park Service trail to recognize and celebrate how \nthese floods literally shaped the face of our State will provide an \nunparalleled educational resource for Washingtonians and visitors from \nacross the country. It will also spur economic development and create \njobs in local communities across Eastern and Central Washington.\n  I look forward to working with my other members of the Pacific \nNorthwest congressional delegation, as well as my colleagues in the \nSenate, to ensure swift passage of this important legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ice Age Floods National \n     Geologic Trail Designation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to adjust the boundary of the Barataria Preserve Unit \nof the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve in the State \nof Louisiana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senator Vitter, \nto introduce the Jean Lafitte National Historic Park and Preserve \nBoundary Adjustment Act of 2005. This bill was passed unanimously by \nthe Senate during the 108th Congress.\n  The Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve was \nestablished in 1978 to preserve for present and future generations \nsignificant examples of the rich natural and cultural resources of \nLouisiana's Mississippi delta region. The park seeks to illustrate the \ninfluence of environment and history on the development of a unique \nregional culture. It is named for Jean Lafitte who was a pirate, or \nprivateer as he like to be called, that fought alongside U.S. forces in \nthe Battle of New Orleans at the end of the War of 1812. The park \nconsists of six physically separate sites and a park headquarters \nlocated in New Orleans. The sites in Lafayette, Thibodaux and Eunice \ninterpret the Acadian culture of the area. The Barataria Preserve, in \nMarrero, interprets the natural and cultural history of the uplands, \nswamps and marshlands of the region. Six miles southeast of New Orleans \nis the Chalmette Battlefield and National Cemetery, site of the 1815 \nBattle of New Orleans and the final resting place for soldiers from the \nCivil War, Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II and Vietnam. The \npark's visitor center, which is located in the historic French Quarter, \ninterprets the history of New Orleans and diverse cultures of \nMississippi delta region.\n  It is the Barataria site that is the focus of our attention today. \nThe Bill before us would merely adjust the boundary of the Barataria \npreserve unit of Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve and \nby doing so protect a crucial component of one of the largest and most \nproductive expanses of coastal wetlands in North America--coastal \nLouisiana or as they are known: America's Wetlands. The Barataria \npreserve is the only part of our coastal wetlands preserved in the \nNational Park System. As we strive to find ways to stem the tide of \ncoastal erosion in Louisiana, and bring about the restoration of \nwetlands already lost, it is equally important that we protect those \nareas that remain such as the Barataria preserve so that Americans can \nexperience, first hand, the amazing beauty and fertility of Louisiana's \nbountiful coastal wetlands--the most threatened wetland ecosystem in \nthe country--disappearing at a rate of 25 to 35 square miles a year. \nLocated on the outskirts of New Orleans, where it is accessible not \nonly to the people of New Orleans but also to the millions of tourists \nfrom around the world that visit New Orleans and south Louisiana, \nBarataria serves as an interpretive experience of this greatest of \ncoastal wetlands.\n  This bill expands this national treasure without any cost to the \nFederal Government while preserving private property rights. It simply \ntransfers to the Park over 3,000 acres of wetlands already in Federal \nownership, already paid for by the American people. These lands, which \nare adjacent to the Preserve, became Federal as a result of the \nsettlement by the Justice Department of two lawsuits brought by the \nlandowners against Federal agencies. However, because these acres are \nnot managed by the park, they are presently unavailable for public use. \nAn Act of Congress is necessary to allow inclusion of these lands into \na new boundary.\n  My bill does just that, opening these lands for canoeing, wildlife \nviewing, exploration, fishing, and hunting, all under the management \nand protection of the park service. The bill grants long-term \nprotection to crucial resources that the Park Service has found \nsuitable and feasible for inclusion within a new boundary through a \n1996 boundary study.\n  The Park is immediately adjacent to the developed areas of the \nWestbank of Jefferson Parish along much of its boundary while the \nBarataria unit in particular is right next door to a hurricane levee. \nMaking more of the park boundary contiguous with the levee\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\nthat divides developed land from undeveloped wetlands enhances \nopportunities for direct cooperation between these communities and the \nPark for management of shared concerns. These concerns include the \nrouting of storm-water run-off; the discharge of treated sewage; \nestuarine water quality and its effects on fisheries and recreational \nuses; wetland restoration and mitigation; and a number of other \nproblems and opportunities. The Park has worked with Jefferson Parish \nin seeking creative solutions to these problems and will continue to do \nso. The addition of these properties will only enhance their chances \nfor success.\n  It is for all of these reasons that I am hopeful the Senate can \napprove of this measure in the near future. The expansion we seek in \nthis Bill benefits us today as well as tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \ndirect the Great Lakes National Program Office of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to develop, implement, monitor, and report on a \nseries of indicators of water quality and related environmental factors \nin the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my colleagues Senators DeWine and Voinovich \nof Ohio, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, and I are pleased to introduce \nthe Great Lakes Water Quality Indicators and Monitoring Act. The bill \ndirects the Environmental Protection Agency to develop indicators of \nGreat Lakes water quality and related environmental factors and a \ncomprehensive network to monitor those indicators. This bill will \nresult in science-based assessments of the health of the Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes are a treasured natural resource. The Great Lakes \ncontain almost 20% of the world's fresh water, and millions of people \nin the Great Lakes basin rely on the lakes for drinking water, for \neconomic livelihoods such as fishing and shipping, and for recreational \nopportunities, including swimming and boating. Unfortunately, the Great \nLakes have suffered from decades of toxic discharges, urban and \nagricultural runoff, and other environmental challenges. We've made \nsome progress in improving water quality, but we know we have a long \nway to go.\n  The stewards of the lakes--at the Federal, State, and local levels--\nuse a variety of methods to determine the health of the Great Lakes and \nwhether they are improving. For example, the EPA and the Fish and \nWildlife Service monitor the accumulation of chemicals in Great Lakes \nfish. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration detects \nchanges in the ecosystem from space-based satellites and waterborne \nbuoys. The U.S. Geological Survey samples stream flow and quality, and \nthe States inspect for compliance with water quality standards. These \nefforts to collect scientific data are largely voluntary and suffer \nfrom a lack of funding and coordination. Additionally, they use \ninconsistent methods that often produce incompatible results.\n  In 2004, the General Accounting Office released a report entitled \nGreat Lakes: An Overall Strategy and Indicators for Measuring Progress \nare Needed to Better Achieve Restoration Goals. The GAO looked at \nalmost 200 Federal and State programs and found that a lack of \ncoordination, poorly defined goals, and insufficient data make it \ndifficult to evaluate the success of these programs. The GAO found that \nthere are no data collected regularly throughout the Great Lakes, and \nthat the existing data are inadequate to determine whether water \nquality and other environmental conditions are improving.\n  In 1990, I authored the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act, which \nstrengthened the water quality standards in the Great Lakes region. In \n2002, Congress passed the Great Lakes Legacy Act, to speed the cleanup \nof contaminated bottom sediment. Today, we need to establish a way to \nevaluate the impact of these and similar measures. To show results, we \nneed science-based indicators of water quality and related \nenvironmental factors, and we need to monitor those indicators \nregularly throughout the ecosystem.\n  GAO recommends that EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office lead an\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\neffort to develop indicators and a monitoring network. Our bill gives \nthat office the mandate to work with other Federal agencies and Canada \nto identify and measure water quality and other environmental factors \non a regular basis. The initial set of data collected through this \nnetwork will serve as a benchmark against which to measure future \nimprovements. Those measurements will help us make decisions on how to \nsteer future restoration efforts. With a clear picture of how the Great \nLakes are changing, we can change course when needed and spend public \nfunds on the most effective measures to meet the most pressing demands.\n  This bill serves a second purpose--it provides EPA with dedicated \nfunding to make sure that data collection can begin in a timely manner \nand be carried out consistently and comprehensively.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and help speed its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 209. A bill to build operational readiness in civilian agencies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am re-introducing today a bill that was \non the legislative calendar of the 108th Congress when it adjourned in \nDecember. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act \nis intended to build operational readiness in the civilian agencies to \nimprove our nation's capacity to carry out post-conflict stabilization \nand reconstruction missions.\n  Until very recently, the concept of ``nation building'' was \nconsidered to be pejorative by many Members of Congress and government \nofficials. The foreign policy orthodoxy of both parties was skeptical \nof missions that entailed long-term peacekeeping or stabilization \ncommitments. If military force was necessary, most policymakers \nbelieved it should be used only for relatively brief periods followed \nby rapid withdrawal.\n  But experience has taught us that this approach rarely can be \naccommodated if we are serious about protecting our own security in an \nage of terrorism. We have seen how terrorists can exploit nations \nafflicted by lawlessness and desperate circumstances. They seek out \nsuch places to establish training camps, recruit new members, and tap \ninto a global black market in weapons technology. If we are to deny \nsanctuaries to terrorists, we must be involved in post-conflict \nstabilization.\n  With this in mind, the Foreign Relations Committee took up the issue \nof how best to organize and prepare for post-conflict missions. Well \nover a year ago, we held our first bipartisan roundtable that brought \ntogether some of the best minds from inside and outside of government \nto consider this issue. From this process, we developed the \nStabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004. I \nintroduced this legislation with Senators Biden and Hagel, and the \nCommittee passed it unanimously. The purpose of our bill is to \nestablish a more robust civilian capability to respond quickly and \neffectively to post-conflict situations or other complex emergencies. \nThe bill puts the State Department at the center of the civilian \nreconstruction and stabilization effort, while coordination between \nState and Defense would continue at the NSC level.\n\n  The Defense Science Board (DSB), which recently recommended a similar \nstrengthening of stabilization and reconstruction capacity in the \nDefense Department, endorsed our legislation. On January 26, I \nintroduced S. 192, new legislation that took the DSB recommendations \nand provided the executive branch the necessary authorities to carry \nthem out. It calls upon the Secretary of Defense to take immediate \naction to strengthen the role and capabilities of the Department of \nDefense for carrying out stabilization and reconstruction activities as \nwell as to support the development of core competencies in other \ndepartments and agencies, principally the Department of State. The bill \nhas been referred to the Senate Armed Service Committee for that \nCommittee's consideration.\n  While recognizing the critical challenges that our military has \nundertaken with skill and courage in both Afghanistan and Iraq, we must \nacknowledge that certain non-security missions will be better served in \nthe future by a more organized civilian response. Our post-conflict \nefforts frequently have had a higher than necessary military profile. \nThis is not the result of a Pentagon power grab or institutional \nfights. Rather, the military has led post-conflict operations primarily \nbecause it is the only agency capable of mobilizing sufficient \npersonnel and resources for these tasks. As a consequence, military \nresources have been stretched and deployments of military personnel \nhave been extended beyond expectations. If we can improve the \ncapabilities of the civilian agencies, they can take over many of the \nnon-security missions that have burdened the military.\n  In re-introducing the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian \nManagement Act'' in the 109th Congress, I am well aware of the impact \nit has already had on both the debate on this issue and developments to \ndate. In fact, some initiatives contained in the legislation have moved \nforward without its having been enacted. My Senate colleagues on the \nForeign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee agreed with the need to \nprovide an emergency conflict response fund for stabilization and \nreconstruction crises. And the Commerce, Justice, State appropriators \nin both the Senate and the House agreed with the need to establish a \nnew office at the State Department to take the lead in organizing our \ncivilian efforts. Indeed, an Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization \nhas now been organized and a highly capable coordinator named. At her \nconfirmation hearings, Dr. Rice demonstrated detailed knowledge of the \nOffice and its work. I am confidant that she has already embraced the \nDepartment's role as a core mission and will work to support the Office \nwith appropriate funding and the kind of Department-wide backing and \nsupport from management that it will need to do its job.\n  So why continue to pursue the legislation? It is still important to \nseek enactment because the legislation provides a permanent basis in \nlaw for the established office as well as new authorities that the \nDepartment will need to be successful.\n  The Bush Administration's action on this issue demonstrates its \nability to recalibrate policy and organization to address a changing \nworld. We know that the President will continue to provide leadership \nin organizing the U.S. government for this mission. As demonstrated by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote of 19-0, and by actions \ntaken by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nState and the Judiciary and the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations, there is significant support in the Congress for his work \nand for the foresight he is already demonstrating.\n\n  The new Office, headed by Carlos Pascual, is doing a government-wide \ninventory of the civilian assets that might be available for \nstabilization and reconstruction tasks. It is also pursuing an idea \nproposed in our bill of a Readiness Reserve to enable rapid \nmobilization of post-conflict stabilization personnel. It will work \nclosely with the Secretary to assist in the coordination of policy, the \npreparation and management of response, and in developing cooperative \narrangements with foreign countries, international and regional \norganizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector \norganizations.\n  I am hopeful that the Office also will develop the concept of a 250-\nperson active duty Response Readiness Corps that is contained in the \nlegislation. In Army terms, that is less than a small battalion of \nwell-trained people--a modest but vigorous force-multiplier that would \ngreatly improve our nation's stabilization capacity. This Corps would \nbe composed of State Department and USAID employees who have the \nexperience and technical skills to manage stabilization and \nreconstruction tasks in a hostile environment.\n  Secretary Rice has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of \nenhancing standing civilian capacity to respond to post conflict \nsituations. In answer to one of my questions during the confirmation \nprocess, she said: ``Creating a strong U.S. Government stabilization \nand reconstruction capacity is an Administration national security \npriority.''\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\n  She asserted that ``experience has shown that we must have the \ncapacity to manage 2 to 3 stabilization and reconstruction operations \nconcurrently. That means [we need] staff in Washington and in the field \nto manage and deliver quality programs.''\n  Dr. Rice is prepared to make the State Department an effective inter-\nagency leader as it should be--in post-conflict operations. I look \nforward to working closely with her on this effort. I consider this new \nmission to be one of the most important long-term defenses that the \nState Department can mount against future acts of terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Mr. Burr, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Inouye, and \n        Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 211.

It is the first step in an ambitious plan to provide 365 day, \n24 hour 2-1-1 service throughout all of New York, and ultimately, the \nentire country.\n  The Calling for 2-1-1 Act, which I am introducing today, will create \nat least one 2-1-1 call center just like the one in Rochester in every \nstate in the country, and will link every regional call center together \nto ensure Statewide coverage. Last Congress, 31 members of the Senate \nand 149 members of the House of Representatives co-sponsored the \nCalling for 2-1-1 Act. In the 109th, we are working to appeal to even \nmore.\n  The best part of the 2-1-1 system is that it is equally available to \neveryone. From the mother whose child is about to go off to war, to the \nveteran returning from service, 2-1-1 will help people access the \ninformation they need when they need it. It helps teens who are in \ncrisis and young mothers who have nowhere else to turn. Single mothers \ntrying to find a job in a tough economy, frail senior citizens who need \nhelp with transportation but have no family or friends to call, and \nsubstance-abusing teens who in a moment of lucidity decide to seek a \nway out can all find what they need by dialing 2-1-1.\n  This number also helps people who want to give back to their \ncommunities. 2-1-1 provides lots of information about volunteer \nopportunities and helps direct people who want to give donations. At \ntimes of disaster, like the recent tsunami, 2-1-1 will be there to help \nget everyone the information they need to make sure their donations are \ndirected effectively.\n  2-1-1 is not only good for New Yorkers; it is also good for our \nNation's bottom line. 2-1-1 saves money because it eliminates \nduplicative services. The service will replace the existing maze of \nindividual numbers for individual services: hotlines for shelter from \nabusive spouses, vaccinations for children, or information about where \nto obtain hospice services for ailing parents or loved ones. 2-1-1 will \nbe a ``one-stop shop'' for all of these services. According to a recent \nstudy by the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at \nthe University of Texas' Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, 2-\n1-1 call centers can save as much as $130 million in the first year of \noperation and as much as $1.1 billion over ten years.\n  I would add that 2-1-1 saves lives. Every time someone calls 9-1-1 \nwith a non-emergency call, the operators spend time with that caller \nthat they could be spending dealing with a true emergency. 2-1-1 will \nreplace 9-1-1 as the non-emergency point of reference because it is so \neasy to recall.\n  We learned on September 11th how important 2-1-1 can be. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the disaster, most people did not know where to \nturn for information about their loved ones. Fortunately for those who \nknew about it, 2-1-1 was already operating in Connecticut during \nSeptember 11th, and it was critical in helping identify the whereabouts \nof victims, connecting frightened children with their parents, \nproviding information on terrorist suspects, and linking ready \nvolunteers with coordinated efforts and victims with necessary mental \nand physical health services. 2-1-1 provided locations of vigils and \nsupport groups, and information on bioterrorism for those concerned \nabout future attacks.\n  As time went by, many people needed help getting back on their feet. \nMore than 100,000 people lost their jobs. Close to 2,000 families \napplied for housing assistance because they couldn't pay their rent or \nmortgage. 90,000 people developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or clinical depression within eight weeks of the attacks. \nAnother 34,000 people met the criteria for both diagnoses. And 2-1-1 \nwas there to help in Connecticut.\n  It wasn't available in far too many other areas, however. In fact, a \nBrookings Institution and Urban Institute study of the aftermath of \nSeptember 11th found that many dislocated workers struggled to obtain \navailable assistance. People ``found it difficult to connect with \nresources due to a social-services infrastructure that does not support \na simple and efficient method for people to learn about and access \nservices and for agencies to coordinate their activities.''\n  And that is what 2-1-1 is all about. It provides a single, efficient, \ncoordinated way for people who need help to connect with those who can \nprovide it.\n  The Federal Communications Commission laid the groundwork for a 2-1-1 \nnumber in 2000 when it directed that telephone number to be reserved \nfor information and referral to social and human-services agencies. The \n2-1-1 system opens the way to a user-friendly social-services network, \nby providing an easy-to-remember and universally available phone number \nthat links individuals and families in need to the appropriate non-\nprofit and government agencies.\n  In Rochester, New York and throughout the Finger Lakes, 2-1-1 will do \njust that. Whatever the need, 2-1-1 can help point you in the right \ndirection. That is why I am so pleased to be introducing this \nlegislation today, and why I am so optimistic that this will be an \nimportant first step in the road to bringing 2-1-1 to communities \nthroughout the Empire State and the entire U.S.A. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 212. A bill to amend the Valles Caldera Preservation Act to \nimprove the preservation of the Valles Caldera, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in 2000 Congress established the Valles \nCaldera National Preserve, which is composed of approximately 89,000 \nacres of spectacular land in northern New Mexico. The Preserve was \ncreated to protect and preserve the region's values and to provide the \npublic with opportunities for the multiple use and sustained yield of \nits resources.\n  Over the past 5 years, we have become aware of some simple changes in \nFederal policy that can be made to allow the Valles Caldera Trust and \nU.S. Forest Service to better address the issues facing the Valles \nCaldera Preserve. The bill that Senator Bingaman and I introduce today \nrecognizes the need for those policy changes.\n  The bill does the following: (1) Eliminates the ``willing seller \nbasis'' so the Secretary of Agriculture can purchase the outstanding \nmineral interests of the Valles Caldera; (2) requires the Valles \nCaldera Trust to better manage its obligations and expenditures; (3) \nexpands the category of people who can solicit and accept donations on \nthe Trust's behalf; (4) allows monies received from claims relating to \nthe Preserve to be used for costs incurred by the Trust; (5) provides a \nrate of compensation for the chairman of the Trust; (6) authorizes the \nTrust to dispose of marketable renewable resources; and (7) requires \nthe Secretary\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nof Agriculture to develop a fire safety plan for the Preserve.\n  These are not vast changes; nor should they be controversial. They \nwill, however, make an important difference to one of New Mexico's most \npristine wilderness areas that is appreciated by New Mexico's visitors \nand natives alike.\n  Because of the difference this legislation will make in New Mexico, I \nhope my colleagues will join with Senator Bingaman and me in approving \nthe Valles Caldera Preservation Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Federal land to Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Domenici to introduce legislation to allow a transfer of land \nto Rio Arriba County, NM from the Bureau of Land Management. The land \nis needed for County facilities, a cemetery for a local parish, and a \nnew public school.\n  Rio Arriba County is in a difficult position; the needs of the \nrapidly increasing area population continue to increase but there is \nprecious little land available to the County where they can locate \nnecessary facilities. Fortunately, the County has worked with the BLM \nto find a parcel of land that each agrees will best serve the interests \nof the public if it is transferred to County ownership. Indeed, I am \ntold that BLM would likely have handled this transfer administratively \nif they were not barred from doing so by the particular history of how \nthis parcel came into federal ownership. I am unaware of any opposition \nto the transfer.\n  This bill will simply change the legal framework for the parcel so \nthat the transfer can take place. I hope the Senate can act on this \nbill as quickly as possible so that Rio Arriba County can move forward \nto meet the pressing needs of the people there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \ncooperate with the States on the border with Mexico and other \nappropriate entities in conducting a hydrogeologic characterization, \nmapping, and modeling program for priority transboundary aquifers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Domenici \nand Senator Kyl, I am pleased today to introduce the United States-\nMexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act. This legislation is \nintended to address the significant challenges concerning water \nresources that exist along the U.S-Mexico border. Recognizing the \nimportance of these issues to the States making up that border, New \nMexico, Arizona, Texas, and California, the Senate passed this bill \ntwice during the 108th Congress. With strong bipartisan, and now \nbicameral support, I hope we can act quickly to pass it once again so \nthat it can be enacted into law at the earliest opportunity.\n  The genesis of this bill is a field hearing I conducted over three \nyears ago during my tenure as the Chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. The focus of that hearing was water resource \nissues developing along the U.S.-Mexico border. In particular, I was \nconcerned that issues regarding the availability of future water \nsupplies were growing, and could lead to conflict in the region. The \ntestimony at that hearing made clear that consensus is lacking on how \ncommunities in the border region will address their future water needs. \nMost significant, I was struck by the lack of agreement on the long-\nterm viability of future groundwater sources, many of which involve \naquifers underlying both the United States and Mexico. Given the rapid \npopulation growth along the border, and the corresponding increase in \ndemand for potable water, there is a strong need to gain a common and \ndetailed understanding of our shared groundwater resources. A science-\nbased understanding of the resource is the first step to avoid \nconflicts similar to the one arising in south Texas over Rio Grande \nwater deliveries under the 1944 U.S.-Mexico treaty.\n  The United States-Mexico Trans-boundary Assessment Act is intended to \naddress the lack of a binational consensus regarding water supplies \nalong the border. It will do this by establishing a scientific program, \ninvolving the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Resources Research \nInstitutes, and appropriate authorities and other entities on both \nsides of the border, to comprehensively assess priority transboundary \naquifers. Ultimately, the information and scientific tools developed \nunder the program will be extremely valuable to State and local water \nresource managers in the border region. Of particular note, the \nanalysis will include a search for new sources of water such as saline \naquifers. Continued development of desalination technologies may lead \nto significant use of this untapped resource in the near future.\n  I understand that establishing this scientific program and accurately \nassessing our shared water resources is just a step towards developing \nthe long-term plans and solutions that will help avoid future \ninternational disputes concerning scare water supplies. This small \nstep, however, is an important one, and one with broad policy support. \nIn its 6th Report on the U.S.-Mexico Border Environment, the Good \nNeighbor Environmental Board, an independent federal advisory committee \nmanaged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, recommended the \ninitiation of a ``border-wide groundwater assessment program to \nsystematically analyze priority trans-boundary aquifers.'' Also, the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, in a January 2003 \nreport of its U.S.-Mexico Binational Council, included as one of its \nrecommendations that Mexico and the United States ``improve data \ncollection, information gathering, and transparency as the first step \nto developing a long-term strategy for water management.''\n  Ultimately, an effective long-term strategy will have to be developed \nby the communities and other water users who reside along the border. \nWorking with each other and their State water resource agencies, I \nbelieve successful strategies can be developed so long as the \ninformation upon which those plans are based is the most accurate \npossible. In that respect, the USGS, along with its State-based \npartners, have a strong and important role to play. The resources and \ncriteria provided by this legislation will ensure that these \norganizations can fulfill that role which, in turn, will enhance the \nprospects of our border communities to be able to plan for their future \nin a manner ensuring their long-term viability and prosperity.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to make these remarks. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement \nAct to revise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator \nAkaka joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law \nin 1988, and has been reauthorized every 4 years since that time.\n  The Act provides authority for range of programs and services \ndesigned to improve the health care status of the Native people of \nHawaii.\n  With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act \nand the establishment of Native Hawaiian health care systems on most of \nthe islands that make up the State of Hawaii, we have witnessed \nsignificant improvements in the health status of Native Hawaiians, but \nas the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this \nbill make clear, we still have a long way to go.\n  For instance, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \nrates in the State of Hawaii--rates that are 21 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State female population. Nationally, Native \nHawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast \ncancer.\n  With respect to diabetes, in 2000, Native Hawaiians had the highest \nmortality rate associated with diabetes in the State--a rate which is \n138 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups.\n  When it comes to heart disease, the mortality rate of Native \nHawaiians associated with heart disease is 68 percent higher than the \nrate for the entire State, and the mortality rate for hypertension is \n84 percent higher than that for the entire State.\n  These statistics on the health status of Native Hawaiians are but a \nsmall part of the long list of data that makes clear that our objective \nof assuring that the Native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good \nhealth comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet \nbeen achieved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Health Care \n     Improvement Reauthorization Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE \n                   IMPROVEMENT ACT.\n\n       The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act (42 U.S.C. \n     11701 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

Mr. President, almost ten years ago, I stood before you \nto introduce a bill ``to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United \nStates determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims.''\n  That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Five years ago, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims \nreported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate \nand credible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the \nUnited States has taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to settle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor the sum of $1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the \nparties after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. \nIndependently, the court concluded that the settlement amount is ``not \na gratuity'' and that the ``settlement was predicated on a credible \nlegal claim.'' Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, \nCong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of \nHearing Officer).\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those \nfunds that the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will \nfinally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for \nfar too long been denied.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, llinois, and Wisconsin. From \n1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional land of \nthe Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of cession--many of \nthese cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of \nmilitary action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were repeatedly made \npromises that the remainder of their lands would be secure and, in \naddition, that the United States would pay certain annuities to the \nPottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal the policy of \nremoval--an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands--some five million acres in \nand around the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, \nthe Pottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their \ntribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers \nseeking more land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with \norders to extract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty \nCommissioners spent 2 weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--\nincluding threats of war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to \nagree to cede their territory. Finally, those Pottawatomis who were \npresent relented and on September 26, 1933, they ceded their remaining \ntribal estate through what would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. \nSeventy-seven members of the Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of \nChicago. Members of the ``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not \nassent to the cession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomis 5 million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nBut the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The \nTreaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to \nthe Iowa land. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to \naccept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied \n``justice would be\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\ndone.'' Treaty of Chicago, as amended, Article 4. Nevertheless, the \nTreaty of Chicago was ratified as amended by the Senate in 1834. \nSubsequently, the Pottawatomis sent a delegation to evaluate the land \nin Iowa. The delegation reported back that the land was ``not fit for \nsnakes to live on.''\n\n  While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis--\nparticularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty--refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east--with \ndevastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian \ntribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of \nthe Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on \na per capita basis government contract. Over one-half of the Indians \nremoved by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were \nalmost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas \nagainst their will and without their consent.\n  Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most \nof those in the Wisconsin Band vigorously resisted forced removal. To \navoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Band \nultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes \nwithout their horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes \non their backs.\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864 (13 Stat. 172) the \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their \nannuities by not removing and directed that the share of the \nPottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be \nretained for their use in the United States Treasury. (H.R. Rep. No. \n470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, \n1949). Nevertheless, much of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin \nBand.\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--\npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties. (Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess.) By the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 380), the \nCongress directed the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims \nmade by the Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomis that still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the[] [Wisconsin Bands] \nproportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys \npaid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the \nclaimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies \nretained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \nclamant Indians as directed the provision of the Act of June 25, \n1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada was $1,517,226. The Congress thereafter enacted a \nseries of appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to \nsatisfy most of money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nresiding in the United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nwho resided in Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \ncongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for \nredress of their claim.\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA) \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides \nof the border--brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission \nfor recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 \n(Ind. Cl. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823 (1950). The claim \nof the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims Court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. Cl. 445 (1983). The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the congressional reference process. The court has \nnow reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing \nto admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that the United \nStates is willing to do what we can to see that justice--so long \ndelayed is not now denied.\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians (the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States), the \nAssembly of First Nations (which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada), and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal \ngroups that remain in the United States today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Authorization for Payment.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of \n     the Treasury shall pay to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \n     $1,830,000 from amounts appropriated under section 1304 of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n       (b) Payment in Accordance With Stipulation for \n     Recommendation of Settlement.--The payment under subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (1) be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of \n     the Stipulation for Recommendation of Settlement dated May \n     22,\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n     2000, entered into between the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \n     and the United States (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``Stipulation for Recommendation of Settlement''); and\n       (2) be included in the report of the Chief Judge of the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims regarding Congressional \n     Reference No. 94-1037X, submitted to the Senate on January 4, \n     2001, in accordance with sections 1492 and 2509 of title 28, \n     United States Code.\n       (c) Full Satisfaction of Claims.--The payment under \n     subsection (a) shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of \n     the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada against the United States \n     that are referred to or described in the Stipulation for \n     Recommendation of Settlement.\n       (d) Nonapplicability.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution \n     Act (25 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.) does not apply to the payment \n     under subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n        Levin, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 217. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to preserve the \nessential air service program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with 13 other Senators to \nintroduce the bipartisan Essential Air Service Preservation Act of \n2005. I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Snowe as the principal \ncosponsor of the bill. Senator Snowe has been a long-time champion of \ncommercial air service in rural areas, and I appreciate her continued \nleadership on this important legislation. Senators Ben Nelson, Collins, \nRockefeller, Harkin, Grassley, Jeffords, Schumer, Leahy, Clinton, \nPryor, Levin, and Specter are also cosponsors of the bill.\n  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to \nensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline \nderegulation could continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, \nmany rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.\n  Our bill is very simple. It preserves Congress' intent in the \nEssential Air Service program by repealing a provision in the 2003 FAA \nreauthorization bill that would for the first time require communities \nto pay for their commercial air service. The legislation that imposed \nmandatory cost sharing on communities to retain their commercial air \nservice had been stricken from both the House and Senate versions of \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, but was reinserted by conferees. I \nbelieve that any program that forces communities to pay to continue to \nreceive their commercial air service could well be the first step in \nthe total elimination of scheduled air service for many rural \ncommunities.\n  Two times since mandatory cost sharing was enacted Congress has \nblocked it from being implemented. For fiscal years 2004 and 2005, a \nbipartisan group of senators included language in the Department of \nTransportation's appropriations act that bars the use of funds to \nimplement any mandatory cost sharing program. This bill would simply \nmake Congress' ongoing ban permanent.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently hinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For \nsmall communities, commercial air service provides a critical link to \nthe national and international transportation system.\n  The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air \nservice to over 100 communities in thirty-four states. EAS supports an \nadditional 33 communities in Alaska. Because of increasing costs and \nthe continuing financial turndown in the aviation industry, \nparticularly among commuter airlines, about 28 additional communities \nhave been forced into the EAS program since the terrorist attacks in \n2001.\n  In my State of New Mexico, five cities currently rely on EAS for \ntheir commercial air service. The communities are Clovis, Hobbs, \nCarlsbad, Alamogordo and my hometown of Silver City. In each case \ncommercial service is provided to Albuquerque, the state's business \ncenter and largest city.\n  I believe this ill-conceived proposal requiring cities to pay to \ncontinue to have commercial air service could not come at a worse time \nfor small communities already facing depressed economies and declining \ntax revenues.\n  As I understand it, the mandatory cost-sharing requirements in the \nFAA reauthorization bill could affect communities in as many as 22 \nstates. Based on an analysis by my staff, the individual cities that \ncould be affected are as follows:\n\n       Alabama--Muscle Shoals; Arizona--Prescott, Kingman; \n     Arkansas--Hot Springs, Harrison, Jonesboro; Colorado--Pueblo; \n     Georgia--Athens; Iowa--Fort Dodge, Burlington; Kansas--\n     Salina; Kentucky--Owensboro; Maine--Augusta, Rockland; \n     Michigan--Iron Mt.; Mississippi Laurel; Missouri--Joplin, Ft. \n     Leonard Wood; New Hampshire--Lebanon; New Mexico--Hobbs, \n     Alamogordo, Clovis; New York--Watertown, Jamestown, \n     Plattsburgh; Oklahoma--Ponca City, Enid; Pennsylvania--\n     Johnstown, Oil City, Bradford, Altoona; South Dakota--\n     Brookings, Watertown; Tennessee--Jackson; Texas--Victoria; \n     Vermont--Rutland; Washington--Moses Lake\n\n  As I see it, the choice here is clear: If we do not preserve the \nEssential Air Service Program today, we could soon see the end of all \ncommercial air service in rural areas. The EAS program provides vital \nresources that help link rural communities to the national and global \naviation system. Our bill will preserve the essential air service \nprogram and help ensure that affordable, reliable, and safe air service \nremains available in rural America. Congress is already on record \nopposing mandatory cost sharing. I hope all Senators will once again \njoin us in opposing this attack on rural America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 217\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Essential Air Service \n     Preservation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF EAS LOCAL PARTICIPATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking section 41747, and \n     such title shall be applied as if such section 41747 had not \n     been enacted.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 41747.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 218. A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide \nincentives to landowners to protect and improve streams and riparian \nhabitat; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  MR. KOHL. Mr. President, there are a number of different conservation \nprograms aimed at farmers, with a variety of goals. While many of those \nprograms improve water quality and stream health, none are primarily \nfocused with improving fish habitat. The bill I am introducing today \nwould focus USDA conservation dollars on restoring high quality fish \nhabitat in streams around rural America.\n  While there are millions of miles of streams throughout the country, \nfew of these streams are able to support the kind of first rate \nfisheries that they have in the past. Agriculture and industry have \naltered riverbeds over the years, slowing the movement of water for \ntheir own purposes. The EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service have \nfound that 81 percent of all stream fish habitats in the U.S. have been \nadversely affected by either pollution or other disturbances. In places \nwhere alterations in the river are no longer needed, they should be \nremoved to restore the ecosystem for the native fish.\n  Clean, fresh, fast moving streams are a necessary requirement for \nsome of our most popular game fish. Trout, one of our most valuable and \nsought-after game fish, need very specific conditions to thrive, and \nthose conditions have been harder and harder to find. Currently roughly \n2 percent of all freshwater fishes are either considered rare or at \nrisk. Habitat loss is part of the problem with only 19 percent of \nstreams and rivers in the lower 48 of high enough quality for wild or \nscenic status.\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\n  This bill, the Stream Habitat Improvement Program, is about more than \njust preserving an ecosystem or building wildlife populations, this is \nalso about tourism and recreation. Fishing in this country is big \nbusiness. In Wisconsin alone there are almost 950,000 anglers, and \nalmost half a million more come from out of State to fish in Wisconsin. \nTogether these anglers spend $1 billion on fishing related expenses in \nour State. Nationwide recreational fishing is related to $41 billion in \neconomic activity. An industry with this much impact around the country \ndeserves our consideration.\n  The bill introduced today would provide payments to farmers who \nengage in conservation projects that improve stream health. The bill is \nbased on the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program, but focused more \nclosely on streams, creeks, and rivers. Farmers who participate in the \nprogram will make improvements on streams running through their \nproperty. Improvements could include repairing shoreline, removing \nbarriers to fish passage, and planting trees to shade the water and \nstrengthen stream banks. Farmers who are willing to make the efforts to \nimprove spawning grounds and add cover for fish can do a lot to \nrehabilitate this resource.\n  Not every river and stream needs to be returned to its natural state, \nor be granted wild and scenic status. But this bill tries to take a \nsmall step toward repairing a resource for the future. Fishing, \nespecially trout and fly fishing, are big business in this country, as \nwell as important environmental indicators. Our efforts to further \nstream quality will have both economic benefits as well as natural \nones, and those are the kind of efforts that everyone in Congress can \nget behind.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect the \nretirement security of American workers by ensuring that pension assets \nare adequately diversified and by providing workers with adequate \naccess to, and information about, their pension plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, the Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, to re-\nintroduce the National Employee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee \nAct--or the NESTEG bill as we call it in the Finance Committee. The \nNESTEG bill would reform our pension and retirement savings laws in \nseveral important ways. For example, NESTEG would require companies to \nallow their employees to diversify out of company stock, a provision \nthat the Committee adopted in response to the events at Enron which saw \nemployees' retirement plans vanish almost over night. The NESTEG bill \nalso includes other important participant protections, including \nenhanced disclosure requirements, new rules governing so-called \nblackout periods, and faster vesting of employer contributions. In \naddition, NESTEG expands the portability of retirement plan assets so \nthat workers can keep money saved for retirement, and simplifies \npension laws and regulation. The NESTEG bill also responds to the \nuncertainty in the rules governing defined benefit pensions by \npermanently adopting the yield curve as a replacement for the 30-year \nTreasury rate.\n  Last year, the Finance Committee unanimously approved the NESTEG \nbill. This year, I am looking forward to seeing it signed into law. \nThis bill first began in the wake of the outrageous events that went on \nin the wake of the collapse of Enron and corporate scandals at other \ncompanies. Over the past few years, the Finance Committee has worked \ndiligently to enact reforms in a number of areas of the law to make \nsure that events like that don't happen again.\n  The important pension protections in the NESTEG bill are one \nremaining area for reform. The headlines have died down, but workers' \npensions are still too vulnerable to company failures. Thus, a central \npiece of this bill would allow employees to diversify their retirement \nplans so that they are not overly concentrated in company stock. \nDiversification is one of the hallmark principles of sound investment \nstrategy, and promoting diversification should be a hallmark of our \npension laws.\n  But the NESTEG bill is not just a bill that responds to Enron-like \nsituations. The NESTEG bill includes other important improvements to \n401(k) and other defined contribution plans as well. The bill makes it \neasier for employees to transfer amounts from one plan to another, \nthereby making sure that plan assets remain saved for retirement. And \nthe bill includes provisions designed to make it easier and more cost \neffective for small businesses to sponsor a retirement plan. Small \nbusinesses are vital to our economy, and we need to encourage a level \nplaying field so that workers at small businesses throughout our \ncountry have the same access to retirement plans as workers at Fortune \n500 companies.\n  The NESTEG bill also would remove a major source of uncertainty \nplaguing our pension system by enacting the yield curve as a permanent \nreplacement to the 30-year Treasury rate for pension funding. Workers \nneed reliable pension funding, and employers need a reliable basis on \nwhich to calculate pension payments. The NESTEG bill\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\nalso gives plan sponsors more flexibility to fund their plans well in \ngood times, and restricts the ability of companies with severely \nunderfunded plans to promise more benefits to work. The Administration \nhas recently come forward with additional pension funding reform \nproposals, and I look forward to examining those reforms as the Finance \nCommittee considers legislation in this area this year.\n  Retirement security is a topic that is going to get a great deal of \nattention this year. We know we need to increase long-term savings in \nAmerica, and we know that there are ways that we can improve our \nprivate retirement system. The reforms in the NESTEG bill that I am \nintroducing today with Senator Baucus represent an important step \nforward in improving Americans' retirement security. As we debate \nretirement security issues this year, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to achieve the goal of ensuring that all Americans achieve a \nsecure retirement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend \nSenator Grassley, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, in \nintroducing the National Employee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee \nAct.\n  Senator Grassley and I have attempted put together a bipartisan bill \nto improve the security of the pension plans that cover America's \nworkers. The Finance Committee approved similar legislation in the last \nCongress. Some of the provisions in this bill that provide participant \nprotections were in a bill we introduced in the 107th Congress--a bill \ndesigned to help us avoid another Enron retirement plan debacle.\n  We all remember Enron. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. Because \ntheir 401(k) accounts were heavily invested in company stock, these \nworkers lost most of their retirement savings as well. While the story \nof Enron's employees is no longer new, others companies unfortunately \nhave risen up, or fallen down, to take Enron's place.\n  This country is in the middle of a discussion about retirement \nsecurity. The administration is recommending that we introduce \ninvestment risk into the Social Security system--a system that is the \nsole source of retirement income for one-fifth of our senior citizens, \nand the primary source for almost two-thirds of seniors. Before we \nintroduce risk into Social Security, the bedrock of our retirement \nsystem, we need to take a hard look at how we can reduce risk to \nparticipants in the private retirement system. That is what this bill \nis about.\n  Pension legislation is challenging. Companies offer plans \nvoluntarily. If we value employer-sponsored retirement plans--and I \ndo--we need to be careful not to make them so burdensome that companies \nwill stop offering them. At the same time, workers have the right to \nbasic protections to make sure that the money that they are counting on \nfor retirement is really there when the time comes.\n  I believe that this bill strikes that balance. It phases out the \nability companies have to keep workers locked into company stock in \ntheir retirement plans. But it does not limit those workers' ability to \ninvest in that stock if they decide that doing so is best for them.\n  To help make that decision, we give workers tools to make good \ndecisions, and really understand the consequences of their actions. We \nrequire the issuance of benefit statements so workers know how much \ntheir accounts are worth and how much company stock they already own. \nAnd we provide a safe harbor to make it easier for employers to make \nindependent investment advice available if they want to.\n  The challenge inherent in legislating for a voluntary pension system \nis particularly sensitive when the subject is defined benefit plan \nfunding. When we discuss and debate funding proposals, we need to \nconsider the health of PBGC, the participants who are counting on \ndefined benefit pensions and the employers who have been willing to \npromise these benefits.\n  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures defined benefit \nplans covering forty-four million Americans. As recently as 2001, PBGC \nhad a projected surplus. Now PBGC has a projected deficit of $23 \nbillion. And this deficit represents unfunded guaranteed benefits. \nSadly, many participants were promised benefits in excess of those \nguaranteed by PBGC. These participants planned their retirement around \na benefit promise, only to have the rug pulled out from under them. We \nmust strengthen the funding of defined benefit pension plans so \npromises made can be kept. This bill takes some important steps toward \nthis goal.\n  First, this bill provides a permanent replacement for the 30-year \nTreasury rate used to calculate minimum funding requirements for \ndefined benefit plans. Congress passed a temporary substitute last \nyear, but our temporary fix expires at the end of this year. This bill \nwould extend the current corporate bond rate for an additional year, \nand then begin phasing in the yield curve--a set of rates that \nrecognizes that you will get a different interest rate on a 5-year loan \nthan on a 15-year loan.\n  This bill increases the deductible limit on company contributions to \ndefined benefit pension plans. This is so critical. We must allow \ncompanies to contribute more in good times, to build a cushion for bad \ntimes.\n  Under this bill, plans of financially-distressed companies that are \nless than 50 percent funded would not be allowed to continue promising \nadditional benefits until either the funding improves, or the company's \nfinancial footing is more solid. This is a tough provision. But we have \nto make sure that employees receive benefits that they have earned. We \nhave to do our best to make companies pay for promises they have made. \nBut when a company cannot pay for more promises, we must be willing to \nstep in and say ``No more promises.''\n  This bill has a number of other provisions that will make it easier \nfor a worker to move retirement plans from employer to employer, or \nfrom an employer plan to an IRA. There are also provisions that make it \neasier to administer retirement programs.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, to see the National Employee Savings and \nTrust Equity Guarantee Act through to enactment. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in working toward a more secure retirement for millions of \nAmericans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 222. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nstabilize the amount of the medicare part B premium; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Keep the \nPromise of Medicare Act'' of 2005, and am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Kennedy, Boxer, Lautenberg, Rockefeller, Dayton, \nand Corzine.\n  Our Medicare beneficiaries were greeted in the New Year by the \nlargest premium increase in Medicare's history--17.5 percent. At the \nsame time, the Social Security COLA increased by only 2.7 percent.\n  What are the implications of such a discrepancy? More than 2 million \nbeneficiaries nationwide have lost their entire COLA to the Medicare \npremium increase, and almost 13 million seniors and disabled Americans \nwill have over 50 percent of their COLA consumed by the Medicare \npremium increase.\n  This dramatic increase could have been avoided--CMS Administrator \nMcClellan has acknowledged that provisions included in the 2003 \nMedicare law designed to privatize the program directly contributed to \nthe premium increase.\n  Therefore, my legislation will limit, retroactively, the 2005 Part B \npremium increase to the same level as the Social Security COLA. The \nresult will be nearly a $10 monthly savings for our seniors--the Bush \nAdministration has given seniors a monthly $78.20 premium; under our \nlegislation the premium would be $68.40.\n  Older Americans have been struggling under the relentless increases \nin the cost of their health care and prescription drugs. Rather than \nalleviating the challenges they are facing, the 2005 premium increase \nhas made their situation even direr.\n  Adjusting the current premium is a first step, and one we must take \nimmediately. Additionally, we should use this year to revise an \noutdated law that has led to record increase in Medicare premiums in \nthe last four years. The promise of Medicare must include\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\nprotection from dramatic increases in the Part B premium.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Levin, Mr. Dayton, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n        Sarbanes):\n  S. 223. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nrepeal any weakening of overtime protections and to avoid future loss \nof overtime protections due to inflation; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am here to introduce legislation and to \ntalk about an issue that my colleagues have heard me speak about on \nnumerous occasions during the course of the past two years, frequently \nat some length. That issue is overtime pay for American workers.\n  It is a subject I feel deeply about. It has become very clear to me \nthat Iowans feel very deeply about it, as well. Working families across \nthe country feel deeply about it.\n  I know that is true because people approach me and tell me what \novertime pay means to them and their families. I have become associated \nwith this fight here in Congress over protecting overtime pay, so when \npeople recognize me, they very often will approach me and tell me a \nlittle bit about themselves and why they support my efforts on this \nissue. Many of them even become emotional about it.\n  Why is that? Why do people feel so strongly? For some, it is a simple \nmatter of fairness and valuing work. They believe that receiving time-\nand-a-half pay when they put in more than 40 hours of work in a week is \nfair because if they are going to give up their premium time--hours \nbeyond a normal workweek--then their employer should provide them with \npremium pay. It is simple fairness. Of course, they might also rely on \nthat premium pay as a substantial part of their income. That is a \nbenefit of valuing work fairly. They make more money.\n  Most people making overtime pay are not extremely affluent, so they \nare probably spending a lot of that extra income, putting it right into \nthe local economy. That is therefore a further benefit to the economy.\n  Other people, to tell the truth, would rather not work a lot of \novertime hours. They believe a 40-hour workweek is a full workweek.\n  That is what the Fair Labor Standards Act, FLSA, did when we passed \nit in 1938. It established the principle of a 40-hour workweek in law \nby saying that employers need to pay extra when they work their \nemployees longer than that. The time-and-a-half rule tends to \ndiscourage employers from requiring their employees to work longer than \n40 hours, and many people value the law for that reason. They want to \nkeep their premium time for themselves. They want to spend their \npremium time doing leisure activities or performing important family \nduties.\n  In 1938, our government decided that the 40-hour workweek was \nimportant to Americans. Look in any economic history book. It is \ntreated as a fundamental and valuable principle in our economy. \nOvertime pay rewards work, and it reduces exploitation. It protects \n``premium time'' for working men and women.\n  The 40-hour workweek says: Human beings are more than just the work \nthey do. It says, the progress of technology can allow us to enjoy a \ngood standard of living and quality of life without spending all of our \nhours toiling and laboring.\n  The 40-hour workweek also creates jobs. Requiring time-and-a half pay \nfor overtime work encourages employers to hire more workers, rather \nthan requiring additional hours of work from existing employees. \nFranklin Roosevelt cited this as a rationale when he signed the FLSA \ninto law.\n  In 1933, probably for all the reasons I have just mentioned, the \nUnited States Senate voted 53 to 30 to set a cap for hours in a \nworkweek. The number of hours was 30. The Senate voted to cap the \nworkweek in the United States at 30 hours. Those were extremely \ndifficult times economically, but the Senate of 70 years ago \nnonetheless placed a greater value on quality time spent off the job \nthan they did increasing productivity with longer workweeks.\n  The Bush rules are deeply flawed. They make millions of modest-income \nand moderate-income American workers vulnerable to losing their \neligibility for overtime pay, broadening the categories of workers that \nare ineligible for overtime protections--often in response to specific \nrequests from industries.\n  If overtime is free to the employer, it is going to be overused. A \nstudy done by the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers University \nshowed that only 20 percent of the workers eligible for overtime work \nmore than 40 hours a week, but 44 percent of workers who are exempt \nfrom overtime pay work overtime.\n  Several months ago, three former career DoL officials released a \nreport after having done an in-depth review of these rule changes. \nTheir analysis should be read by all to whom the issue of overtime is \nimportant.\n  These were not just any three former DoL officials. These were the \ntop three people who administered these regulations over the course of \nthe last two decades. They speak with enormous credibility on this \nissue.\n  These career employees have said that ``in every instance where DoL \nhas made substantive changes to the existing rules, it has weakened the \ncriteria for overtime exemptions and thereby expanded the reach and \nscope of the exemptions.'' This comes from people who were elevated to \ntheir high positions within DoL during the Reagan administration. The \nfact that they say these new rules are bad for the American worker in \nall ways but one ought to tell us something.\n  All of my colleagues are well aware that I led fights on the Senate \nfloor during the last Congress to block or repeal the Department of \nLabor's FLSA overtime rule changes. Despite the fact that Congress \nvoted 6 times during that period to protect workers' overtime by \nblocking the new rules, the administration insisted on ignoring the \nwill of Congress. The new rules went into effect on August 23 of last \nyear.\n  The bill I am introducing today would simply allow any workers who \nwere entitled to overtime before the new rules took effect last August \nto retain their overtime rights. It makes ineffective those portions of \nthe new rules that allow employers to take overtime eligibility away \nfrom workers who were eligible before the new rules took effect.\n  Secondly, my bill would also increase the minimum salary threshold. \nThe minimum salary threshold that helps define overtime eligibility had \nnot been raised since 1975 before the Bush administration raised it to \n$23,660. The administration did not raise it high enough, and millions \nof workers who should be covered are not covered due to this \ninadequacy. This bill will increase the number of workers covered by \novertime protections by raising the minimum salary threshold to \n$30,712--to correspond with the increase in workers' wages since 1975. \nThe bill also contains language that requires the salary threshold be \nadjusted annually to reflect and keep pace with increases in inflation.\n  American workers deserve an iron-clad guarantee that their overtime \nrights are safe. That is what the bipartisan bill I am introducing \ntoday accomplishes. It repeals any provisions of the new rules that \ntook effect last August that weaken overtime protections, and it \nindexes the minimum salary threshold annually to avoid future loss of \novertime protections due to inflation. I thank the 13 of my colleagues \nwho have agreed to cosponsor this for their support, and I look forward \nto adding more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Overtime Rights Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938.\n\n       Section 13 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 213) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\n       ``(k)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subchapter II of \n     chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code \n     (commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedures Act) \n     or any other provision of law, any portion of the final rule \n     promulgated on April 23, 2004, revising part 541 of title 29, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, that exempts from the overtime \n     pay provision of section 7 of this Act any employee who would \n     not otherwise be exempt if the regulations in effect on March \n     31, 2003 remained in effect, shall have no force or effect \n     and that portion of such regulations (as in effect on March \n     31, 2003) that would prevent such employee from being exempt \n     shall be reinstated.\n       ``(2) The Secretary shall adjust the minimum salary level \n     for exemption under section 13(a)(1) in the following manner:\n       ``(A) Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall increase the minimum \n     salary level for exemption under subsection (a)(1) for \n     executive, administrative, and managerial occupations from \n     the level of $155 per week in 1975 to $591 per week (an \n     amount equal to the increase in the Employment Cost Index \n     (published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) for executive, \n     administrative, and managerial occupations between 1975 and \n     2005).\n       ``(B) Not later than December 31 of the calendar year \n     following the increase required in subparagraph (A), and each \n     December 31 thereafter, the Secretary shall increase the \n     minimum salary level for exemption under subsection (a)(1) by \n     an amount equal to the increase in the Employment Cost Index \n     for executive, administrative, and managerial occupations for \n     the year involved.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Harkin for introducing \nthe Overtime Rights Protection Act to restore overtime protections for \nthe more than 6 million Americans denied overtime pay and denied the \nguarantee of a 40-hour work week by the Republican anti-overtime \nregulation adopted in 2004. The bill will also provide overtime \nprotections for additional deserving workers.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate voted four times to block the \nAdministration's overtime rule, and the House voted twice to block it. \nYet, the Republican leadership refused to accept the will of Congress \nand the will of the American people. Instead, it blocked the enactment \nof this legislation and continued the unfair assault on America's \nworkers and their right to overtime pay.\n  In today's economy, workers are concerned about losing their jobs, \ntheir pay, their health benefits, and their retirement benefits. Now \nmore than six million employees also have to worry about losing higher \npay they've always earned for working overtime.\n  These men and women are nurses. They are school teachers. They are \nlong-term care workers. They are assistants in mental health \nfacilities. They are countless men and women in many other fields.\n  Make no mistake--overtime cuts are pay cuts. When workers lose their \novertime pay, they still work longer hours. But they get no extra pay \nfor doing so, even though they've had the right to time-and-a-half pay \nfor overtime work ever since the 1930's.\n  Clearly, we need a policy to create more jobs, not eliminate jobs. By \ntaking away workers' right to overtime, the Administration's rule \nundermines job creation, since it allows businesses to require \nemployees to work longer hours for no extra pay, rather than hire new \nworkers to do the extra work.\n  Denying overtime pay is a thinly veiled scheme to reduce workers' pay \nand raise employers' profits. In this troubled economy, it makes no \nsense to ask any workers anywhere in America to give up their overtime \npay.\n  Instead of making hard-working men and women work longer hours for \nless pay, businesses should create new jobs by hiring more employees to \ndo the work.\n  We know that employees across America are already struggling hard to \nbalance their family needs and their work responsibilities. Requiring \nthem to work longer hours for less pay will impose an even greater \nburden in this daily struggle.\n  According to the Families and Work Institute, two of the most \nimportant things that children would most like to change about their \nparents are that they wish their parents were less stressed out by \ntheir work, and they wish they could spend more time with their \nparents.\n  The Government Accountability Office says that employees without \novertime protection are twice as likely to work overtime as employees \ncovered by the protection. In other words, businesses don't hesitate to \ndemand longer hours, as long as they don't have to pay higher wages for \nthe extra work.\n  Protecting the 40-hour work week is vital to protecting the work-\nfamily balance for millions of Americans in communities in all parts of \nthe nation. The last thing Congress should be doing is to allow the new \nanti-overtime rule to make the balance worse for workers than it \nalready is.\n  Under the overtime law, low-income workers are supposed to be \nautomatically included. But today, millions who should be included are \nleft out, since wages have increased, but the maximum earnings level \nfor automatic coverage has remained the same for 30 years. The Bush \nAdministration raised it to $23,660 in their new rule, but this level \nis still too low. The Harkin bill will cover more workers by raising \nthe threshold to $30,712, and index it to keep pace with wage growth. \nThis change will bring it to the level it would be if we'd made annual \nadjustments for wage inflation over the last 30 years.\n  Congress cannot look the other way while more and more Americans lose \ntheir jobs, their livelihoods, their homes, and their dignity. Denying \novertime pay rubs salt in the wounds of this troubled economy. Enacting \nthe Overtime Rights Protection Act will end this injustice, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S674-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S674-S676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 22--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE \n                            ON INTELLIGENCE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS submitted the following resolution; from the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence; which was referred to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration:\n\n                               S.

Bush stated after the election \n     in Iraq that the ``world is hearing the voice of freedom from \n     the center of the Middle East''; and\n       Whereas the United States Government stands ready to work \n     with the new Government of Iraq to build a free, democratic, \n     secure, and prosperous Iraq: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that, on January 30, 2005, the people of \n     Iraq elected a 275-member Transitional National Assembly and \n     leaders of provincial and regional governments in Iraq in an \n     election that has been widely described as free and fair;\n       (2) recognizes this election is a milestone in the \n     development of democracy in Iraq, commends the people of Iraq \n     on the election, and congratulates the new members of the \n     Transitional National Assembly and the leaders of the \n     provincial and regional governments;\n       (3) commends the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq \n     for its administration of the election and commends the \n     United Nations Mission in Iraq for the provision of expert \n     technical assistance and training to the Commission;\n       (4) expresses its respect for the freely expressed will of \n     the people of Iraq, its admiration for their courage in the \n     face of intimidation, threats, and acts of violence, and its \n     intention to work with the new Government of Iraq to help the \n     people of Iraq realize the opportunity for a more peaceful \n     and prosperous future;\n       (5) urges the new leadership of Iraq to move forward with \n     drafting the constitution, upholding the rule of law, and \n     holding a referendum on the new constitution in October 2005;\n       (6) urges all members of the international community to \n     help Iraq end the violent insurgency which is destabilizing \n     the region and help Iraq build the necessary political, \n     economic, and security infrastructure essential to establish \n     a viable, democratic state and improve the lives of the \n     people of Iraq; and\n       (7) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to help \n     the people of Iraq succeed in building their own government \n     and fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Iraq for a \n     free, united, peaceful, and prosperous Iraq.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I submit today a resolution commending the \nIraqi people for their participation in the election of January 30, \n2005, of a 275-member Transitional National Assembly and provincial and \nregional governments; and encouraging further steps toward \nestablishment of a free, democratic, secure and prosperous Iraq.\n  Despite the threats to voters, candidates and election workers, and \nthe acts of violence by those seeking to prevent the voice of the \nmajority from being heard, millions of Iraqis voted on Sunday.\n  For the first time in over 50 years, the Iraqi people have been given \nthe opportunity to choose their leadership. Through this resolution, \nthe Senate recognizes and commends this historic moment and the strides \nof the Iraqi people toward free and fair elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/31/senate-section/article/S676-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S676-S677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARING/MEETINGS\n\n\n                     subcommittee on national parks\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.
