Mr. President, I was in a town called Zeeland, ND, \nbecause we have a serious drought occurring in ranching country. We had \nranchers and farmers--this is a town of about 120 people and 170 \nranchers and farmers showed up very concerned about how they are going \nto feed their cattle.\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\n  We talked a lot about the drought and the devastation for ranchers \nand farmers when it doesn't rain and how they take care of their cattle \nherd and what might happen to them.\n  One of the issues raised in that meeting repeatedly was--in addition \nto the lack of rain--if you are running a farm or ranch, you are a \nheavy user of energy. What has happened to the price of energy, \nparticularly the price of fuel, has been devastating to those farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Our State university pointed out that the average farm and ranch in \nNorth Dakota is confronted with about $18,000 a year in higher costs \nbecause of what has happened to the price of fuel.\n  This morning I woke up and listened to the news, just as I did \nyesterday, and found that the price of oil is over $75 a barrel and \ncontinuing to go up. If we take a look at the major integrated oil \ncompanies in this country, we will discover the substantial increase in \nprofits--this is 2005 over 2004, last year's numbers: 43-percent \nincrease, 37-percent increase, 31-percent increase in profits.\n  The Congressional Research Service just did an evaluation for one of \nour colleagues which says that cash reserves for the major integrated \noil companies have grown from over $9 billion in 1999 to nearly $58 \nbillion now. Let me say that again. Cash reserves of the major \nintegrated oil companies now stand at over $58 billion.\n  It made me think about a story that was in BusinessWeek 2 years ago, \n``Why Isn't Big Oil Drilling More?''\n\n       Rather than developing new fields, oil giants have \n     preferred to buy rivals, ``drilling for oil on Wall Street.'' \n     While that makes financial sense, it is no substitute for new \n     oil.\n       Oil has been over $20 a barrel continuously since 1999. Far \n     from raising money to pursue opportunities, oil companies are \n     paying down debt, buying back shares and hoarding cash.\n\n  That was 2 years ago. It is worse now.\n  Last fall, we offered a windfall profits rebate that would have \ncollected from those companies that were not using their revenues to \nexpand their search for additional oil. For those that were buying back \nstock or drilling for oil on Wall Street, they would pay a fee, the \ntotal proceeds of which would be rebated to consumers. Those who were \nbuilding additional refineries or investing back into the ground to \nsearch for oil would not pay the fee; they would be exempt.\n  The oil companies were very upset by that proposal, but the fact is, \nthey would decide whether they would pay it. None of it would come to \nthe Government; it would all be rebated to consumers. They would decide \nwhether they pay it based on their decisions. Are they going to buy \nback stock with their profits? Are they going to hoard cash, drill for \noil on Wall Street, or are they going to use those profits to expand \nthe supply of energy?\n  I believe given what is happening, as we know, there is no free \nmarket in oil. I know there is a lot of discussion on the floor of the \nSenate about free market. We have oil ministers from the OPEC countries \nsitting around a table behind a closed door talking about how much they \nare going to produce and what price they aspire to have. We have big \noil companies married up through blockbuster mergers, and they have two \nnames--ExxonMobile, PhillipsConoco; they have more raw muscle in the \nmarketplace--and, third, the futures market has become an orgy of \nspeculation, no question about that.\n  With these three elements, there is no free market in oil. The price \nof oil is now at $75 a barrel. Almost all consumers in this country--\nyes, those who drive up to the gas pumps and pay $50, $60 and more to \nfill their tanks, and especially farmers and ranchers--are struggling \nto find out: How do I buy fuel for spring planting? How do I buy fuel \nfor the harvest? How do I put up hay for the cattle? How do I do all of \nthat? They are the ones who bear all the pain, and in the meantime the \nmajor integrated oil companies are waltzing to the bank with a treasury \nthat is full of money coming from consumers.\n  This does not work. In the longer term, aside from the question of \nhow dependent we are on offshore oil, it seems to me Congress has to \ndecide that it is going to intervene if we are going to $58 billion in \ncash reserves created by the major integrated companies. Those cash \nreserves are not working. Those cash reserves are not expanding the \nsupply of energy, they are not expanding the supply of oil, and \ntherefore reducing prices. They are being used--as I said, in \nBusinessWeek there was one example of drilling for oil on Wall Street \nor buying back stock. That is not a way to bring prices down and \nprovide some relief to consumers.\n  Last fall, Senator Dodd and I offered a proposal that would have \nprovided a rebate to consumers from those companies as a result of \nthose companies not using those profits to reinvest in expanding the \nsearch for energy. We came up very short in the vote. It is our \nintention to offer that proposal once again. At $75 a barrel for oil, \nwith increases particularly for farmers and ranchers in an agricultural \nState, it is reasonable to ask: What is Congress doing? Is it just \ncontent to observe, just watching? What is Congress doing?\n\n  So if nothing intervenes in the coming days, Senator Dodd and I \nintend to offer, once again, that proposal. Let me underscore that the \npoint of that proposal is this: That proposal will be the most \nsignificant incentive to expand production and expand the search for \nadditional production that we could have. This is not punitive. It is \nto say: Either you are using it to expand the production of energy \nsupplies and bring down prices or you are going to have to rebate some \nof it back to the consumers.\n  In 2004, the oil industry had its highest profits in its history. The \naverage price for a barrel of oil was $40. Now it is $75. Those major \nintegrated companies haven't done anything to increase expenses or any \nother issues; they are just collecting that additional revenue.\n  I want the oil industry to find additional oil and to produce in \nareas that are available to them. The best way, the most significant \nincentive I can think of is to say to them: If you are thinking about \nwhat to do with that cash reserve of $58 billion and deciding between \nbuying back your stock or trying to do additional mergers and acquiring \noil through mergers rather than drilling, then you would be a lot \nsmarter to find a way to expand production by investment because that \nmeans you will not be impacted at all by the proposal we would offer.\n  This proposal is about expanding investment in exploration and \nthereby expanding the supply of energy and bringing down the price of \nenergy. So that is what Senator Dodd and I will, once again, attempt to \ndo.\n  I hope that in the coming days we will begin to see some lessening of \nthe burden of these energy prices on the American consumer, farmers and \nranchers and others. In the meantime, I don't think we ought to take a \nlook at a $58 billion cash reserve by the major integrated companies, \nmost of them--three of them; nearly 90 percent of them are three \ncompanies--and say, that is OK, it doesn't matter to us, while \neverybody else is feeling the pain and bearing the burden of these \ndramatically increasing prices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business, with 15 \nminutes reserved for the majority and 15 minutes reserved for the \nminority. The minority still has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe my colleague, Senator Dodd, is \non his way to the Chamber, but let me ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Brownback proceed, with the understanding that we would reclaim \nour time on this side when Senator Dodd arrives.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nDemocratic time is reserved, and the Senator is recognized under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for that as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7452-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7452-S7454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the situation in\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nNorth Korea and about the dire situation of the people of North Korea \nand the human rights abuses that are taking place. I think most of my \ncolleagues know about the missile testing that has been occurring in \nNorth Korea, about the difficulty in getting negotiations going on the \nsix-party talks. I applaud the administration for their efforts on \ngetting these six-party talks moving on North Korea.\n  I also wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the human toll \nthat is taking place in North Korea. Kim Jong Il, the leader of North \nKorea, has been a weapon of mass destruction against his own people, \nkilling 1.5 million of his own people in prison camps--nearly 10 \npercent of their entire population--over the past 15 years. In \nparticular, I draw to the attention of my colleagues an article that is \nin today's Asia Times Online because I think this actually summarizes \nthe overall situation pretty well.\n  North Korea and South Korea have been talking quite a bit, and the \nSouth Koreans have actually sided with the Chinese and the Russians on \na weaker U.N. Security Council resolution. The North Koreans just \nwalked out of ministerial talks with the South Koreans, saying that \nthey want to pursue a missile weapons system--the North Koreans do--for \nthe protection of the entire Korean peninsula, including South Korea, \nwhich is absurd. This will be used against the South Koreans. At the \nsame time they want to pursue missiles, nuclear technology, the North \nKoreans are demanding from South Korea half a million tons of rice and \nseveral hundred thousand tons of fertilizer to help feed the starving \nNorth Korean people at a time when the Government is investing \nheavily--millions and billions of dollars, perhaps--in missiles and \nnuclear weapons which they can then sell to other countries, such as to \nthe Iranians, where the missile technology in Iran is based upon the \nNorth Korean missile technology system. And then they have the gall at \nthe same time to demand food out of South Korea to feed their starving \npeople in North Korea and fertilizer to be able to grow their crops.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed \nin the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is just amazing gall, that they \nwould do something like that, and it also highlights the situation and \nwhat is taking place.\n  I hope North Korea knows by now that their behavior has consequences. \nThe Security Council is considering a resolution. I hope we are able to \nget the tougher one that the Japanese are pursuing. The one from China \nand Russia clearly does not go far enough. We should work with our \nallies to attempt to defend against the North Korean threat.\n  Our missile defense programs now are more important than ever. \nThankfully--thankfully--we have put a missile defense program in place \nthat is not fully operational but should help us against these rogue \nregimes such as North Korea and Iran which are far less predictable--I \nthink one could probably use that term--than what the former Soviet \nUnion was, even though the Soviet Union had a bigger threat capacity.\n  What the President of Iran will do and what Kim Jong Il will do is \nhard to predict. These are very erratic leaders and ones who don't \nrespond well, if at all, to a mutual destruction type of threat that we \nused against the Soviet Union. We need the missile defense system.\n  The basic problem is the North Korean regime itself. The regime has \nturned North Korea into a failed state. I had hoped to bring over to \nthe Senate floor this morning a picture that is pretty well known by \nmost people. It is a night photograph of the Korean peninsula, and it \nshows lights in South Korea, it shows lights in China, and it shows \ndarkness in North Korea, which highlights the nature of the failed \nstate. This is just so amazing, that we have the Korean peninsula \ndivided into two countries--South Korea, the 12th largest economy in \nthe world, democratic and free, growing, robust; and North Korea, \nhaving killed 10 percent of its people in the last 15 years through \nstarvation and a gulag system--on the same peninsula.\n  North Korea is a failed state. The North Korean regime engages in \nillegal activities, including counterfeiting American money as well as \nproducing missile systems and expanding its WMD programs. It has a \nhumanitarian crisis. I noted earlier that an estimated 1.5 million \nprisoners have been killed in North Korea's prison camps. The gulag \nremains. Approximately 200,000 are currently in prison--political \nprisoners in North Korea.\n  The assistance China and South Korea provide to North Korea makes \nthem complicit in North Korea's missile development program. The \nassistance keeps their economy on life support, and thanks to North \nKorea's lack of transparency, even humanitarian aid is often diverted \nfrom the North Korean people for military use.\n  North Korea's symptomatic human rights abuses are often lost amidst \nour discussion of its nuclear and missile programs. We should set a \nlonger term goal to bring to light the humanitarian abuses that are \ntaking place. We need a Helsinki-type of discussion on human rights. We \nshould not just discuss missile technology or nuclear technology; we \nneed to discuss the humanitarian crisis that is in North Korea.\n  I also believe we need to discuss the elephant that is in the room \nthat nobody will discuss. North Korea is a failed state. Hundreds of \nthousands have walked out of North Korea into China. Some are now \nfinding a way into the United States as refugees. They tell horrific \nstories of what is taking place.\n  The natural state of the Korean peninsula is one country, whole and \nfree. That is the long-term goal for the natural state of the Korean \npeninsula--one country, whole and free. We should set that as a long-\nterm objective--the spread of democracy throughout the Korean \npeninsula.\n  I urge the Bush administration to fully fund the programs authorized \nby the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, and I urge my colleagues \nto fund those programs as well in the appropriations process. We should \nbe prepared to accept those North Koreans who voted with their feet and \nescaped the regime into this country and others as well.\n  We had our first group, a small group of six North Korean refugees, \nand four were women. The women said that the refugees that make it out \nof North Korea into China, 100 percent are trafficked into some form of \nsexual bondage or sexual slavery. They get out of North Korea into \nChina--that is relatively simple--and then they are captured, almost \nhunted like animals in China. When they are captured, the people who \ncatch them say: Look, you are going to do what I say or I am turning \nyou in to the Chinese authorities; they will repatriate you to North \nKorea, and you will end up in the gulag. So they do what they say, and \nthey are sold. They are caught like wild animals and sold to people in \nsome form of sexual bondage and sexual slavery in that portion of \nChina.\n  We should push China aggressively to stop repatriating North Korean \nrefugees. They are going back into the gulag. They are going back into \nthe death camps. The Chinese should be forced not to do that. It is \ncalled refoulement. It is against the U.N. agreements on human rights \nthat they entered into. They should be forced not to do that, not to \nsend them back. We should begin discussions with China and South Korea \non what the Korean peninsula should look like in the future--one \ncountry, full and free.\n  The bottom line is that our problem isn't just the missile or nuclear \ncapacity of North Korea, it is the North Korean regime itself. We must \naddress the root problem if we are ever to find a solution.\n  I might remind my colleagues as well that it is not just the missile \ntests, it is not just the nuclear technology in North Korea, because \nthen they look to sell it, as they have, and spread it to Iran, which \nmultiplies our sets of problems. We must look also at what happens to \nthe North Korean people, and much of our focus must be placed on China. \nChina is the one that is primarily keeping North Korea on life support \nsystems now. They are funding them. The Chinese, by not refouleing \nrefugees, by allowing North Koreans to come out and pass freely through \nthere to third countries, would really help a\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\ngreat deal in this crisis, and China bears much of the responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the chance to address the \nbody. We are looking at putting forward a resolution calling on any \nfuture dialog with North Korea to include a human rights component. \nAlong with the discussion of missile technology and nuclear technology, \nit desperately needs a human rights component, as we did in \nnegotiations with the former Soviet Union on missiles and nuclear \nweapons. We also included a Helsinki human rights component. This \ndiscussion needs a human rights component as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for allowing me \nto step in front of him to speak, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Asia Times, July 14, 2006]\n\n              North Koreans Let Their Feet Do the Talking\n\n                            (By Donald Kirk)\n\n       Seoul.--The ruckus over the North Korean missile shots has \n     exploded into a war of words that's endangering South Korea's \n     efforts to shrug off the crisis as a minor obstacle on the \n     path to North-South reconciliation.\n       South Korea appears to have awakened to the depth of the \n     difficulties with the North in the breakdown of ministerial-\n     level talks this week in the port city of Pusan. Far from \n     finding the basis for one of those face-saving statements \n     that often emerge from North-South Korean talks, the two \n     sides cut off the dialogue on Thursday a day earlier than \n     expected after finding no ground for agreement.\n       The sides were absurdly far apart, according to reports \n     from the closed-door sessions, with North Korea insisting the \n     missiles were needed for the defense of all Korea, North and \n     South, not just North Korea.\n       Finally, the North Koreans walked out on Thursday after \n     South Korea's Unification Minister Lee Jeong-seok flatly \n     rejected their claim that the North's Songun or military \n     first policy covered both Koreas equally. The talks were \n     originally to have gone on until Friday.\n       Lee, a one-time leftwing activist who has sought mightily \n     to paper over North-South differences, got nowhere in efforts \n     at persuading North Korea to return to six-party talks on its \n     nuclear weapons.\n       At the same time, he rejected North Korean demands for half \n     a million tons of rice and several hundred thousand tons of \n     fertilizer to help feed starving North Koreans at a time when \n     the government is investing heavily in missiles and nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The failure of the talks is ominous since they were \n     ``ministerial level''. The North Korean delegation was led by \n     Kwong Ho-ung, chief cabinet councilor. The North Koreans, \n     before boarding a direct flight from Pusan to Pyongyang on \n     Air Koryo, the North Korean airline, said ``our delegation \n     was no longer able to stay in Pusan'' as a result of the \n     South Koreans' ``reckless'' insistence on raising the issue \n     of the missile tests.\n       Suggesting the seriousness of the collapse, a statement \n     distributed by the North Koreans said the North now had no \n     dialogue partners in the South ``due to the South Korean \n     side's unreasonable'' position. The statement said they had \n     not come to Pusan to discuss military matters or six-party \n     talks.\n       South Korean leaders, caught between conflicting demands \n     from the United States, North Korea, China and Japan as well \n     as their vituperative critics and foes on their own home \n     front, remain determined to head off U.S. and Japanese \n     attempts to bring about a debate in the United Nations \n     Security Council on sanctions against North Korea.\n       South Korean officials firmly favor a resolution introduced \n     by China and Russia that ``strongly deplores'' the missile \n     tests and calls on all nations to ``exercise vigilance in \n     preventing supply of items, goods and technologies'' for \n     North Korean missiles. The resolution also asks them ``not to \n     procure missiles or missile-related items'' from North Korea.\n       The fear in the South is that a debate on a much tougher \n     Japanese resolution, banning North Korea from deploying or \n     testing missiles, importing or exporting missiles or weapons \n     of mass destruction, including nuclear warheads, or \n     developing any of them, would greatly exacerbate tensions.\n       South Korean strategists believe such a strong resolution \n     would arm Japan with the pretext for following through on \n     threats to attack North Korean missile sites. In fact, South \n     Korea has responded with far greater alarm to Japan's \n     floating this idea than to the actual missile tests, while \n     the rift between Japan and South Korea has turned into what \n     appears as an unbridgeable chasm.\n       A spokesman for South Korea's President Roh Moo-hyun \n     blasted Japan for what he called a ``rash and thoughtless'' \n     threat. It was, he said, ``a grave matter for Japanese \n     cabinet ministers to talk about the possibility of a \n     preemptive strike and the validity of the use of force \n     against the peninsula''.\n       U.S. officials, led by Christopher Hill, privately warned \n     Japan against a preemptive strike, reminding the Japanese \n     that open discussion of that possibility only invited an \n     adverse response from South Korea as well as China.\n       Such talk, they note, also plays into North Korea's \n     propaganda machine, which often emits noises about U.S. plans \n     for a ``preemptive strike'', citing that danger as a \n     rationale for the need for nuclear weapons.\n       The U.S., however, sides with Japan in the United Nations, \n     and no U.S. official adopts a harder line than the U.S. \n     ambassador to the U.N., John Bolton, a tough-talker from his \n     days as under secretary of state for arms control during \n     President George W. Bush's first term.\n       Bolton and Japan's U.N. Ambassador Kenzo Oshima have \n     engaged in the diplomatic nicety of calling the Chinese and \n     Russian draft ``a step in the right direction''. South Korean \n     officials believe, however, they may hold off on supporting \n     it, calling instead for a debate that gives both of them a \n     forum for lambasting North Korea.\n       Oshima found ``very serious gaps'' in the Chinese and \n     Russian draft, while Bolton seemed anxious to have the \n     Japanese resolution submitted to a vote despite the certainty \n     of Chinese and Russian vetoes. ``We're prepared to proceed at \n     an appropriate time with a vote,'' said Bolton, and ``let \n     every one draw their own conclusions.''\n       The standoff over how to deal with North Korea comes at a \n     critical time in relations between the U.S. and South Korea. \n     A U.S. team has just arrived in Seoul for talks about \n     creating an ``independent wartime command'' for South Korean \n     forces rather than a unified command led by a U.S. general.\n       The creation of such a command marks a major--and \n     controversial--departure from the system dating from the \n     Korean War placing all forces under a single American general \n     in the event of war.\n       The U.S. is also consolidating its bases in South Korea, \n     moving them south of Seoul in the face of widespread \n     opposition by activists and farmers resentful of the loss of \n     their land while the U.S. scales down its forces, now \n     totaling 29,500 troops, down from 37,000 three years ago.\n       Activists and farmers also oppose efforts by the U.S. and \n     South Korea to come up with a free trade agreement (FTA). \n     More than 20,000 people demonstrated in a heavy downpour in \n     central Seoul on Wednesday, charging the agreement would \n     deprive farmers and factory workers of their livelihoods.\n       While the North Koreans walked out of the talks in Pusan, \n     U.S. negotiators boycotted a session of the FTA talks in \n     Seoul on pharmaceuticals. The U.S. claims a plan for South \n     Korea to reimburse patients for the purchase of drugs made in \n     South Korea makes drug imports here virtually impossible.\n       It was a bad day all around for U.S. negotiators. Hill, in \n     Beijing, said he was finally taking off for Washington after \n     getting nowhere in efforts at persuading China to bring North \n     Korea back to the table. He tried, however, to see the \n     impasse from China's viewpoint.\n       ``China has done so much for that country,'' he said, ``and \n     that country seems intent on taking all of China's generosity \n     and then giving nothing back.'' The Chinese, he said, ``are \n     as baffled as we are.''\n       The U.S. and China, however, seemed in complete \n     disagreement on U.S. Treasury Department restrictions on \n     firms doing business with North Korea. Hill had nothing to \n     say in response to the official Chinese hope, expressed by a \n     spokesman, that the U.S. would ``make a concession regarding \n     the sanctions issue and take steps that will help restore the \n     six-party talks''.\n       The U.S. denies it's imposing ``sanctions'' and says the \n     restrictions are to counter North Korean counterfeiting. Hill \n     has repeatedly dismissed the topic as a matter for the \n     Treasury, not the State Department, while North Korea has \n     made the issue the reason for not returning to talks on its \n     nukes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7454-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7454-S7455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to my colleague \nfrom Kansas, I am always delighted to hear his comments and thoughts.\n  I wanted to be here earlier to discuss with our colleague and friend \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, the growing problem we are all \nhearing about from our constituents all across this country, and that \nis the ever-rising cost of gasoline and petroleum-related products. \nThere has been a staggering increase in the price of oil and gasoline \nwhich is having a huge impact on working families in this country. \nTheir weekly earnings have risen less than one-half of 1 percent over \nthe last 5 years, yet the cost of gasoline has more than doubled over \nthat same period of time.\n  These charts and graphs give an indication of what has happened to \nthe price. Beginning in 2000, it was $1.47. Just last week, in my \nhometown in Connecticut, the price ranged from $3.15 per gallon to \n$3.35 per gallon, depending upon the quality of fuel you were buying, \nand the national average is creeping closer to $3.00 per gallon. We \nhave seen the price of oil soar from just over $30 per barrel in 2001 \nto an excessive $75 per barrel this week.\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n  Most of us are aware, with the existing product from previously dug \nwells around the world, large profits can be made at $30 and $40 per \nbarrel. So when you start talking about $75 per barrel, you get some \nindication of the level of profits that are being made.\n  I mentioned what it is like for people out there who are struggling \nto make ends meet and hold their families together. Weekly earnings \nhave risen only .4 percent since 2001, adjusted for inflation, while \ngasoline prices have risen 130.5 percent since that same year, adjusted \nfor inflation. When you start talking about people on fixed incomes or \npeople earning the minimum wage, the problem becomes more pronounced. \nWe have gone 9 years now with no increase whatsoever in the federal \nminimum wage. We tried here only a few weeks ago, prior to the Fourth \nof July recess, for a $2.10 per hour increase in the minimum wage over \nthe next several years, from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. That is \na very modest increase in that minimum wage, but it would make a huge \ndifference for people out there who are trying to make ends meet.\n  Again, we have a limited time to talk about this, but Senator Dorgan \nand I are once again going to ask our colleagues to consider the idea \nof a rebate going back to people who are trying to make ends meet. We \nask, when you have profits in excess of $40 per barrel, to either \ninvest those profits back into the development of new product or new \ntechnologies or rebate part of those profits back to consumers.\n  I know the Presiding Officer cares deeply about this issue and has \nlectured us on numerous occasions about the importance of supply. I \ndon't fault the industry for trying to make a profit. What I would like \nto know is, are the companies investing in production, alternative \nsources of energy, and new technology? I would like to know they are \ngoing to do something, in addition to making a profit, that will \nactually increase our domestic supply.\n  We wake up today to find the region of the world on which we depend \ntremendously for our supplies is literally aflame, a tinderbox that is \nexploding while we are gathered here. Yet we sit around here almost \npretending that nothing is wrong as we continue to watch oil and \ngasoline prices skyrocket and oil companies record huge profits.\n  One of the major oil companies, in its 2004 annual report, told its \nshareholders:\n\n       We achieved the highest net income in our history, $18.2 \n     billion. This was 48 percent higher than in 2003, as a result \n     of higher oil and gas prices.\n\n  So they recognize themselves that their profits are occurring because \nof these skyrocketing prices. Why not put some of those resources into \ndeveloping alternatives, or doing a better job to see to it we become \nless dependent on the Venezuelas and the Middle East for our supplies? \nAnd if not, why not rebate some of the profits back to people who are \nstruggling to make ends meet?\n  Senator Dorgan and I are asking the leaders to provide us a limited \namount of time to debate oil and gasoline prices and other energy \nissues. Nothing has captivated the attention of our public as has this \nissue. I don't know why we can't find some time to talk about ideas to \nprovide relief to people we represent. We spent more time in the last \ncouple of weeks talking about gay marriage and flag burning. How about \ngasoline prices?\n  How about saying to the American public: Listen to the ideas we have \nto reduce the pressure you are feeling economically. That would be a \nwelcome surprise to most Americans, to hear us talk about something \nthey deeply care about. At the appropriate time, the Senator from North \nDakota and I will be offering some language, once again asking our \ncolleagues to join us in a bipartisan way to see if we can't encourage \nthe industry to do something more than just brag about its profits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4 minutes 12 seconds on \nRepublican side. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. We yield back the remainder of time in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5441, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5441) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Feinstein amendment No. 4556, to amend chapter 27 of title \n     18, United States Code, to prohibit the unauthorized \n     construction, financing, or, with reckless disregard, \n     permitting the construction or use on one's land, of a tunnel \n     or subterranean passageway between the United States and \n     another country and to direct the United States Sentencing \n     Commission to modify the sentencing guidelines to account for \n     such prohibition.\n       Thune/Talent amendment No. 4610, to establish a program to \n     use amounts collected from violations of the corporate \n     average fuel economy program to expand infrastructure \n     necessary to increase the availability of alternative fuels.\n       Vitter amendment No. 4615, to prohibit the confiscation of \n     a firearm during an emergency or major disaster if the \n     possession of such firearm is not prohibited under Federal or \n     State law.\n       Menendez modified amendment No. 4634, to provide that \n     appropriations under this Act may not be used for the purpose \n     of providing certain grants, unless all such grants meet \n     certain conditions for allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we are now back on the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. My hope is, although this is not formalized as a \nunanimous consent agreement yet--but the understanding I have with the \nSenator from Washington was that the Senator from Pennsylvania would \nspeak for about 15 minutes and then the opposition, if they wish to \nspeak, would speak for 15 minutes. Then the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl, would speak for about 10 minutes on his amendment. Then \nthere will be 10 minutes in opposition. Then we will go to a vote on \nthose two amendments. Either--if they are merged, one vote; if they are \nnot merged, two votes. Then we will go back to the Menendez amendment, \nthe amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I understand Senator Collins wishes to speak on that, and Senator \nLeahy wishes to speak. I am not sure what the time understanding is \nbefore we can get to a vote on the amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey, but my hope would be we could go to a vote fairly promptly on \nthat amendment after completing the votes on the amendments of Senator \nKyl and Senator Santorum.\n  I see the Senator from Washington is here. Is that her understanding?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would let my colleagues know we have \nseveral Members who want to come to the floor to speak. We are checking \nwith several of the relevant committees. I am hoping over the course of \nthe next hour or so we can figure out the timing on the votes the \nchairman requests.\n  Mr. GREGG. At this time, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nready to go and we will get started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4575\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4575 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) for himself \n     and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 4575.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the number of border patrol agents, to 2,500 \nagents, and offset by increasing the availability of reverse mortgages \n                              for seniors)\n\n       On page 70, line 3, strike ``$5,285,874,000; of which'' and \n     insert ``$5,459,135,000; of which $459,863,000 shall be for \n     1,500 additional Border Patrol Agents and the necessary \n     operational and mission support positions, information \n     technology, relocation costs, and training for those agents; \n     of which''.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 540 (a) Section 255 of the National Housing Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1715z-20) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (g)--\n       (A) by striking the first sentence; and\n       (B) by striking `established under section 203(b)(2)' and \n     all that follows through `located' and inserting `limitation \n     established under section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan \n     Mortgage Corporation Act for a 1-family residence'; and\n       (2) in subsection (i)(1)(C), by striking `limitations' and \n     inserting `limitation'.\n       (b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall by \n     notice establish any additional requirements that may be \n     necessary to immediately carry out the provisions of this \n     section. The notice shall take effect upon issuance.''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, let me say, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Kyl, we are working on two amendments that deal with the issue \nof border security. The first I am offering is an amendment to add 500 \nadditional border guards to the underlying bill. The President, in his \nbudget request, suggested we increase the number of border guards to be \ntrained this year to 2,500. One thousand of those were provided in the \nbill, but this would add an additional 500. The other 1,000 was \nprovided in the emergency supplemental, which was passed earlier this \nyear, which would bring us a total of 1,000, plus 1,000 in this bill, \nplus 500, to 2,500.\n  The reason the subcommittee and the committee did not provide the \nadditional 500 the President requested was because the President funded \nthose additional 500 with a fee on airline flights. That was something \nthe committee did not include in their mark and, as a result, didn't \nhave the resources the President's budget request had to be able to \nfund these additional 500 guards.\n  We have been working with Chairman Gregg and the ranking member to \ntry to come up with an offset, understanding this bill is incredibly \ntight. There are a lot of priorities in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Trying to find offsets and taking money away from other vital \nareas of homeland security was a very difficult thing to do. As a \nresult, I worked with the committee and came up with an offset that was \nused in the House of Representatives on another appropriations bill \nover there. It is an offset with which I am very familiar because it is \na piece of legislation I actually introduced earlier this year having \nto do with reverse mortgages.\n  Reverse mortgages are a very important tool that is used by some \nseniors in our society who have a lot of equity in their home but do \nnot have a lot of income. They don't have a substantial stream of \nincome to be able to support themselves in their retirement, so they \nhave all this equity locked up and no ability to access that equity.\n  The reverse mortgage program, sponsored and directed by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development--overseen by them--is a way \nto unlock that equity to be able to get income into the hands of our \nsenior population. It is a pilot program now and has a cap of 250,000 \nmortgages. What this amendment does is removes the cap, adjusts the \namount of money that will be allowed--the size of these reverse \nmortgages--based on the geographic area of the country, to reflect the \ndiscrepancy in pricing of houses in those different geographic areas of \nour country.\n  As a result, it will, because of these transactions, result in more \nincome to the Federal Government, more revenue to the Federal \nGovernment. It is about $190 million. This would pay for the amendment \nI am offering to increase the number of border guards.\n  In addition, there would be some additional money left over, which \nSenator Kyl, in a subsequent amendment, will address, to deal with the \ndetention facilities and use up the remaining part of that money and \nsome additional money in an offset that he has.\n  It is a combination effort to try to help the subcommittee come up \nwith additional resources which I am sure the chairman would love to \ndo. The chairman has been excellent in the past several years, since \nthe events of 9/11, in fully funding the requests from the \nadministration--in fact, in some cases exceeding the requests from the \nadministration in providing for border guards. I think he has said on \nthe floor of the Senate that we have seen a 40-percent increase in \nborder guards, in the number of border guards being trained and the \nnumber of border guards, period, in this country since the events of 9/\n11.\n  We have seen a substantial increase. I commend him for the priority \nhe has put to that. But I understood the difficulties he had in trying \nto come up with the money to add the additional 500 the Department said \nthey could train this year and that they need. This is a way to provide \nthe additional resources, to do so without emergency designation, to do \nso without busting the budget, to do so with a legitimate offset that \nactually raises the money that could counter the expense in providing \nfor the additional border guards.\n  Obviously, this is an important issue. There is no issue I heard \nabout more, over the past several months in particular as I traveled \naround the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as the issue of defending our \nborder. We passed an immigration bill in the Senate which was an \nattempt to increase the number of border guards, increase detention \nfacilities, build new fences, improve our points of entry at our \nsouthern border. That is wonderful, if we can get a comprehensive \nimmigration bill passed. If we get a piece of that immigration bill \npassed that deals with the border, I think that is a positive step in \nthe right direction.\n  That doesn't mean we can't do things right now in the normal process \nto improve the situation at the border. We have done that in prior \nappropriations bills as a result of the work of the chairman and \nranking member, and we should continue to do so, whether we get an \nimmigration reform bill ultimately passed this session of Congress.\n  This is the opportunity for Congress to actually do something \nconcrete and positive this year to enhance our border security--to \nincrease the number of border guards up to the President's request and \nup to what the Department of Homeland Security says they can use this \nyear and train this year.\n  I am hopeful we will get support for this--again, if it is fully \noffset. It is something we have cleared through the Ways and Means \nCommittee because this does raise revenue. When Chairman Thomas was on \nthe Senate floor, I asked about the potential blue slip problem. We \nhave gotten word we will clear that hurdle, if necessary.\n  I obviously checked with Chairman Bond and the housing subcommittee. \nThey have been very helpful in that regard. We have run all the traps. \nThere is a solid offset, and it provides for a definite need in a very \ncritical area of our national security; that is, our border presence.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4643\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Santorum \namendment be laid aside for the purposes of me laying down an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, my amendment is similar to that laid down \nby Senator Santorum in that the offset comes from the same housing loan \nprogram. It is an effort to reach the President's full goal rather than \nwhat the appropriations bill was able to accommodate, but in this \nsituation to reach that goal for detention spaces rather than \nadditional Border Patrol. If you combine the two amendments, what we \nwill have accomplished is to achieve the funding of the full number of \nBorder Patrol agents the President wanted to add and the full number of \ndetention spaces the President wanted to add. That is the simple \nexplanation. There simply was not quite sufficient money available to \nthe Appropriations Committee to achieve 100 percent of both of those \ngoals. Those goals were stated in the President's budget with respect \nto detention spaces.\n  I will describe the detention space problem in a moment, but the \nPresident's fiscal year 2007 budget request requested an additional \n6,700 beds. The legislation before the Senate funds an additional \n1,000. The supplemental appropriations bill we passed earlier\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nfunded an additional 4,000. Adding those two together, you have 5,000 \nnew beds. Subtract that from the 6,700 the President said he needed \nwhen he submitted the budget and we have an additional 1,700 beds we \nneed to acquire. This legislation appropriated the funds for the \nadditional 1,700 beds and uses the offset Senator Santorum will trigger \nin his bill, as well.\n  Why is it important to add these detention spaces? The primary reason \nis to end, once and for all, this program of catch and release. When we \napprehend an illegal immigrant from a country other than Mexico, you \ncannot return that person to Mexico. The person is not a citizen of \nMexico. We have to return that person to their country of origin. This \nis a very difficult thing to do.\n  First of all, some of the countries will not take their people back. \nOthers will only do so after a great deal of time and effort are \nexpended in paperwork to take them back. There are something like \n40,000 Chinese nationals who need to go back to China but who are not \nbeing sent back to China.\n  What happens to those people in the meantime? The program in the past \nhas been, as I said, catch and then release them because there is no \nplace to detain them pending their removal to their country of origin.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security would like to have enough \ndetention space available that the people who need to be detained can \nbe detained. They can be put on the airplane and sent back to their \ncountry of origin. The Secretary would like to expedite this removal so \nthat in all cases it is done within a couple of weeks, if possible. \nToday, the average is about 3 weeks.\n  The problem is, many people are apprehended and simply told to return \nin 3 weeks, 90 days, or whatever the period might be. Of course, most \nof them do not come back to be removed to their country of origin. That \nis the release part of it. As a result, we have a large population of \nillegal immigrants in this country from countries other than Mexico who \nhave been apprehended, have been asked to come back so they can be sent \nback to their country of origin but who never come back to be sent \nback. Without the detention spaces, that is not going to stop. Once \nthose detention spaces are available, the Secretary believes these \nillegal immigrants will cease coming here because the expense of their \ngetting here is not going to be worth it since they will have the \ncertain knowledge they will be apprehended, detained, and then sent \nback rather than detained and then released into our society, never to \nbe heard from again.\n  The President's 2007 budget did describe this practice of catch and \nrelease and described it as an unacceptable practice that must end. If \nwe are going to end it, we need to have sufficient detention spaces, as \nthe President pointed out, the additional 6,700 beds to accommodate \nthese people.\n  A number of Members have continually talked to the administration and \nthe Department of Homeland Security about this problem. For one reason \nor another, it has always been a matter of, we need more detention \nspaces and we cannot accommodate this many people. It is a major \nbreakthrough; the administration has finally calculated how many more \nspaces it needs and has begun the process of acquiring those spaces. We \nneed to support the administration's full request and not simply get 60 \nor 70 percent of it accomplished. We are not going to solve this \nproblem of catch and release until we have sufficient detention space.\n  It is also a security problem for the United States because in many \ncases we do not know the identities of these people. These are not \nsimply Mexican nationals coming across. They could be people from \nChina, Russia, Vietnam, or countries of special interest to the United \nStates in the Middle East, for example, countries from which terrorists \nhave come. As a result, it is important not to simply release these \npeople into the interior of our country never to be heard from again. \nThey carry false documents. We do not know their true identities. It is \nimportant when we apprehend them to detain them.\n  Let me quote from a June 22 letter from me to the Department of \nHomeland Security, Secretary Chertoff:\n\n        . . . because DHS lacks the detention space to hold OTMs \n     [other than Mexican nationals] it necessarily releases 70 \n     percent of them into the interior of the United States with a \n     Notice to Appear for an immigration hearing. Approximately 70 \n     percent of those released failed to appear for their \n     hearings; of those who do appear, 85 percent fail to comply \n     with final orders of removal and remain illegally in the \n     United States. In effect, therefore, our national policy \n     amounts to ``catch and release,'' and raises significant \n     national security concerns. Moreover, it does nothing to \n     deter further illegal immigration by OTM's. Indeed, it may \n     have the opposite effect: A June 4th article in the San Diego \n     Union Tribune indicates that Brazilians, who make up a large \n     portion of the OTM's, actively seek out border patrol agents \n     after illegally crossing the border, so that they may get a \n     Notice to Appear and pass unmolested into the interior.\n\n  In other words, it is actually a benefit for these people who have a \npiece of paper with them that, in effect, frees them from additional \napprehension during this period of time prior to their notice to \nappear. When the time period is up and they are supposed to actually \nappear, they are gone. In the meantime, they basically had a free pass \nto travel wherever they want in the United States, unmolested by the \nBorder Patrol or law enforcement.\n  In a November 15, 2005, letter to Secretary Chertoff, I joined \nSenators McCain, Hutchison, and Cornyn in advising the Secretary that:\n\n       . . . the Department should immediately resolve the ``catch \n     and release'' practice, under which these non-Mexican illegal \n     aliens are released into the interior due to lack of \n     detention space.\n\n  The result of that was an effort by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to identify what was necessary in order to achieve the goal. \nAs I said, their determination was 6,700 beds, the number called for in \nthe administration's budget.\n  I applaud the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, Senator \nGregg, for finding the funding to add an additional 1,000 beds to the \n4,000 that were put in the supplemental appropriations bill, also due \nto his efforts. The Committee on Appropriations has gone a long way \ntoward getting this funding, but we are still not quite there.\n  This legislation says this must be one of our priorities. As a \nresult, having found a way to pay for it from other legislation, let's \nadd these 1,700 so we can accommodate the full budget request of the \nPresident and say we have done everything we can to resolve this \nproblem of catch and release.\n  There are some additional things we could talk about here, but it is \nprobably relatively uncontroversial for us to complete this job. If \nthere is no opposition to this amendment, I don't think it is necessary \nfor me to talk about some of the additional things we could discuss to \nmake the case; that it is very important to stop this program of catch \nand release. I think almost everyone agrees with that proposition. My \namendment is what is necessary to complete that unfinished business.\n  I hope our colleagues would see the benefits of adding this to the \nbill and ensure we can complete the task of resolving this problem of \ncatch and release.\n  If there is further debate, I am happy to respond and cite additional \ninformation that I think will help make the case we need to do this, \nbut I don't think it is a case that needs a great deal of elaboration. \nI ask my colleagues when we have the opportunity to vote on this, to \nsupport this amendment, as well as Senator Santorum's amendment, which \nI also wholeheartedly join in supporting. I am an original cosponsor of \nit.\n  These are the two pieces of unfinished business we need to take care \nof in this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nArizona. I am a cosponsor of his amendment as he is a cosponsor of \nmine. I am very sanguine about the opportunity to get both the \ndetention facilities, the beds added, as well as the additional border \nguards the President requests. I think everyone in this Chamber has \nbeen very clear about the need for additional border security on both \nsides of the aisle. In fact, we voted on numerous amendments in the \npast offered by Members on both sides of the aisle to increase border \nsecurity as well as to stop the catch-and-release policy.\n  Here is an opportunity to have the President's budget request \ncomplied with, and to offset that is sort of a bonus. It is good public \npolicy. We have\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\ngood public policy providing streams of income for our seniors at a \ndifficult time in their life through the process of reverse mortgages, \nwhich was a pilot program that has worked very well and has broad \nsupport on both sides of the aisle.\n  What we have in this amendment, as well as the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona, is the opportunity to have a win-win situation. \nMy understanding is, however, that--at least there is a rumor afoot--\nsome on the other side of the aisle have a problem with the offset, not \nthat they have a problem--my understanding is they do not have a \nproblem with the offset itself but that under the rules of the Senate \nthere is a germaneness issue with respect to this particular offset on \nthis particular piece of legislation.\n  I hope we look to the merits of actually both pieces of legislation: \nOne, the funding for detention facilities and for border guards, the \nneed to do that, the need to do it in a fiscally responsible way, not \nadding to the deficit. On top of that, there is the good public policy \nthat can be accomplished through the Reverse Mortgage Program--which, \nagain, has broad support from both sides of the aisle and has terrific \nsupport within the senior community, the AARP, as well as so many other \nsenior organizations, lending organizations, and the like who see the \nterrific advantage. This is a program overseen by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. It is a good public-private partnership \nthat has the public component to ensure that seniors are not taken \nadvantage of in these transactions. So it is a good win for our \nseniors, it is a good win for our border security, as well as getting \nrid of a very bad policy which is catch and release.\n\n  So again, the point of germaneness has not been made, and maybe on \nsecond thought we will see that the actual public policy benefits of \ngetting something done here in the U.S. Senate, of increasing border \nsecurity, as well as improving the living conditions of our seniors, \nwill be a good one-two punch to accomplish here today in the U.S. \nSenate. I hope we can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, when I described my amendment, I neglected \nto send it to the desk, so I send the amendment to the desk at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself and Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 4643.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the number of Department of Homeland Security \n          detention bed spaces by 6,700 total beds in FY 2007)\n\n       On page 75, line 8 strike ``$3,740,357,000; of which; and \n     insert ``$3,780,357,000; of which $40 million shall be \n     authorized for 1,700 additional detention beds spaces and the \n     necessary operational and mission support positions, \n     information technology, relocation costs, and training for \n     those beds; of which''.\n       Sec.  At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n       Section 255 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-\n     20) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(n) Authority To Insure Home Purchase Mortgage--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision in \n     this section, the Secretary may insure, upon application by a \n     mortgagee, a home equity conversion mortgage upon such terms \n     and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, when the \n     primary purpose of the home equity conversion mortgage is to \n     enable an elderly mortgagor to purchase a 1-to-4 family \n     dwelling in which the mortgagor will occupy or occupies one \n     of the units.\n       ``(2) Limitation on principal obligation.--A home equity \n     conversion mortgage insured pursuant to paragraph (1) shall \n     involve a principal obligation that does not exceed the \n     dollar amount limitation determined under section 305(a)(2) \n     of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for a \n     residence of the applicable size.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4615, As Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I call for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 4615 and ask that it be modified according to \nthe modification language already at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to do both actions.\n  The amendment (No. 4615), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 540. PROHIBITION ON CONFISCATION OF FIREARMS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this Act shall be used \n     for the seizure of a firearm based on the existence of a \n     declaration or state of emergency.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors the following Senators: Chambliss, Roberts, Bunning, Allen, \nBaucus, Thomas, and Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this slightly modified amendment is the \nsame amendment fundamentally that I described and talked about \nyesterday, only now it is fully germane--a pure limitation amendment \nwhich clearly can be and should be and will be considered and voted on \nin the context of this underlying bill.\n  It would prohibit law enforcement officers from confiscating firearms \nfrom those who are in lawful possession of them just because it is a \ndisaster situation. It would not prevent funding for law enforcement \nofficers who confiscate firearms because someone is in violation of \nFederal, State, or local law. It simply says, law enforcement cannot, \nunder their powers because it is an emergency situation, start \nconfiscating firearms which are completely legal, which have been \nobtained completely lawfully, by law-abiding citizens.\n  As I explained yesterday--and I want to repeat it very briefly now--\nwe talk about second amendment rights. We talk about the right and the \nneed in some cases to defend your life and property. That is why the \nsecond amendment offers such fundamental and important constitutional \nrights.\n  Yet at no time in our ordinary experience is that more important, \nmore truly important, to the preservation and defense of one's life and \nproperty than in the sort of disaster situation we saw right after \nHurricane Katrina.\n  In the aftermath of that disaster, there was no communication. The \npolice were cut off from enforcing their duties in many neighborhoods. \nAnd there was no ability for law enforcement to come to a citizen's \ncall in light of an emergency. So a law-abiding citizen truly did, in \nmany instances, depend on his firearm, his lawfully obtained legal \nfirearm, protected by the second amendment for the defense of his \nproperty and literally, in some cases, his life and his family's life.\n  Therefore, we should never allow the confiscation of those legal \nfirearms in that desperate situation when they truly are essential for \nthe preservation of life and property.\n  Again, my amendment is very simple and straightforward in that \nregard. As it has now been modified, it is fully germane within the \nbounds of this bill.\n  I look forward to my colleagues supporting it with a strong \nbipartisan vote because it is such a clear, commonsense, right thing to \ndo.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. I certainly intend to support it--strongly support it. \nI think it is an excellent amendment. I believe it is going to require \na vote, however.\n  We are now going to turn to the Senator from Connecticut who is going \nto offer an amendment with 30 minutes on that amendment, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut having control of 20 minutes and myself having control \nof 10 minutes. At the completion of the presentation of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, I would hope we would be able to work out an \nagreement where we can go to a vote on the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and a vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut. That has not yet been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4641\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n4641, if I may, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a second?\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthis amendment be 30 minutes, with 20 minutes allocated to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4641 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague \nfrom Michigan, Senator Stabenow, be added as an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if the Chair would inform me when the \nSenator from Connecticut has consumed 15 minutes, I would appreciate \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise this morning to offer this \namendment that seeks to meet some of the domestic security needs of our \nNation as demonstrated by a distinguished group of experts in public \npolicy, national security, and public health. This is not an amendment \nthat I have crafted on my own. Rather, this amendment reflects the \ntremendous work done by our former colleague, the Senator from New \nHampshire, Warren Rudman, who authored this report under the auspices \nof the Council on Foreign Relations back in 2003, along with a very \ndistinguished group of Americans who brought a wealth of talent to that \nreport, making significant recommendations as to how we might \nstrengthen the ability of first responders in this country to deal with \nthe national security threats posed by terrorist organizations.\n  Obviously, all of us here are more than aware of these threats not \nonly because of the events of 9/11, when we were victimized by the \nattacks of al-Qaida, but because we have witnessed the tragic events in \nMadrid and London, and most recently, the train bombings near Mumbai, \nIndia, where terrorist attacks have taken the lives of innocents. Once \nagain, we realize that we are very, very vulnerable.\n  Warren Rudman has warned us of this vulnerability. A distinguished \ngroup of Americans, who I will identify in a moment, have warned us. I \nwill be offering an amendment now for the fourth time since 2003 urging \nmy colleagues to support an effort to put some very meaningful \nresources to bear when it comes to the needs of our first responders \nall across this country.\n  As I mentioned, this is the fourth year I have offered my amendment, \nalong with my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. And I thank \nher immensely for her tireless efforts in this regard as well.\n  The purpose of this amendment is very simple. It is to fund the \nurgent priorities of our Nations's firefighters, law enforcement \npersonnel, emergency medical personnel, transportation systems, and \ncritical infrastructure, such as our ports and chemical plants around \nthe country.\n  The amendment would pay for these vital priorities by lowering the \ntax breaks for individuals with annual incomes in excess of $1 million.\n  Politics is always about choices. Choices are never easy. To pay for \nthis, I have to come up with an offset. I realize that. But it seems to \nme if we cannot make the simple choice of asking those who are the most \naffluent in our society to reduce, for a period of time--not totally--\nbut just reduce, by a small amount, the amount of the tax break they \nwould be getting over the next few years in order to fund the needs we \nhave in our communities across this country--it is not a difficult \nchoice to make.\n  I suspect if we surveyed the Americans who are making this kind of an \nincome, as to whether or not they would be willing to forego the size \nof the tax cut they would be getting in order to properly fund these \nefforts, I suspect those Americans, as patriots, would be more than \nwilling to make that kind of a sacrifice, if you wish to call it such, \nin order to properly fund the efforts that have been identified by \nAmericans who know what they are talking about when it comes to our \nnational security needs.\n  Four years ago, the Council on Foreign Relations--which I mentioned \nalready--convened an independent task force to identify the challenges \nfaced by our Nation in preventing and responding to acts of terrorism. \nThis group was chaired, as I mentioned, by our former colleague, \nSenator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire.\n  The task force, in June of 2003, issued a very comprehensive report \nentitled: ``Emergency Responders: Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously \nUnprepared.'' That was the report issued in 2003.\n  Senator Rudman was joined on this task force by a very distinguished \ngroup of Americans. Let me name some of them, not all of them: George \nShultz, former Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, Secretary of the \nTreasury, Secretary of Labor, and Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget; William Webster, former Director of the Centra Intelligence \nAgency; Charles Boyd, the chief executive officer and president of \nBusiness Executives for National Security; Margaret Hamburg, the vice \npresident for biological weapons at the Nuclear Threat Initiative and \nformer Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services; Donald Marron, former chairman \nof UBS America; James Metzl, former staff member of the National \nSecurity Council, the Department of State, and former staff director of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Norman Ornstein, resident \nscholar at the American Enterprise Institute; Anne-Marie Slaughter, \ndean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs \nat Princeton University; and Harold Varmus, president and chief \nexecutive officer of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center--and on \nand on, just to give you some idea of who the authors of this task \nforce are.\n\n  All I have done is taken their recommendations and put them into \nlegislative form. These are not Dodd proposals. These are proposals \nthat our former colleague, along with the individuals I have just \nmentioned, have asked us to do. They told us 3 years ago the things we \nmust do to be better prepared to deal with our threats. These are their \nideas, not mine. I am just taking their ideas and putting them in \nlegislative form, along with my colleague from Michigan, and asking our \ncolleagues to get behind this and to pay for this by reducing, ever so \nmarginally, the amount of the tax break that individuals making more \nthan $1 million a year would otherwise be receiving.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nJudd Gregg--we are good friends--and Senator Byrd. They have a very \ndifficult task, along with the other members who serve on the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee. It is not an easy job at all, and \nI recognize that. However, concerning the needs of our\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nemergency responders and our critical infrastructure, I think we are \nfaced with a problem that is far more significant than the budget cap \nrequirements placed on these appropriations bills.\n  I think we will come back and revisit this if we are faced with the \nkind of tragedies I think all of us know are out there, when we look \nback and ask why we didn't do what needed to be done when Warren Rudman \nand others warned us about what would happen if we didn't provide the \nkind of support we are asking for. We would be told at some later date: \nWell, you see, there was a budget cap here where we mandated we could \nnot do any better than what the budget cap required of us. I think we \nwill come back to rue those words. I think we will regret it deeply \nthat we did not provide the kind of support being recommended by this \ndistinguished panel of Americans.\n  If the tragic events in Madrid and London, the alleged plot to \ndestroy the Holland Tunnel, and most recently the train bombings in \nIndia say anything to us at all, it is that we must renew and redouble \nour efforts to prevent and respond to terrorism here at home.\n  The Rudman report only underscores, in my view, the sense of urgency \nthat we ought to have about protecting our country from the risk of \nterrorism. However, the needs of our communities far exceed the limited \nresources we have been given in this bill. Again, I have respect for \nSenator Gregg and Senator Byrd. They have a very difficult job. I will \nbe the first to admit that.\n  In fact, what I am asking for in this amendment is to spend $20 \nbillion a year for 5 years, to hire, equip, and train first responders \nand to better protect our critical infrastructure from attack. This \nbill spends only roughly $4 billion a year, only about a fifth of what \nwe are told by the Rudman report is urgently needed.\n  Again, we are faced here with a point of order that I know will be \nraised against this amendment because it violates the cap. And I will \nbe asking to waive that budget point of order when either my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire raises it or someone he designates does. But I am \nasking my colleagues, do not let yourself cast a vote here that I think \nwe will come to regret down the road.\n  How many more warnings do we need to have as a nation? We are not \nisolated in the world. We are not that well protected. What happened in \nIndia, what happened in Madrid, what happened in London, what happened \nhere only 5 years ago will happen again. We need to provide the kind of \nprotection that our constituents demand of us.\n  The Rudman report must not become yet another report collecting dust \non a forgotten shelf--and that is my fear--until once again we are \nstruck and wonder why we did not take these steps called for in that \nreport.\n  Let me read, if I may, briefly, the conclusions of the report. Listen \nto their words. If my words do not move you, listen to the words \nauthored 3 years ago by the people on this distinguished panel of \nAmericans, authored by the Council on Foreign Relations. Listen to what \nthey said 3 years ago. And I quote them. They, and Senator Rudman, said \nthe following:\n\n       The terrible events of September 11 have shown the American \n     people how vulnerable they are because attacks on that scale \n     had never been carried out on U.S. soil. The United States \n     and the American people were caught under-protected and \n     unaware of the magnitude of the threat facing them.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In the wake of September 11, ignorance of the nature of the \n     threat or of what the United States must do to prepare for \n     future attacks can no longer explain America's continuing \n     failure to allocate sufficient resources in preparing local \n     emergency responders. It would be a terrible tragedy indeed \n     if it took another catastrophic attack to drive the point \n     home.\n\n  Madam President, I do not think any words can express the problem \nbefore us more clearly than those of Senator Rudman. It would be a \nterrible tragedy if it took another catastrophic attack to drive this \npoint home.\n  I would also like to quote from the foreword of this report written \nby Les Gelb, who is the former president of the Council on Foreign \nRelations. Listen to what he had to say at the conclusion of that \nreport:\n\n       As I sit to write this foreword, it is likely that a \n     terrorist group somewhere in the world is developing plans to \n     attack the United States and/or American interests abroad \n     using chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or \n     catastrophic conventional means. At the same time, diplomats, \n     legislators, military and intelligence officers, police, \n     fire, and emergency medical personnel, and others in the \n     United States and across the globe are working feverishly to \n     prevent and prepare for such attacks. These two groups of \n     people are ultimately in a race with one another. This is a \n     race we cannot afford to lose.\n\n  Again, I can stand here for the next hour and a half or 2 hours. I \ndon't think any words I can utter are going to be as serious as the \nones authored by Warren Rudman or Les Gelb. These groups, those that \nare somewhere in the world as I am standing here on the floor of the \nSenate, are preparing to attack us again. I know that. Every one of my \ncolleagues knows that is going on. And simultaneously, there are people \nin Alaska, Connecticut, and New Hampshire that are doing everything \nthey possibly can to protect us. Two groups, one wants to attack us; \nthe other is trying to prepare against that attack. It is a race, and \nwe are being asked by people who know what is going on to provide \nadequate funding so that the group that defends us will have the means \nto protect us.\n  I am asking for the fourth time in 3 years to break this cap and do \nwhat ought to be done to give our Nation the kind of protection it \ndeserves.\n  In October 2002, several months prior to the issuance of the Rudman \nreport, the Council on Foreign Relations convened yet another task \nforce, the Independent Task Force on Homeland Security, which issued \nthe report ``America: Still Unprepared, Still in Danger.'' This task \nforce was cochaired by Senator Rudman and another of our former \ncolleagues, Senator Gary Hart of Colorado. They came to the general \nconclusion:\n\n       America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and \n     respond to a catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\n\n  The report further warned:\n\n       America's own ill-prepared response could hurt its people \n     to a much greater extent than any single attack by a \n     terrorist [and] the risk of self-inflicted harm to America's \n     liberties and way of life is greatest during, immediately, \n     and following a national trauma.\n\n  Here we have two seminal reports issued within 8 months of each \nother, essentially sounding an alarm to policymakers. We are the \npolicymakers. We the ones who have to make the decision as to whether \nor not resources are going to be there. We hear the alarm further \nstrengthened each year by our States, localities, and first responders \nwho request more resources to adequately protect those to whom they are \nentrusted. Yet for all practical purposes, the vast bulk of these \nreports and requests continue to fall on deaf ears here in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The funding level I am proposing in this amendment is over $16 \nbillion. It is a huge amount of money. I recognize that. It supplements \nthe approximately $4 billion that the underlying measure devotes to \nemergency responders and infrastructure security.\n  Together the bill and the amendment provide $20 billion in emergency \nresponder funding over the next year. Again, this is not my \nrecommendation. This is the recommendation of these individuals who \nhave spent a lot of time looking at the issue and believe this is what \nis necessary. In fact, they might argue for more because that \nrecommendation was made almost 4 years ago. So there is no factor built \nin for inflation or other costs that may have increased. I assume that \nnumber, if they were writing it today, may be larger. But I will still \nuse the number from 4 years ago.\n  I understand that the need for a budget resolution to set caps on \nappropriations bills. Effective budget resolutions are those that \nachieve balance. They curb reckless spending while providing sound \ninvestment in our domestic and foreign priorities. Unfortunately, I \ndon't find the current budget resolution and the caps it has imposed as \nbalanced at all. And while constraining our ability to invest \nadequately in our emergency responders and domestic security, the \nresolution is projected to increase the national deficit by $296 \nbillion in the coming year, principally because it seeks to make \npermanent tax cuts that are way too generous and that benefit primarily \nthe most affluent in society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 14 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. I will take another 5 minutes, if I may.\n  The report before us presents an uncomfortable reality that we have \nto face as a country. I certainly applaud the hard work that has been \ndone, as I mentioned earlier. Yet as the tragedy in India vividly \nshowed us on Tuesday, n nation, including ours, is invulnerable. We \nstill possess weaknesses in our domestic security and our domestic \ninfrastructure that must be strengthened. For over 3 years now we have \npossessed, in the form of the Rudman and Hart reports, a clear message \nfrom our most qualified experts that we need to do more to prepare \nourselves. And while I recognize that this amendment is expensive, this \ncost will pale in comparison if we are hit and unprepared to respond to \nit. This cost will be minor.\n\n  We all agree that $16 billion is a considerable sum. In fact, it \nrepresents roughly half the cost of the underlying bill. However, our \ncountry continues to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion every \nmonth in Iraq and Afghanistan, roughly a billion dollars a week. So we \nare talking about 16 weeks of investment, if you want to look at it in \nthose terms, in Iraq as to whether or not we ought to be talking about \nsimilar investments here at the local level.\n  This is funding that would not be wasted. The Rudman report clearly \nstates the need for more resources. The demands we hear from our States \nand localities and first responders clearly state the need is there. \nOur ports have identified $8.4 billion to meet Federal security \nrequirements. That is their assessment. Our transit agencies have \nidentified $6 billion to make trains and buses and other forms of \ntransit safer for passengers. Our firefighters and first responders \ndemonstrate over $4 billion in needs annually so that they may perform \ntheir critical duties more safely. That is the conclusion coming from \nour transit agencies, port authorities, and firefighters. Those are \ntheir recommendations.\n  Again, I have asked my colleagues in the past to be supportive. I \nhave not succeeded when I have offered this. But I offer it again \nbecause of what happened just a few days ago, halfway around the world \nin Mumbai, India. How many more times do we have to be reminded of what \ncan and is likely to happen here again and whether or not we will be \nprepared to respond to it.\n  Warren Rudman and the people who worked with him to make these \nrecommendations are serious individuals. These are Democrats, \nRepublicans, people who have served as distinguished public policy \nsetters over the last 25 years, from the Central Intelligence Agency to \nthe Secretary of State to the national security agencies. These are not \npeople who casually recommend the numbers they have. They studied the \nissue carefully. They believe it is the proper amount to request.\n  I am taking their suggestions, their words, their numbers, and \noffering to my colleagues an opportunity to take a report that is \nserious in its intent, serious in its proposals, and asking my \ncolleagues to endorse it by breaking down this cap and offsetting the \ncost by the means I have suggested.\n  At the appropriate time, if a budget point of order is raised, I will \nmove to waive that Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays so that my \ncolleagues can be heard on this issue once again. I hope that on a \nbipartisan basis we can say to our colleagues who chair the committees \nand the subcommittees, my good friend from Washington, my good friend \nfrom New Hampshire--they do a tremendous job in this area--but I think \nthe clear message from the Rudman report is that we need to do a better \njob. The American people expect nothing less. I will ask for a vote \nwhen that occurs.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe I have 10 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I am a great admirer of the Senator from \nConnecticut. He is obviously a significant force within the Senate. He \nhas a lot of good ideas. He thinks big. This amendment is another \nexample of that in some ways in that this amendment would cost $16.5 \nbillion. The bill we brought forward to the floor for Homeland Security \nis a $32 billion bill. What he is suggesting is that we increase the \nauthorized amount in this bill by half. It is for accounts which \nalready have a large amount of money headed in their direction, first \nresponder accounts.\n  We have spent, since we began this effort, over $14 billion on first \nresponders. Of that $14 billion, however, that was authorized to be \nspent, only $6 billion has actually been spent. In other words, the \nStates and localities, which have the right to this money, have put in \nplace plans to spend money for first responders, but they have only \nbeen able to plan in a wa that was appropriate to the point where they \nhave been able to use $6 billion. So we actually still have $8 billion \nin the pipeline before this bill is passed.\n\n  When this bill is passed, we are going to add another $2.4 billion to \nthe pipeline. So that instead of having $8 billion available to be \nspent, we will be up to approximately $10.5 billion that will be \navailable and it has not been spent.\n  Now the Senator from Connecticut comes along and says we need to put \nanother $16 billion on top of that $10 billion, when we already know \nthat the communities and States haven't been able to spend effectively \nthe money that is available already, plus the additional money that we \nare going to provide through this bill.\n  Yes, the Rudman Commission came forward with a series of proposals. \nQuite honestly, I am obviously a great admirer of Warren Rudman. He was \nmy predecessor, and he was an incredibly strong and effective Senator. \nHe has remained a significant force for a lot of good things, including \nnational security issues, intelligence issues. And his work maintaining \nthe integrity of the financial community has been exceptional. But the \nreport that they put together is a bit stale in many ways because of \nall the money we put in the pipeline. It is also a touch stale because \nif you really wanted to spend $16.5 billion on top of the money that we \nhave in this bill, I am not absolutely sure that I would put it on top \nof the money that is sitting there because it wouldn't get used that \nquickly.\n  If you really want to provide these types of resources and you want \nto raise taxes to do so, you might want to put it on the border, into \nthe Coast Guard, into intelligence. If you want to stop the next \nattack, the way you will stop it is through intelligence and through \nborder security, especially if you are looking at weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  There are things that need to be done that maybe could use some more \nresources. To put $16 billion on top of $10 billion which hasn't been \nspent yet and say you have solved some problem, I don't think solves \nany problems, quite honestly. I think it is a statement, yes. But these \ncities and towns in the next year aren't going to draw down the $10 \nbillion that is available to them so they are certainly not going to \ndraw down the $16 billion.\n  My view on the first responder issue has been that we put so much \nmoney in the pipeline that it is sort of like putting a fire hose in \nthe system. They haven't been able to handle the money yet. As they \nwork through the system and can handle that money, then we will put in \nmore money.\n  I am willing to raise first responder dollars, although we have done \na pretty good job in this account already with $2.4 billion. But I \ndon't want to use resources that can get me an instant bang for the \ndollar, such as putting a new Border Patrol agent on the border, which \nis what we have done, rather than put in a dollar that is going to sit \nin the Treasury for 2 or 3 years while communities get their act \ntogether.\n  I don't think from a policy standpoint this type of expenditure is \nnecessarily the priority I would choose. From a pure budget standpoint, \nlet's face it, this is the biggest increase I have seen proposed on \nthis bill. There have been others. Senator Biden proposed to add a \nbillion dollars of new money for rail transit, but this is $16.5 \nbillion. That is a huge amount of money.\n  The title of the amendment says it is going to be paid for by tax \nincreases. It doesn't say what tax increases. The Senator from \nConnecticut says we are going to be taxing the rich. The amendment \ndoesn't say it is going to be taxing anybody. Its title says it is \ngoing to tax. There is no operative language for taxes.\n  So it is actually not even paid for. It is not paid for under the \nterms of the\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\namendment. In my opinion, this type of tax-and-spend amendment is not \njustified, and it is very hard, in the context of the budget process \nand in what we have already done in these accounts, to justify. I \noppose it.\n  At the proper time, I will make a point of order against the \namendment as exceeding our budget cap. I don't think the policy demands \nit, and I certainly think the number is far out of anything that is \nlogical in the context of what we are trying to deal with relative to \nsetting up homeland security and making sure it is effectively pursued \nin this country.\n  At the termination of this debate, I hope we can get to a vote on \nSenator Vitter and Senator Dodd. We are waiting to hear from the other \nside of the aisle whether they are going to allow us to vote on Vitter. \nI think in the next 5 minutes we may have a couple of votes. We are \nstill awaiting word, for the information of our colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time\n  Mr. DODD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 14 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me quickly attempt to rebut my friend from New \nHampshire on these issues. I didn't make up these numbers. These are \nfrom our States and localities. They are telling us these are their \nneeds; it is not just in the Rudman report. Their request of 4 years \nago, based on the cost of items they thought were necessary then, has \nobviously gone up. Our ports identified $8.4 billion. That is not my \nrequest. These are serious people who are running our ports across the \ncountry. They need $8.4 billion to meet Federal security requirements; \ntransit agencies, $6 billion. That is what they are telling us they \nneed; firefighters, first responders, an additional $4 billion. Even by \nthe chairman's estimation, we are $10 billion short of what needs to be \ndone. I expect they are certainly making an effort, but it falls way \nshort of what we are being told are the needs across the country.\n  Again, I am prohibited from getting too specific about this. My \ncolleagues on the committee can make that decision. I think I am \ncorrect in that, but I suggest that if you were to ask patriotic \nAmericans who have incomes of more than a million dollars a year \nwhether they would be willing to forgo some of the tax break they are \ngetting--not a tax increase but some of the tax break they are \ngetting--to pay for this, they would agree.\n  We are spending $1 billion a week in Iraq alone. This is calling for \n$16 billion--16 weeks of what is spent for the effort in Iraq--to make \nus more secure at home. I don't hear any great complaints about the \nbillion dollars a week we are spending in that particular effort. Yet \nwe cannot find the resources to make us more secure at home.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of the amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to add my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe I have about 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to reiterate the fact that we \nalready have $8 billion in the pipeline. We are going to have $10.5 \nbillion, which has not been spent after this bill is passed. This \namendment is a $16 billion plus-up on a bill that cost $32 billion. It \nis a massive expansion. It will basically be going into an account at \nHomeland Security and won't be spent because they cannot spend the \nmoney they already have. It is a proposal that is simply not going to \nhave the policy impact the Senator hopes for.\n  I know the Senator has alluded a couple of times to how much we are \nspending in Iraq, which is an immense amount of money. But we have \nsoldiers on the ground in Iraq. We have equipment that has to be \nreplaced there. We are fighting a war in Iraq. So I am sure the Senator \nisn't suggesting that we take the money from Iraq and move it over to \nthe Homeland Security Department. I am just using that as an example. \nBut the war in Iraq is being fought within the context of the budget. \nIn this instance, this would be way outside of the budget.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and make a point of \norder under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act that the \namendment provides spending in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 38, nays 62, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 197 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). On this vote, the yeas are 38, \nthe nays are 62. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of \norder is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time what we are going to do--and I \nwill make a unanimous consent request to this effect--is we are going \nto recognize the Senator from Maryland to make two points on \ngermaneness: one relative to Senator Santorum's amendment and one \nrelative to Senator Kyl's amendment. At the conclusion, we are going to \nrecognize the Senator from Texas for up to 10 minutes. Then we are \ngoing to recognize the Senator from Maine for up to 20 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that what I have stated be the order.\n  At the same time, I further ask unanimous consent that while this \naction is pending, I not lose the right of priority relative to making \na second-degree amendment on the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator from New Hampshire did not provide me any opportunity to \nrespond to the Senator from Maryland. I would like 2 minutes to \nrespond.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would amend the request to have the \nSenator from Pennsylvania speak in response to the motion of the \nSenator from Maryland for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thought the request on this side was \ngoing to be----\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Maryland, in making his motion, will \nhave 3 minutes to debate them, or respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot object to that, but I ask that following the Senator from Maine, \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Kyl amendment.\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would ask the chairman of the committee, does he want \nto do the Kyl amendment first?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think that is probably a good idea, to do \nthe Kyl amendment first.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4643\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I make a point of order that Kyl \namendment No. 4643 is a rule XVI violation. It is legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And the amendment falls, I take it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the amendment does fall.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is now the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Santorum amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4575\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \nSantorum amendment No. 4575 is a violation of rule XVI. It is \nlegislation on an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as Senator Kyl and I discussed earlier, \nthis is an attempt to try to find an offset to basically increase the \ncap for this appropriations bill by finding an offset of a little over \n$200 million so we could fully fund the border security request from \nthe President, from the Department of Homeland Security, for 2,500 \nborder guards and increase the detention facilities to the amount that \nthe President requested in his budget. This amount comes from a \nprovision that lifts the cap on the number of reverse mortgages that \nwill be available to our seniors to help them provide for themselves \nwhere they have a high amount of equity in their homes and not a \nsufficient stream of income. So what this legislation would do is \nprovide that initial income by allowing more reverse mortgages to be \nauthorized from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Unfortunately, we did understand this is subject to a point of \ngermaneness, but this is good public policy, and it has bipartisan \nsupport. It happens to come up with basically the amount of money that \nwe needed to provide for both fully funding border guards and fully \nfunding detention facilities. So my hope was that--as is the case in \nmany appropriations bills--we set aside the issue of germaneness, and \nwe deal with the substantive issue, which is this is good public policy \nand it accomplishes another good public policy, which is to provide for \nthe border guards.\n  I am disappointed that the point of germaneness was raised. There \ncertainly is a point to be held here. I was hoping that it would not be \nraised and we could vote on the merits of the bill. I think it is an \nunfortunate occurrence, but the Senator has the right to make that \npoint of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have no problem with the purpose in \nterms of the program that the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to \nimplement, but I think this is a classic example of why we should not \nlegislate on appropriations bills. This cap was increased last year \nfrom 150,000 to 250,000 reverse mortgages for senior citizens. Yet, \nthere have been some reports of some concerns that there is a certain \namount of fee gouging taking place with respect to senior \ncitizens. This amendment would remove the cap altogether. It seems to \nme that there ought to be an effort to look into and address some of \nthese concerns rather than just further increasing the program.\n\n  This is an important program for senior citizens, and we are hopeful \nit is working. We have been testing it out. We had an original cap of \n150,000. Subsequently, this was raised to 250,000. The amendment also, \nof course, increases the loan limits. So there are some very \nsubstantive changes being made by this proposal with respect to this \nprogram. It seems to me it calls for the invoking of rule XVI and an \nopportunity to examine the substance of the program in a more careful \nway. That is the basis of raising the rule XVI point of order. I think \nthis fits classically into the rationale for that ruling being part of \nthe rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute. Mr. SANTORUM.\n  Mr. President, again I respect the Senator's right to do this. \nCertainly a point of germaneness lies here. I suggest this legislation \nis supported by every senior group of which I am aware--AARP, mortgage \nbankers, a whole host of other organizations that see this as a \ntremendous opportunity to help low-income seniors who have equity bound \nup in their homes and have no way to access that in an affordable \nfashion.\n  This is a regulated area. I know we had a hearing of the committee \nnot too long ago to look at this. HUD is concerned about fees, as the \nSenator from Maryland said. But they feel very comfortable that this is \na program which can and should be expanded. While it doesn't look as if \nwe are going to get this accomplished today, hopefully we can get it \naccomplished in the future. The House did adopt it in the TTHUD bill \nover in the House to help provide additional resources in the TTHUD \nbill in the House. Whether we get this accomplished here today or in \nthe House bill, I am hopeful this legislation can move forward.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say briefly, I hope in any effort to expand it we can \naddress the concern that has been expressed about fees, including by \nHUD itself, because, although this is a very good program and it is \nvery important to seniors, in the course of this program being utilized \nwe don't want to start drifting down the path of predatory lending--I \nguess I would call it reverse predatory lending. That is why I believe \nwe need to include that kind of analysis in any expansion of the \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday I offered a commonsense \namendment that would help secure our broken immigration system, at \nleast in part. This is an amendment which would have helped the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Border Patrol execute what is \nknown as catch and return--or expedited return--rather than the current \ncatch and release program that the Department has been engaged in when \nit comes to people who come illegally into our country from places \nother than Mexico.\n  Last year, 1.1 million people were detained coming across our \nsouthern border, and 250,000 of those--about a quarter--came from \ncountries other than Mexico. The fact is that South America, Central \nAmerica, and Mexico itself have become a land bridge for people from \naround the world seeking to come through our southern border into the \nUnited States.\n  The only way we are going to be able to begin to deal with this is to \ncreate a real deterrence that convinces people that if they attempt to \nimmigrate illegally across our southern border, they will not only be \ndetained but they will be returned to their country of origin without \nany delay.\n  Because of a lack of personnel and because of inadequate policies, we \nhave had what has literally come to be known as a catch and release \npolicy. In other words, people who come from Mexico can be returned \nliterally the same day. But if you come from countries other than \nMexico, it takes on average about 2 months to return those individuals \nto their country of origin because of the need to process the \npaperwork, get permission of that country to return the foreign \nnational to that country, and the like.\n\n  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael \nChertoff, has specifically said that this is a key to the success of \nour expedited removal program, which will finally allow us to create \nsome deterrence when it comes to fixing our broken immigration system \nand border security controls.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Chertoff's letter of March 27, \n2006, endorsing this amendment's approach be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Specifically what this amendment would do is deal with El \nSalvadoran immigrants who are the\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nsubject of the so-called Orantes injunction. This was issued by the \nFederal court in Los Angeles in 1988, and still exists today, which \ninhibits the Department's ability to use expedited removal when it \ncomes to Salvadorans. It is clear when you compare the track record for \nthe Salvadoran population as opposed to those from other countries that \nexpedited removal works. But for this injunction, which impedes the \nability of the Department to use the expedited removal, I believe we \nwould see a tremendous level of deterrence which would help, in \nconnection with everything else we are doing, to discourage illegal \nimmigration into our country.\n  The only reason I stand here today and am talking about this \namendment and I am not able to ask for an up-or-down vote on this \namendment and to implement this request from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity which will help us fix our broken border security system, \nwhich will allow us to use expedited removal, is because the Democratic \nleader sought, by use of a procedural motion last night about 6 \no'clock, to make a set of circumstances where we could not have a vote \non that amendment.\n  I think this is another test, a test of our will, a test of our \nnational resolve to fix our broken immigration system and to secure our \nborders. Unfortunately, due to the action of the Democratic leader \nyesterday, I believe that is a further indication that we are failing \nthat test.\n  The American people want us to act decisively to fix this problem. \nThey recognize this is a Federal issue, that only the Federal \nGovernment can deal with our international borders and provide the kind \nof security that will allow us to know who is coming into our country \nand why individuals are getting here. We know many of them want to come \nhere to work, to seek a greater opportunity. We all understand that on \na very human level. But the same porous borders that allow workers to \ncome across allow gang members, allow common criminals, \nnarcotraffickers, and, yes, even terrorists to enter our country \nwithout our knowing it only to do their mischief at a later time.\n  I believed it was incumbent upon me to come to the Chamber to explain \nmy deep disappointment in this procedural move that was engaged in by \nthe Democratic leader yesterday, which has denied us an opportunity to \nhave a vote on this important amendment, one endorsed by the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security and one which I believe is \nabsolutely essential to our restoring credibility to our border \nsecurity efforts by enabling our Border Patrol to use this well-\nrecognized mechanism of expedited removal and deterrence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 2006.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: Thank you for your support of critical \n     injunction reform legislation, which will significantly \n     enhance our ability to end ``catch and release'' of non-\n     Mexican illegal aliens apprehended on the Southwest border. \n     We urgently need Congress to pass this legislation so that we \n     can ensure that long-outdated court decisions do not \n     frustrate our efforts to secure the border.\n       We have made great strides in increasing the number of non-\n     Mexican illegal aliens detained for removal along the \n     Southwest border. Indeed, most individuals from Central and \n     South America, other than Salvadorans and family groups, are \n     now detained for prompt removal upon apprehension at the \n     Southwest border. But we are stymied in making further \n     progress because of a 1988 court order that has impeded our \n     ability to quickly remove Salvadorans caught after they \n     illegally cross our borders.\n       This 1988 court decision was issued at a time when El \n     Salvador was in the midst of a civil war and when immigration \n     was governed by very different statutes, yet it continues to \n     dictate our handling of Salvadorans. On November 17, 2005, we \n     fully explained to the district court the dramatic changes in \n     the facts and law that have occurred since the entry of its \n     perpetual injunction in 1988. We asked the district court to \n     lift its order in November, but we have no firm date for when \n     this process will reach its conclusion in the district court \n     or on appeal.\n       Other longstanding civil injunctions, including one that \n     was issued 30 years ago, likewise impede our ability to \n     effectively enforce the immigration laws. These district \n     court decisions have created onerous operating procedures \n     requiring the commitment of vast amounts of government \n     resources. They detrimentally impact immigration enforcement \n     on a daily basis and often frustrate our efforts. One such \n     other order has resulted in the creation of extra procedures \n     requiring substantial additional resources for routine visa \n     processing. Another injunction has resulted in certain \n     Freedom of Information Act requests being given priority over \n     other pressing work. Invasive court-ordered requirements, for \n     all practical purposes, hamstring the authority of the \n     President and the Congress over the borders. Yet the \n     conditions which gave rise to such requirements may have \n     changed.\n       Under current law and court procedures, it can be extremely \n     time-consuming and difficult to end these injunctions. With \n     this legislation, Congress will be taking significant steps \n     to ensure that we are no longer hostage to these old, out-of-\n     date, court orders.\n       Because of the urgent need, I strongly encourage you to \n     attempt to move this legislation both as free-standing \n     legislation and as an amendment to the pending immigration \n     bill. Without such legislation, we simply cannot end the \n     ``catch and release'' policy for illegal immigration.\n       Thank you again for your support of our efforts to end \n     ``catch and release,'' so that we can take a major step \n     toward complete control over our borders.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4634\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered last evening by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez. To me, this feels like Groundhog Day. Last year on this very \nbill the Senate debated exactly the same issues regarding the funding \nfor the Homeland Security Grant Programs. The proposal last year, with \nthe exact same minimum as the Menendez amendment, was soundly defeated. \nSenator Lieberman and I offered an alternative that was agreed to by a \nvote of 71 to 26.\n  The chart I am going to display explains it to our colleagues. The \nMenendez amendment would slash homeland security dollars for 36 States \nand the District of Columbia. It would take funding from 36 States and \nhand it over to 14 States--14 States that already receive more than 70 \npercent of the funding.\n  I am particularly surprised that this amendment is being offered \nafter the widespread criticism and outrage over the funding allocation \ndecisions by the Department of Homeland Security just a few weeks ago. \nI have told Secretary Chertoff that I believe he achieved what I would \nhave thought was impossible: he made both New York and the State of \nMaine equally unhappy with his allocation decisions.\n  Many of the advocates for this amendment criticized the way in which \nthe Department used its discretion to distribute funds. I share in \ntheir criticism. Their concerns are understandable, but their proposed \nsolution is absolutely baffling because it would give even more \ndiscretion to the Department of Homeland Security to decide, with \nvirtually no guidance, how to allocate these funds.\n  The Department has clearly demonstrated that it has a long way to go \nin perfecting a risk allocation methodology. Indeed, if you look at the \nrecent inspector general's report from the Department on critical \ninfrastructure, which was used in part to help determine these funding \nallocations, you will see that the Department has a very long way to go \nin coming up with a worthwhile risk-based system.\n  On that list of critical infrastructure was a petting zoo, for \nexample, an ice cream shop, a doughnut shop. This is part of our \ncritical infrastructure, absolutely essential assets? Yet the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Jersey provides virtually no guidance \non how a risk-based formula would work. By contrast, the legislation \napproved by the committee I chair puts forth risk factors that the \nDepartment should weigh.\n  The Menendez amendment simply hands the reins over to the same \nDepartment that was so widely criticized in its funding decisions. The \nresult of the approach of Senator Menendez will be that more funding \nwill be given out under a flawed and inexact methodology. That is \nexactly why we still\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nneed to maintain a healthy State minimum, to assure that flawed \ndistribution methods do not lead to gaps in our security system.\n  The minimum in the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, \n.25 percent, is simply too low. It slashes by two-thirds the Homeland \nSecurity grants that every State is now guaranteed. Under his \namendment, each State would be assured of only a little more than $2 \nmillion, for both the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the law \nenforcement program for this year. Compare that with a minimum \nallocation of slightly more than $7 million for fiscal year 2006 and $9 \nmillion the year before.\n  Again, let me emphasize this. Under the Menendez amendment, each \nState would be assured of only a little more than $2 million for \nhomeland security, prevention, and response needs. That is a 72-percent \ncut in guaranteed funding to each State. I encourage my colleagues to \ntalk to the emergency managers in your State, to talk to your first \nresponders, your police officers, firefighters, emergency medical \npersonnel, to find out what gaps in homeland security would be left \nunfilled if they faced such a sharp and massive reduction.\n  If we are going to become better prepared as a nation, each State \nmust receive a predictable and reasonable base allocation of homeland \nsecurity funding. States need a predictable base level of funding each \nyear in order to support multiyear projects such as creating \ninteroperable communications networks or first responder training \nregimes on a natural basis.\n  Risk-based funding, if distributed properly, certainly is important, \nand I support it and have proposed it. But it doesn't take away the \nneed for this steady funding stream so that every State can bring its \nsecurity up to a base level.\n  Let me give you perhaps the best example of the need for multiyear, \nsteady, predictable funding, and that is the interoperability of first \nresponder communications.\n  I am sure you recall, Mr. President, that the 9/11 Commission pointed \nto the lack of compatibility in communications equipment as \ncontributing to the loss of life on 9/11.\n  The investigation that the Senate Homeland Security Committee did \ninto the failed response to Hurricane Katrina demonstrated beyond any \ndoubt that there is still a major problem. We saw different parishes in \nLouisiana using incompatible communications equipment that slowed and \nhampered the response to victims.\n  The National Governors Association reported last year that 73 percent \nof States have not developed Statewide communications interoperability \nnetworks. That is a complicated, expensive and multiyear process.\n  That is exactly the kind of goal--the interoperable communications \nnetwork--that the steady, predictable funding from the Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program is designed for.\n  The National Governors Association during last year's debate wrote to \nme saying:\n\n       To effectively protect our States from potential terrorist \n     events, all sectors of government must be part of an \n     integrated plan to prevent, deter, respond and recover from a \n     terrorist act. For that plan to work, it is essential that it \n     be funded through predictable, sustainable mechanisms, both \n     during its development and its implementation.\n\n  It is important to know that current law requires States to develop a \n3-year homeland security plan. Multiyear planning is critical to \ndeveloping a successful prevention and response strategy. Yet, if we \nare going to ask States to plan 3 years out, we have to be prepared to \nguarantee them a predictable base level of funding.\n  When we talk about the significance of preventing the next terrorist \nattack, it is important to note that terrorists often stage their \noperations training and hideaway from their most obvious targets.\n  This hits home to those of us in Maine because two of the terrorists \nthat flew the plane into the World Trade Center on 9/11 started their \njourney of death and destruction from Portland, ME, a city of \napproximately 65,000 people. That is where they started.\n  Just think if they could have been apprehended in Portland and maybe \nthe number of lives that could have been saved.\n  As the publication of the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice notes, several of the terrorists involved in the attack had \nroutine encounters with State and local law enforcement officials in \nthe weeks and months prior to the attack.\n  If the State, tribal and local law enforcement officers are \nadequately equipped and trained, they can be invaluable assets in \nefforts to identify and apprehend suspected terrorists before they \nstrike. We must provide State and local law enforcement with the tools \nthey need to keep our country secure.\n  I note that it isn't only the two terrorists who started from \nPortland, ME that are good examples of terrorists hiding or training or \ntransiting through rural areas. The 9/11 Commission told us that two of \nthe terrorists, for example, were in Norman, OK, and others were in \nNorcross, GA.\n  All of these examples illustrate the vulnerability of towns and \ncities across America while highlighting the need for effective \ncooperation among all levels of government.\n  The Menendez amendment takes rational evaluations of need or \neffectiveness out of the distribution methodology. I hope my colleagues \nwill take a close look at the exact language of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Jersey. I think they will be very concerned by \nthat language if they do so.\n  This language factors out of the funding equation consideration of \nwhether an area actually needs funding or whether it has a plan to \nspend the funding effectively.\n\n  That is an invitation to waste, fraud, and abuse if ever I have heard \none.\n  The amendment would inevitably lead to more wasteful spending. It \nassures that we will hear about more cases of first responders' dollars \nbeing wasted.\n  For example, New Jersey spent a small fortune worth of dollars that \nwere supposed to go for homeland security purposes on air-conditioned \ngarbage trucks.\n  That is the kind of waste that we want to avoid. But when you take \nout any consideration of need, of effectiveness, of planning from the \nformula, that is exactly the kind of wasteful spending you are going to \nget.\n  The RAND Corporation recently cautioned us that homeland security \nexperts and first responders have cautioned against an overemphasis on \nimproving the preparedness of large cities to the exclusion of smaller \ncommunities and rural areas.\n  The report recognized that much of the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure--water plants, for example, or chemical plants and other \npotential high-value targets--is located in rural areas.\n  We all know of the threat of a terrorist attack on our food supply. \nThat is another example.\n  There are so many rural hospitals which have shown that they are \nunprepared. I could give you example after example.\n  But, surely, it makes no sense to give the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which has already proven that it does not have the systems in \nplace to handle an allocation that is based on the Department's \ninterpretation of risk--surely, it doesn't make sense to give \ndiscretion to the Department. But that is exactly what the Menendez \namendment would do. It would give more discretion. It strikes any \nconsideration of whether an area needs the funding, whether it has a \ngood plan for the funding, and whether the funding will be used \neffectively.\n  The Menendez amendment will hurt our national efforts to protect our \ncountry from terrorist threats. It will leave most States worse off. It \nleaves the District of Columbia worse off than under current law.\n  Under his amendment, each State would be assured of only a little \nmore than $2 million for both State Homeland Security Grant Programs \nand the law enforcement programs this year.\n  Again, I compare that to a minimum allocation of approximately $7 \nmillion last year and $9 million the year before.\n  Thirty-six States and the District of Columbia would be clear losers.\n  The Department would be given more discretion--discretion it has \nalready shown it cannot handle. And this amendment, because it does not \nconsider need and effectiveness and does\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\nnot set out criteria for the Department to use, would result in \nadditional wasteful spending.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont \nwishes to speak. I presume the Senator from New Jersey has 20 minutes \nreserved under the previous order. I believe the debate should go \nforward, but I wish it would go forward with the unanimous consent that \nI continue to reserve the right to protect my second-degree position.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the standing order.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I join my colleagues from Maine and \nConnecticut in opposing the Menendez amendment, which seeks to change \nthe formula for the State Homeland Security Grant Program. The chairman \nand ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee have fought \ntirelessly to ensure that every State is prepared for a major disaster.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of their bill, S. 21, the \nHomeland Security Grant Enhancement Act, which strikes a fair \ncompromise on this issue. This legislation passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming majority last year as an amendment to the FY 2006 Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. Thanks to Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, the Senate has taken a strong position on the need for a \nconsistent, guaranteed line of homeland security funding for each and \nevery state.\n  I strongly advocate the .75 percent minimum, which is guaranteed \nunder current law. Hawaii and every state needs to develop a \npreparedness baseline, so residents are cared for in the event of a \ndisaster. I fear that reducing the State minimum to .25 percent will \nseverely impact the homeland security preparedness and response \ncapabilities for much of the United States.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that the distribution of the \nmajority of homeland security funding should be left to the discretion \nof the Department of Homeland Security. However, we all remember what \nhappened in May when DHS rolled out its new risk-based funding model. \nNew York and Washington, DC took a huge funding cut.\n  After enduring a 30 percent cut, my home State of Hawaii received \nlittle more than what the current state minimum guarantees. I oppose \nputting the people of Hawaii at risk by reducing the legally required \nminimum any further Hawaii is an island state, 2,500 miles from the \nU.S. mainland, which requires us to be self-sufficient in the event of \na disaster.\n  As I said before, the Senate has already opposed the .25 percent \nminimum being debated today. I urge my colleagues to uphold that vote. \nI urge opposition to the Menendez amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would have hoped we could come \ntogether on this amendment. I do not consider it an effort to pit \nStates against States.\n  I heard the distinguished chairwoman of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity refer many times to the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission's \nunanimous bipartisan recommendation said all Homeland Security funding \nshould be driven by risk, allocation should be driven by risk and \nstrictly by risk.\n  Our amendment, however, does not take their conclusion, in \nrecognition that States have responsibility and needs, to the ultimate \nconclusion of all money should be focused strictly by risk. It \nrecognized that all States have some degree of responsibility within \nthe context of a Federal mandate. It says, as the administration has \nsaid, that it should at least receive .25 percent of all of those \nfunds. We are in line with what the 9/11 Commission said.\n  If we are going to quote the 9/11 Commission, then we should quote it \nin its entirety. Also, we are in line with where the administration's \nown recognition is.\n  In my mind, this is not small States versus big States, small cities \nversus large cities, rural versus urban. It is about risk. Very small \nStates can have very big risk. Ultimately, they would be--if their \nrisks are established as they believe them to be--beneficiaries at the \nend of the day with our amendment.\n  While the District of Columbia is obviously not a State, it is small \nin size and in population compared to many of the States of the Union, \nbut it has great risk because it is at the seat of our Government, with \nnational monuments and national landmarks. In fact, when it is driven \nbased on risk, it should do much better.\n  To suggest I would offer an amendment that would hurt my own State, \nas I saw on that chart, is simply not the reality.\n  I understand a number of small States, for example, face great risks \nfrom nuclear plants, to ports, to dealing with security risks at their \nborders. Those risks, if we use risk assessment, will drive where the \nmoney should go.\n  Of course, risk can change in the future, depending on the nature of \nthe threats we face.\n  Just as Members of this Senate are asked to support issues in the \nnational interest, such as supporting our agriculture, protection from \nhurricanes, help after flooding, whether those issues impact our \nparticular State, we and all Senators act in this respect in the \nnational interest to support getting our Homeland Security dollars to \nthe places at greatest risk. In fact, the Senator from Hawaii mentioned \nthe cuts to communities such as New York City. When it is not based on \nrisk assessment, that is the result we have.\n  I agree with those who have said that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity can do a far better job. We are in unanimous agreement with \nthat. I looked at the list of national critical infrastructure. I look \nat some popcorn factories, some petting zoos. Those are in this \ninfrastructure of which there is great risk. That obviously is not the \ncase.\n  Ultimately, we need a process that drives our limited resources to \nwhere the greatest risks are and where the greatest threat is. \nCertainly, I believe that allocation as the 9/11 Commission called for \nin a bipartisan unanimous report, looking at all of the equation of \nHomeland Security and intelligence reform, is the way we should drive \nthese moneys.\n  We are silent on effectiveness. We do not alter effectiveness as part \nof the equation. We stated so yesterday to the distinguished chairman \nof the Committee on Homeland Security when he asked us. As a matter of \nfact, our legislation says to the maximum extent practicable. It does \nnot undermine the very essence of making sure we have effectiveness. We \nwant effectiveness. But is there effectiveness when you are giving \nallocations of moneys for which there is virtually no risk in many \nparts of the country or a much lesser risk?\n  I hope those who come from small States but have big risks would \nactually be supportive of our amendment.\n  In my mind, I find it interesting there are those who continuously \nvote against the amendments that have been offered to try and raise the \nHomeland Security funding overall but suggest we should not distribute \nthe existing funding based on risk. In my mind, our amendment is \nactually about creating a standard in which all--large and small, rural \nand urban, regardless of what part of the country--receive a baseline \nguarantee but also receive those moneys needed to deal with risk. Any \nformula is always subject to, when there is an element that is to be \ndetermined on the basis of risk, how well the executive branch \noperates, but that is true no matter what. We need to keep the \nexecutive branch's feet to the fire and make sure that risk is truly \nrisk, not as we see on some of the lists given in terms \nof infrastructure in the country that clearly has no risk.\n\n  At the end of the day, to suggest we should have a general \ndistribution formula of Homeland Security moneys when the September 11 \nCommission unanimously said that is not in the best interests of the \ncountry, that is not the best way to protect the country, and \nultimately where those entities who complain they do not have the \nresources necessary to meet their homeland security challenge could get\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\ngreater resources if their risks are, in fact, established, is to \nundercut the very essence of their argument.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Senator Cornyn added as a cosponsor \nof our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Menendez to drastically cut the base allocation of Homeland \nSecurity grants for all States.\n  I heard the statement of the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nSenator Collins. I associate myself with her words. She has stated it \nfar more eloquently than I as to why this amendment should be defeated.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has the right concerns about the \nadministration's underfunding of first responder assistance programs. \nHis concerns are absolutely right. I happen to agree with him on those. \nBut he has chosen the wrong target to try to fix that problem.\n  Senator Menendez and his cosponsors are understandably outraged over \nhow threat-based Homeland Security grants were recently distributed. If \nit were not so serious a situation, the recent explanation by Homeland \nSecurity officials and how they distributed these funds would be \nlaughable. We are not debating the competence of Homeland Security. If \nwe were, we would hear all the statements of Homeland Security that if \nthere is a sudden terrorist attack, they are ready; had there been a \nsudden terrorist attack with no notice at all on New Orleans last year, \nthey are ready to do everything possible to help the people. Of course, \nwhen they had a week's notice before Hurricane Katrina, they still have \nnot responded. It is not their competence we are debating.\n  Yesterday, the Senate once again attempted to correct the Bush-Cheney \nadministration's woefully inadequate request for Homeland Security. \nUnfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from New York, Senator \nClinton, to restore $750 million for first responders' assistance, was \ndefeated. I had voted for that. I am sure the Senator from New Jersey \ndid.\n  Now we come to this amendment that purports to correct the blunders \nof the Homeland Security threat assessments by slashing the base \namounts to every single State in the country. Unfortunately, as the \nSenator from Maine has rightly pointed out, this amendment does pit \nState over State in how to divide inadequate overall funding for \nHomeland Security.\n  That is not the way to correct the incompetence of the Department of \nHomeland Security's determination of how to allocate grants based on \nrisk. It is the right issue; it is the wrong solution.\n  When the Senate last year considered a similar amendment proposing \nthis misplaced change in support for first responders, the Senate \nsoundly rejected it with 65 of our colleagues voting against it. The \nterrorist attacks of September 11 added to the responsibilities and \nrisk of first responders nationwide.\n  I wrote the all-State minimum formula as part of the USA PATRIOT Act \nof 2001 to guarantee each State receives less than 1 percent--actually \n0.75 percent of the national allotment to help meet the national \ndomestic security needs. Every State, rural or urban, small or large, \nhas basic domestic security needs and deserves to receive Federal funds \nto meet these needs and the new Homeland Security responsibilities the \nFederal Government demands. Large urban areas and high-risk areas have \neven greater needs, and they should be addressed. Both should be \naddressed.\n  I don't mean to be parochial, but my little State of Vermont, the \nsecond smallest State in the Union, is a State that borders another \ncountry. We are a State with a nuclear reactor. We have been called \nupon by the Federal Government to help out on border security, to help \nout because we are in a direct line from Canada down to two very large \nurban areas--Boston and New York. We are constantly getting requests to \nhelp. Our little State of 660,000 people, loyal Americans all, wants to \nhelp every way we can, but we are saying if we are asked to help out a \nwhole lot of other States, at least let us have some basic \nhelp. Whether it is going to require us to put in new radio systems, \ntelecommunications systems, or anything else, to protect not just us \nbut to help protect other urban areas, let us do it.\n\n  I would remind everybody, when we had the tragedy of 9/11, for weeks \nafter that happened, the air support over New York City, the armed \nresponse, the F-16s flying over New York City were flying out of \nBurlington, VT. Vermont provided people from our military, from our law \nenforcement, from everywhere else. We did not ask to be reimbursed, \neven though it cost us a lot. We responded within an hour. And it was \nthe Green Mountain Boys who flew over New York City, providing that \nsecurity at a time when nobody knew if there was going to be another \nattack. They did it around the clock. They did it with people canceling \nvacations.\n  We had one mechanic driving down the interstate with his family on \ntheir way to their vacation. He was a mechanic for the Air National \nGuard. He heard on the radio about the attack, and at the first place \nhe could do a U-turn on the interstate, he did. He headed back. He told \nhis wife and kids: Drop me off here; they are going to need me. I will \ncall you when I get my first break.\n  And 3 days later, when he had an hour's break, he called and said: \nSend me some clean clothes. Don't take me home. Go back to your \nvacation. Send me some clean clothes. He kept on working.\n  Now, every State would have done the same. We respond. But if you pit \nStates against each other, that ignores the real problem. The real \nproblem is the administration has failed to make first responders a \nhigh enough priority. Congress, instead, should be looking to increase \nthe overall Federal commitment to the Nation's first responders. We \nhave plenty of money to spend on Iraq's first responders. Let's spend \nsome of that money on the first responders of the United States.\n  The smaller States, especially, would never be able to fulfill those \nessential duties on top of their daily responsibilities without Federal \nsupport. My colleagues should be warned that if the minimum drops any \nfurther--and you compound that by the substantial drops in overall \nfirst responder funding--then small- and medium-sized States will not \nbe able to meet those Federal mandates for terrorism prevention, \npreparedness, and response. Again, if we can send money to Iraqi first \nresponders, let's find the money for American first responders.\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, we worked together in \nthe Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike, from large States and \nsmall States, and we have done it with the other body--to meet the \nneeds of all State and local first responders from rural and urban \nareas. Our fire, police, and rescue teams in each State in the Nation \ndeserve support in achieving the new homeland security responsibilities \nthe Federal Government demands.\n  The taxpayers in my State never questioned the fact that we would \nhelp in the disasters of Katrina or the disasters of 9/11. All States \nwere in this together. But representatives of urban areas have been \narguing that Federal money to fight terrorism is being sent to areas \nthat do not need it, that it is being ``wasted'' in small towns. They \nhave called the formula highly politicized and insisted on the \nredirection of funds to urban areas that they believe face heightened \nthreat or terrorist attacks.\n  What critics of the all-State minimum seem to forget, though, is that \nsince 9/11, the American people have asked all State--all State--and \nlocal first responders to defend us as never before on the frontlines \nin the war against terrorism--a war that will not end in my lifetime or \nthe lifetimes of the other Members of this body.\n  Vermont's emergency responders have the same responsibilities as \nthose in any other State to provide enhanced protection, preparedness, \nand response against terrorists. We have to ensure that adequate \nsupport and resources are provided for our police, our fire, and our \nEMS services in every State, if we expect them to continue protecting \nus from terrorists or responding to terrorist attacks, as well as \ncarrying out their routine responsibilities.\n  I understand the concerns of my friend from New Jersey. He is an \nextraordinarily able Senator, as he was\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\nan extraordinarily able Member of the other body. I have enjoyed our \nfriendship, and I have enjoyed the fact that we have worked together \nmany times. But I would say to him and others, do not foster divisions \nbetween States because that is going to ignore the real problem. The \nreal problem is that the President has failed to make first responders \na high enough priority. We should be looking to increase the funds to \nour Nation's first responders, not pit State against State.\n  We have seen cuts in State and local first responder formula grants \nin the Homeland Security Department by 59 percent--from $2.3 billion in \n2003 to $941 million in 2006. That is $941 million for all first \nresponders in America for the whole year. That is about what we have \nspent this week alone in Iraq. This week already we have spent about \n$941 million. That is what we are going to say we are going to spend \nfor the whole year in the United States to protect us and to give our \nfirst responders the money they need. Now, those cuts--those huge \ncuts--are going to affect every State, whether it is a small State or a \nlarge State.\n  We are looking at another year of subpar funding for our State and \nlocal first responders. For 2007, the President proposes a 52-percent \noverall cut, or $1.3 billion, in funding for State and local law \nenforcement agencies alone. That, incidentally, is about what we spend \nin 1 week in Iraq.\n  The Senate Homeland Security spending bill we now consider cuts both \nthe Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program by $50 million each over the current year. \nGrants for high-threat, high-density urban areas--such as the ones the \nSenator from New Jersey is rightly concerned about; these are what the \nlarger cities and metropolitan areas have been wrangling over in recent \nweeks--they face a $20 million cut over last year and a $140 million \ncut from 2 years ago.\n  These programs play a critical role for all States and communities \nfor the purposes of training, procuring equipment, planning, and \nconducting exercises. Clearly, the domestic preparedness funds \navailable are insufficient to protect our people and prepare for and \nrespond to future domestic terrorist attacks anywhere on American soil.\n  I am not saying we should not help the Iraqi people. I am saying, \nlet's give at least the same kind of priority to the American people. \nIt would be comforting if we could at least tell Americans their \nGovernment was doing everything possible and practical to keep them \nsafe. We cannot truthfully tell them that. There is much left undone in \nsecuring our Nation. That is why we are not abandoning the small- and \nmedium-sized States that suffer under this amendment. This came up last \nyear. The Senate roundly rejected it last year. I hope it will again \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise, reluctantly, today in opposition \nto the amendment offered by my friend from New Jersey. I agree with my \ncolleagues--certainly, with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator \nfrom Maine, and others who have spoken against the amendment--that it \nis not the right path for us to follow.\n  I will say this, though. I agree with my colleagues who do support \nthis amendment when they say that places such as New York and \nWashington, DC, are the most vulnerable to terrorist attack. \nUnfortunately, that is true. These are places that were attacked 5 \nyears ago on 9/11, and they are surely the targets foremost in the \nminds of those who want to do us further harm. Those places deserve \nmore first responder aid than other communities, including communities \nin my own State.\n  What my colleagues who support this amendment ignore, however, is \nthat communities across the Nation face some vulnerability to terrorist \nattacks as well. This amendment would cut first responder aid for all \nbut the largest communities by two-thirds or more. And with all due \nrespect, I do not believe that is responsible. I could stand here today \nand list all the places in my own State of Delaware that I think are \nespecially vulnerable. I will mention a few.\n  Delaware is home to some of the largest chemical companies and plants \nin the country. Right across the river, we have three nuclear power \nplants. They are closer to my home than they are to any of the Senators \nor the Governor of New Jersey, for that matter. We have I-95 that cuts \nright through my State, carrying all kinds of cargo, including \nhazardous cargoes. The Northeast Corridor of Amtrak runs right through \nmy State. We have two major rail lines, all of which carry hazardous \nand dangerous cargo from time to time. We have all kinds of shipping \ngoing up the Delaware River, which divides Delaware and New Jersey. The \ncargo it carries is dangerous as well. Frankly, a lot of it is an \nattractive target for terrorists, those who would do us harm.\n  And everybody else, probably, in the Chamber today, or those who will \nbe showing up to vote in a few minutes, could say the same. They could \ngo through a litany of similar kinds of concerns as to targets in their \nown States that would make them vulnerable, too. But that is not the \npoint of this debate.\n  This debate is about whether we want States such as Delaware or \nStates such as South Carolina or States such as Washington or States \nsuch as Arkansas or New Hampshire or others--that are represented on \nthe floor at this moment--whether we want our States to have the \nresources we need to achieve even minimum preparedness, goals that are \nset by the Department of Homeland Security for our country.\n  We will not be able to achieve those goals in Delaware and in a \nnumber of other States with the cuts that, unfortunately, this \namendment proposed by my friend from New Jersey would require.\n  From their inception, the State grant programs funded through this \nbill have directed some 60 percent or more of their resources to the \nlargest most vulnerable areas. And we should do that. In addition, the \nUrban Areas Security Initiative directs even more money to the largest \nmost densely populated cities. All of it is distributed based on \nvulnerability. There are not any cities in Delaware or in very many \nother small States that are competing for those funds.\n  What the amendment before us, regrettably, would do is tie the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's hands, forcing those who manage these \ngrant programs to direct virtually every dollar we appropriate in first \nresponder aid to a handful of States and larger cities. The Department \nofficials would have no ability to consider whether a State or city \nactually needs the money they are getting or whether a grant recipient \nis even capable of spending those dollars effectively.\n  As I mentioned before, I am all for giving the most vulnerable \ncommunities more money. We should. This amendment, however, takes that \nworthy goal, in my view, several steps too far, taking a significant \namount away from 36 States and, apparently, would even cut the \nallocation for Washington, DC. I do not think we want to do that \neither.\n  Every State has seen a decrease in first responder aid in recent \nyears, as money has been diverted to other priorities. I do not \nnecessarily agree with those decisions, but I certainly do not agree \nthe solution to this problem that this amendment before us suggests--\nthat is, to jeopardize the security of citizens in States such as mine \nand dozens of other States similar to it across the country--is the \ncourse we should follow.\n  I will reluctantly vote no on this amendment and encourage many of my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if there is no further debate on this \namendment--maybe the Senator from New Jersey wishes to respond, but \nupon completion of his response, I would suggest that all debate on \nthis amendment be deemed to have been completed and that at 12:45 we \nturn to an amendment from Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton; that we \nhave 30 minutes on that amendment, with 20 minutes for Senators Schumer \nand Clinton and 10 minutes in opposition, controlled by myself; and \nthat at the conclusion of that, Senator Sessions be recognized to offer \ntwo amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nask a question. Does that allow the remainder of the time I had \nreserved to be used by myself for the purposes of responding?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. And I believe Senator Collins has a little bit of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I could \nclarify, which of the Sessions amendments will be offered at 1:15?\n  Mr. GREGG. I cannot represent which ones. But he has five filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I believe my friends from New Jersey, \nNew York, others who support this amendment, and I share the same \ngoals: we want to ensure that those areas of our country that are \npredictably at higher risk of terrorism receive enough support to \nprevent and, if necessary, respond to attacks; we want to make our \nNation as a whole a safer place. Where I must respectfully disagree, \nhowever, is in how best to accomplish those goals. This amendment would \nnot do so.\n  In May, when the Department of Homeland Security announced its 2006 \nhomeland security grant awards, for States and also for urban areas, 48 \nStates and the District of Columbia found they had lost money from the \nyear before. Many of these States, Connecticut and New York included, \nlost substantial sums. This was not primarily because of a change in \nthe formula, however; it was because funding for these critical \nprograms had been reduced by 29 percent. Since 2004, these programs \nhave been cut in half, so there is increasingly less funding for all.\n  I was therefore disappointed yesterday to see the Senate reject \nSenator Clinton's amendment--which both Senator Menendez and I \ncosponsored--that would have restored some of this funding. The \nfundamental problem here is the shrinking pie, not how we divide it.\n  When Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, awards were announced, I, \nlike many others, was disturbed to learn that New York City and \nWashington, DC--the two cities that were the targets of the terrorists \non September 11th, and two that by any commonsense measure remain among \nthose at risk by terrorists--had suffered sharp, and seemingly \ninexplicable, cuts in their UASI grants. But this wasn't because UASI \nmoney is awarded to cities not deemed at risk. There is not now nor has \nthere ever been a guaranteed minimum or formula for UASI grants. Within \nthe UASI pot, one of the reasons that New York City's share went down \nwas because the Department didn't want its grants to be used for what \nNew York deemed to be an essential need: paying for law enforcement \npersonnel to staff its anti-terrorism efforts. This amendment does not \nsolve that problem.\n  Finally, as we should have learned--by now--the hard way, even in the \nbest of circumstances, risk assessment is at least as much art as \nscience. And I think most of us can agree that DHS's shifting \nmethodology for calculating risk does not represent the best of \ncircumstances. Thus we have learned that DHS has had trouble counting \nnational icons and government buildings and figuring out which \ninfrastructure really is critical.\n  I have also learned, in what will surely come as a surprise to my \nconstituents in Greenwich and Stamford, that according to DHS, \nsouthwestern Connecticut is not even considered part of the New York \nmetropolitan area. This despite the fact that 100,000 people each day \ncommute from Connecticut into New York, that major rail and commuter \nlines connect my state with New York, and that when the terror alert \nlevel is raised in New York City, additional Connecticut State Police \nmust be activated. And, of course, that on that tragic day nearly 5 \nyears ago, 67 Connecticut citizens perished in the World Trade Center \ntowers. DHS's risk assessment method, however, remains unable to \naccount for the additional risk and demands of being part of the \nConnecticut-New York-New Jersey tristate area. This amendment also does \nnot solve that problem.\n  The fact is, the Senate has already approved legislation \npainstakingly negotiated within the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee that represents a better approach. In S. 21 and in a \nnearly identical amendment to last year's Homeland Security \nappropriations bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 71 to 26--\nSenator Collins and I tried to balance support for cities and States at \nknown high risk of a terrorist attack without sacrificing the security \nof locations that have not suffered in the past, but very well could in \nthe future, and which are still critical to our preparedness and \nresponse.\n  While we provide more funding based on assessments of risk--we need \nto recognize that our intelligence is not perfect, that we do not know \nwhere or when terrorists will strike next, and that we must be on \nnotice they could strike anywhere. The fact is, terrorists alter their \nmethods of destruction. One day they may strike fortified targets such \nas military facilities, and the next day they may strike soft targets, \nas they did when they blew up a discotheque in Indonesia and took \nhostage an entire school in a small town in Russia. And how dare we \nforget what terrorists--though of the homegrown variety--did in \nOklahoma City in 1995 striking a target in the middle of our Nation's \nheartland.\n  Common sense, therefore, requires us to continue to build basic \ncapacity to prevent and respond to attacks wherever they may occur. And \nto build capacity over time, State and local officials need some \npredictability. They need to know when and how much assistance they are \nlikely to receive from year to year if they are to plan and execute \nhomeland security properly.\n  Were we to adopt the pending amendment, it would mean that each State \nwould only be guaranteed to receive slightly over $2 million this year \na nearly trivial amount and short sighted in light of the significant \nnational needs that we face. We know from Katrina that first responders \nwill need to come from all over the country to respond to a \ncatastrophic event, whether natural or manmade--and we need those \nresponders to be properly trained and equipped. We know, too, that the \nnext 9/11 attack on New York or Washington may be prevented by action \ntaken in a town far away, where terrorist plotters are discovered by \nlocal law enforcement. Those local law enforcement officers also need \naccess to intelligence, training, and resources to be most effective. \nIn the end, we cannot simply build a wall around a few known high-risk \ncities--it not only leaves the rest of the country vulnerable, but it \nwill leave the highest risk cities more vulnerable, too.\n  The problems with homeland security funding are urgent and real, but \nthis amendment will not solve them. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \namendment proposed by Senator Menendez.\n  While the Senator from New Jersey no doubt has the best of intentions \nin working to increase grant funding for high population areas, I do \nnot believe that reducing funding for the majority of States in our \ngreat Nation is a viable way to protect against terrorism.\n  If we, as a country, are going to be adequately prepared for another \nterrorist attack, we must not forget that we are vulnerable on all \nfronts. The 36 States that would be negatively impacted by this \nproposal contain some of our Nation's most valuable assets.\n  In reducing funding to States such as Kansas, this amendment tosses \naside the risks to agriculture that supports our Nation's food supply, \nthe oil and petroleum facilities that provide invaluable energy in this \ntime of need, and the many Federal buildings and places of national \nsignificance that are scattered throughout our great Nation.\n  We cannot let ourselves believe that if we only protect large cities \nand high population states, we will be safe from the devious and \ncalculating minds of those who wish us harm. One need only to look to \nOklahoma City in this regard. Rather, preparing for what we expect in \ndensely populated areas is a surefire way to be shocked and horrified \nshould the inexplicable and unthinkable happen again.\n  This legislation has been considered in this Senate before, and it \nwas defeated soundly. To add it now as an\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\namendment disregards the hard work many have done to negotiate a \nfunding formula that most benefits our entire country. We cannot afford \nto compromise the security of an entire Nation for the benefit of a few \nareas.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by \nseveral of my colleagues, the distinguished Senators from Vermont and \nDelaware. I agree with them that one of the core issues is overall \nhomeland security funding. There is no question about that. The No. 1 \nresponsibility, certainly, of the Federal Government and of government \nin general is to protect its citizens. We are woefully underfunding the \nability to protect our citizens, whether that is in the cargoes of our \nports or the cargoes underneath our airplanes, whether that is in the \ncontext of first responders, interoperable communications, whether that \nis in the context of mass transit.\n  Unfortunately, in the wake of London, in the wake of Madrid, and in \nthe wake of Mumbai, the Senate voted against amendments that ultimately \nwould have increased the funding so that those wake-up calls would \nnever be realized in the United States. That was the will of the \nSenate.\n  Several of my colleagues have actually made the case that their \nStates have very significant risks, whether that risk is a nuclear \npowerplant by a border with another country, whether that risk is \nchemical facilities right across the river, whatever those risks are. I \nfind it interesting that our colleagues have come to the floor to make \nthe case that they, too, have risks. We acknowledge that. We do not \neliminate all funding for all States. On the contrary. We guarantee a \nbaseline of funding for all States. But we say that the bulk of that \nfunding, as it has been time and time again, even very recently, \nsupported by Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton, the former chair and vice chair \nof the 9/11 Commission in a letter to House Members who offered \nlegislation that, among other things, would make sure that all homeland \nsecurity funding would be based on risk, as their unanimous bipartisan \nvote took place in the 9/11 Commission outside of the constraints of \nthe politics of the situation--they made that conclusion. They still \nsupport that conclusion. That is the very essence of the Menendez-\nLautenberg amendment. We understand. And we believe that those who have \nmade the case for risk should do better because they have real risks. \nThat is, in essence, what our amendment says. If you have the risk, you \nshould have the resources.\n  I agree with all of my colleagues who said they deserve to have more \nfunding to protect America and to protect Americans. That is certainly \nwhat I believe is the very essence of what we tried to do in the first \ninstance by taking that money which we do have and focusing it on risk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Obama be added as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 4594 \nto the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007. I \nthank Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd for accepting this amendment by \nunanimous consent. Before I describe this amendment, I would like to \nacknowledge the hard work and leadership of Senator Gregg and Senator \nByrd, and thank them for their diligence in coming to a consensus on \nthis crucial piece of legislation. The balance between enhanced \nsecurity and strong stewardship of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollar is \na fine one. I applaud your attention to both, and I support this \nlegislation.\n  The Emergency Management Performance Grant, EMPG, program is designed \nto provide State and local emergency management agencies with the \nnecessary funds to expand the development, maintenance, and improvement \nof their programs. It is the only source of Federal assistance that \nprovides vital emergency management, coordination, and planning support \nto State and local governments and first responders. It funds \npersonnel, training, and exercises. The program requires that States \nmatch 50 percent of the Federal contribution. According to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, EMPG funds are spent rapidly compared \nto other programs; in other words, if Congress appropriates additional \nEMPG funding, it will be used expeditiously, efficiently, and \neffectively.\n  Last year the EMPG program was funded at $185 million. In an effort \nto increase the sound management of homeland security funds, earlier \nthis year I asked the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security \nto increase funding for the EMPG program. I am pleased that 41 Senators \njoined me on this request. The Department of Homeland Security \nAppropriations Act of 2007 funds the program at $205 million.\n  While I am heartened by and thankful for the $20 million increase in \nfunding over last year's level, I feel strongly that the program should \nbe further increased. Accordingly, this amendment would increase the \nfunding of the EMPG program by an additional $15 million. I am joined \non this amendment by Senators Baucus, Biden, Burns, Cantwell, Collins, \nFeingold, Harkin, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Murray, Pryor, Roberts, \nSnowe, Stabenow, and Warner. I thank them all for their support. It is \nmy strong belief that an additional $15 million for the EMPG program \nwill enhance the effectiveness of every disaster relief fund dollar \ndirected toward response and recovery.\n  Since 9/11, the responsibilities of our first responders have \nincreased. They must now be prepared to respond to natural disasters, \nman-made disasters, and malicious acts of terrorism. We must support \nthem. With the enhanced responsibilities, and the tight budget \nconstraints currently faced by State and local governments, the \nflexibility provided by the EMPG program is vital.\n  I would like to describe some of the ways that EMPG funds help State \nand local governments. In Ohio and across the Nation, the emergency \npreparedness requirements have increased significantly since 9/11. For \nexample, according to a 2003 study conducted by the Emergency \nManagement Association of Ohio, approximately 10 percent of all \nemergency management employee time was spent on antiterrorism and \nhomeland security activities prior to September 11, 2001. By 2003, that \nfigure had shot up to 50 percent.\n  In addition, State and local emergency management agencies now are \nresponsible for the coordination and implementation of national \ninitiatives, such as integration of the National Response Plan into \nexisting emergency operations plans and implementing the National \nIncident Management System. The EMPG funds the extra manpower and \nmanagement support to help State and local governments meet these \nincreased responsibilities.\n  Furthermore, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many States have \nidentified the requirement to be to carry out mass evacuations in the \nevent of catastrophic disasters. Increased EMPG funding will help State \nand local governments prepare these contingency plans.\n  According to the National Emergency Management Association, EMPG \nfunds are used for a wide variety of purposes which vary State by \nState. In Alabama, EMPG funds play a critical role in helping the State \ndevelop its plans to respond to natural disasters, particularly \nhurricanes; grants are used for contingency planning, including \nevacuation plans, debris removal plans, and plans for postdisaster \ndistribution of critical assistance to those affected by the storms. In \nOregon, EMPG funds are used to upgrade key emergency operations centers \nfor counties that face large hazards such as wild land fires, annual \nflooding, and earthquakes.\n  Increasing the funding for EMPG would help some States do even more. \nIn Alaska, additional resources would be used to increase levels of \nemergency management personnel, which for some communities are \ncurrently only part-time positions. In New Hampshire, increased EMPG \nfunds would be used to address the areas identified in the National \nPlan Review as either ``insufficient'' or ``partially sufficient.'' \nThis would include statewide evacuation planning, surge planning and \ncapability, as well as further development of the State emergency \noperations plan.\n  In response to Hurricane Katrina, the EMPG program more than proved \nits worth. In a statement submitted to the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Homeland Security, Bruce Baughman, the president of the National \nEmergency Management Agency, gave the following description of the \nmutual assistance provided by the Emergency Management Assistance \nCompact, EMAC, which is funded by the EMPG:\n\n       EMAC enabled 48 states, the District of Columbia, the \n     Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico to provide assistance in the \n     form of more than 2,100 missions of human, military and \n     equipment assets and over 65,000 civilian and military \n     personnel and equipment assets to support the impacted \n     states. The nature of the nation's mutual aid system vividly \n     shows the need for all states to have appropriate \n     capabilities for all disasters and EMPG allows states and \n     local governments to build this capability both for their own \n     use and to share in through EMAC.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee conference report for 2006 concurred \nwith\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nthis assessment, noting that ``EMPGs are vital to state and local \nemergency management agencies.''\n  This year, the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee \nreport concluded that ``EMPG is an essential source of funding for \nstate and local emergency management,'' and that ``state and local \ngovernments currently have productive relationships with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency's regional emergency managers that are \ncritical to maintain an all-hazards response capability,'' and that the \ncommittee ``expects these relationships to continue.'' The subcommittee \nfurther noted that:\n\n       Additional federal funding is necessary to properly support \n     state and local responsibilities and coordinate with federal \n     emergency management during national disasters.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, State and local governments must be \nprepared. The EMPG program is a proven method of accomplishing this \ngoal. This amendment is both fiscally responsible and strategically \nsound.\n  I thank Senator Gregg for working with me to identify an appropriate \noffset for this increased funding. Once again, I applaud the efforts of \nthe Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, especially in light \nof the tight fiscal environment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4634\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \namendment offered by my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. I \nwant to make sure there is a clear understanding about what we are \ndiscussing. It has been said before--it is worthy of repetition--that \n700 of the almost 3,000 people who lost their lives on 9/11 came from \nthe State of New Jersey. The largest remaining share came from the \nState of New York. The region is connected by all kinds of interests \nand conditions. When we look at the region and see what happened with \nour State and the State of New York, in terms of resources from grants \nby Homeland Security, it is hard to understand.\n  We don't have sufficient resources for homeland security. I heard my \ncolleague say that earlier. We don't. However, whatever we do have \nshould be targeted to those parts of the country most at risk of \nanother terrorist attack. Here we see, once again, that our friends in \nthe Congress, our friends in the Senate are treating homeland security \nas another opportunity for additional resources. We are all resource \nstarved, every State. Why? The reasons are obvious. We are giving tax \nbreaks to people who don't deserve and, in many cases, don't want them, \nbillions and billions of dollars to the wealthiest among us. We have a \nwar, about which there is considerable question, that is costing us \nhundreds of billions of dollars. And by the end of this year, we will \nprobably be at the level of $500 billion, a half a trillion dollars. \nThat funnel keeps on taking money away from what we need at home.\n  Yes, we have to protect ourselves against terrorism from any part of \nthe world against American citizens. But we have a reason to believe \nthat on these shores of ours, within the boundaries of the United \nStates, we could lose lots more of our people and have our lives \ndisrupted much more than they have been. It is very uncomfortable. We \nspend a fortune in security funding. If you go to the airports, you see \nit every minute. If you go into large public buildings, you see it \nthere. Wherever you go, our lives have been inhibited in some way. Our \nfreedoms are curtailed by the threat of terrorism.\n  So we hear that our enemy has their guns loaded. What would happen if \nwe knew that there was going to be an assault coming from abroad on the \nNew York Harbor? Would we say: Don't defend that harbor; don't defend \nthose areas, New Jersey and New York, where they are at the highest \nrisk of terrorism facilities in the country? No, don't defend them? \nEven though the armada is on its way to New York Harbor, let's make \nsure that we take care of Wyoming and Nebraska and other States? No \nslight intended; they are all great States. But let's make sure we give \nthem money now because we are going to distribute funds for defending \nourselves.\n  Seven hundred people from our State--neighbors, friends, even family. \nMy oldest daughter's best friend died in the World Trade Center, \nleaving three children behind. Her husband searched hospitals for 2 \nweeks, refusing to accept the fact that she would no longer be in their \nlives, hoping against hope she would be discovered alive. Those stories \nwere repeated all over the area. The FBI has declared the 2-mile \nstretch that goes from Newark Liberty Airport to the harbor as the most \ninviting place for a terrorist attack in the country. Why? It is a very \ndensely populated area, with large chemical facilities that could \nendanger the lives or well-being of more than 12 million people.\n  To suggest that each State should be guaranteed a minimum I find hard \nto believe. I commend my colleague for saying: OK. Recognizing that if \nwe want to get this passed, that we desperately need to raise the funds \nfor those places most at risk, as mandated by the 9/11 Commission, then \nwe have to understand reality. It is politics. Every State wants to get \na little bit of the distribution. So let's reduce it from three-\nquarters of 1 percent to one-quarter of a percent as a minimum and \nallow more funds to be distributed among the States most at risk. It \nmakes eminent sense to me.\n  When we look out west and we see Wyoming, beautiful State that it is, \ngetting seven times more resources, more funding per capita than New \nJersey, seven times more, if there is a risk in Wyoming, it sure can't \nbe comprehended by seven times more distribution.\n  I recall, once again, for emphasis purposes, recommendation 25 of the \n9/11 Commission report:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities. Federal homeland \n     security assistance should not remain a program for general \n     revenue sharing.\n\n  Listen to that. Pay attention to this report. It was skillfully done, \nheaded by the former Governor of New Jersey, a brilliant public servant \nwho said that this is the way the program should be divided. Let's do \nit that way. Let's do it. Let's put the money where the risk is. That \nis what this ought to be about, nothing more. We have tried to arrive \nat a compromise position. I hope the Senate will support that position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4600\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 4600.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4600.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase appropriations for disaster relief, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 98, line 24, strike ``$1,640,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,941,390,000, of which $301,390,000 is designated as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 402 of S. Con. Res. \n     83 (109th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2007, as made applicable in the Senate by \n     section 7035 of Public Law 109-234,''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n20 minutes, which I will divide between myself and my colleague from \nNew York, Senator Clinton. I believe then the Senator from New \nHampshire will have 15 minutes, and, at some point, we will vote on \nthis legislation, probably around 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, I rise to offer this amendment to \nrestore more than $300 million in funding to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's disaster relief account. This\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nis the amount that the President had requested in his budget. So this \nis hardly an outlandish fee or a fee that came up out of our heads.\n  As we all know too well, our country has been visited by disaster far \ntoo many times in the last year. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \ndevastating wildfires in Texas, Arizona, and California, and now the \nrecent flooding in the Northeast, devastating New York as well as \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont, Maryland, and Virginia. Some of my \nstaff people, and I know many others, have had flooding in their homes \nin the Washington area because of that.\n  Unfortunately, FEMA has come up short every time. The Agency always \nseems to be on its heels when it needs to be on its toes.\n  With all of the trouble that FEMA has, we should not be cutting the \nfunding that goes directly to the people who are victims of these \nterrible disasters.\n  We have seen the disaster. We have seen the terrible flooding. We \nknow it is all too real. A week ago Friday, Senator Clinton and I \ntoured the affected regions in upstate New York and saw the enormity of \nthe flood and the work it is going to take to get it clean.\n  I will share this with you. We met a businessperson who started out a \nnew business and lived in the Catskill Mountains. He had been flooded \ntwice in previous years. The disaster relief official on the ground \nsaid the first two floods were 100-year floods, meaning that level of \nflood only occurred once every hundred years. This was a 500-year \nflood. This businessperson--dedicated like all small business people, \nbut they are sweating through all of this--was already loaned up and \nneeded more money quickly.\n  We met another business leader in St. Johnsville in the Mohawk Valley \nin Montgomery County, who started a new business and was the hope of \nthe county, with 100 new jobs. They had announced they were going to \nhave another 65 new jobs, but they were flooded out.\n  The Beechnut plant, the largest employer, suffered huge damage, and \nthe plant that makes baby food is not able to open. We visited the \nCanajoharie town hall, where all of the equipment was flooded and gone, \nincluding computers, phones, police department and fire department \nrecords--gone.\n  We were in Binghamton and Conklin, which was totally flooded, as was \nHancock and other places. We were told in one area in the Delaware \nValley that the rain cloud stayed and never moved for 16 hours at the \ntop of the mountain and the rain kept coming down.\n  We met an older gentlemen whose 15-year-old daughter was in their \nhouse by the creek bank. The creek turned its course and pushed the \nhouse into the water, and she died. We saw that damage firsthand.\n  The damages are going to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. \nJust alone, the sewage plant in Binghamton was destroyed, a brandnew \n$20 million plant, gone.\n  The physical damage to farms is enormous. As we flew over the \nCatskill Mountains, in the Delaware Valley and the Mohawk Valley, you \ncould see farms flooded--the whole farm. The corn was gone. We saw dead \ncows, which is the life blood of these farms, including the dairy. Crop \nlosses are estimated to be $20 million.\n  So the damage was enormous. The damage was everywhere. It is unlike \nanything we have ever seen in New York.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It restores more than $300 million in \nfunding for FEMA's disaster relief account, bringing it back up to the \nPresident's request of $1.9 billion. Under this program, FEMA gives \nthree types of assistance desperately needed: Individual assistance \ngoes to individuals and households. This helps disaster victims find \ntemporary housing, pay for rent, home repair, and even home replacement \ncosts.\n  In these three areas, the Susquehana Valley, Delaware Valley and its \ntributaries, and the Mohawk Valley, there are still homes being \ncondemned as we speak. The people who lived in those homes for decades \nor for generations will never be able to go back. This assistance is so \nimportant to them.\n  Second is public assistance, which is aid to public entities for \nreimbursement for emergency services and the repair or replacement of \ndisaster-damaged public facilities such as roads, bridges, and water \nfacilities. One town supervisor told us that their whole budget for \nroads--the whole yearly budget--was gone in 3 days. They don't know how \nthey are going to repair the roads that are still broken and damaged.\n  It didn't just occur to smaller roads. I-88, one of the most \nimportant lanes of commerce in our State, running from Albany to \nBinghamton, had a huge chasm in it. That was on the front page of most \nnewspapers. Some truck drivers died as they fell into that chasm. We \nneed that to help our towns, villages, and counties, get back.\n  Third, there is hazard mitigation assistance which helps local \ngovernments protect against future disasters and reduce future losses \nto public and private property. In this era of changing climate, when \nwe have had disasters afflicting us year after year, hazard mitigation \nassistance is very important.\n  In our State, as in our neighboring States, people are struggling. \nThere is nothing like seeing that damage firsthand and looking into the \neyes of people who have lost loved ones or homes or businesses. You see \nthat the only hope they have is that the Federal Government will come \nforward.\n  We know that FEMA didn't do the job in New Orleans. We know it is \ngoing to be difficult for FEMA to get the money quickly and in large \namounts to the areas in our State where they are needed. But the one \nthing we also know is that FEMA should not be able to say they don't \nhave the dollars. Right now, with the cuts that are proposed in this \nbudget, we cannot be sure of that.\n  So many people are struggling in New York and around the country and \nwe should be mobilizing the full resources and wherewithal of the \nFederal Government, not cutting back. This is one area where there is \nvirtually universal agreement that it is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility--disaster relief.\n  Today, it is raining again in upstate New York. People are worried \nabout the flood waters rising once again. We have to do everything in \nour power to help them and give them the assistance they need to \nrebuild stronger than ever.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, and I yield the remaining \ntime to my colleague from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, my colleague has eloquently described \nthe damage and devastation that he and I visited together last week.\n  Floods are biblical. They go back as far as human history is \nrecorded. But I never cease to be amazed at the damage they cause. \nThere is something about a flood that is so devastating. It leaves \nbehind places that are destroyed because of mold. It ruins businesses \nand homes. It leaves a residue of mud and muck and debris. It is a \ndemoralizing, debilitating disaster.\n  As Senator Schumer and I traveled from Binghamton north, we saw \nfirsthand people coping and trying to figure out what was next--\nbusinesses that lost everything and don't know how they will ever get \nback into business, homes that were washed into rivers and creeks, city \nhalls and fire departments and police departments with records that \nwere obliterated in an afternoon.\n  Now, if this were a once-in-a-hundred-years phenomenon, maybe I would \nnot be so worried, but time and again we have heard that there have \nbeen 3 floods in this area of New York in the last 24 months, 2 of \nwhich were classified as 100-year floods, 1 of which was classified as \na 300-year flood. We are beginning to see the effects that were \npredicted by the National Hurricane Center earlier this year. We had \neven seen our National Archives, which holds our most precious founding \ndocuments, like the Constitution and Bill of Rights, fighting back the \nfloodwaters, trying to preserve America's history.\n  Just last night in the county I live in in New York, tornadoes were \nspotted. That is very unusual. I lived for a number of years in \nArkansas. We saw tornadoes all the time. I have been chased\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nby a tornado. I have seen them on the horizon. I have lived with \ntornado damage. I visited many devastated communities. But tornadoes \nwere not thought to affect States like New York. New York was hurricane \nterritory, not tornado territory. Last night, we had a tornado.\n  The strange weather that we are experiencing is out of the usual, and \nI hope that we can get the help we need and that the amendment that \nSenator Schumer and I have proposed will be passed so that we can \nreplenish the disaster fund with the amount of money that we know will \nbe needed to take care of the people we represent in New York.\n  There was similar damage in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and \napparently there is more to come. We have had predictions that the 2006 \nAtlantic hurricane season outlook is expected to be 80 percent above \nthe normal in the number and intensity of hurricanes.\n  We all know of the damage that occurred along our Gulf coast. But \nthere are predictions of significant storms along the Atlantic coast up \nto and including New York for the rest of this summer and into the \nfall.\n  We need to get ready. That is why this amendment makes such good \nsense. All that it asks is that we restore the money the President \nasked for in his budget. That money was cut. We want to add and \nreplenish the disaster relief fund to the tune of $300 million so that \nthere is $1.94 billion in that fund to help us meet the needs of New \nYorkers and others who are being afflicted by this unusually severe \nweather.\n  Fully funding that disaster relief fund is one way to ensure that \npeople know there is going to be help on the way. It is demoralizing \nenough--I saw it on the faces of people as I walked the streets of \nCanajoharie and saw everybody in shorts and flip-flops and T-shirts \nshoveling out the public library or the boys and girls club across the \nstreet or the businesses up and down Main Street or the Beechnut plant.\n  It is demoralizing enough to try to figure out how you are going to \nrecover from a flood. Let's not add to that sense of despair by sending \na message that the Federal Government isn't prepared to help.\n  We learned a lot from the disasters of our response to Katrina and \nRita, and I hope we will have unanimous support to replenish the \ndisaster relief fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lieberman be \nadded as a cosponsor to the Schumer-Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purpose of calling up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I was assured there would not be an \nobjection. This is for the purpose of bringing up an amendment but not \ncalling for a vote on it at this time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4582\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4582.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4582.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security \n (Transportation Security Administration) from removing any item from \n   the current list of items prohibited from being carried aboard a \n                          passenger aircraft)\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security \n     (Transportation Security Administration) shall not modify the \n     list of items prohibited from being carried aboard a \n     passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air \n     carrier in air transportation or intrastate air \n     transportation set forth in section 1540 of title 49, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, so as to permit any item contained on \n     the list as of December 1, 2005, to be carried aboard a \n     passenger aircraft.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this is an amendment which addresses the \nconcerns raised by the Transportation Security Administration lifting \nthe prohibition of passengers carrying onto our passenger aircraft \nsharp objects, including knives.\n  There is a considerable debate, led by the airline attendants and \npilots, as to the wisdom of this rule being lifted. I ask the Senate to \nconsider whether this is a good idea. We have been so successful in \nnearly 5 years in avoiding incidents on our airlines, in keeping our \npeople safe on our airlines. If it ain't broke, why fix it?\n  This rule has worked. People are used to the rule. My goodness, we \nhave had security people take steak knives out of people's handbags and \nsuitcases. We have had them take out huge pen knives and switchblades. \nWhy do we want to go back to that?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sorry, I did not hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is to set aside the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4600\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask that we return to the pending \nbusiness of the Schumer-Clinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, speaking to the Schumer-Clinton amendment, \nI wish to simply make the point that obviously all of us in the \nNortheast have experienced these very severe weather conditions which \nhave led to floods. In New Hampshire, we are a little bit ahead of New \nYork, regrettably. We had a huge storm earlier that led to major \nflooding throughout the State.\n  I have to congratulate FEMA for their response. They have been very \nprompt. They have been on top of it. People who have made requests for \nreimbursement pursuant to the disaster declarations have received those \nfunds, and we are getting a very effective and efficient response \nthroughout New England, which all of New England was impacted, \nespecially Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\n  I know New York has gone through this experience, and, of course, the \ncity of Washington has. I understand the Senators from New York wanting \nto make a point relative to the importance of having the resources to \nmake sure when this type of disaster occurs there is money available to \naddress the concerns of the communities that have been hit and the \nindividuals who have been hit.\n  This amendment, as it is presently structured, is not going to have \nany impact on the New York problem that exists today. That will be \naddressed by money that is already in the pipeline, that is in the \ndisaster relief fund. The disaster relief fund has a very robust amount \nof money in it. It has $9.3 billion in it right now. This bill \naddresses 2007 disaster activity. This bill has a number of $1.6 \nbillion which will be added to whatever is left at the end of the 2006 \nyear of the $9.3 billion as the resource available to FEMA.\n  So as a practical matter, the amendment which the Senators from New \nYork have offered will have no impact on the very compelling anecdotal \nstories that have been put forward relative to the damage to the New \nYork communities. Those communities and the individuals affected by \nthis event will be looking to FEMA, which has resources which are \nalready in the pipeline which will be available for them to assist the \npeople who have been impacted. The money will be there. The New York \ncitizens will get the money they need out of the $9.3 billion which is \nin the disaster relief fund.\n  What this amendment does is declare an emergency and add another $300 \nmillion to this bill, which is essentially outside of the budget. So I \nreally don't think it is necessary at this time--in fact, I know it is \nnot necessary at this time, and I know it is not going to impact the \nimmediate New York situation. It just is not. It raises the bigger \nissue of what should be the number\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\nthat we put into the disaster relief fund in one of these bills.\n  It almost is a Ouija board exercise on this committee to figure out \nwhat number we put into this account because some years disasters will \nbe significant and some years they won't. The last year and a half, we \nhave dealt with the Katrina event, which was more than significant--it \nwas horrific last year, and that was an aberration, we all sincerely \nhope--certainly the Presiding Officer hopes that--but that has caused \nus to have to spend over $100 billion on disaster relief.\n\n  Whatever we put in this account is really just a guess, and until we \nsee the actual events that are brought upon the Nation relative to \nnatural disasters, how much money this account is going to need will \nnot really be known.\n  What we have shown as a Congress--and I think we have shown it rather \naggressively time and again--is that when a disaster does occur which \ndoes qualify for FEMA funds and the disaster relief fund needs dollars, \nwe act in a very prompt and aggressive manner. In fact, one can argue \nthat in the Katrina situation, we put so much money in the pipeline so \nfast that a lot of it was not effectively used. That has been our \nhistory. I think that is actually the way to approach it.\n  I have often thought about whether we should just put a lot of money \nin there and let it sit and wait for the disaster. We could do that, \nbut as a practical matter, that is not a good use of taxpayers' \ndollars. It makes much more sense, if we have a terrible disaster, if \nwe have floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes that create a declaration of \ndisaster, that we make sure we have enough money in the disaster relief \nfund to meet the immediate needs, and if it needs more, we can come \nback and do it under emergency declaration.\n  There is no question there is enough money in the relief fund to take \ncare of all the disasters we know about, with potentially the exception \nof Katrina, which is being handled outside the relief fund for the \nreconstruction of the gulf coast. There is no need to put any more \nmoney in this account. Certainly, if we put more money in it at this \ntime, it will have no impact on an event that occurred a month ago or \nan event that occurs tomorrow or occurs up until the end of September \nbecause this money will not be available until October 1.\n  So this amendment is a statement, I understand that, of concern by \nthe Senators from New York, and as representatives of the State of New \nYork, I can understand their desire to get on record with such a \nstatement. But at the appropriate time, I will make a point of order \nagainst it because it is an expense which we should not incur at this \ntime for the reasons which I have outlined.\n  For the edification of our Members, my hope is--and I have talked \nwith the Senator from Washington about this--my hope is that after \nSenator Sessions offers his amendments--and my understanding is that he \nwill be here shortly to do that--we will be able to vote on four \namendments. That would be an amendment by Senator Menendez, an \namendment by Senators Schumer and Clinton, and the two Senator Sessions \namendments. I hope those votes will get started soon after Senator \nSessions has completed his presentation and when anybody who wishes to \nrespond to him has done so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4582\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside. I wish to comment briefly on amendment No. 4582, which I \nunderstand would reverse the Transportation Security Administration's \ndecision to remove small scissors and tools from the prohibited items \nlist.\n  I understand we want to take every precaution when it comes to \nsecurity on our airplanes, in our ports, and on our trains, but this is \na case where I think the Administrator of the TSA has been trying to do \nthe right thing.\n  In my opinion, one of the problems with TSA is we have given them \ntons of money, we have demanded and expected all kinds of security \ninstantly, and it has created certain problems. We should focus our \nmoney more wisely. I think the Transportation Security Administration \nshould focus on higher priorities. They have been willing to do that.\n\n  I have talked to the Administrator, Kip Hawley, several times about \nwhat they are trying to do. This is an issue which does have \njurisdiction in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on \nwhich I serve. Frankly, I commended him, privately and publicly, for \nbeing willing to take some of these things off the list. How many of \nyou have been through these outrageous processes that you have to go \nthrough or have had to go through to get on airplanes? How many times \nhave I been ripped off of scissors or small pocket knives that are no \ndamage at all? I just went ahead and bought them by the dozen. I mean, \nthis is not going to an airplane take.\n  So common sense is what I have asked the TSA to use: Use your head. \nMy goodness, is this a weapon? It looks pretty dangerous. It is a \nballpoint pen. So it is time we have some common sense at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, at the Transportation Security \nAdministration. How many times am I going to have to take off my shoes \nbecause one guy tried to light the heel of his shoe? How long is it \ngoing to take us to get technology that makes these frisking processes \nwe go through make sense?\n  Look, the American people don't mind being a little inconvenienced or \nbeing delayed a little bit if it makes sense. But I am telling you, I \nhave warned TSA: This is one of the examples where you have a problem \nbecause Senators in this instance are like everybody else; when we get \non a commercial airplane, we have to endure the same inconveniences and \nembarrassments and ridiculousness as everybody else.\n  So I really do oppose this amendment. I think TSA is trying to do the \nright thing. I go back to what I was talking about a while ago. \nSenators and Congressmen, you are in a line with your constituents; \nwhat are they saying to you? They are ripping us because some of the \nridiculousness they have to go through they don't really think makes an \nairplane or train or whatever more secure.\n  So I just hope we will not pass this amendment. I believe the TSA has \ndone the right thing, and I hope they will continue to make it less \ninconvenient, while making it more secure. Focusing on things that \nreally are a danger will allow them to do a better job where it \nmatters.\n  I just wanted to raise this point of view with regard to the decision \nby TSA and to object to the amendment that is pending. I hope to focus \non this issue and talk about it responsibly among ourselves and with \nthe Transportation Security Administration--that is good, but I think \nit would be a mistake to reverse these items which have been taken off \nthe list.\n  Mr. President, I understand there are other speakers who may be in \nthe area, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, today I offer an amendment cosponsored \nby Senator Levin and Senator Baucus that will require U.S. Customs and \nBorder Patrol to charge inspection fees to Canadian shippers who export \nmunicipal solid waste into Michigan in order to pay for truck \ninspections. My amendment would impose approximately a $420 fee on \nevery trash truck that crosses into Michigan.\n  In 2003, the city of Toronto started shipping 100 percent of its \ntrash to Michigan. The result? Every day, 350 trucks carrying trash \nfrom Toronto enter Michigan on their way to Michigan landfills. But \nthey don't just carry trash. In recent years we have found illegal \nmedical waste, including radioactive materials, and illegal drugs and \ncurrency. There is no limit to what could be smuggled in these trucks.\n  In February, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general \nreleased a report that I requested with Senator Levin and Congressman \nDingell. The inspector general found that trash trucks are extremely \ndifficult to inspect and carry dangerous waste. The report also points \nout that trash trucks are difficult to screen with traditional x-ray \nequipment and must be physically inspected to verify their contents. \nFinally, the report states that it is virtually impossible to find \ndangerous items because of limited resources for conducting time-\nintensive physical inspections.\n  The people of Michigan know exactly what kinds of dangerous materials \nare in these trash trucks. Over the past few years, we have seen \nnumerous examples. Customs officials seized nearly 1 ton of illegal \ndrugs hidden inside a Canadian trash truck that entered the U.S. from \nToronto over the Blue Water Bridge. A Canadian trash truck arrived in \nMichigan dripping blood because it contained broken bags of untreated \nblood and hospital waste in direct violation of Michigan and Ontario \nlaw requiring medical waste to be placed in secure containers separate \nfrom other waste. A trash truck that was on fire attempted to cross the \nBlue Water Bridge, requiring 8,000 gallons of water and valuable local, \nState, and Federal resources before it was finally doused. Most \nrecently, a Canadian trash truck spilled sewage sludge across a main \nthoroughfare of Huron Township closing the road for hours and diverting \nvaluable local resources for the cleanup.\n  These outrageous incidents and the inspector general's report led me \nto offer an amendment to the fiscal year 2007 budget resolution that \nwas unanimously accepted by the Senate. My amendment assumes $45 \nmillion a year in Federal funds that would be collected by charging \nCanadian trash shippers an inspection fee as they enter Michigan. The \ncollected fees will pay for the increased personnel costs associated \nwith increasing the number of physical inspections of trash trucks, \nensuring that taxpayers are not on the hook to pay the costs for \ninspecting these dangerous trash shipments.\n  Based on information provided by the inspector general, we know that \nit will take four Customs agents about 4 hours for each trash truck \ninspection. Based on personnel and administrative costs, we estimate \nthat the fee for each trash truck will be approximately $420.\n  The next step is to ensure that Customs can actually collect these \nfees. The amendment I am offering today does exactly that.\n  On March 30, the Committee on Homeland Security's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations released a report called ``An Assessment \nof U.S. Efforts to Secure the Global Supply Chain.'' This report \nincludes a section on Canadian trash shipments.\n  The subcommittee report states that it is ``inherently difficult and \ndangerous to physically inspect trash containers.'' Furthermore, the \nsubcommittee recommends that Congress ``enact into law the provisions \nrecently adopted by the U.S. Senate to impose a fee on international \nshipments of trash to pay for a more rigorous inspection regime to \nprotect U.S. citizens from the security risks currently associated with \ntrash containers.''\n  This is what the amendment that I am offering today does: establishes \nthe inspection fees that the Senate already approved in the budget \nresolution.\n  We need to give Customs the resources to more effectively screen and \ninspect them.\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to make some remarks and discuss the two \nreports I previously mentioned in order to provide some legislative \nhistory and intent of my amendment No. 4657, that the Senate just \nadopted.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations' March report, among \nother things, analyzed the unique security risks posed by the \nimportation into the United States of cargo containers carrying trash.\n  The report points out that the importers of consumer products, by \ncontrast, have more control over the specific content and the origin of \nthe imported products, making it easier to\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\ntake steps to monitor and ensure the security of the supply chain. \nThere are few, if any, security measures in place to screen trash or \nensure that trash does not conceal illegal or harmful materials, such \nas weapons or nuclear material.\n  Growing imports of trash present an increasingly serious security \nproblem. For example, according to the Senate report, Canada shipped \nroughly 100,000 containers of trash across U.S. borders into Michigan \nin 2004 alone, an 8-percent increase over 2003. Another 10,000 \ncontainers of trash come through nine other ports of entry on both the \nnorthern and southern borders of the United States each year.\n  The inspector general's report found that from 2003 to 2004, tons of \nillegal drugs and millions of dollars in illegal currency have been \ntransported into the United States in trash containers, among other \nforbidden cargo. The Senate report concluded that the Department of \nHomeland Security should ban imports of trash into the United States \nentirely until the Secretary of Homeland Security ``can ensure that the \nsupply chain of a trash importer is secure or develops protocols \nensuring adequate inspections of individual trash containers.''\n\n  In order to pay for more rigorous inspections to protect people in \nthe United States from the security risks currently associated with \ntrash containers, the Senate report recommended enacting into law a \n``fee on international shipments of trash.''\n  In my amendment, the shipments that would be more rigorously \ninspected would be in the Customs Territory of the United States, which \nhas the meaning given the term in the general note 2 of the Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States.\n  Also, the term ``municipal solid waste'' means all waste materials \ndiscarded for disposal by households, including single-family and \nmultifamily residences, and hotels and motels; and all waste materials \ndiscarded for disposal that were generated by commercial, \ninstitutional, municipal, and industrial sources, to the extent such \nmaterials are essentially similar to what I just described and were \ncollected and disposed of with other municipal solid waste previously \ndescribed as part of or normal municipal solid waste collection \nservices, except that this does not apply to hazardous materials other \nthan hazardous materials that, under regulations issued under section \n3001(d) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act are not subject to regulation \nunder subtitle C of that act.\n  The term ``municipal solid waste'' includes food and yard waste, \npaper, clothing, appliances, consumer product packaging, disposable \ndiapers, office supplies, cosmetics, glass and metal food containers, \nhousehold hazardous waste, and debris resulting from construction, \nrepair, or demolition of structures.\n  The term ``municipal solid waste'' does not include any solid waste \nidentified or listed as a hazardous waste under section 3001 of the \nSolid Waste Disposal Act, except for household hazardous waste; any \nsolid waste including contaminated soil and debris resulting from a \nresponse action taken under the section 104 or 106 of the Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, a \nresponse action taken under a State law with authorities comparable to \nthe authorities of such section 104 or 106 or a corrective action taken \nunder the Solid Waste Disposal Act.\n  It also does not include recycled materials that have been separated, \nat the source of the waste, from waste otherwise destined for disposal \nor that have been managed separately from waste destined for disposal; \nscrap rubber to be used as a fuel source; materials and products \nreturned from a dispenser or distributor to the manufacturer for \ncredit, evaluation, and possible reuse, any solid waste that is \ngenerated by an industrial facility and transported for the purpose of \ntreatment, storage, or disposal to a facility or unit thereof that is \nowned or operated by the generator of the waste, located on property \nowned by the generator or a company with which the generator is \naffiliated or the capacity of which is contractually dedicated \nexclusively to a specific generator, or as long as the disposal area \ncomplies with local and State land use and zoning regulations \napplicable to the disposal site, any medical waste that is segregated \nfrom or not mixed with solid waste, combustion ash generated by \nresource recovery facilities or municipal incinerators, or waste from \nmanufacturing or processing, including pollution control, operations \nnot essentially the same as waste normally generated by households.\n  Mr. President, I hope this will provide the executive and judicial \nbranches with a fuller explanation of the intent and meaning of this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4626\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a bipartisan amendment \nwhich I introduced with my colleagues, Senators DeWine and Mikulski, \nthat helps our Nation's firefighters perform their critical duties more \nsafely. This amendment was passed earlier by unnanimous consent. I \nwould like to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg, and the subcommittee's \nranking member, Senator Byrd. Crafting legislation that meets the \nvaried domestic security needs of our Nation is no easy feat and I \nthank Chairman Gregg, Senator Byrd, and all of my colleagues on the \nsubcommittee for their hard work and support.\n  This amendment increases funding to the Assistance to Firefighters \nGrants, which I initially authored in 2000 with my colleagues, Senators \nDeWine, Levin, and Warner. During the past 5 years, this initiative, \nwhich includes the FIRE and SAFER grants, has provided almost $2.5 \nbillion in assistance to over 29,000 fire departments in all 50 States \nand the District of Columbia. These resources have enabled fire \ndepartments to obtain updated firefighting equipment, hire additional \nfirefighters, and improve firefighter training--activities that are \ncrucial toward ensuring that firefighters can protect American citizens \nsafely and effectively in this post-9/ll world.\n  Our Nation's firefighters are willing to do whatever it takes to \nperform their duties. We have first-rate firefighters throughout our \nNation, but they continue to be under-funded, under-staffed, \nundertrained, and under-equipped to deal with the various emergencies \nthat may arise and have already arisen in their jurisdictions.\n  Very few people who are not firefighters stop and think about how \nmuch we continue to ask of our firefighters in today's world. They \nstill perform their traditional duties of extinguishing fires, \ndelivering emergency medical services, and ensuring that fire codes are \ninspected. However, refighters have also taken on homeland security \nresponsibilities that include responding to and handling hazardous \nbiological and radiological agents.\n  The fact remains that cash-strapped municipalities across our Nation \nsimply do not have the financial resources and personnel to assist \ntheir fire departments in fully meeting these enhanced responsibilities \nand, consequently, safeguarding their populations. According to the \nmost recent needs assessment study of the U.S. Fire Service published \nin December 2002, most fire departments lack the necessary resources \nand training to properly handle terrorist attacks and large-scale \nemergencies.\n  More specifically, the study found that, first, using local \nfirefighters, only 11 percent of fire departments can handle a rescue \nwith emergency medical services at a structural collapse of a building \nwith 50 occupants. Second, using local firefighters, only 13 percent of \nfire departments can handle a hazardous material incident involving \nchemical and/or biological agents with 10 injuries. Third, an estimated \n40 percent of fire department personnel involved in hazardous material \nresponse lack formal training in those duties. And finally, the study \nfound that an estimated 60 to 75 percent of fire departments do not \nhave enough fire stations to allow firefighters to respond swiftly to \nemergency calls.\n  These statistics are startling and are not improving over time. A new \nneeds assessment that is forecasted to be released in the coming months \nis expected to conclude that--despite the success the firefighter \ngrants have achieved in individual departments--fire departments across \nthe Nation continue to struggle to carry out their critical duties.\n  The risks that firefighters are expected to face continue to outgrow \nthe\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nability of municipalities fully to provide them with the resources they \nrequire. Therefore, it is imperative that the Senate continue \nsupporting our firefighters and working to address their concerns.\n  The amendment that I have offered increases funding for firefighters \nby $25 million--$1.5 million for the FIRE Act grant initiative and \n$12.5 million for the SAFER Act grant initiative. These increases bring \nthe total arpount of funding for the FIRE Grant to $552,500,000 and the \nSAFER Grant to $127,500,000. While I thank Senators Gregg, Byrd, and \ntheir colleagues on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee \nfor finding the resources necessary to support these important grant \ninitiatives at levels slightly above last year's funding, I believe \nthat more resources need to be dedicated to the FIRE and SAFER grants.\n  The FIRE Act grant initiative has been one of the most successful \nhomeland security grant initiatives in recent years. It is clear that \nthe need for these competitive, merit-based grants continues to grow in \nall regions of our Nation. For fiscal year 2006 alone, there were over \n18,000 applications submitted, totaling over $2.3 billion in grant \nrequests. Unfortunately, less than $545 million in Federal funding was \nultimately made available.\n  Equally important as the FIRE Grant is the SAFER Grant--an initiative \nwhich provides critial resources for fire departments to hire and \nrecruit personnel.\n  Just as the FIRE Act provides the equipment and training resources \nfor firefighters to do their job, the SAFER Act provides the human \nresources necessary to get those jobs done safely and effectively. Over \nthe past three decades, the number of firefighters as a percentage of \nthe Nation's workforce has steadily declined. Today two-thirds of fire \ndepartments in the United States lack adequate personnel. We have fewer \nfirefighters per capita, one firefighter for every 280 people, than \nnurses and police officers.\n  In fiscal year 2006 alone, 1,727 applications were submitted, \ntotaling over $1.8 billion in grant requests. Unfortunately, less than \n$110 million in Federal funding was ultimately made available. Clearly, \nwe must do more in order to ensure that fire departments are adequately \nstaffed and trained to meet the needs of their communities.\n  The amendment that I have offered is fully offset by reducing \nadministrative funding for the Office of the Homeland Security \nSecretary and Executive Management and utilizing unused funding from \nlast year for science and technology initiatives. These offsets still \nallow the Office of the Secretary to meet its obligations fully in the \ncoming year and the Department of Homeland Security to develop new \ntechnologies that keep Americans safe.\n  I would like to conclude by reminding my colleagues that the fiscal \nyear 2007 authorization levels for the FIRE and SAFER Grants are $1 \nbillion each. The appropriations in this bill for these initiatives are \nless than one-third the sums authorized. I am committed to working with \nmy colleagues in the future to ensure that firefighters receive more \ncritical resources they require.\n  America's firefighters are always the first ones in and the last ones \nout. They risk their own lives to save the lives of others. They stare \ndanger in the face every single day because they know they have a duty \nto fulfill. We must rcognize their contribution to our domestic safety \nand see to it that they have the necessary equipment and personnel in \norder to perform their critical duties safely and effectively.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Dodd-DeWine \namendment increasing funding for firefighter grants. These grants are \nfor local fire departments to ready themselves. The cost of equipment \ncan't be covered on fish fries and bingos alone. The firefighter grant \nprogram is a wise and prudent use of Federal funds. I know these funds \nare used well in my home State of Maryland.\n  This program has no winners or losers. Everyone wins in rural and \nurban America. I acknowledge that these are tight times and there is a \ntight allocation. But we must do better for our first responders. When \nI was the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development, Senator Bond and I funded \nfirefighter grants at $900 million. While this amendment does not get \nus to that funding level, it does provide an increase for the program.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4659.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. The Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, less than 2 months ago, on May 17, my \ncolleagues, by a vote of 83 to 16, approved\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nmy amendment to the Department of Homeland Security immigration bill to \nconstruct at least 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of vehicle \nbarriers along the southwest border of the United States. This was \nbased on the statement of the Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary \nChertoff, that this was what he believed was necessary to create a \nborder enforcement system.\n  Of course, a fence is not a cure-all, but it is a very real and \nintegral component of enforcement at the border. Many of the areas we \nhave the greatest difficulty with are urban areas. You can't put a \npoliceman at every single street corner where people can walk across. \nSo a barrier is necessary.\n  We have a number of barriers in San Diego and other places, and they \nhave worked very well. Crime on both sides of the border has decreased, \nproperty values have increased in those areas, and economic development \nhas occurred.\n  So there is no doubt--and it is not something that is mysterious--\nthat a good fencing procedure will help us in many ways. It is \nsomething we discussed and debated, and then when we voted, we voted 83 \nto 16 to approve it--a bipartisan vote.\n  But what I wish to make clear is this was simply an authorization. It \nrepresented a promise, a commitment by the Senate that we would build \nfencing. We would build fencing, and that, in large degree, is a part \nof our dialog with the American people in which we told them we are \ngetting serious about enforcement. We are not just talking anymore. We \nreally mean this time to get serious about enforcement, and we are \ngoing to do the things that are necessary. We are not going to build a \nfence along the entire border, but we need a certain amount of \nfencing--370 miles--and that is what would be put in, and that is what \nthis Congress, this Senate, voted for. The House has more. I think they \nhave 600 miles in their bill. So this was where we were.\n  I have made this point for some time in the debate: We do a lot of \ntalking, we do a lot of legislating. The things we do often sound very \ngood. The things we say often sound very good. But we don't ever quite \nget there. The things which will really make a difference, which can be \ndemonstrable in improving lawfulness at the border, somehow, some way, \nseem not to become law.\n  This fencing requires a sum of money. We are going to show an \nincrease--an increase--in spending for Medicare and Medicaid and Social \nSecurity next year or this year, this period, of over $100 billion. We \nare talking here about a cost of less than $2 billion, a one-time \nenforcement enhancement of having a barrier at the border.\n\n  The figure we have in here of $1.8 billion contemplates that it will \nall be done by private contractors at the higher prices for the better \nfence. I suspect as we move forward in conference the conferees may \nfind that the National Guard, which were not part of the process at the \nbeginning, were not being called out when we first voted on this \namendment, could actually build this fencing for what we understand \nwould be one-third the cost per mile. This might be a perfect thing for \nthem to do and participate in. There may be other ways to keep this \ncost down.\n  We made a commitment as a body that we were going to take some real \nsteps that would work to enhance enforcement at the border.\n  So I say to my colleagues, in many ways the vote we are about to take \non funding this amendment is a test. The American people should look at \nus and evaluate us according to this test we are about to take. Were we \nserious on May 17 when we said we wanted to build this fence? It is not \nin this bill today. This is the legislation that is the appropriate \nvehicle to put in the spending for it. It is not in the President's \nrequest. It is not in the item that came out of the committee.\n  I know the committee had many challenges, but this matter is \nimportant. It represents a commitment we made to the American people. \nWe need to follow through on that. If we do not, how could anyone say \nthat the Senate has integrity in the commitment that it has made to the \nAmerican people to create a lawful system of immigration in our \ncountry, to end the lawlessness at the border and create a lawful \nsystem?\n  That is what we need to do. We don't need to end immigration. We are \ngoing to maintain immigration. We are going to treat people fairly. We \nare going to allow people to come in and go from the United States. In \nfact, we can enhance that and make it much easier, but we need to have \na lawful system. We need to end this unlawful system, and that is what \nI would say is so critical about this process.\n  The bill as presently written appropriates $288 million for necessary \nexpenses to plan, construct, renovate, equip, and maintain buildings \nand facilities necessary for the administration and enforcement of the \nlaws relating to customs and immigration.\n  None of this $288 million is designated for any construction of new \nareas of border fencing on the Southwest border, as we voted to do by \n83 to 13. The construction funding only includes money to continue land \nacquisition and construction for the San Diego fence--$30 million--\nwhich is already under construction.\n  As for vehicle barriers that we have been told are important, \nespecially out in the rural areas, barriers to stop the easy crossing \nof vehicles, 39 miles of new permanent vehicle barrier in western \nArizona only are funded. That is for 39 miles, not the 500 miles that \nwe authorized. It continues construction of vehicle barriers in El Paso \nfor a few miles; $200,000 for vehicle barriers in the Swanton Sector.\n  Those amounts are the only amounts out of the $288 million that are \ndesignated specifically for fencing and vehicle barriers. That is not \nenough to fund what the Senate voted to authorize, 370 miles of fencing \nand 500 miles of vehicle barriers.\n  I know there are ways to contain costs. Frankly, I think if we work \nat it we might be able to demonstrate this amount of fencing could be \ndone for less than we have here. But I would say to my colleagues, the \nestimates we have had are these. This will meet the challenge. Unless \nwe have clear evidence to the contrary, we need to follow through on \nour commitment to fund this.\n  This amendment appropriates the funds for the 370 miles of fencing \nand 461 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic locations along the \nSouthwest border that the Senate authorized in May. Although the \nDepartment of Homeland Security supported my amendment at the time to \nadd these miles of fencing and barriers when we voted on those issues \nin May, funding for these miles of fencing is not included in the bill.\n  The advantages of fencing are numerous. It magnifies, it multiplies \nthe effectiveness of our Border Patrol officers as they go about their \nwork. They have a difficult job to do. They have to maintain a border \nthat is 1,700 miles long. They need help. There is no way we could have \nenough Border Patrol agents to patrol that entire border. We need to \nmake it more difficult for those who would come in to our country \nillegally.\n  Fencing has worked in San Diego, it has worked in Arizona, and it is \ngoing to work wherever we put it, to enhance the ability of our law \nenforcement officers to detain and stop and interdict those who would \nenter the country illegally, which is what we need to do if we are \ngoing to move from this lawless system of immigration to a lawful \nsystem of immigration.\n  These are the kinds of things the American people have been asking \nfor. They are asking for us to demonstrate that business as usual is no \nlonger in effect, that talk is no longer in effect. The American people \nare looking at us and they are going to be looking at us carefully to \nsee if we are actually going to follow through on what might really \nwork to reduce illegal immigration and to create a system that is \nlawful and decent and fair, so people who wait in line are not chumps \nand those who break the law and come across the border illegally are \nthe ones who get rewarded.\n  We need to stop that. That is wrong. It undermines law and sends a \nwrong message to those people who come into our country.\n  I say to my colleagues that we need to do a better job. We have a \nserious problem with the American people. They are suspicious of us. \nThey are cynical about what we have done. We have been talking about a \nlawful system of immigration for 30 or 40 years, and we have never \nproduced it. We\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\npassed a bill 20 years ago, in 1986, that was to be the amnesty to end \nall amnesties. We said we are going to do this one time and after this \nis done we are going to create a lawful system for immigration.\n  What happened? Amnesty became law just like that. The people got \ntheir amnesty. And there was a promise. As we made a promise on May 17 \nto build fences, they promised to do the things necessary to secure the \nborder after 1986, and it never happened. It didn't happen in the \n1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000. We had a series of Presidents who did \nnot follow through. We have had a series of Congresses that have sat \nover those years and they have not made this system work. Yet when we \ngo back home to our borders we say we want no amnesty and we want a \nlawful system. It is time for us to make a decision.\n  This is a lot of money, you say. It is $2 billion. I say we spend \n$1,400 billion a year in this country. If you took a poll of the \nAmerican people, would they say we ought to spend a couple of billion \ndollars to start making a real dent in the illegality at the border, \nthat they would expect us to find the money somewhere? I think there is \nno other program in this country not worthy of being reduced to some \ndegree so we could fund this.\n  My amendment would simply take an overall reduction in funding in \nthis bill because that is what I am limited to, really, as an effective \namendment at this point: to cut across all funding levels in the bill a \nsufficient sum to fund what we committed to do, which is build a fence.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, this matter is not going away. We are \nnot going to be able to go back to the American people and tell them we \nhave taken seriously their directive to us to fix this system if we \ndon't put up the money necessary to do so.\n  As I have said for so many years--and recently we have talked about \nit a lot--you have to get to that tipping point in enforcement. You \nhave to reach that point in which it is quite clear to those who would \nwant to come to this country that the best way to do so is to come \nlawfully, to wait in line and take your turn.\n  I talked with President Bush about it on Air Force One. He agreed. He \nused the phrase ``tipping point.'' That is exactly correct. We want to \nestablish a tipping point; a barrier, sufficient agents, sufficient \ndetention spaces are key to that. It is not going to break the bank.\n  I am optimistic about our ability to achieve this. But you simply \nhave to close the holes. You have a bucket with three holes in it. If \nyou close two of the holes, you are still going to have the water run \nout. When we do what is necessary to close the holes in our legal \nsystem we can create a system that will actually work, create a tipping \npoint where people wait in line and come legally according to the \nstandards this country establishes for them.\n  I am very concerned that by not funding what we just so recently \nvoted for, by not funding that we will be indicating, just like in \n1986, we were really serious about moving forward with an amnesty but \nwe are not serious about creating a lawful system of immigration in \nthis country. Wouldn't that break faith with the people who sent us \nhere? Wouldn't that undermine their respect once again? It is already \nat the lowest possible ebb.\n  They know we have not been serious about the border. Everybody knows \nthat. Who can deny that? It has been an issue for quite a long time. It \nhas been discussed and discussed.\n  They say we can have a virtual fence. A virtual fence will help a \nlittle bit. But I am not able to cash a virtual check at the bank.\n  I would like to see some real fencing. So we had a discussion about \nthat and we voted. We voted to build a fence. It was a little more than \nhalf of what the House voted in size, but it was a significant step \nthat will, in fact, multiply the effectiveness of our Border Patrol \nagents who are working their hearts out for us right now, today. It \nwill absolutely do that. It will absolutely work.\n  That is why some people oppose it so steadfastly. Whatever you \npresent in the matter of immigration, in my experience, that actually \ntends to work, gets objected to. Somehow it becomes very difficult to \npass.\n  There was objection to this amendment, frankly, until the very end. I \nthink the voices of the American people were heard and all of a sudden \nwe ended up with 83 votes. Some people thought it would be a close \nvote. It wasn't so close when we voted because we were listening to our \nconstituents, which is what we are supposed to do.\n  There are 2,000 miles on the border. Many of those are quite remote, \nnot appropriate to build a fence on. Some say they want to build a wall \nalong the border. What we need is strategic fencing. We need to use \nhigh technology. We need increased agents. We need enough bed spaces \nwhen someone is apprehended so that they can be detained pending \ndeportation, particularly if they are other than Mexicans, because the \nMexicans can be taken across the border right quickly, normally. But \nfor those who are from other areas of the world, sometimes it is very \ndifficult to effect a deportation.\n  As a result, people in our law system are forced to confront a \nproblem. They don't have the bed space for them. They don't have a \nplane flying back to the Philippines or Brazil or Chile or wherever the \npeople may be from that day, so they are releasing people on bail, \ncalled catch and release. They are released and they don't show up to \nbe deported.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit in effect at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, that is where we are. What you need to \ndo is reduce the number of people who are coming here illegally. You \nneed to reach a tipping point. People who are coming here illegally, \nother than Mexicans, have been told correctly until recent months that \nif they are apprehended, they are not going to be put immediately on a \nplane back to Brazil or the Philippines or wherever they may have come \nfrom. They are going to be released on bail. One study showed that 95 \npercent of the people released on bail under these circumstances don't \nshow up to be deported. Surprise, surprise.\n  You need bed spaces. We have some more bed spaces in our bill. You \nneed more agents--not a huge number of bed spaces and not huge \nincreases in agents, but you need more agents and more bed spaces. You \nneed to multiply the impact and effectiveness of Border Patrol agents \nby barriers.\n  How much more simple can it be than that, that we have these barriers \nthat multiply the effectiveness of our Border Patrol people?\n  The strategy among those who support this bill that passed the \nSenate--the Kennedy-McCain bill, or whatever we want to call it, which \nmoved through the Senate--is that it become law. The strategy is that \nwe will sort of have a conference with the House of Representatives in \nsecret and we will come up with some deal that gives amnesty to \neverybody who is here. Check the future flow of immigration in the \ncountry forever, and we will talk about how to make enforcement work.\n  A lot of people said: Listen, we went through that in 1986. That is \nwhat we talked about in 1986. Remember? Don't forget that. That is what \nthey said in 1986. They said in 1986: Give us amnesty today and we will \ntake care of the enforcement tomorrow.\n  Senator Isakson offered an amendment to deal with that very specific \nmatter. He said: I am worried about that, too. That is what happened in \n1986. That is what I am hearing from my constituents back in Georgia. \nWe are all concerned about that. We know it is a very real problem. Why \ndon't we say amnesty doesn't become effective, or any relief that one \nmay choose to give to those who come here illegally, whatever relief we \ngive them doesn't become effective until we have the border secured. He \noffered that as an amendment. It was one of the most intensely watched \namendments in the entire process.\n  I have to tell you, it was very discouraging to me and very \ndiscouraging, I think, to the American people to see that amendment \nfail. Why? Why was that amendment important? Because they rightly \nconclude from that that we never had or never intended to create a good \nenforcement mechanism. If not, why wouldn't we pass the Isakson \namendment? Why wouldn't we pass it? Why wouldn't we pass it if we \nintended to actually create a lawful system?\n  It made you think that maybe what we are hearing is rhetoric--talk \nand\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\npromises--but we are not going to deliver.\n  That is why I am saying to my colleagues that this border fence is \nmore than just a little matter of $1 billion-plus, as much as that is. \nIt is a matter for the American people to evaluate whether or not they \nconsider that we are acting with integrity when it comes to creating a \nlawful system of immigration in America.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security said it is necessary. We voted 83 \nto 16 to approve it. Now we have the Homeland Security bill where this \nproject should be funded, and it is not funded.\n  I know we have difficult choices to make. But that is what they pay \nus for.\n  Are people not listening to their phone calls, and not reading their \nmail?\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Louisiana, understands this \nissue. I have heard him speak articulately on it.\n  It is a matter of legitimate concern for the American people. The \nAmerican people are not anti-immigrant. They do not want to punish \nimmigrants. They believe in immigration. But they want a lawful system \nof immigration that serves the just interests of the United States of \nAmerica--not a system that makes a mockery of the law. They have been \nasking for it to be fixed for 30 years, and no President and no \nCongress has responded to their cry.\n  I am going to tell you, they are going to be heard this November. \nThere may be some people who will have to answer if they voted for this \nfence and then didn't vote to fund it.\n  Why not? Why shouldn't they be held to account on that?\n  We are facing some difficult choices. The American people are \nconcerned about the issue. Fundamentally, the American people are \ncorrect. They have good and decent instincts.\n  This Nation is a nation of laws. And on immigration we can have laws \nthat work. That is what we are looking to do.\n  I don't know of anyone else who wishes to speak at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks regarding \nthe amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Alabama.\n  I want my colleagues to know that this amendment which the Senator \nfrom Alabama is proposing provides over $1.8 billion for the \nconstruction of a fence along the southwest border of the United \nStates. However, my colleagues should know that he pays for this \namendment by an across-the-board cut to virtually every other \ndiscretionary program that is funded within this Homeland Security \nbill. That amendment amounts to a 5.7 percent decrease to critical \nprograms such as the Coast Guard operations that are absolutely \nessential in both homeland security and with the number of domestic \nissues.\n  His amendment would also cut FEMA and disaster relief funds at the \nheight of the hurricane and western forest fire season, and it cuts \nfunding from the Secret Service for the protection of the President.\n  This amendment also cuts a lot of our critical border security \nprograms.\n  On a bipartisan basis earlier this week, the Senate increased funding \nfor border security programs by $350 million. The bill that is before \nthe Senate right now has $11 billion for Customs and border protection \nand immigration and Customs enforcement.\n  The irony of the Senator's amendment is that it would cut funding for \nthe hiring of 1,000 new Border Patrol agents to pay for the fence. His \namendment cuts funding for 1,000 additional detention beds to pay for \nthis fence. And his amendment cuts funding for unmanned aerial \ninvestigation and surveillance helicopters and Border Patrol \nhelicopters to pay for this fence.\n  The bill before the Senate is carefully constructed and balanced to \nprovide funding for homeland security priorities within very limited \nresources.\n  I know the chairman and the ranking member of this committee have \nworked long and hard to balance a lot of requests regarding homeland \nsecurity. The amendment before us would unbalance that dramatically.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I greatly respect the Senator from Alabama \nand his tireless efforts in addressing the issue of illegal immigration \nand his amendment on building a wall in those parts of the urban areas \nof the border where a wall would be effective. It is an appropriate \namendment, and I strongly support it. It was in the authorization. Had \nthe administration supported our efforts relative to capital \nimprovements in the supplemental, we might have been able to make a \nfairly significant commitment toward that wall. But the wall would be \nbuilt over 2 years.\n  This amendment accelerates that construction into a 1-year time \nperiod. Within the bill, we have approximately $400 million in \nsupplemental capital improvements that could be used for wall \nconstruction. I don't think all of it would be used. Some of it would \nbe obviously.\n  We should build these walls. There is no question about it. The real \nissue is that the offset being used creates a Hobson's choice for \nalmost everyone here, I suspect, because the practical effect of a 5.7 \npercent cut would be that we would have to reduce Border Patrol agents \nby about 750. We would have to reduce detention beds by about 1,100.\n  We have attempted very hard to increase Border Patrol agents in this \nbill and increase detention beds. Yet we haven't funded the wall \nspecifically as a result of our efforts to do these increases.\n  The effect on the Coast Guard, the Senator from Washington alluded \nto, would probably be that the number of fast boats which we intended \nto buy would be reduced significantly, and our capacity to arm \nhelicopters would be reduced from what we hoped to arm--60 helicopters. \nWe have, at the most, armed probably 50, maybe 55.\n  There is a real implication to this amendment. It has an implication \nin the things we are doing relative to border security which will be \nimpacted by it.\n  I am totally sympathetic to the need to make this investment in this \nfencing activity. And I believe within the Department's funds relative \nto capital improvements there is also some money which could be put \nthere but nowhere near the dollars he believes are necessary with which \nthe Department needs to continue construction.\n  We are going to have to come up with a better way to do this. We are \nnot going to be able to do this, in my humble opinion, the way this \namendment is constructed--in an across-the-board cut.\n  I have to oppose this amendment in its present form for that reason.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are going to proceed with \nconstruction over 2 years. Since we don't know what will happen next \nyear, the Congress voted to build a fence, and we ought to fund the \nfence, in my opinion, when we promised to build it. But we could build \nit over 2 years and split the money each year, I suppose. It would \nultimately slow down completion. It would probably take some time to \nget it constructed. I don't know whether my colleagues would agree to \ncut that price in half and do it over 2 years, and whether it would \ngain their support. If so, I would be prepared to accept that reduction \nin the amendment.\n  Let me just say that we know what happened. Senator Gregg did his \nvery best in the supplemental. Judd Gregg, chairman of our committee, \nis a fine Budget Committee chairman. He also chairs this Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee. He was able to force into the supplemental \nadditional money for border security which was not in the President's \nrequest. I salute him for that. But that is not getting us there. We \nare still talking about nickles and dimes. We are still talking about \nbusiness as usual. Somehow we need to find this money. We spend over \n$800 billion a year in discretionary spending. We spend nearly $1.4 \ntrillion a year in entitlement spending, entitlement increases--an \nincrease of over $100 billion next year. So we can't find a couple of \nbillion dollars to fulfill the commitment we made to the American \npeople?\n  We know how the system works around here. There is no one way that\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nit works. There are many ways to skin a cat, as they say.\n  We need a vote for this amendment. And that would send a signal to \nthe Appropriations Committee and send a signal to the White House that \nthis Senate is serious about fulfilling its commitments. Some way \nbetween now and then, some way they will find this money through \nwhatever sources are appropriate to fund it. That is where we need to \nbe. That is what we need to achieve.\n\n  If we allow it to go through without any money for this fencing, we \nwill rightly be accused of not being serious about the commitments we \nhave made to the American people with regard to actually enforcing the \nlaws of immigration in America, which many Americans already believe we \nare not serious about. They do not respect what we have done in the \npast, and they should not; we have failed. It is time for Congress to \ntry to fix it and do better. In fact, we must do better. The Secretary \nof Homeland Security has told us this kind of barrier fencing is \nnecessary for his success.\n  Now, we build a bridge in immigration that goes about 8 feet across \nthe 10-foot cavern, and we never quite close the loop. As a result, we \nnever reach the tipping point where it becomes much more logical for \nsomeone who wants to come to America to come legally than illegally, so \nthey continue to come illegally. They are rewarded for that. They get \nto the head of the line, and they get amnesty when they get here after \na period of time. That is a bad signal. We need to stop that signal.\n  By building more barrier fencing, by following up on the President's \ncommitment to call out the National Guard, those activities send a \nsignal to the world that our border is no longer open. Isn't that the \nmessage we want to send? We do not have an open border. We have a \ngenerous immigration system, far more generous that any nation I am \naware of in the world. More generous than Canada, more generous than \nEngland, more generous than Mexico. We have a generous system. Don't \nlet anyone put us down that we are somehow an anti-immigrant Nation. \nNothing could be further from the truth. We are very generous, but we \ndo need to have a system that is lawful.\n  About a million people come into our country legally. About 750,000 \nor 800,000 come into the country illegally. Almost as many come \nillegally. That is not right. It cannot continue. This is not an \nextreme position to take.\n  Let's build the fences that the Secretary of Homeland Security \ndiscussed. I don't know where the Senator would get the money for it \nand exactly how it would be worked, but I believe if we voted a strong \nvote to fund this fencing, somehow, some way, the leadership of the \nHouse and the Senate would get together and figure out a way to fund it \nappropriately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement relative to a series of votes: At 2:30, the Senate proceed to \nconsecutive votes in relation to the following amendments: Senator \nMenendez, No. 4634; Senator Schumer, No. 4600; Senator Sessions, No. \n4659; Senator Sessions No. 4660.\n  I further ask consent that the time until then continue under the \nagreement which we had earlier relative to the Sessions amendment; \nfurther, that no amendments be in order to any of the amendments prior \nto the vote; further that prior to the first vote, Senator Leahy be \nrecognized for 1 minute, Senator Menendez for 1 minute, and myself for \n1 minute; further that between the remaining votes there be 2 minutes \nequally divided in the usual form and that after the first vote, all \nvotes be 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Reserving the right to object, I have an amendment, \npossibly a second amendment if the first is not agreed to, stipulating \nthat at least 20 percent of the agents will be directed to the northern \nborder.\n  Mr. GREGG. I say to the Senator, we will be happy to entertain that \namendment after we have completed voting on these and put that in the \nqueue for consideration after we complete the votes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. There will be an opportunity to offer and have it \nconsidered by the full Senate after this sequence?\n  Mr. GREGG. We will be here for a little while.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I make one thing very clear: Fencing should not be a \npolitical gimmick. It should not be a suggestion that it would cure all \nof our problems, but fencing works.\n  Let me share some thoughts about it. It is proven with the \nestablishment of the San Diego border fence, crime rates in San Diego \nhave fallen off dramatically. According to the FBI crime index, crime \nin San Diego county dropped 56.3 percent between 1989 and 2000. Vehicle \ndrive-throughs--these are people who bolt across the border in a \nvehicle--vehicle drive-throughs through the immigration prohibited \nareas have fallen from between six and ten per day before the \nconstruction of border infrastructure to only four drive-throughs in \nall of 2004. And those four only occurred where the secondary fence was \nincomplete.\n  Fencing has reduced illegal entries in San Diego. According to \nnumbers provided by the San Diego Border Sector Patrol in February of \n2004, apprehensions decreased from 531,000 in 1993 to 111,000 in 2003. \nLet me repeat that, talking about tipping points: They had to arrest, \nin 1993, along the San Diego border, 531,000 people; after the fence \nwas up in 2003, only 111,000 were arrested, one-fifth. How many hours, \nhow much money was saved because people did not have to be arrested and \ndid not come illegally? How many people did not successfully enter the \nUnited States because of this fence?\n  Fencing has also reduced drug trafficking in San Diego. In 1993, \nauthorities apprehended over 58,000 pounds of marijuana coming across \nthe border, but in 2003 the fence helped stem the tide of drug \nsmuggling and only 36,000 pounds of marijuana were apprehended. In \naddition, cocaine smuggling decreased from 1,200 pounds to 150 pounds, \nabout one-tenth.\n\n  I talked to Congressman Duncan Hunter, who chairs the House Committee \non Armed Services. He is very familiar with the border. He explained to \nme it was an absolute wonder how much good that fence did. That is why \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, has spoken out \nand said this is what he needs: 370 miles.\n  I am quite aware there is a shortage of money, and we have to make \nchoices. I repeat, in our discretionary budget, we spend about $870, \nmaybe $900 billion in our entitlement program expenditure. It will \nincrease 9 percent next year. It will increase by over $100 billion. We \nspend $1.4 trillion-plus on entitlements. That is $1.4 trillion on \nentitlements. We cannot find $2 billion to deal with the fencing that \nwe voted a few weeks ago to approve? I think we can. I know it is \ndifficult.\n  I know Chairman Gregg, if he had the money, as he said, would fund \nit. How do we break this train wreck we are heading to? How do we get \noff this track of not doing what we committed to do? Vote for this \namendment. It will send a message to the appropriators, it will send a \nmessage to the administration, it will send a message to those who are \nworking on our appropriations accounts that we as a Senate expect them \nto somehow, some way, go back and make the tough priority choices and \nfind the money necessary to do this. Maybe we can fund it over 2 years. \nIf so, they will work that out. This is not the final draft of the bill \nthat will ultimately be before the Senate. They will work that out. I \nam willing to work with them on that.\n  Also, if the National Guard were to build it, we have been told they \nwould do it for one-third of the cost that private contractors would \ncharge. That could be a savings, and we could get this fencing done \nwithout so much money in any one budget year.\n  We voted to build 370 miles of fencing, 500 miles of barriers for \nvehicles, and I am hoping we will not disappoint the American people, \nonce again. I am hoping somehow, some way, we will rise to the occasion \nand say: We made a commitment. It is the right thing to do.\n  The administration was never out here championing building fencing. \nThat is never something they said would be a cure-all. Frankly, it is a \nbigger positive step than many people\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nadmit. They did come forward and tell us, through the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, that these were the figures they needed to create a \nlawful system at our border. We have areas in developed cities and \ntowns where people can walk across the border without even a \ncheckpoint. There is not even a fence there. This is what we need to \ndo.\n  If we are serious about it, and I think the American people are, and \nI think there is a growing seriousness with the President and the \nMembers of the Senate, let's step up and do what it takes. Don't go 8 \nfeet across the 10-foot ravine and fall into the pit. Let's complete \nthe task before the Senate. Somehow, some way, we can find the money in \nthis budget. I know we will if we pass this amendment. If we do not \npass this amendment, we will be sending a signal, it is business as \nusual, and we do not intend to honor our commitments.\n  That is the wrong thing to do it. It could not be more damaging to \nhave failed to honor our commitments on any bill before the Senate than \nthe immigration bill. This is a bill for which the people have the \nleast confidence in us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4660\n\n  The other amendment I call up is amendment No. 4660; I ask the \nprevious amendment be set aside, and I will make my remarks about \namendment No. 4660.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with sufficient \nfunding of ICE, Immigrations and Custom Enforcement interior agents. \nICE is authorized. We voted to authorize and hire 800 new investigative \nagents in fiscal year 2007. That begins October 1st. Beginning October \n1st, we voted to authorize the hiring of 800 new agents under the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  The Department of Homeland Security asked for 206 investigative \nagents in 2007. Among other things, those agents are used to \ninvestigate illegal employment in the workplace, workplace enforcement. \nVirtually every Senator, in the context of the immigration debate, has \ntalked about how important it is to increase worksite enforcement. We \nhave talked about it time and time again. The way to do that is to \nincrease the number of agents who are investigating these cases. How \nsimple can it be?\n\n  This Senate bill appropriates $57 million, an increase of $19 \nmillion, to enhance resources devoted to worksite enforcement. \nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, the $19 million \nincrease would hire 141 new agents. The bill also appropriates funds to \nhire 27 new compliance investigators. They are similar to but not the \nsame as an investigative agent.\n  The 141 new agents and the 27 compliance investigators do not meet \nthe President's request for 206 agents. They just do not meet the \nPresident's request for 206 agents. And it does not come close to \nfunding the 800 agents that Congress authorized ICE to hire next year.\n  You see, once again, this is serious business. We talk about \nenforcement. We say we are going to do it, but when it comes down to \nthe lick log, we spend our money on other things.\n  So my amendment will ensure that the fiscal year 2007 appropriations \nbill for the Department of Homeland Security funds the full level that \nCongress authorized to hire in 2007, a total of 800 new agents. This \nmeans that we have to find the money for ICE to hire 659 more agents \nthan the bill currently funds. That is 800, minus 141.\n  The Department of Homeland Security tells me that it costs as much as \n$130,000 to fund a fully wrapped new ICE agent for the first year, with \ntraining and equipment and all those things. Therefore, the cost for \nthese additional 659 new agents will be $85 million. To pay for these \nagents, the amendment contains an across-the-board reduction.\n  This is about making some decisions about what we intend to do with \nregard to enforcement of immigration laws. It sets some priorities. So \nthat will help us focus on what we need to do.\n  To me, based on my experience, having worked with Customs agents, \nhaving worked with Border Patrol agents, having worked with INS agents \nback when I was a Federal prosecutor, interior enforcement agents, who \nare responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the workplace and \ninside our borders, are a top priority.\n  Let me tell you, it is not going to be that difficult. We are not \ngoing to need tens of thousands of Federal agents to change the \nworkplace illegality that is going on. Most businesses today want to do \nthe right thing. We have not given a biometric card, which is not \neasily counterfeitable, to those people who come here legally so the \nbusinesses can make a legitimate decision about whether they are legal \nor not. We have created a lawless system in many different ways.\n  But businesses must be held accountable. We can create, under this \nbill, a system that gives businesses a greater ability to know what the \nlaw is and to comply with the law. Once they know we expect them to \ncomply with the law, once we pass this immigration bill that will \ncreate better workplace rules and procedures, we can almost overnight \nsee a dramatic reduction in the hiring of illegals at the workplace. \nIsn't that what we want?\n  Some do not want that. They would like to be able to hire as many as \nthey want to at lower wages.\n  But we as a nation have to look at the national interest and set a \npolicy about how many people should come into the country, only allow \nthose in lawfully, and make sure they are given a good identifier so \nthey can go to work. But we need sufficient investigators to make sure \nwe reach the tipping point in the workplace so that employers know with \ncertainty what the rules are and know that if they do not comply with \nthose rules they will be held to account. Once they know that they will \nbe held to account, we will see, in very short order, a dramatic \ndropoff in illegal activity. Just this increase would make a tremendous \namount of progress.\n  Mr. President, I have a few minutes left. I would yield to the \nSenator from New Hampshire. He may want to make some remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes that \nshould have been set for 2:30 now be set to begin at 2:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4610 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this particular amendment, which enjoys \nwide support here in the Senate, would dramatically increase the \navailability of alternative energy refueling systems, such as \nbiodiesel, ethanol, and compressed natural gas, by reimbursing eligible \nentities up to $30,000 for the costs associated with installing these \nalternative gas pumps.\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I believe our Nation's \nhomeland security is directly related to our Nation's energy security. \nThe underlying goal of this amendment is to provide American consumers \nmore opportunities to use American-made alternative fuels as we work to \nlessen our Nation's dependence upon foreign sources of energy.\n  As I noted yesterday when I offered this amendment, I am unaware of \nany opposition to what this amendment attempts and seeks to do. In \nfact, since I offered the amendment, a number of our colleagues here in \nthe Senate have cosponsored this particular provision.\n  Additionally, American automakers, such as General Motors and Ford, \nsupport this effort, as do various agricultural groups--from the Farm \nBureau to the National Corn Growers Association--as well as \nenvironmental groups. The reason is very simple. It makes a lot of \nsense for so many reasons, not the least of which is getting us away \nfrom this overdependence of foreign sources of energy. But it is good \nfor the environment. It is good for the American consumer. It is good \nfor the American agricultural producer.\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\n  I certainly appreciate the bill managers' patience regarding this \namendment. And while I also appreciate the fact that the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill probably is not the appropriate vehicle to \nhave this amendment considered and discussed, I am greatly encouraged \nby many of the calls and statements of support for this initiative that \nI have received since offering it, as well as some new ideas I have \nreceived that I hope to explore to make this particular provision even \nstronger.\n  So I expect we will revisit this issue. I fully am hopeful we will be \nable to get a vote in the Senate on this provision. Again, as I said \nbefore, I think it is important for our national security because of \nthe direct correlation to energy security. It is also important for our \neconomy. It is important for our environment.\n  For all those reasons, I intend to offer this amendment at a later \ntime to what I hope will be a debate on an energy bill later this \nsummer. But for the time being, I will withdraw the amendment.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and other of my \ncolleagues in the future as we work to get this provision signed into \nlaw. I believe it is that important. It is important for the future. \nInasmuch as I would like to see it voted on today, I realize in the \ninterest of keeping this debate about the issue at hand and trying to \nkeep ancillary and nongermane business away from it, I will withdraw \nthe amendment and look forward to having it debated at a later time.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. The issue he has raised here is an important one. I \nalso appreciate the fact that it is more appropriately raised on \nanother matter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4660\n\n  Mr. President, speaking to the second amendment that Senator Sessions \nhas offered, this again is an issue of priorities. The first amendment \njuxtaposes the need to build a wall with the need to add border \nsecurity agents and detention beds and make the Coast Guard a more \nrobust player and more capable, and have the US-VISIT program and the \nimmigration program work well.\n  It is ironic, actually, that this amendment, which increases \ninvestigators by 800, would, if the first amendment were to pass, end \nup reducing investigators by 300. I guess the net result would be if \nboth amendments passed, you would end up with 500 investigators. But \nthat shows the problem here that is being presented to the Senate by \nthe way these amendments are structured with their across-the-board \ncuts. Because the across-the-board cuts impact the entire Department. \nThis is not a Department that does a lot of things we do not need to \ndo.\n  Certainly, we need our Border Patrol agents. We need our Coast Guard. \nWe need our Secret Service. We need our detention beds to make sure we \ncan put these people away when we have them. So when you do an across-\nthe-board cut, you impact all these other services.\n  And, yes, ICE could use more investigators. That is why in this bill \nwe added 75, so that we have 6,000 investigators in the ICE program. He \nwould add 800 more to that. But, as I said, should his first amendment \npass, he would reduce that number, logically--because there would be a \n5-percent reduction--by 300. It would be almost a 6-percent reduction, \nactually.\n  So, again, I have to oppose the amendment. Although the policy may \nmake sense, the way it is paid for does not. It would actually do \nsignificant harm to our capacity, in my opinion, to have a robust \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  So I will oppose the second amendment offered also by the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4659\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, thank you. First of all, I appreciate the \nexplanation of the chairman of the subcommittee and conclude, as he \nhas, unfortunately, that, good policy notwithstanding, taking money \naway from other good policy decisions we have made or intend to make in \nsupport of funding for more Border Patrol agents, more detention \nspaces, and so on, requires that we oppose the amendment that would \ntake money from those programs to build more fencing.\n  Much of this fencing is in my State of Arizona. We need that fencing. \nI am convinced we will be able to get the fencing done, if not by the \nNational Guard, then by construction that will, in fact, cost money, \nfor which there is some in the budget. There is probably more needed, \nand we are going to have to find a way to add that. But this, \nunfortunately, has been constructed as a zero-sum game with this \namendment. In order to put more money on fencing, we take more money \naway from Border Patrol. So that is going to make it a very difficult \nproposition.\n  Mr. President, the matter I would like to ask unanimous consent to \nspeak on, I say to the chairman, actually is a matter not related to \nthis bill. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 90 seconds as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl are printed in today's Record under ``Morning \nBusiness.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4634\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I had reserved the final 4 minutes of my \ntime in opposition to the Menendez amendment. I am going to claim that \ntime now.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. Let me briefly summarize three issues that make the \namendment so problematic.\n  First, it slashes the minimum allocation for homeland security grant \nmoneys for States. It would impose a two-thirds cut in the guaranteed \nallocation which would undermine the efforts of States that have \nentered into multiyear projects such as improving the interoperability \nof their communications equipment which is an expensive multiyear \nproposition.\n  Second, the amendment makes absolutely no sense. If my colleagues are \nunhappy, as I am, with the Department of Homeland Security's allocation \nof funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program, why would they want \nto give unfettered discretion to the Department on how to allocate the \nfunds?\n  The amendment has absolutely no criteria included in it to define \nrisk. By contrast, the proposal that was approved by the Homeland \nSecurity Committee sets out criteria--such as whether there had been a \nterrorist attack previously, the population density, whether it is a \nborder State, whether it is on the coastline--and gives guidance to the \nDepartment since it has clearly shown that it does not have a well-\ndeveloped system for allocating based on risk. We have seen the results \nof that.\n  Third, the Senator from New Jersey strikes the requirement in current \nlaw to have the Department look at the need for the funding. All of us \nare concerned about reports that homeland security grant money in some \nlocalities has been wasted, whether it is on leather jackets or air-\nconditioned garbage trucks, actual cases, one in the District and one \nin New Jersey, or for other questionable purposes. We need to make sure \nthat the Department is allocating the funds not only based on risk, \nthreat, and vulnerability but also on need and effectiveness. There are \nno requirements for this funding to be developed and allocated based on \nthe need for it nor the effectiveness of the State's plan.\n  For those three reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe Menendez amendment. Thirty-six States and the District of Columbia \nwould lose funding under his proposal. The funding instead would be \nreallocated to 14 States which already receive more than 70 percent of \nall the funding for homeland security.\n  This is a misguided amendment. It will lead to wasteful spending. It \nwill undermine the efforts to bring all States up to a base level of \npreparedness and response. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I see the Senator from Delaware is on the floor. He has been very \nactive in\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nthis area. If I do have any time remaining, I would be happy to yield \nto my colleague, the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 23 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, the Senator has said it well. There is \nnothing much I can add. When it comes to proportioning these funds, we \nneed to use common sense. If we do, I think we will vote no on the \namendment. I thank the Senator from Maine for all the leadership she \nprovides.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4659 and 4660\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks on \nthe question of funding of the authorized border fencing in amendment \nNo. 4659 and amendment No. 4660 which would authorize funding for the \nhiring of a number of interior enforcement agents that we authorized \nand voted to hire just a few weeks ago. I would like to talk about \nthat.\n  I am well aware--and I know the argument that has been made by our \nwonderful Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg, and Senator Murray--\nthat there is just not enough money in this bill to pay for it. I would \nsay to my colleagues: This is an important issue that deals with \nsomething that we made a commitment to the American people about just a \nfew weeks ago. And now it comes time for us to fund it and we don't \nhave the money.\n  We spend almost $900 billion in discretionary spending, $1.4 trillion \nin entitlement spending. We can find a couple of billion dollars to \nfund this.\n  How do we do it? We pass these amendments, and we will send a signal \nto the appropriators and to the White House that we are serious and \nfind the money somewhere. That is what we will be saying. I know they \nare going to say: Don't vote for this amendment. I am for the fence. \nEverybody is for the fence, Jeff. We just don't have the money.\n  How can we say that? We just voted to build the fence. We can't say \nwe don't have the money. That is not an acceptable answer. So pass this \namendment. Yes, it is going to cause some grief. Yes, there is going to \nbe huddling of appropriators and budgeteers and the White House. They \nare going to have to hammer out a way to get the money to fund this \nthing. But to let this slip and to be on record as a Member of the \nSenate who just voted to build a fence and now vote not to fund it is \nnot a good thing to do. It is going to send a bad signal to the \nAmerican people. It is going to be a bad signal. They are going to say: \nThey have been promising to have some enforcement and the first vote \nthat comes up, the first bill that comes down the pike, they don't put \nthe money in to do just what they voted to do.\n  Remember the fence can't be built and the agents we authorized to be \nhired can't be hired unless we appropriate the money. Please, we have \nto appropriate the money. I know this budget is tight. I will just say \nto my colleagues, I thank Senator Gregg for his support for the fence, \nhis work in the supplemental to get more money for enforcement. If it \nhad not been for his leadership, we would not have as much as we have. \nBut it is not enough.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is a \nstatement by the Senate that somehow we expect this matter to be \nfunded. There is plenty of money in this Government, if we look for it, \nto fund this important matter.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 4659 and 4660, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk for \nthe two amendments I have proposed. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to modify those two amendments, as we have proposed them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4659 and 4660), as modified, are as follows:\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 4659, AS MODIFIED\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Customs and Border Protection'' and under the \n     subheading ``construction'' is hereby increased by \n     $1,829,400,000.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, of the \n     amount made available under the subheading described in \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) $1,184,000,000 of which shall be used for the \n     construction of 370 miles of double-layered fencing along the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico; \n     and\n       (2) $645,400,000 of which shall be for the construction of \n     not less than 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico.\n       (c) Discretionary amounts made available under this Act, \n     other than the amount appropriated under the subheading \n     described in subsection (a), shall be reduced by \n     $1,829,400,000.\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 4660, AS MODIFIED\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Immigration and Customs Enforcement'' and under the \n     subheading ``salaries and expenses'' is hereby increased by \n     $85,670,000.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, of the \n     amount made available under the subheading described in \n     subsection (a) $104,000,000 of which shall be available to \n     hire an additional 800 full time active duty investigators \n     employed by the Department of Homeland Security to \n     investigate violations of immigration laws (as defined in \n     section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)) pursuant to section 5203 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-458; 118 Stat. 3734) which requires the \n     hiring of not less than 800 more investigators than the \n     number for which funds were made available during fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2006.\n       (c) Discretionary amounts made available under this Act, \n     other than the amount appropriated under the subheading \n     described in subsection (a), shall be reduced by $85,670,000.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds to say that this \namendment would authorize the appropriating committee to pay for the \nfencing--give them more discretion to pay for it out of the account \nthey deem is appropriate. It would be across the board but within their \ndiscretion, so that no one particular account must be cut or reduced by \npassage of this amendment. The Coast Guard and other things would not \nhave to be reduced in order to pay for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the points I previously made relative to \nthe impact of this amendment remain accurate. I continue my opposition \nto both amendments because of the across-the-board cut nature and the \nimpact it would have on all elements of the Homeland Security \nDepartment. Even though the policy may be something we would agree with \nif we had the resources, we don't have the resources.\n  I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be votes \non four amendments: Menendez, No. 4634; Schumer, No. 4600; Sessions, \nNo. 4659, as modified; and Sessions, No. 4660, as modified.\n  Prior to the first vote, Senator Leahy is recognized for 1 minute, \nSenator Menendez for 1 minute, Senator Gregg for 1 minute, and between \nthe remaining votes there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nin the usual form, and after the first vote each will be a 10-minute \nvote.\n  Senator Leahy is recognized for 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4634\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the underlying issue today on this \namendment is that the administration has slashed Homeland Security \nfunding. It has mismanaged the grants it has awarded. We would not be \nin the situation of pitting State against State if the President \nadequately funded Homeland Security. Grants are being cut from $2.3 \nbillion in 2003 to under $1 billion this year--$1 billion for the whole\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\nyear, this Homeland Security grant. We spend over a billion dollars a \nweek in Iraq. If we can spend money for homeland security in Iraq, we \nought to be able to spend a tiny fraction of that here.\n  I commend Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me first say I totally agree with my \ncolleague from Vermont. We are dramatically underfunded for what we \nneed for homeland security. That truly is the core of the issue. I \nappreciate the spirit of the debate he has had with us on this issue \nand his comments. I simply believe that as we seek to fund it fully, \nthe question becomes, What do we do now? The bipartisan, unanimous 9/11 \nCommission recommended that homeland security funding be based on risk. \nThat is what this amendment does.\n  Many of my colleagues have actually made the case, by virtue of what \nthey have said, that risk-based funding should be the very essence of \nour foundation. They made a good case for their respective States for \nrisk-based funding when they argued that their States have high-risk \ntargets. This amendment does nothing to eliminate the effectiveness \ncomponent. It does not eliminate the minimum guarantees for States. But \nthreat after threat has been revealed, and that makes it very clear \nwhere the greatest threats are in our country. That ultimately should \nbe our thrust, driving our resources, those which we have, as we try to \nbuild more to where the risk is.\n  We are all in this together. We are called upon to vote for \nagriculture, hurricanes, and other things. I ask Senators to vote in \nfavor of this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe in a risk-based approach. I \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Menendez amendment No. 4634. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 36, nays 64, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 198 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Allen\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     DeWine\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 4634), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I respectfully request that on vote No. \n198 my vote be recorded as yea. It will not make a difference in the \nfinal tally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on rollcall vote 198, I voted nay. It was \nmy intention to vote yea. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto change my vote since the outcome will not be affected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4600\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes for debate on the \nSchumer amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment is one which I believe \nwould be supported by George Bush because it restores the amount of \nfunding for FEMA by $300 million. That is what the President requested.\n  We have had unprecedented disasters in the Northeast and in so many \nother places in other parts of the country as well. We have had \ndisaster after disaster in this country. FEMA should not be \nunderfunded. We should not have the people who have been wiped out by \nfloods and drought and hurricanes sitting on tenterhooks in the hopes \nthat maybe we will pass a supplemental 6 or 8 months from now.\n  This simply restores the President's request for FEMA. It would \nhardly be a profligate request. So I ask my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, particularly those from the Northeast, to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the disaster relief fund has $9.3 billion \nin it. That is more than enough money to get us through the balance of \nthis year and will give us a surplus going into next year. We have $1.6 \nbillion in this bill to add to the $9.3 billion for next year. If a \ndisaster occurs and it is of significant proportions, we will obviously \ncome back and do an emergency appropriations.\n  No money that would occur as a result of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New York could be used this year for any disasters that have \noccurred this year in the Northeast because, of course, this money \nwon't be available until next year. There is adequate money, however, \nto take care of the Northeast issues. So at this time I ask Members to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the deeming language in Public Law 109-\n234, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation of the \npending amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. \n95, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006, I \nmove to waive section 402 of that concurrent resolution for the \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. GREGG. And this is a 10-minute vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is a 10-minute vote.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 199 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Clinton\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n54. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\naffirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is sustained. \nThe emergency designation is removed.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will raise a point of order against the amendment which \nwas ruled not an emergency. The pending amendment would cause the bill \nto violate section 302 of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4659, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Now I understand we are on to the first amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nSessions amendment, No. 4659, as modified. Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This amendment would follow through on our 83-to-16 \nvote on May 17 to build 370 miles of fencing at the border and 500 \nmiles of vehicle barriers, as requested by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, Mike Chertoff. Unfortunately, this bill does not fund it. \nJust a few weeks ago, we authorized it. Now we are not funding it. That \nis not acceptable and will undermine our credibility with the American \npeople.\n  Please note that the amendment has been modified. The amendment has \nbeen amended, and it does not require any account to be reduced, such \nas the Coast Guard or others, but it does require discretionary \nspending in the bill to be reduced to pay for it, so it is paid for.\n  We need to honor our commitment and our vote of just a few weeks ago \nin order to maintain credibility with the American people on the \nquestion of immigration, an area in which they have great reason to \ndistrust our actions. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I know Senator Gregg and his team will figure out a way to fund it if \nwe require it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as I stated earlier on the floor, all of \nour colleagues need to understand that we have worked very hard to put \ntogether a balanced bill under the direction of the chairman and the \nranking member on this side, Senator Byrd. This amendment will \nessentially cut Border Patrol agents, transportation security, Coast \nGuard operations, Secret Service, Office of Domestic Preparedness, FEMA \ndisaster relief, and FEMA operations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment in order to keep \na balanced bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Although I am very sympathetic to the purpose of the \npolicy behind this amendment, the simple fact is that this sort of \nacross-the-board cut would wreak havoc on this department and \npotentially mean significant reductions in a number of critical areas. \nThis department does not have a lot of activity that is not critical to \nour homeland security, and a 5.5 percent cut across the board would \nhave a devastating impact. So I have to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I must oppose the Sessions amendment because \nit would eliminate critical border security funds from this bill.\n  The subcommittee has carefully balanced the needs of our law \nenforcement personnel on the border, and an across-the board cut, like \nthat proposed in the Sessions amendment, would leave our borders \ndangerously exposed.\n  I remain committed to strengthening the fencing along the border. But \nit is unwise to finance that fencing with cuts in our border security \nelsewhere.\n  I join the chairman in opposing this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 29, nays 71, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 200 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--29\n\n     Allen\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Lott\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n\n                                NAYS--71\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 4659), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. GREGG.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4660, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Two minutes are divided on the \nSessions amendment numbered 4660.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this amendment will fund the \ninvestigative agents we authorized in the immigration bill that passed \nthis Congress. It would do so by increasing the funding for $85 million \nand would fully fund the 800 positions we authorized. We authorized 800 \npositions, but, unfortunately, we have only funded 141.\n  Once again, it raises serious questions, as in 1986, about whether or \nnot we are going to talk but not be willing to put up the money to fund \nthe bill.\n  Also, this will be offset by reductions in any discretionary account \nwithout mandating across-the-board cuts. The amendment has been amended \nfrom that previously filed so that no specific account is required to \nbe cut, such as the Coast Guard.\n  I believe we need to follow through on our commitment to the American \npeople to increase our investigative agents. This will fund what we \nauthorized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As noble as it is to hire 800 full-time active duty \ninvestigators, this amendment cuts law enforcement grants, firefighter \ngrants, emergency management grants, State Homeland Security grants, \nurban security initiative, FEMA, and, ironically, will cut money for \nthe fence that is within the bill before the Senate. I urge a no vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, again, the policy is very laudable, but the \nproblem is, the dollars are being taken out of other accounts. We are \nattempting to ramp up the personnel in a lot of Border Patrol \nactivities, to ramp up the number of beds, and to ramp up our efforts \nin the Coast Guard.\n  This $85 million is not going to come out of thin air and will have \nto come from one of these accounts or a series of accounts.\n  We have a balanced bill. As much as I appreciate the Senator's \nproposal, this .3 of a percent across-the-board cut will have a fairly \nsignificant impact on Homeland Security.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to an amendment by \nSenator Reed, followed by an amendment by Senator Dayton. After those \ntwo amendments are disposed of, we will have an hour of debate relative \nto the Vitter amendment, with Senator Durbin controlling 45 minutes and \nSenator Vitter controlling 15 minutes. And then we will proceed to a \nvote on the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from New Hampshire?\n  Mr. GREGG. I amend my request by saying that at the end of the hour \nof debate on Vitter, we will go to a vote in relation to the Vitter \namendment without any second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4613\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 4613.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4613.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To limit the reduction in operations within the Civil \n                Engineering Program of the Coast Guard)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. The Secretary of Homeland Security may not take \n     any action to alter or reduce operations within the Civil \n     Engineering Program of the Coast Guard nationwide, including \n     the civil engineering units, facilities, and design and \n     construction centers, the Coast Guard Academy, and the \n     Research and Development Center until the Committees on \n     Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of \n     the Senate receive and approve a plan on changes to the Civil \n     Engineering Program of the Coast Guard. The plan shall \n     include a description of the current functions of the Civil \n     Engineering Program and a description of any proposed \n     modifications of such functions and of any proposed \n     modification of personnel and offices, including the \n     rationale for such modification, an assessment of the costs \n     and benefits of such modification, any proposed alternatives \n     to such modification, and the processes utilized by the Coast \n     Guard and the Office of Management and Budget to analyze and \n     assess such modification.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would require the Coast Guard \nto report to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation on proposed changes to the civil engineering program \nbefore the Coast Guard takes any action to alter or reduce operations \nwithin this particular program. The mission of the civil engineering \nprogram is to provide high-quality planning and real property and \nfacilities maintenance to support Coast Guard units across the country. \nIn my judgment, reducing staff and reorganizing the civil engineering \nprogram is not appropriate, given the current workload and the \nincreased number of homeland security responsibilities taken on by the \nCoast Guard. If significant reductions in personnel and offices take \nplace, I have serious concern that the Coast Guard would not be able to \nadequately support its shore facilities in New England and across the \nNation.\n  The work performed by employees of the Coast Guard civil engineering \nprogram is of paramount importance. It is important that Congress \nreview any plan to reorganize or consolidate this program.\n  It is my understanding, hope, and expectation that the amendment will \nbe accepted by voice vote. I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Commerce Committee for their kindness.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4613.\n  The amendment (No. 4613) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 194, I voted ``yea.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``nay.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4663\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4663 and ask for \nits immediate consideration, and I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4663.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated for United States Customs \nand Border Protection salaries and expenses by $44,000,000 to place an \n additional 236 border patrol agents along the Northern Border and to \n     fully offset that amount with corresponding reductions in the \n         appropriations for administrative travel and printing)\n\n       On page 70, line 21, strike ``$5,285,874,000;'' and insert \n     ``$5,329,874,000, of which $44,000,000 shall be used to hire \n     an additional 236 border patrol agents.''.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) All amounts made available under this Act for \n     travel and transportation shall be reduced by $43,000,000.\n       (b) All amounts made available under this Act for printing \n     and reproduction shall be reduced by $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Murray for their \ngracious help in fashioning this amendment. It does not add any \nadditional funding to this bill. It does, however, redirect $44 million \nfrom travel and transportation, printing and reproduction to hire 236 \nadditional Border Patrol agents to protect our country's 5,525-mile \nnorthern border which covers 13 States, including my State of \nMinnesota. When Congress passed the 9/11 act in 2004, there were \nreportedly 994 Border Patrol agents working on our northern border. \nSince then that number has declined to 950 border guards, and only 250 \nof them are working at any one time.\n  I recognize the very serious needs on our southern border and fully \nsupport the need for additional Federal border guards there. The fact \nthat President Bush is calling yet again upon our National Guard to \nreinforce those southern border patrols evidences the shortsightedness \nof the administration and a majority in Congress opposed to Democratic \ncaucus efforts in the Senate 10 times during the past 4 years to \nincrease funding for Border Patrol and other homeland security efforts. \nOnce again, the administration says one thing but does another. Now it \nhas evidently actually reduced the number of northern Border Patrol \nagents since 2004, despite the 9/11 Commission in its report noting:\n\n       Despite examples of terrorists entering from Canada, \n     awareness of terrorist activity\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n     in Canada and its more lenient immigration laws, and an \n     inspector general's report recommending that the Border \n     Patrol develop a northern border strategy, the only positive \n     step was that the number of Border Patrol agents was not cut \n     any further, despite the fact that the only terrorist caught \n     entering the United States, millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam, \n     tried to come in from Canada. We also know that criminal \n     gangs are trafficking Asian sex workers in Canada into the \n     United States. The result is that Minnesota's northern border \n     counties such as Kittson and Lake of the Woods are struggling \n     by themselves to protect their communities from drug \n     traffickers and other illegal invaders. They say they can't \n     rely on Federal Border Patrol agents because there aren't any \n     there. These five or six-person local police and county \n     sheriff operations in northern Minnesota are nearly entirely \n     on their own.\n\n  My amendment will increase the number of northern Border Patrol \nagents across this country by 24 percent while taking nothing from our \nsouthern Border Patrol reinforcement.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4663) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4615, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was waiting in deference to the sponsor of the \namendment. I think it is appropriate for him to open the debate. Now I \nam told that my time is running because he is not here. I have no \noption or alternative but to speak to the amendment.\n  I cannot believe this amendment is being offered to this bill. This \nis a bill on homeland security. This amendment relates to a declaration \nof a disaster, a disaster like Hurricane Katrina. Do you know what \nhappens in times of disaster? You have probably seen it. Basic law \nenforcement breaks down. The police you expect to be there to manage \nthings are overwhelmed. There are too many things going on at once. The \nfire department, the police department are trying to maintain order in \nthe midst of chaos. Don't take my word for it. Remember what you saw on \nCNN around the clock. It was absolute chaos as people were being \nflooded out of their homes, desperately swimming through the water \ntrying to reach the Superdome, trying to find a safe place.\n  What happened was, the police decided under those circumstances they \nwanted to maintain order. So the first thing they said is: This is a \ngun-free area. When people go into the Superdome, they don't bring guns \ninto the Superdome because there are families there. There are mothers, \nfathers, and children. We are going to keep this as a gun-free area.\n  They obviously were sensitive to the fact that anyone can be \nvulnerable in a situation such as that. Imagine if your son or daughter \nis in a National Guard unit sent to this emergency trying to maintain \norder and snipers start shooting at them. It can happen. You may recall \nthe reports of gunfire going on in New Orleans. I have no idea how \nvalid those reports were. But it is understandable that law enforcement \nagencies in those situations will say: Wait a minute. We have to \nestablish order. We have to at least have a safe zone around our \nNational Guard troops so they don't get shot while they are down there \ntrying to save these poor people.\n\n  Do you recall all those people who were filing across the bridge? \nMothers were carrying babies. Imagine if someone was standing at the \ntop of that bridge with a gun saying: Give me your money, as they come \nby. The police are trying to maintain order. In those circumstances, \nwouldn't you want to give the police, law enforcement agencies, the \ntools they need to protect rescue workers, to protect National Guard \ntroops, to protect the mothers and fathers with their children who have \nbeen dispossessed from their homes? It is an obvious thing. It is \ncommonsense.\n  Along comes the Vitter amendment. Do you know what Mr. Vitter, my \ncolleague from Louisiana, suggests? None of the funds appropriated by \nthis act shall be used for the seizure of a firearm based on the \nexistence of a declaration of a state of emergency. You can't take the \nguns away. If they declare a disaster an emergency, you can't say to \npeople, this is a gun-free zone and we are taking your gun away.\n  Is that what the second amendment is all about? Is that what the \nright to bear arms is all about, in a state of an emergency, in an \neffort to restore order in a chaotic situation, that you want to take \naway the power of a law enforcement agency to say: You can't bring a \ngun into the Superdome because there are children in there trying to \nsleep and mothers trying to keep them together in the midst of a \ndisaster? Is that a violation of the second amendment to say if they \nare taking potshots at the National Guardsmen who are down there \nrisking their lives for those poor people in that situation, that we \nare going to stop the guns from being close to where they are staying, \nwhere they are living? Is that a violation of the second amendment to \nsay if somebody is using a gun which they might legally have but using \nit in an illegal fashion, you can't take the gun away?\n  That is what this amendment does. This is an incredible amendment. I \ncan't believe that we would want to tie the hands of law enforcement in \nthe midst of an emergency situation, when it is difficult to maintain \nlaw and order.\n  Years and years ago I went to law school in Washington. In 1968, I \nwas sitting in my law school library, where I should have spent a lot \nmore time. This city turned into pure chaos with the assassination of \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. There were riots in the streets. Buildings \nwere being burned. People were being arrested for looting and arson by \nthe hundreds and thousands. The whole system disintegrated.\n  They went to the law schools and said: You are going to be lawyers \ntoday. You are going to represent people. The system was out of \ncontrol. We were trying to establish order. We were trying to give to \nthe police what they needed to get things settled down to keep people \nsafe, to protect innocent victims.\n  I lived through it. I saw it. You have seen it, maybe not in your \npersonal life, but following it on television. Yet, what we have here \nin the Vitter amendment is, it takes away the authority of law \nenforcement to take a gun from a person even if it is a threat to a \nhelpless victim in a disaster or if it is a threat to a National Guard \ntrooper or if it is a threat to another law enforcement agency.\n  Let me tell you what else. In his original version of the amendment, \nwhich he has changed, the Senator says we will make an exception--I \nwant to make sure I get this right. If you see someone who has a gun, \nwhich could be seized under Federal or State law in a criminal \ninvestigation--think about that, this is a gun that may have been used \nto murder someone--you can take that gun in the midst of a disaster. \nThey took that out. So if someone is standing there with a gun that you \nknow was used in a criminal situation for a murder, they take away the \nauthority of the law enforcement people to even seize that gun if \nsomeone has declared a disaster.\n  What are we thinking? Why would we do this to the men and women in \nlaw enforcement, to the National Guardsmen, or to innocent victims, \nwhich could be you or me or people we love, in a disaster they cannot \neven anticipate? Why would we do that?\n  I will tell you why. We are doing it for the National Rifle \nAssociation. We are doing it for the gun lobby. In their devotion to \nthe second amendment, they have closed their eyes to the obvious. \nOwning guns legally and using guns legally in America is a protected \nright in Illinois and most States. But to take a situation that is a \ndisaster, when the law has broken down and to say that you won't allow \nlaw enforcement to take a gun away that might be used to hurt an \ninnocent person, that just goes too far.\n  I reserve the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I again stand to strongly support this \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote for its passage.\n  I have only been able to listen to some of the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. I really think he has been \nwatching a very different disaster and scenario than I experienced and \nlived through on the ground in Louisiana. I can tell you that the \nconfiscations we are talking about were not from the criminals he is \nreferring to--by the way, confiscations from criminals who are engaged \nin criminal activity can still occur under my amendment. The police \nhave the power and the authority to enforce the law, which includes \napprehending criminals and taking weapons away from criminals \ncommitting criminal acts.\n  The confiscations I have been talking about that happened in the \ndisaster area were from law-abiding citizens. They were law-abiding \ncitizens who didn't have a phone line to communicate with the police or \nanyone else. They were law-abiding citizens who were isolated in their \nhomes, frightened, and only had their own resources and witnesses and, \nyes, in some cases, firearms, to protect themselves and their families \nand to protect their possessions. Those are the confiscations that \nhappened. Those are the confiscations we are trying to prevent.\n  And, of course, this amendment would in no way prevent confiscations \nfrom criminals, those involved in criminal activity. Of course, the \npolice have the full power and authority to enforce the law in that \nsituation, as they do at all other times.\n  That is why the Fraternal Order of Police strongly supports this \namendment. That is why they have written a letter expressing that \nstrong support. I would like to read a portion of it:\n\n       Your amendment would prohibit the use of any funds \n     appropriated under this legislation from paying for the \n     seizure of firearms during a major disaster or emergency, \n     except under circumstances currently applicable under Federal \n     and State law. As we witnessed in the communities along the \n     Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, large-scale \n     critical incidents demand the full attention of law \n     enforcement officers and other first responders. During this \n     time, the preservation of life-search and rescue missions is \n     the chief priority of every first responder. Further, \n     breakdowns in communications systems and disaster-related \n     transportation or other infrastructure failures will lengthen \n     a law enforcement agency's response times, increasing the \n     degree to which citizens may have to protect themselves \n     against criminals. A law-abiding citizen who possesses a \n     firearm lawfully represents no danger to law enforcement \n     officers or any other first responder.\n\n  That is why the Fraternal Order of Police are supporting this \namendment, as well as, yes, the NRA, who supports this amendment. I say \nthat proudly. I don't say it with any fear that it brings disrespect to \nthe cause.\n  With that, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this is not a curious amendment. It has \nnothing to do with the Superdome in New Orleans at the time of Katrina, \nbecause if law enforcement people were standing at the door and they \nsaid you could not enter with a legal or illegal firearm, you could not \nenter. But the Senator from Illinois would like to suggest to you that \nthis is to stop chaos within the Superdome.\n  That is flatly false. It is important that you understand that. That \nwould not prohibit--if we want to fast forward, God forbid, to a \nnational disaster in Chicago of an unprecedented kind, and for the \npolice to say for those seeking sanctuary at the McCormack Center, you \ncannot bring guns in here--this amendment would not prohibit that. This \namendment agrees with a Federal judge who got an injunction to stop the \nchief of police of New Orleans from acting illegally. That is what it \ndid.\n  I am not going to judge the chief of police. He has resigned and is \nlong gone. He left town. He was in a crisis situation. But in this \ninstance the Senator from Illinois is right. When law enforcement \nbreaks down in a national or local disaster, should not the private \ncitizen who legally owns a firearm have the right to protect themselves \nand their property? The answer for 200 years in this Nation is \nabsolutely yes.\n  I will give you a couple of situations. A little old lady is sitting \non her porch in New Orleans with a shotgun across her lap. Why? Because \nthere were marauders in her neighborhood who were stealing and robbing. \nShe was protecting her home, property, and life. The police came and \nripped the gun out of her hand and said, Get out of our way. That \nhappened. I saw it on videotape. It happened. She had not shot anybody. \nShe was deterring those from entering her home and stealing her life \nsavings.\n  Another example: A couple is moving down one of the canals of New \nOrleans in their boat. They lost their home and they were in their \nboat, and it was post-Katrina. They were stopped by the local water \npatrol in the area, who said, Do you have a firearm on board, and they \nsaid, Yes, we do. Is it legal? Yes, it is; here are the papers. Give us \nyour gun. That is what happened. That is really what happened in New \nOrleans. A Federal judge finally stepped in and said, Stop that, you \ncannot do it, and, by the way, the thousands of firearms that you have \nconfiscated, give them back, they are private property. Guess what \nhappened. They didn't give them back because they kept no records. They \nwere on a massive sweep. Even some of the local police who were \ninterviewed were embarrassed because they were taking guns away from \npeople and they knew it was their only defense in protecting their own \nproperty.\n  Is the Senator from Illinois denying the basic right of property, \ndefense, self-defense, and family defense in a national disaster when \nlaw enforcement breaks down? You bet he is. But the Senator from \nLouisiana is saying quite the opposite. The Senator from Louisiana is \nalso saying that current law, Federal law, is in no way abridged here. \nThat is fundamentally important. Circumstances can get very, very \ndifficult.\n  I would not want to prejudge the former chief of police of New \nOrleans in an impossible situation. When criminal elements were \nmisusing firearms, as they always do, but where private citizens were \nprotecting property, as they can and should have the right to do with \nthe use of their firearms, in his broad sweep of a desire to protect, \nhe took everything. That should not happen. When I saw it happening and \nwhen I heard about it, I said, Not in America; that is not the way this \ncountry works.\n\n  But for a moment in time, that is the way it worked in New Orleans, \nuntil a Federal judge stepped up and said, You are out of bounds and \noff of the law, so stop it. That is what happened.\n  Now, this should not have been done in the Superdome, and there were \nnone. This amendment would not prohibit that. It would not deny current \nlaw and the right of the police to so designate. But it would prohibit \nthe kind of order that would create the sweep of law-abiding citizens \nwho were using a firearm for the protection of their property, their \nlife, and their family's life.\n  The day we give up the right of self-protection in this country by \nlaw-abiding citizens is the day we become the victims of government. \nThat is something that should never be allowed.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for offering the amendment. It is \nappropriate, timely, and I hope our colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 6 minutes. The \nSenator from Illinois has 37 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Massachusetts here. \nI will speak briefly.\n  What the Senator from Louisiana understands, and I think will \nconcede, is that this is the third version of this amendment. It has \nbeen written and rewritten and rewritten again. What you have heard \ndescribed may reflect an earlier version, but it doesn't reflect what \nis before us, I say to the Senator from Idaho. I respect him and I know \nhe has a good understanding of the Constitution and the laws.\n  Let me read the words in the amendment before us:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this act shall be used \n     for the seizure of a firearm based on the existence of a \n     declaration of a state of emergency.\n\n  Did you hear a reference to existing State and local law exemption, \nwhich both the Senator from Louisiana and Idaho referred to? No.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me ask, if we had a 9/11-type situation and you had \nWal-Mart that was closed down, with broken windows, and they have a \nseries of guns in the back, and K-Mart and pawn shops were broken down, \ndoes the purpose of this for first responders say they have to leave \nthose guns on the shelves so that looters can arm themselves and \nterrorize a community? Would that be the result, in your reading of \nthis?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is so broad that that is exactly what would happen. \nAll of the commonsense explanations you have heard notwithstanding, \nthat is not what the amendment says.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me ask further, did not the Senator from Idaho--I \nknow the Senator from New Jersey and myself have indicated that if they \nwanted to go ahead and have some way that individuals could demonstrate \nthey had a legitimate ownership of that gun, they would be immune from \nthis amendment. That was rejected, as I understand it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator that if the Senator from Idaho and \nthe Senator from Louisiana want to put together an amendment that \nallows me to protect my home, as you have described, with my legally \nowned firearm, I have no objection to that. There are circumstances \nhere that we could write into it, but as it is written, this prohibits \nthe seizure of a firearm based on the existence of a declaration of a \nstate of emergency. That covers it all. If they are firing on National \nGuardsmen and they say we are going to have a gun-free area around \nwhere the Guardsmen are living, you could not seize the guns. You could \nnot take them away, according to the Vitter amendment.\n  Earlier versions of the amendment were much more explicit and they \nwent through explanations, and the Senator, because he is on an \nappropriations bill and has procedural challenges, took out the \nlanguage that clarifies what he is trying to do, and what he left \nbehind is language that goes too far.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am grateful for the leadership of the \nSenator from Illinois. That is why the International Brotherhood of \nPolice and the Major Chiefs of Police for the Major Cities strongly \noppose this amendment, because it interferes with a police officer's \ndiscretion to react as he or she sees fit under extreme emergency \ncircumstances. The International Brotherhood of Police also notes that \nresponsible gun owners who continue to act in accordance with federal, \nstate, and local law are unlikely to have their guns confiscated unless \nthey use or possess the guns in a manner or place that would be \nprohibited or threatening. That's why they aren't endorsing this \namendment.\n  We are here today talking about the increase in availability and \naccessibility. Today's USA Today is talking about the extraordinary \ngrowth in crime that is taking place in communities across this \ncountry. And one of the reasons that the police chiefs give is because \nof the accessibility and availability of what? Guns.\n  So the Senator from Louisiana is saying we want to make these guns in \ncrisis situations more accessible, more available, when you have thugs \nand those who go out and loot the unfortunate. What possible sense does \nthat make? It makes sense from the NRA's point of view, but when you \nare trying to have a community that is subject to that kind of \nviolence, that makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Mr. President, we get to the question, well, if people are law-\nabiding and they own those weapons, guess what? The NRA will not let \nyou list or gather the list for legitimate law-abiding people. They \ndon't want anybody on the list. They won't let you collect names.\n\n  As the Senator from New Jersey has pointed out, at the time of 9/11 \nwhen we had all of those terrorists here, you could find out where they \nspent the night, you could find out what they charged on their credit \ncards, you could find out what cars they rented or what hotels they \nstayed in, but you couldn't find out where they bought their guns. Why? \nBecause of the NRA. They said they won't permit anyone to keep records.\n  This is payoff time, payback time to the National Rifle Association, \nand it will be payoff time if this goes through.\n  The next time, the Lord only knows, when we have a natural disaster \nor terrorist attack, when people are at a height of anxiety and places \nthat have these weapons are deserted--not only handguns, but rifles and \nsometimes even machine guns--we are going to find that the school is \nout: First responders, leave them alone. Sure we are having strife and \nviolence in the streets, but the Vitter amendment is going to protect \nthe second amendment and leave that alone.\n  That is hogwash, Mr. President. That isn't security. This makes a \nsham of the Homeland Security bill--a sham of it. And that is what this \namendment is.\n  As the Senator from Illinois has pointed out, it is very simple:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated by this Act--\n\n  That means nothing, no first responders--\n\n     shall be used for the seizure of a firearm based on the \n     existence of a declaration or state of emergency.\n       If there is any harm out there whatsoever, no first \n     responder can see it. If a gun is lying out there and there \n     is a terrorist who wants to grab it and cause mayhem, the \n     Vitter amendment says the first responder cannot seize it. Go \n     ahead, help yourself, help yourself; go on in that shop and \n     take every rifle and piece of ammunition you want. Why? \n     Because we are first responders. And then come on out and \n     cause havoc.\n\n  That is what this says, not what some have stated it says. Read the \nlanguage. The language is clear. That is what it says, and that is why \nthis makes absolutely no sense.\n  We talk about trying to deal with the problems of violence in our \ncommunities. We see the proliferation of violence that is taking place, \nand we are going to make it easier in times of crisis to go out and get \nmore guns when, on the front page of the newspapers, they say this is a \ncontributor to the growth in violence that is taking place in all of \nour communities in this country.\n  If you want to be in the tank for the NRA, be our guest because that \nis what this is all about.\n  This amendment makes absolutely no sense in terms of the safety and \nsecurity of our communities in times of crisis, in times of natural \ndisasters, and in times of potential terrorists in this country. That \nis the time we need restraint. That is the time we need responsibility. \nThat is the time we ought to follow the first responders who are \ntrained for these kinds of crises, but what we know is those \nindividuals think this amendment makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 29\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \non this issue because, frankly, it is so hard to comprehend that it \nneeds clarification.\n  What are we talking about? We are saying if people have guns, and \nthey are caught up in the chaos of a natural disaster, with people \nbeing chased out of their homes, people being rescued from rooftops, \npeople begging for assistance, hanging out of windows, and so forth, if \nyou have the wrong person who is hollering for help, and you are a \nfirst responder and you go into that house, you could get shot.\n  What is the sense of this? We are not saying you are being deprived \nof a privilege at that point. What is the privilege? To maybe kill a \nneighbor? Mr. President, if there are 30,000 people in a place that \ncannot accommodate that number, and in the middle of that confusion, in \nthe middle of that frustration, in the middle of the anger and the rage \nthat has to follow because you have been taken out of your home, or \nmaybe don't know where your children are or where your spouse is, and \nthe mental attitude that could exist in that situation, and they are \nmaking sure you have your pet pistol handy?\n  It is outrageous, and it should not be allowed. We have to vote \nagainst the Vitter amendment because what it attempts to do is to make \nsure there is protection. The protection, however, is for the NRA. \nNational Rifle Association really means ``No Records Available'' and \nthat is ridiculous that we\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\ndon't want to have lethal weapons controlled in times of crisis.\n  I am sure the Senator from Louisiana is reacting to a situation. To \nput it bluntly, I think the Vitter amendment would put the lives of \npolice officers, National Guard troops, rescuers, and victims of a \ndisaster in far greater danger. The Vitter amendment would prevent law \nenforcement officials and rescuers, first responders from collecting \nfirearms from individuals, even temporarily, during an emergency or \nmajor disaster.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If a situation arose where a home is abandoned, and \nthere are guns--say there were two guns and ammunition available and \nfirst responders came in, the house has been abandoned and looters are \nout there looking around in different buildings, the way I read this \namendment is if the first responders get there first and they see these \ntwo rifles or additional handguns, the first responders will be \nprohibited from removing those weapons, preventing them from the \npossibility of falling into the hands of the looters; am I correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is absolutely correct. Imagine this in \nresponse to what the Senator is saying: There were felons turned loose \non the streets, there were looters occupying homes or anything to get \nthemselves out of the flood or out of the way and steal anything, and \nhere we give them a present. Not only did they find a roof over their \nhead, they found guns.\n  So someone innocently trying to be of help comes in, such as an \nambulance group, a physician, a coastguardsmen--look how gallant the \nCoast Guard people were--and imagine they try to break their way into a \nwindow to rescue someone they know is in there, and some crazy is there \nwith a gun. Everybody knows, despite the fact that the person coming \ninto the house wants to be of help--visualize what is taking place in \nsome of the major cities across our country, where fire trucks \nresponding to a fire are shot at. Here we are going to say: Wait a \nsecond, don't take away their guns. Maybe we ought to take away the \nfire engine, but don't take away their guns.\n  It is the NRA button. It has been pushed by the organization, and \nthey are saying: Hey, don't let them encroach on our weapon ownership, \neven if the crisis is one that is going to take lives, as we saw in \nKatrina. Imagine being in that facility, that hall with all those \npeople who were desperate to find some way out of that mess and someone \nstarts an argument. Pistols, guns around? Outrageous.\n  What it means is that our law enforcement community will not be able \nto, even temporarily, hold weapons to protect other victims of the \ncommunity at large during this crisis. At the next evacuation center, \nsuch as the Louisiana Superdome, we should allow people to roam around \nthat facility with guns and assault weapons? What happens if someone \nwants to steal something they see one of their neighbors has and an \nargument ensues? The lawfulness is gone. They will be totally out of \ncontrol giving somebody a gun like that.\n  I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to write a law that \ntook guns away from domestic abusers of children and spouses. We had a \nhuge fight over it and finally we got it through. It was 1998. Since \nthen, we have had over 100,000 gun permits denied to people who get so \nenraged that they beat up their kids, their spouse, their wives, their \nhusbands, and the NRA was in there fighting every inch along the way: \nOh, no, don't deprive the people of their freedom to beat up their \nwife, beat up their kids, and maybe if they are drunk enough, they may \nwant to take a couple of shots at members of their household. No, we \nstopped that.\n  We plead with the Senator from Louisiana: Don't force us to vote on \nthis amendment. Don't do it. Think about the people in Louisiana and \nthink about what it might have been like in New Orleans at that time, \nwith water running over the rooftops in many cases. Now we are asking \nfor the right to prohibit law enforcement from confiscating guns if \nthey knew where they are? Perhaps one of these people who had a gun, \nbeen arrested and convicted for domestic abuse still has the gun--let \nthem sit there with a gun and try to enter into a household that is \ndisturbed? It is not right, not fair.\n  The Senate is going to tell law enforcement officials who are trying \nto control these facilities that they are powerless: Keep your hands \noff those guns, policemen, FBI agents, FEMA people; keep your hands off \nthose guns. Our police and Federal law enforcement officers are the \nfirst line of defense in terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and \nthey have to have some degree of discretion.\n  The International Brotherhood of Police Officers thinks this about \nthe Vitter amendment:\n\n       The IBPO stands by our brothers and sisters in law \n     enforcement and disapproves of any legislation that may \n     interfere with a police officer's discretion to react as he \n     or she sees fit under extreme emergency circumstances.\n       Furthermore, the IBPO believes that responsible gun owners \n     who act in accordance with Federal, State and local law are \n     unlikely to have their guns confiscated unless they use or \n     possess the guns in a manner or place that would be \n     prohibited or threatening.\n\n  They are confirming that this is a bad idea.\n  The Vitter amendment would make it almost impossible for officials to \nset up safe areas during an emergency. It would turn evacuation centers \ninto the Wild West. Take the guns and set them up in a safe area so \nthey are returned to the owners. However, be careful to make sure that \nthe original owner, the person who turned the gun in, isn't really a \nfelon on the loose. Police know that large crowds, confined quarters, \nand limited amounts of food and water will lead to high tempers and \nleave people on the edge.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes \nmore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chair.\n  Understandably, police don't want guns in those shelters. The police \nmust have the right to make that shelter a gun-free area. So what do \nthey do? They say: Hey, Joe, turn in that gun; turn it in, and as soon \nas you are settled, we will keep it in safekeeping for you, and we will \ngive you back your gun. But meanwhile, don't permit that gun owner, in \na moment of rage, to do damage that is irreparable.\n  The fact is, our law enforcement community has to have the ability to \nmake decisions that it believes will ensure the health and safety of \nthe community at large. There is no valid reason law enforcement \nagencies should be prevented from doing their job in times of \nemergency. Let's not make it tougher for them. What do we want to do in \ntimes of crisis such as a flood, an earthquake, a hurricane, a tornado? \nAt times like that, do we want to make it tougher for our emergency \nresponse people to carry out the duties they volunteer for, typically, \nand do so efficiently, under dangerous circumstances to themselves?\n  Let the NRA say: Come on, come on, let's let them have their guns. \nWhat is the difference? So they may take a shot or two. That is how it \nsounds to me, and I hope it sounds the same way to others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my request \nwith respect to vote No. 194 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish the Senator from Louisiana had \noffered this and just said: That is the way we want it in Louisiana. \nThat would be OK. But why he wants to do this so it will affect my \nState of Massachusetts or other States is something I find \nunacceptable.\n  I quote here from Superintendent Warren Riley. He was the \nsuperintendent of police in New Orleans. He said:\n\n       Most of the weapons were not taken from the hands of gun \n     owners. Instead, they were seized from empty homes where \n     evacuees left them behind to prevent looters from getting \n     their hands on them.\n\n  Well, if we accept the Vitter amendment, they won't have that \nopportunity to do it again. If that was the\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\npurpose, for gun owners to be able to have it, then the Vitter \namendment should be redrafted. That isn't what his amendment says. \nUnder the Vitter amendment, the police chief and the police chief in \nBoston or Springfield or Worcester or New Bedford or Fall River or any \none of our communities would not be able to provide protection for the \ncitizens of those communities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Vitter has 6 \nminutes remaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the interest of bringing this debate to a close--we \nhave had much more time than you have--I will make a few closing \nremarks and then give the floor to the Senator from Louisiana to close. \nI would ask the Senator from Louisiana if he is going to request a \nrollcall vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for responding, and I will be as \nbrief as I can. I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and New \nJersey.\n  Understand the situation we are talking about. This is not ordinary \nlife in America. It is a time of a national emergency. It is a time of \ndisaster. God forbid something like 9/11 should occur again; or \nHurricane Katrina. It is an extraordinary circumstance where ordinary \nlife is challenged, and we are just this close to seeing our society \ndisintegrate, and the law enforcement officials are trying to keep \nthings together. People are injured. People are pushed out of their \nhomes. Fires are taking place. Chaos is reigning, and they are trying \nto keep the society together. So they make it clear that in some \nplaces, you can't use guns. Where you might have been able to use them \nunder ordinary circumstances, because of a disaster, you cannot use \nthem.\n  The example I use is you send the National Guardsmen in, they are \nsent in by the hundreds and thousands to maintain order, and then \nsnipers start shooting at them. The police make it known that this will \nbe a gun-free zone. We are going to confiscate every gun. We don't want \nany National Guardsmen killed because of this emergency, this disaster. \nIs that unreasonable? Not if it is your son or daughter who is a member \nof the National Guard.\n  But according to the Vitter amendment, the Vitter amendment would \nprohibit the seizure of a firearm based on the existence or a \ndeclaration of an emergency. You couldn't seize the firearm to protect \nthe National Guardsmen or those, as the Senator from New Jersey said, \ndriving down the street trying to put out the fire. People are shooting \nat them and they say: That is it, we are clearing the guns away from \nthese major highways. We don't want people to be shooting at policemen \nand firemen and rescue workers. We don't want snipers killing people \nwho are piling sandbags to save levees. Is any of that unreasonable? It \nsounds like exactly what we want our law enforcement agencies to do. \nBut the Vitter amendment will tie their hands. The Vitter amendment \nwill stop them.\n  One Senator came up to me on the floor and said: This doesn't sound \nlike the Vitter amendment that was described to me earlier. It is not. \nThis is the second rewrite of the original amendment. Each time Senator \nVitter has rewritten it, in fairness to him, he has had to comply with \nSenate rules and he has had to change the wording, and now the wording \nis terrible. It no longer allows for existing State and Federal and \nlocal law enforcement, it no longer allows for the confiscation of guns \nthat you know were used in the commission of a crime. These were in an \nearlier version of the amendment, but they are no longer there. It just \nsays you can't use any of the funds in this act to seize a firearm \nbased on the existence or the declaration of a state of emergency. It \nis the wrong way to go.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Louisiana that I hope he will withdraw \nthis amendment. If he wants to do what the Senator from Idaho suggests, \nwhich is to put in an amendment to allow people to protect their own \nhomes with their own legally owned firearms, I am not going to object \nto that. I don't think we should. But in this situation, in a disaster \nor an emergency, to say that law enforcement cannot control the flow of \nfirearms--God forbid we face terrorism again in America and those \npeople are armed and the law enforcement agencies don't have the power \nto take the guns away from them in a state of emergency. What are we \nthinking?\n  I hope the Senator from Louisiana will reconsider his position. I \nwill yield the floor at this point and allow him to close, and then we \ncan move to a rollcall if he requests one.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in closing and in support of my amendment, \nI wish to make four brief points.\n  First of all, I reiterate the widespread support for this amendment \nfrom many quarters, including the Fraternal Order of Police, a leading \norganization of law enforcement personnel. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis strong letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2006.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our \n     support for an amendment you intend to offer to H.R. 5441, \n     the FY2007 appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Your amendment would prohibit the use of any funds \n     appropriated under this legislation from paying for the \n     seizure of firearms during a major disaster or emergency, \n     except under circumstances currently applicable under Federal \n     or State law. As we witnessed in the communities along the \n     Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, large scale \n     critical incidents demand the full attention of law \n     enforcement officers and other first responders. During this \n     time, the preservation of life-search and rescue missions--is \n     the chief priority of every first responder. Further, \n     breakdowns in communications systems and disaster-related \n     transportation or other infrastructure failures will lengthen \n     a law enforcement agency's response times, increasing the \n     degree to which citizens may have to protect themselves \n     against criminals. A law-abiding citizen who possess a \n     firearm lawfully represents no danger to law enforcement \n     officers or any other first responder.\n       On behalf of the more than 324,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I am pleased to offer our support for this \n     amendment and look forward to working with you to getting it \n     passed. If I can be of any further assistance on this issue, \n     lease do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim \n     Pasco in my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Secondly, Mr. President, I will also request that the \nfollowing list be printed in the Record. It is a list of 10 States that \nhave already passed State law doing exactly what we are going to do \nhere on the floor of the Senate today, and that is simply say that a \ndeclaration or a state of emergency in and of itself does not give law \nenforcement the right to confiscate firearms held in legal possession. \nTen States have already done that. One additional State, the State of \nOhio, has pending legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Emergency Powers 2006\n\n       Alaska--HB 400, sponsored by Representative John Coghill \n     (R-11) passed out of the Senate 19-1 (4/27); House concurred \n     on Senate amendments 30-4 on (4/28); signed by Governor Frank \n     Murkowski (R) on May 18.\n       Idaho--SB 1401; passed Senate unanimously 34-0 and passed \n     House 59-6; signed by Governor Dirk Kempthorne (R) on March \n     30.\n       Florida--HB 285, sponsored by Representative Mitch \n     Needelman (R-31) unanimously passed the House 116-0 and \n     passed the Senate 40-0; signed by Governor Jeb Bush (R) on \n     June 7.\n       Kentucky--HB 290, the ``Gun Owner Protection Act'' \n     sponsored by Representative Robert Damron (D-39), includes: \n     prohibits government officials from restricting the rights of \n     law-abiding gun owners during declared states of emergency. \n     HB 290 passed the House with a vote of 89-7 on February 15 \n     and passed the Senate with a vote of 35-2 on March 24.

Janis \n     (R-56), unanimously passed House 97-0 (2/08) and Senate 40-0 \n     (3/7); signed by Governor Tim Kaine (D) on April 4.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to make a third point, which is \nthat, quite frankly, I find it somewhat ironic that the Senator from \nIllinois would welcome more detailed language, as I did have in the \nearlier draft, because the reason we don't have slightly more detailed \nlanguage on the floor is because of a rule XVI objection by the \nleadership, the Democratic leadership, those working against the \namendment in conjunction with the Senator from Illinois. So they \nobjected to more detailed language in one breath, and then after we \nredrafted the amendment to comply with Senate rules regarding \ngermaneness, they object to less detailed language in the next. You \ncan't have it both ways.\n  The fourth and final point is that the language we do have on the \nSenate floor goes to the heart of the issue and protects fundamental \nsecond amendment rights.\n  There is one point I strongly agree with the Senator from Illinois \nabout, and that is that we are not talking about ordinary life in \nAmerica, an ordinary day; we are talking about a time of emergency \nwhere everything is different, where the world is turned upside down.\n  It is exactly that very reason that this second amendment right to \nbear arms and use legally possessed firearms in defense of yourself, \nyour life, and your property is so crucial, because you know what, your \nphone line in this very unique situation doesn't work, your cell phone \nand Blackberry don't work, there is no communication, and you can't \nreach out to the law enforcement authorities and have them there in a \nreasonable amount of time when your home is being broken into. All of \nthat is gone. All of that is gone. The only thing that remains, in many \ninstances, is your legally possessed firearm. That is the only thing \nfor the defense of yourself, your life, your family's life and health, \nand your possessions. That is exactly why protecting this fundamental \nconstitutional right is so very important, precisely for this sort of \ntime of emergency.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey made some remarks and read \na letter talking about leaving it up to the judgment and discretion of \nlaw enforcement personnel. Well, I have great respect in general for \nlaw enforcement personnel, but I don't think their judgment or their \ndiscretion trumps the Constitution, and that is what happened and that \nis the attitude many of them took, unfortunately, after Hurricane \nKatrina in Louisiana. They thought their judgment and their discretion \ntrumped the Constitution. They confiscated legally held firearms from \nlaw-abiding citizens, in some cases literally older, defenseless women, \nolder citizens trapped in their homes with a legally possessed firearm \nas their only means of defense. That should never happen again. The \nConstitution, the second amendment, should never be abused again, \nparticularly in such a state of emergency.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis commonsense, straightforward amendment. It is supported by the \nFraternal Order of Police, it is supported by the National Rifle \nAssociation, which intends to grade this vote, and I urge all Members \nto offer their support for this straightforward, commonsense amendment.\n  With that, I yield back my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 4618, 4616, 4578, 4592, 4638, as Modified, 4642, as \n  Modified, 4619, as Modified, 4635, as Modified, 4550, as Modified, \n           4624, as Modified, and 4661, as Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, today I rise to support and cosponsor \nSenator Specter's amendment to make sure funding to nonprofit \ninstitutions that are at high risk of terrorist attack receive the \nfunds we have given to them. I have worked with my colleague from \nPennsylvania on legislation to help nonprofits that serve communities \nthroughout the Nation but that are threatened daily by the risk of \nterrorist attack. We have also worked together to provide these \nvulnerable communities with needed funding for the past 2 years. Yet \ndespite our efforts to protect these ``soft targets'' of terrorism, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has refused to release any of last \nyear's money to these nonprofits. This is unacceptable. Today, we are \nmaking it clear that the $25 million provided for nonprofits must be \nspent to protect these institutions.\n  We are all aware of recent terrorist attacks in the United States, \nSpain, Germany, Iraq, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Turkey. These \nattacks by al-Qaida on an international Red Cross building, synagogues, \ntrain stations, hotels, airports, restaurants, night clubs, and \ncultural centers, show its willingness to attack ``soft targets'' of \nall types in order to conduct its campaign of terror.\n  I want to make sure that our communities are safe and the buildings \nwhere citizens live, learn and work are strong and secure to safeguard \nAmerican lives in the event of a terrorist attack. Local communities \nare on the front lines in our war against terrorism. This Congress must \ndo its share to make sure that they do not have to bear the full cost \nof this war. We have done this by providing funds for security \nenhancements in buildings that Americans visit everyday. Yet DHS has \nfailed to give local communities the funds they need. DHS has not \nreleased any of the funds despite instruction from Congress to do so.\n  This amendment is very simple--it requires the Office for State and \nLocal Government Coordination and Preparedness to release the $25 \nmillion Congress provided to enhance the security and safety to these \nnonprofits. This funding will help nonprofits make the needed security \nimprovements to protect these ``soft targets'' of terrorism. These \nnonprofits are worried now, they are under threat now, and they need \nour help now. This Congress has acted and now DHS must act now to make \nthese nonprofits and the communities that they serve safer and \nstronger.\n  As a nation our priority in fighting the war on terror is to be \nsafer, stronger, and smarter so that we are able to better detect, \nprevent and respond to acts of terrorism. This amendment gets us one \nstep closer to meeting those goals by making vulnerable targets smarter \nin detecting and preventing terrorist attacks and by making sure that \nif terror strikes one of these facilities, security and safety measures \nare in place to protect the lives of those inside and around these \nbuildings.\n  Nothing the Senate does is more important than providing America \nsecurity and Americans safety. I am pleased that this amendment has \nbeen accepted because it does exactly that. In the battle to protect \nour nation from terrorist attacks, we must be sure to provide \nassistance to these high-risk nonprofit organizations that provide \nvital health, social, cultural, and educational services to the \nAmerican people.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4616\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to improve the \nNation's preparedness and response to natural disasters and terrorist \nattacks.\n  This amendment is based on legislation that I introduced last year, \nthe Mass Evacuation Exercise Assistance Act of 2005, S. 2043, which \nwould implement a recommendation in the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's report ``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation \nStill Unprepared'' that Federal agencies work with State and local \nofficials to develop evacuation plans.\n  That bill would address a gaping hole in our Nation's disaster \npreparedness by providing grants for evacuation exercises and the \nimplementation of emergency response plans. It would establish a grant \nprogram to ensure that\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\ncities across America have the resources they need to develop \ncomprehensive evacuation plans; stage drills and exercises to practice \nand perfect evacuation procedures; and stockpile the materials needed \nto supply evacuation areas. In addition, the legislation would help \ncities prepare for future emergencies and evacuations to ensure that \ntheir citizens will be evacuated quickly and safely should a natural \ndisaster or terrorist attack occur. Otherwise, like the victims of \nHurricane Katrina, citizens can easily become trapped without food or \nwater in a devastated area or along an escape route.\n  Based on that bill, S. 2043, my amendment today specifically includes \nevacuation exercises among the list of activities funded by homeland \nsecurity grants. Evacuation planning and exercises are already \npermitted, but adding the words ``evacuation preparation and \nexercises'' to the bill would encourage state and local governments to \nrequest homeland security funds for that particular purpose. States and \nlocalities need to practice their evacuation plans in order to test and \nimprove their systems before they must be executed in real emergencies.\n  The Department of Homeland Security recently reported to Congress \nthat many states, territories, and urban areas lack confidence in the \nadequacy and feasibility of their plans to deal with catastrophic \nevents. The Department's report also highlighted the importance of \nexercises in preparing first responders for disasters and revealing \nshortcomings in disaster plans. The Washington Post recently called for \nincreased attention to evacuation exercises and disaster preparation in \npreventing a reoccurrence of the disaster that followed Hurricane \nKatrina. According to the Post, the insufficient Federal and local \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina was ``a failure of execution, not \nprediction.''\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to support this important \namendment to strengthen our Nation's emergency and disaster \npreparedness and response.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4619\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. This measure would \ndirect the Secretary of Homeland Security to revise existing procedures \nand establish new methods for expeditiously clearing the names of \nindividuals who have been mistakenly placed on a terrorist database \nlist, including the Transportation Security Administration's, TSA, No-\nFly and Selectee watch list, or who have names identical to or \nsubstantially similar to names on these database lists. The Secretary \nof Homeland Security would report the revised procedures to Congress no \nlater than 6 months after enactment of this bill.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the TSA and other \nGovernment agencies have maintained terrorist database lists containing \nthe names of individuals suspected of posing a risk of terrorism or \nother threat to airline or passenger safety. The TSA watch list \ncontains the names of individuals who have been placed into two \ncategories. One is the group of individuals in the ``No Fly'' category. \nAny individual whose name appears in this category will not be \npermitted to board a commercial flight, as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and other Federal agencies have deemed that person is a known \nterrorist or someone who has solid ties to terrorist activity. The \nsecond category is known as ``Selectees,'' and they may be on this list \nfor a variety of reasons, such as attempting to pass a weapon through a \nsecurity checkpoint or otherwise exhibiting behavior that presents \nsuspicion that the person may engage in future terrorist acts, even \nthough information about the individual is not sufficient to place them \nin the ``No Fly'' category.\n  Unfortunately, thousands of innocent passengers have been placed on \nthe TSA watch list mistakenly or, as is often the case, because they \nhave the same name as others on the list. This prevents those \npassengers from using the internet or electronic kiosks located at the \nairport to check in when they fly. This causes these passengers to wait \nin long lines to be cleared by airline personnel at the check-in \ncounter, sometimes even resulting in missed flights.\n  The TSA procedure for differentiating the innocent travelers from \nthose who pose a threat is long and still results in the cleared \npassengers having to check in at the counter and present a clearance \nletter from the TSA. In other words, after going through the clearance \nand verification process, innocent passengers still cannot use the \ninternet and kiosks that airlines rely on for passengers to obtain \ntheir boarding passes.\n  I truly hope that as a result of this amendment, the TSA will \nestablish a better system to not only clear innocent passengers from \nany terrorist database lists, but also to work with the airlines to \ndevise a safe and secure check-in procedure that differentiates between \nthe criminals and the innocent.\n  I thank Senator Carper for joining as an original cosponsor of my \namendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 4669, 4670, 4671, 4672, and 4673\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send five amendments to the desk, one on \nbehalf of Senator Baucus, one on behalf of Senator Kyl, one on behalf \nof Senator Schumer, one on behalf of Senator Grassley, and one on \nbehalf of Senator Levin, and I ask unanimous consent that those \namendments be considered read and approved en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4674\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take less than a minute to thank \nboth sides.\n  Can the Senator help me? This is my able assistant.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I must say what a thrill it is \nto work on the staff of Senator Boxer and to be able to help her.\n  I wonder, Senator, if it is OK to go to work for Senator Jeffords?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have never had such a fantastic, underpaid, assistant \nin my life.\n  I will take a minute to explain why I am very delighted that Senators \nGregg and Murray have signed off on this amendment we are about to \nadopt.\n  Senator Schumer has worked very hard on this issue. Here is what we \nsay. We say the inspector general did an investigation and found out \nthat on the out-of-place assets list--these are assets that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will protect--were places such as the \nNestle Purina Pet Food plant, the Sweetwater Flea Market, petting zoo, \nthe beach at the end of a street, the Pepper and Herb Company, Auto \nShop, groundhog zoo, high stakes bingo, mule day parade.\n  We wish we could protect every activity in America, but I think when \nyou are looking at a budget that is limited, we should go after the \ntargets that al-Qaida has told us--the bridges, the highways, the \ninfrastructure, the chemical plants, the nuclear plants. We do not have \nto spend taxpayer money protecting the bourbon festival, as an example.\n  The point is, we are going to ask the Department to either accept the \nrecommendations of the inspector general or tell us why not. That is \nthe essence of the amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues. I don't know if I need to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I join the Senator from Washington.\n  I especially thank the Senator from Washington who has been drawn in \nhere to help out. She has done a fabulous job. We would not have gotten \nto this point as promptly as we have without her assistance and \nleadership. It has been a joy to work with her. Her professionalism is \nextraordinary.\n  I also, of course, thank Senator Byrd, the ranking member. He is a \ntremendous force. He has been for decades. His influence on this bill \nis very significant. He has been a very constructive individual to work \nwith as my ranking member, although he is well my senior in both \nexperience, knowledge, and ability.\n  I especially thank my staff: Rebecca Davies, Carol Cribbs, Shannon \nO'Keefe, Mark VandeWater, Nancy Perkins, and Christa Crawford. They \nhave done a great job. They have been working long hours, as have other \nmembers of our staff, including interns who have been brought in and \nBudget staff who have been thrown in the breach. But the Appropriations \nstaff is a small, rather effective cadre, and we admire what they do.\n\n  On the minority side Chuck Kieffer and his team do a superb job, and \nwe greatly admire their efforts. And, of course, we very much \nappreciate the assistance of the staff of the full committee, and \nespecially the assistance of Senator Cochran and Keith Kennedy, Bob \nPutnam, Jack Conway, and Richard Larson. These are folks who come in \nand help us out a great deal. So we thank them immensely. We could not \nhave gotten to this point without them.\n  They work immense hours. We can never really adequately express our \nappreciation to them, but we do greatly appreciate all they have done.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4582, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that we call up \nand proceed to the consideration of amendment No. 4582 on behalf of \nSenator Clinton, that it be modified with the modification I send to \nthe desk, and that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4582), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 540. The Comptroller General shall provide a report to \n     the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations no later \n     than thirty days after enactment describing the impact on \n     public safety and the effectiveness of screening operations \n     resulting from the modification of the list of items \n     prohibited from being carried aboard a passenger aircraft \n     operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air \n     transportation or intrastate air transportation set forth in \n     section 1540 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, as of \n     December 1, 2005, to be carried aboard a passenger aircraft.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Byrd, the ranking member on our \nside, does have further remarks. I thank him and all of his staff\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year \n2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. I commend Chairman Gregg \nfor his leadership on this important legislation. I thank Senator \nMurray for her contributions to the bill this week. I also thank \nChairman Gregg's staff and my staff for their excellent work on this \nlegislation.\n  The bill that is before the Senate contains numerous improvements to \nthe President's request, both in terms of funding and in giving clear \ndirection to the Department on how to improve its operations. \nRegrettably the President sent a budget to the Congress for Homeland \nSecurity programs that is hollow.\n  This bill provides critical improvements to that request and does so \nin a fiscally responsible manner. Additional funding is provided for \nborder security, port security, grants to equip, train, and hire \nfirefighters, for the Coast Guard Deepwater program to replace its \naging fleet of ships, planes and helicopters, as well as additional \nfunding for emergency managers. In addition, we provide clear direction \nto the Secretary for securing our Nation's chemical facilities.\n  While many of the Department's legacy agencies, such as the Coast \nGuard, Customs and Border Protection, and the Secret Service, continue \nto operate effectively, the Department itself has become an \nineffective, behemoth. Rather than make America safer, the Department \nhas become a cumbersome agency, burdened by malaise.\n  FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been broken into \nineffective pieces, separating the responsibilities for preparedness \nand response. We all learned after Hurricane Katrina that FEMA is no \nlonger up to the task of responding to a catastrophic disaster, whether \nthe disaster is a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.\n  The Department has become a haven for contractors. DHS spends \nmillions of dollars on contractors who produce lots of paper and data \ndumps, that sit in file cabinets and computer files. But the Department \nfails to use that information to make careful choices about how to \nsecure the Nation.\n  In addition to failing to address known vulnerabilities, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is turning into a case study for failed \nmanagement. The GAO and the DHS Inspector General have documented \nnumerous financial management and procurement failures at the \nDepartment. DHS information systems are not secure. GAO alone has \ncompleted 494 evaluations of DHS programs. The DHS Office of the \nInspector General is spread so thin that it was unable to follow \nthrough on 616 different allegations of wrongdoing last year.\n  The Department continues to allow valuable homeland security dollars \nto gather dust in the Treasury. Last week was the 1-year anniversary of \nthe London train bombing; yet, under the Department's plan, rail and \ntransit security funding that was appropriated by Congress last October \nwill not be awarded until this September. And the same malaise applies \nto grants to secure our ports, our buses, for securing buffer zones \naround nuclear and electrical plants, and grants to hire more \nfirefighters.\n  The Department, working with its contractors, put together a list of \n77,000 critical infrastructure sites around the country. It is an \nundifferentiated list including nuclear power plants and electrical \ngrids, an Old McDonald's Petting Zoo, a fleamarket, and an ice cream \nparlor. How ridiculous. Without careful choices, how does that \ninvestment make us safer?\n  The Congress gave the Department authority to allocate first \nresponder funds based on risk, and what did they do? They cut grants to \nNew York by 37 percent and the Washington, DC, area by 43 percent.\n  Nearly 5 years after 9/11, key issues, such as fixing FEMA, \nestablishing\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nchemical security standards, inspecting cargo on commercial aircraft, \ninspecting air passengers for explosives, securing our ports, and \nmaking sure that State and local governments have effective mass \nevacuation plans, are all languishing at the Department. The list of \nissues that are festering at the Department goes on and on.\n  To the Department of Homeland Security I have two words: Wake up.\n  To the administration, I simply say, if you are not going to lead on \nmaking our homeland safer, than follow the lead of Chairman Gregg and \nthe United States Senate.\n  Chairman Gregg has done a masterful job on this bill.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate passed Senator \nByrd's amendment, which would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to set interim security regulations that establish homeland \nsecurity requirements for chemical facilities. Today, I rise to support \nthis amendment in conference.\n  This amendment takes a necessary first step in ensuring that all \nchemical facilities presenting the greatest security risk are secure \nagainst potential threats. This first step will require these \nfacilities to submit facility security plans to the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  In the U.S., 14,000 chemical plants, manufacturers and water \nutilities and other facilities store and use extremely hazardous \nsubstances that if suddenly released can injure or kill employees or \nresidents in nearby communities. Of these facilities, nearly 450 \nindividually pose a risk of harm to more than 100,000 people.\n  When I chaired the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nduring the 107th Congress, the committee unanimously passed chemical \nsecurity legislation that was offered by Senator Corzine. Industry \nconcerns have stalled efforts to adopt strong bipartisan legislation \never since. In the 108th Congress, this committee passed weaker \nchemical security legislation that lacked adequate accountability to \nensure compliance with essential protective requirements. We filed \nminority views articulating our concerns.\n  In 2003 and in 2005, I introduced legislation to improve the security \nand safety of our Nation's wastewater treatment works. Again, this \nlegislation takes into account our growing awareness of security needs \nthat has developed in the nearly 5 years that have passed since the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. My wastewater security \nlegislation requires all wastewater facilities to complete \nvulnerability assessments, emergency response plans, and site security \nplans and to submit them to the EPA.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment is consistent with my legislation, in that \nwastewaster facilities would not be exempt from completing security \nplans and submitting them to the Federal Government.\n  On May 23, 2006, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nconsidered wastewater security legislation. I offered an amendment at \nthat markup which would require wastewater facilities to complete and \nsubmit to the EPA the full range of security plans that I believe are \nessential to the protection of wastewater facilities. The amendment \nwould also require facilities to switch to safer treatment chemicals \nand technologies if grant funding is available. My amendment was not \nsuccessful and the bill reported out of committee did not require \nwastewater facilities to complete vulnerability assessments and submit \nthem to the EPA.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment takes the first step in hardening our \nNation's entire chemical infrastructure against security threats.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to address yet another \nproblem with the Department of Homeland Security. It has been 3 years \nsince its creation, and the Department continues to have difficulties \nintegrating a financial management system. The Department began with 18 \ndifferent financial systems. The Department's most recent effort to \ncreate a new, consolidated financial management system, known as \nEmerge2, has been canceled after the Department spent $23 million \nwithout making progress.\n  History has shown that integrating Federal computer systems and \nmigrating data can be a complicated and costly undertaking. As the \nDepartment of Homeland Security moves forward in its efforts on \nfinancial management integration, it should do so carefully and \ndeliberately. It is my hope that the Department considers a range of \npossible solutions. This includes soliciting ideas from commercial \nproviders with prior Department of Homeland Security experience and \ncontemplating a pilot program with one of these providers to work \nthrough the complicated technical and operational problems.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to address one of the most important \nissues the Congress faces today--protecting our homeland from terrorist \nthreats. One threat we have only just begun to address is a possible \nattack on our food production, supply and distribution systems. \nBioweapons could threaten both our crops and livestock, which would \nhave profound impacts on the health of our society and our ability to \nexport such products.\n  The Senate must support funding for biodefense research, to prevent \nand prepare for such an attack. I am proud that the fiscal year 2007 \nHomeland Security appropriations bill provides additional funding to \ncomplete planning and design of the National Bio and Agro-Defense \nFacility, an initiative to replace outdated labs transferred to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security from the Department of Agriculture when \nDHS was created in 2002.\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security solicited \nexpressions of interests from around the country from consortiums \nqualified to operate this facility. DHS received twenty-nine proposals \nand will choose a set of finalists later this year. The chosen teams \nand sites will go through a competitive process and National \nEnvironmental Policy Act review to identify a final team and site. NBAF \nwill be on the front-line of research and development of new ways to \nprotect our nation's food supply, so the final choice of a team to \noperate NBAF must be made on the basis of scientific and technical \nmerit.\n  The Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium is among the 29 applicants \nto run NBAF. It consists of a group of researchers from leading \nuniversities and selected federal and state agencies in Maryland, \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware. I believe that this \nfive-state consortium, led by the University of Maryland's School of \nMedicine, offers unparalleled scientific expertise and critical \nunderstanding in large institutional management, and will present a \nstrong proposal for the Department's consideration.\n  The combined expertise of the Mid-Atlantic Consortium has a proven \ntrack record in research and development of countermeasures to many \nagents and toxins designated as threats by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This team has \nconsiderable ``hands on'' experience in handling the most sensitive \nkinds of material while adhering to the protocols essential for high \nquality and safely-managed scientific research. I believe this team is \nuniquely qualified define problems so as to develop, test and implement \nsolutions to ensure that we can protect our crops and livestock from \nbiological threats.\n  To augment its exclusive research capability, the consortium has \nidentified the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, BARC, to serve \nas the NBAF site. BARC offers the Department an integrated, secure and \nresults-oriented approach to tackling plant and animal diseases of high \nconsequence that could enter the U.S. through ordinary commerce or an \nact of terrorism. Its existing infrastructure and location would \ncontribute to successfully protecting a highly sensitive facility like \nNBAF.\n  I believe that the Mid-Atlantic Bio-Ag Defense Consortium offers a \nsuperior group of scientific talent, with world class leadership expert \nin running large, complex organizations. It also offers a solutions-\nbased approach to tackle the scientific and public health challenges to \nbe undertaken at the NBAF. For these reasons, it is my hope that the \nDepartment will give strong consideration to this Consortium for the \nNBAF in the coming months.\n  In the end, the Department's selection of a team and a site must be \nbased\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nupon carefully reviewed and documented merit-based analysis, with the \nsupport of the community in which it will be located. As we move \nforward on this initiative, it is my hope that Secretary Chertoff will \nbase the selection on merit, to ensure the integrity of NBAF and the \nimportant work that will be conducted there in the years ahead.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, when I was elected to the Senate, I \npromised the people of Colorado that protecting the homeland and \nsupporting law enforcement would be among my highest priorities. In the \nyear and a half since taking the oath of office, I have worked hard to \nfulfill that pledge by working with my colleagues to help pass the \nCombat Meth Act, working to find bipartisan compromise on the PATRIOT \nAct, working to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill that \nincreases border security, and most important, paying close attention \nto the concerns of Colorado's law enforcement and homeland security \ncommunities.\n  But great challenges remain, challenges that should not be deferred \nfor the next Congress to deal with, challenges that should not be \nturned into partisan weapons, challenges that will require reaching \nacross the aisle to solve.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss just a few of these \nchallenges. First, however, I want to briefly discuss the Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, which we passed today.\n  Thank Senators Gregg and Byrd, who did an excellent job shepherding \nthis bill through the committee process and on the floor. While there \nare some provisions in the bill with which I disagree--for example, I \nwould like to see more funding for first responders, port, and rail \nsecurity--the bill is a product of serious and careful deliberation.\n  I would also like to draw attention to an issue of great importance: \nthe training of our law enforcement and homeland security officials. I \nwas pleased to see the DHS appropriations bill increase funding for the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Center. I am also pleased that the \nbill classifies Federal Law Enforcement Training Center staff as \nserving an ``inherently governmental'' function, which guarantees that \nlaw enforcement training cannot be outsourced. Law enforcement training \nhas been an issue of concern to me dating back to my time as attorney \ngeneral, when we guaranteed an adequate stream of funding for the \ntraining of law enforcement officers through the Colorado Peace Officer \nStandards and Training Board. I look forward to working doing more work \non this issue in the future.\n  I also thank my colleagues for agreeing to the two amendments I \noffered to the appropriations bill.\n  The first requires DHS to provide a detailed report on how it will \nimprove the inspection of incoming agricultural products in order to \nprotect U.S. agriculture from foreign pests and disease.\n  Agriculture is the largest industry and employer in the United \nStates, generating more than $1 trillion in economic activity each \nyear. However, the agricultural sector is both a great strength and a \npotential vulnerability: the entry of foreign pests and disease could \nwreak havoc on the economy, the environment, and public health. In \norder to safeguard American agriculture, we need--first and foremost--\neffective inspection at our points of entry. There have been some \nserious questions about the effectiveness of the inspection program at \nDHS, and my amendment will make sure that DHS has a sensible strategy \nin place to improve that program.\n  My second amendment requires DHS to produce a detailed blueprint \nregarding how it will help Federal, State, and local officials achieve \ncommunications interoperability.\n  More than 5 years after September 11, first responders are still \nstruggling to achieve communications interoperability. Fixing this \nproblem will require money, leadership, and sound planning by Federal, \nState, and local officials.\n  In my own State of Colorado, first responders and emergency managers \nare working hard to solve this problem--and they are making progress. \nBut they deserve to know exactly what DHS plans to do, in the short, \nintermediate, and long terms to help them get to where they need to be.\n  So I thank my colleagues for agreeing to my amendments, for \nincreasing funding for training, and for putting together a \nthoughtful--if imperfect--appropriations bill.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes discussing some important \nhomeland security and law enforcement priorities which I hope the \nSenate will take up as soon as possible.\n  Each of these issues share two important characteristics: they are \nvital to the security of our Nation, and they have broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  First and foremost is providing adequate funding for law enforcement.\n  When I talk to law enforcement officials in Colorado, no issue comes \nup more often and I can understand why. When I was attorney general, I \nsaw firsthand the importance of Federal assistance for law enforcement: \nFederal funds allow law enforcement agencies to hire more police \nofficers and firefighters, to purchase equipment, to conduct training \nexercises, and to fight the meth epidemic. This is not a partisan or \nideological issue: it is about protecting our communities and the first \nresponders who serve them.\n  To be honest, I have long been confused by this White House's annual \neffort to cut these vital programs. Of all the line items in the \nbudget, of all the places to cut unnecessary Federal spending, the \nPresident keeps trying to cut key programs for first responders. For \nexample, this year, the President's budget request proposed deep cuts \nto the COPS Program, which helps State and local law enforcement \nagencies hire police officers; the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrant Program, which makes grants to help States improve their criminal \njustice systems; firefighter assistance grants, which provide direct \nassistance to local fire departments; and the Office of Violence \nAgainst Women.\n  These proposed cuts are particularly appalling at a time when the \ncrime rate seems to be rising. Indeed, preliminary figures indicate \nthat the national violent crime rate rose 2.5 percent in 2005 as \ncompared to 2004.\n  Fortunately, there is bipartisan support to restore many of these \ncuts. Indeed, this week the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee restored funding for many of the programs that the \nPresident proposed to cut or eliminate, including COPS and the Byrne \nJAG Program. For that, I applaud the subcommittee--and I hope the full \nSenate follows suit. The heroes who keep us safe every day deserve the \nbest equipment, the best training, and the best support available--and \nthey deserve Senators who will fight for them.\n  Next, I want to discuss the need to pass a comprehensive immigration \nreform package that includes strong border security measures.\n  We are now embroiled in a historic debate about immigration and \nborder security. The reality is that our borders are broken and \nlawless--and that millions have crossed the border without the \nGovernment knowing who they are or why they are here. Indeed, the GAO \nreleased a report in March that detailed how two Federal investigators \nwere able to smuggle enough nuclear material to make two dirty bombs \nacross our northern and southern borders. The report stated that GAO \ninvestigators ``transported radioactive sources across both borders . . \n. with ease.''\n  This is why the comprehensive immigration reform backed by a \nbipartisan majority of Senators includes thousands of new positions \naimed at fixing the border. For example, the bill would add 12,000 new \nBorder Patrol agents, 10,000 new ICE worksite inspectors, 2,500 new \nport-of-entry inspectors, 1,000 new document fraud inspectors, and \nhundreds of other related positions.\n  I am hopeful that we can address this issue in the context of a \ncomprehensive reform of our immigration laws--and that we can bring law \nand order to our porous borders.\n  Next, I wish to address identity theft--another issue that calls for \na bipartisan approach.\n  Each year, roughly 5 percent of the population is victimized by \nidentity theft. That means that in 10 years, roughly half of the \npopulation will have been affected. But not only does identity theft \naffect the victims--many of whom see their credit ratings ruined and \ntheir financial situations turned\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nupside down--it is also fueling and financing a good part of the meth \nepidemic that is ravaging so many communities. Indeed, meth addicts \nhave become the driving force behind identity theft in Colorado--as \nthey seek new ways to fund the production and consumption of the drug. \nSo tackling identity theft is also a way of tackling the meth epidemic.\n  I believe that a comprehensive approach to attacking identity theft \nwill require working with the financial industry, law enforcement, \nretailers, and consumer groups. I applaud the Judiciary and Commerce \nCommittees, both of which have bipartisan bills addressing this issue. \nThere are elements of both bills that would go a good ways toward \naddressing identity theft, and I hope that the Senate takes action on \nthis issue soon.\n  I also wish to briefly discuss prisoner reentry--another vital law \nenforcement issue that cries out for a bipartisan solution.\n  Approximately 650,000 State and Federal prisoners reenter society \neach year, and a staggering two-thirds of them are returned to prison \nfor a new crime or parole violation within 3 years of release. \nPrisoners returning to society face difficulties with housing, \nemployment, mental health, and substance abuse--all of which impose a \ngreat toll on families, communities, State and local governments, and \novercrowded prison systems. The problem is truly multidimensional and \ncalls out for a bipartisan approach.\n  For that reason, I am happy to cosponsor the Second Chance Act, a \nbipartisan bill which provides badly needed resources for prisoner \nreentry programs. I hope the Senate takes action on this bill soon.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly discuss port and chemical security.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan GreenLane Maritime \nCargo Act and the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act. I cannot stress \nhow important these bipartisan pieces of legislation are to protecting \nour homeland security.\n  Indeed, each year roughly 9 million shipping containers enter the \nUnited States via our seaports. Those containers carry approximately \n2.4 billion tons of goods worth more than $1 trillion--and those \nnumbers are expected to double in the next 20 years. Furthermore, the \naverage container originating overseas will pass through over a dozen \nintermediate points before arriving in the United States--providing \nmultiple points of vulnerability for both our security and our economy. \nThe GreenLane Maritime Cargo Act would take some important steps to \nsecure our ports--including requiring 100 percent screening of incoming \ncontainers within a year--and is a fine example of bipartisan problem-\nsolving.\n  Regarding chemical security, we face a situation today where there \nare no Federal laws establishing minimum security standards at chemical \nfacilities--this despite the fact that the roughly 15,000 chemical \nplants and refineries in this country pose a great vulnerability and \ndespite the fact that dangerous chemicals routinely travel along our \nhighways, inland waterways, and on railcars that pass through the heart \nof major cities. The cost of an attack would be staggering in terms of \nboth loss of life and economic impact. Even DHS agrees that chemical \nsecurity legislation is necessary. So I am very pleased to be a \ncosponsor of the bipartisan Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act.\n  Neither port security nor chemical security is a partisan issue. Just \nlook at these two bills: they both have strong bipartisan support. So I \nsay to the Senate: let us take up these important bills soon.\n  Mr. President, each of the issues I have discussed this morning has \nbipartisan support. Each is important to the security and safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  Our most important obligation as Senators is to protect the security \nand safety of our constituents--and each of the issues I have discussed \nthis morning would take an important step in that direction. I hope the \nSenate can debate and act on these issues soon.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the fiscal year 2007 Department \nof Homeland Security Appropriations bill before us today. Our Nation \nfaces a serious terrorist threat and we need to adequately fund our \nsecurity agencies. I am concerned, however, that the bill falls short \nin some areas of what is needed to effectively protect the homeland.\n  For instance, the bill makes significant cuts to State grant programs \nfrom FY 2006 levels and does not ensure that funds are distributed \nusing risk as the guiding principle. Although DHS Secretary Chertoff \nhas assured us that the Department would follow the recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Commission and distribute funds based purely on risk, when \nfunding for the Urban Area Security Initiative was released in May the \ncities most at risk--New York, Washington, and Boston among them--\nreceived the deepest cuts. I supported amendments during consideration \nof this bill that sought to rectify this problem and I hope that the \nbill can be improved in conference to ensure that funding is \ndistributed where it is needed.\n  I am also concerned that the bill calls for shutting down a large \nportion of the LORAN navigation system infrastructure, limiting it to \nAlaska and the northwest and northeast coasts. Although I realize that \nthis is the result of a compromise, I strongly support maintaining the \nLORAN system nationwide and intend to work with Senator Stevens, \nSenator Murray and others in conference to prevent the premature \nshutdown of this important asset.\n  Mr. President, we must take steps to secure the border, though I \nopposed Senator Sessions' amendment to appropriate additional funds to \nconstruct fencing along the southwest border because it would have \nraided discretionary funds used to hire more border patrol agents, buy \nmore detention beds, train first responders, and fund other pressing \nneeds. Although I support some limited fence construction, I do not \nbelieve we should be undermining critical homeland security programs to \nfinance them. I remain committed to passing balanced immigration \nlegislation that protects the border and allows immigrants to earn \ncitizenship, and I hope that the Congress can reach an agreement to \naccomplish that in the upcoming weeks.\n  Finally, I am pleased my amendment to repeal the Transportation \nSecurity Administration's exemption from Federal contracting laws was \naccepted. TSA has a record of mismanaging contracts and wasting \nbillions in taxpayer dollars and it should not continue to be exempt \nfrom the same level of accountability that we require of every other \nFederal agency. I thank the managers for working with me to pass this \namendment, and I hope that it is included in the final conference \nreport.\n  I hope that some of these important issues can be worked out in \nconference and that we can send the best bill possible to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the fiscal \nyear 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill, the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, and my friend from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, for accepting two amendments that will help \nremedy some of the Government's failures in disaster response.\n  The first amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, will require the Department of Homeland Security, \nDHS, to develop a robust system to help people locate family members \nafter a disaster. Immediately after Hurricane Katrina, people searched \nthe Astrodome and combed the Internet, hoping to locate their loved \nones. Unfortunately, many of these people continue their search today.\n  My amendment requires DHS, in consultation with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services and the Attorney General of the United \nStates, to review the methods used by the Louisiana Family Assistance \nCall Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \nto assist in the location of friends and family displaced by Hurricane \nKatrina. DHS must then report on these models and provide Congress with \na detailed plan for the swift implementation of a family locator \nprogram for future disasters that reflects the lessons learned from \nthese two models. The Department's plan should lead to the creation of \nan efficient means of helping those displaced by future disasters \nlocate their friends and family.\n  My second amendment is a commonsense attempt to stop the abuse of no-\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nbid contracting in the aftermath of a disaster. After Hurricane \nKatrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency relied upon the \n``unusual and compelling urgency'' exception to allow no-bid contracts \nfor everything from collecting debris to hauling and installing housing \ntrailers. Unfortunately, some of these no-bid contracts were not merely \nemergency stop-gap measures--they were open-ended agreements and \nresulted in significant waste and abuse.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nCoburn, prohibits the use of no-bid contracts under the ``compelling \nurgency'' exception, unless these contracts are limited in time, scope \nand value, and notification is provided to the congressional oversight \ncommittees. This amendment will end the abuse of noncompetitive \ncontracts by setting real and reasonable limits to the emergency \nexception. This amendment does nothing to inhibit a rapid response to \nemergencies; rather it closes a loophole that threatens the integrity \nof our Federal response, and it will save taxpayer money. I thank the \nSenators for accepting this amendment into the bill.\n  I am pleased that these amendments have been accepted into the bill, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the \nfailures of the Government's response to Hurricane Katrina are not \nrepeated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support final passage of the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill today because its funding is \nvital to our first responders and all of those responsible for \nprotecting us. Further, it includes important provisions that I worked \nto have included.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate passed both my amendment and \nSenator Stabenow's amendment on Canadian trash imports. My amendment \nwould require the Secretary of Homeland Security to deny entry to the \nUnited States of any commercial trash truck until the Secretary \ncertifies that the methodologies and technologies used to screen the \ntrash for the presence of chemical, nuclear, biological and \nradiological weapons are as effective as those used to screen for such \nmaterials in other items of commerce entering the U.S. The Department \nwould first be given 90 days to assess the situation, and then another \n180 days to implement changes to address the security concerns. If \nhowever, such changes are not identified, which I expect will be the \ncase, municipal solid waste will not be allowed to come into the State \nof Michigan or elsewhere in our country.\n  With thousands of trash trucks coming into Michigan from Canada each \nweek, this provision is critical for addressing the risks this garbage \nposes to our country's security, public health, and the environment. \nSenator Stabenow's trash amendment also addresses the security risks \nfrom trash by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to levy a \nfee on the trash shipments, in an amount that would cover the cost of \nsuch insepctions. It would therefore make it more expensive for Ontario \nto send their trash to Michigan, protecting U.S. landfills from being \nfilled with Canadian trash.\n  With the help of my friends from West Virginia and New Hampshire, \nSenators Byrd and Gregg, the Senate accepted my amendment related to \nthe establishment of the fifth and final Northern Border Air Wing in \nDetroit, MI. The Northern Border Air Wing, NBAW, initiative was \nlaunched by the Department of Homeland Security in 2004 to provide air \nand marine interdiction and enforcement capabilities along the Northern \nBorder. Original plans called for DHS to open five NBAW sites in New \nYork, Washington, North Dakota, Montana, and Michigan.\n  The New York and Washington NBAW sites have been operational since \n2004. Unfortunately, not all of the sites have yet been established, \nleaving large portions of our northern border unpatrolled from the air \nand, in the case of my home State, the water. In the conference report \naccompanying the fiscal year 2006 DHS Appropriations bill, the \nconferees noted that these remaining gaps in our air patrol coverage of \nthe northern border should be closed as quickly as possible.\n  Given that the threat from terrorists, drug traffickers, and others \nwho seek to enter our country illegally has not diminished, I believe \napproximately $12 million of the funds included in Senator Byrd's \namendment for Air and Marine Interdiction, Operations, Maintenance, and \nProcurement which was adopted should be used by Customs and border \nprotection to complete the remaining activities necessary to prepare, \nequip, and establish the Michigan NBAW site as Secretary Chertoff \npreviously indicated he intends to do during fiscal year 2007.\n  In an April 11, 2006 letter to me, Secretary Chertoff indicated that \nit was his department's plan to open the Michigan site during the 2007 \nfiscal year and the Byrd amendment will enable the department to stick \nto its schedule. Mr. President Secretary Chertoff's letter and \nenclosures, my letter to the Secretary, and a colloquy are printed in \nthe Record at page S7405.\n  Senator Baucus was also successful in his mission to press forward \nefforts to ensure that the northern Border is provided with \nproportionate resources as the southern border. His unmanned aerial \nvehicle pilot project will enabled the Customs and Border Patrol to \nperform a pilot project on the northern border between Canada and the \nUnited States. As the Senate knows, the northern border is nearly four \ntimes the length of the Southern border and it deserves an appropriate \nattention from the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes a provision offered by \nSenator Byrd that would give the Department of Homeland Security the \nauthority to issue interim regulations for chemical facilities that \npose the greatest security risk. There are over 15,000 chemical \nfacilities in this country, and there still are no Federal laws that \nexplicitly address the threat of terrorism activities at chemical \nplants. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism bill, S. 2145, which I \ncosponsored, and which was reported by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in June 2006, takes a much more \ncomprehensive approach to this issue. However, because the Senate's \nRepublican leadership is not allowing S. 2145 to come to the floor, I \nam pleased that Senator Byrd offered his amendment, which I supported, \nto address the very real risks posed by chemical facilities.\n  While I am pleased that funding was increased for port security and \nborder protection, I am disappointed that the Senate rejected \namendments to provide additional funding for first responders. We \ncannot expect our first responders to be well-trained, properly \nequipped and fully staffed to protect us, if we cut their funding \nsources. I am hopeful that funding levels will be restored in \nconference.\n  I am also disappointed that the Senate failed to move away from the \ncurrent small State funding formula that is used to allocate funding \nfor our first responder grant programs. I supported an amendment that \nwould have allocated funding for the largest first responder funding \nprograms based on an assessment of threat, vulnerability and \nconsequences, and no State would have received less than .25 percent. \nThis approach would have reduced the amount of funds allocated to \nStates regardless of need and increased the funds available to be \ndirected to states facing the greatest terrorist threats and greatest \nneed. All Americans suffer when a major city is hurt by a terrorist \nattack; it is critical that Congress direct more funds to areas facing \nthe most significant threats. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to make the allocation of these scarce resources more \nequitable.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time we can go to third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, in a few moments, we will be doing a \nunanimous consent request on water resources development as well as \nstem cells. Before doing that, I turn to my colleague, the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me tell you something about what is \nabout to happen if the unanimous consent request goes through. It is a \nsignificant bill. We have been working on it now during the last three \nauthorizations, since the year 2000. Now, for 3 years, we have been \nworking on this bill. We have had incredible cooperation, as everybody \nin the Chamber knows. It is always difficult to get something like this \nthrough, but it is necessary to keep this country moving.\n  I will single out the members of the committee. I chair the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee: Senators Thune, DeMint, Vitter, \nWarner, Isakson, Chafee, Murkowski. And Senator Voinovich of Ohio has \nbeen particularly helpful on this. He has a lot of interest in this \nbill. Of course, more than anybody else on the Republican side, Senator \nBond, who is chairman of the subcommittee, has been very helpful.\n  The big four in this case, of course, would be Senators Bond, Baucus, \nJeffords, and myself. We have worked closely together to overcome some \nof the obstacles. Early on, there were several holds on this bill \nbecause it is complicated. It is one that almost is of the magnitude of \nthe Transportation reauthorization bill. But we had several people who \nhad concerns and we worked with them, including Senator Snowe, who was \nnice enough to help us with some of the facets she had objections to; \nSenator Sessions; Senator McCain; and, of course, the Democratic \nmembers of the committee who worked so well, including Senator Carper \nand Senator Lieberman, and Senators Clinton, Lautenberg, and Obama. \nEverybody was there working together. It was quite an undertaking to \nget us to the point where we are today.\n  I will single out several others. Senator Gregg had some concerns \nalso. Probably one of the persons I was really gratified to work with \nis Senator Feingold, the Senator from Wisconsin. I thank him for his \ncooperation. He had a number of amendments that I thought would be more \nthan we could really handle. We had to get the number down to a certain \nnumber that is workable so we could have a time agreement to get this \nbill passed. I thank Senator Feingold for his cooperation and for \nagreeing to offer limited amendments under short time agreements. If he \nwanted to be hard to get along with, he could have had long agreements \nand this would have gone into many nights. He didn't do that. He agreed \nto short time agreements, which will make this possible to pass. His \nwillingness to work with us is very much appreciated by me.\n  Over the past few months, he consistently has been helpful and \nresponsive in working on the WRDA bill. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin for his cooperation.\n  This is going to be the first time that we have a lot that we need to \nauthorize the Corps of Engineers to do in navigation flight control and \nenvironmental restoration. This bill will allow us to do that. I thank \neverybody for his or her cooperation. Let's go forward.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, on Tuesday, July 18, the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 93, S. 728.\n  I further ask that the committee-reported amendments be withdrawn and \nthe managers' substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to as original \ntext for the purposes of further amendment and that the only other \namendments in order be the following, the text of which are at the \ndesk, with specified time agreements equally divided in the usual form:\n  Boxer, Folsom Dam, 1 hour; Feingold-McCain, mitigation standards, 1 \nhour; Feingold-McCain, peer review, 4 hours; Inhofe-Bond, independent \nreviews, 1 hour; Inhofe, fiscal transparency, 1 hour; McCain-Feingold, \nprioritization report, 2 hours; McCain-Feingold, chief of engineers, 1 \nhour; Nelson of Florida, water projects, 1 hour; Specter, Federal \nhopper dredges, 1 hour.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 hours of general debate on \nthe bill, and that following the disposition of amendments and the use \nor yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, \nand the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 166, H.R. \n2864, the House companion, and that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 728, as amended, be inserted thereof; that \nthe bill, as amended, be read the third time and the Senate proceed to \na vote on passage, and S. 728 be returned to the Senate calendar.\n  I further ask that no points of order be waived by virtue of this \nagreement.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, first, I want the Record \nspread with the fact that the Senate can work together. This is an \nexample of that. Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe are polar opposites \npolitically. I don't know if we could find two stranger people to work \ntogether on a bill than the two of these Senators. But this is a bill \nthat takes cooperation and building consensus. That is what they have \ndone.\n  This is not a Republican bill, it is not a Democratic bill, it is a \nbill for the Senate. I also want the Record to reflect that Senator \nFeingold, who has three amendments on here, is a person who is \ndedicated to looking at the substance of legislation. I express \npublicly my appreciation for his cooperation and for allowing us to get \nto this point. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are currently talking to some other \nSenators about the water resources bill, so I will have more to say \nabout that later.

Mr. President, today marks a significant milestone for \nIraq--and for coalition forces. According to Ambassador Khalilzad, \nMuthanna will become the first province in which civilian Iraqis take \ncharge of Iraqi security forces in that province. For the first time, \nthe day-to-day security of the Iraqi people living in Muthanna will be \nin the hands of a civilian Iraqi.\n  For the half million people living in Muthanna, this means a tangible \nchange in the security and governance of the province. Since 2003, \nAmerican and coalition forces--the Australians, the British, and the \nJapanese--have worked together to ensure the security of Muthanna. But \nbeginning today, the Governor of Muthanna will assume supervision of \nall provincial police. National police and Iraqi army troops within the \nprovince will remain under the national control of Prime Minister Jawad \nal-Maliki.\n  The provincial Iraqi police service will assume the lead for domestic \nsecurity in Muthanna. Multinational forces will move out of all urban \nareas in Muthanna and assume a supporting role. They will provide \ntransition assistance teams and remain postured to assist but only at \nthe approval of Prime Minister al-Maliki.\n  But more importantly, the handover of Muthanna is a critical step in \nthe chain of events leading to Iraq standing entirely on its own. It \nmarks a new phase in the history of Iraq. It means the increasingly \ncapable Iraqi security forces and Government are ready to operate \nindependently--and to replace coalition forces. And it means the \nPresident's strategy for Iraq is working.\n  Before March 2003, Iraq was a sworn enemy of the United States. The \npeople of Iraq suffered under the oppression of a tyrant. Today, that \ntyrant is behind bars, and the world is safer and more secure for it.\n  Iraq's Government has transitioned from a brutal dictatorship to a \ndemocracy in which all Iraqis have a voice. Last year, millions of \nIraqis defied the threats of the terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, \nstreaming to the poll in three national elections. Iraq's Sunni \npopulation participated in greater numbers each time. And just over a \nmonth ago, we eliminated the shadow cast by al-Zarqawi.\n  The Iraqi security forces are growing, as are their capabilities and \nresponsibilities. In July of 2004, there were no operational Iraqi Army \ndivision or brigade headquarters. In just 2 years, 2 divisions, 14 \nbrigades, and 57 battalions control their own area of responsibility; \n28 authorized national police units are in the fight with 10 battalions \nin the lead. Over 264,000 trained and equipped Iraqi security forces \nare taking the battle to the enemy.\n  Iraq now has a free and independent media. Thousands of \nreconstruction projects are in the works, slowly but surely \nstrengthening Iraq's infrastructure and economy. And a fully \nconstitutional national Unity government representing all Iraqi people \nis finally in place.\n  Many challenges remain ahead. But today is an important step toward a \nfree, democratic, and prosperous Iraq governed by the rule of law. We--\nthe United States and our coalition allies--must continue to train and \nequip Iraqi security and police forces to ensure Iraq's 17 other \nprovinces are fully prepared to follow in Muthanna's footsteps. As \nIraqi forces stand in, coalition forces will step aside, and we will be \none step closer to bringing our troops home.\n  In a region plagued by radicalism and instability, today's transfer \nis a critical milestone. It means we are one step closer to peace and \nstability, and it means Iraq is one step closer to assuming its \nrightful place in the global community of democratic nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7505-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7505-S7506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONDEMNING THE ACTS OF WAR PERPETRATED AGAINST ISRAEL BY HEZBOLLAH \n                                 FORCES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise because of the recent attacks on \nIsrael. The most recently breaking news: rocket attacks on the city of \nHaifa in Israel, which clearly represents an escalation of the attack \nfrom Lebanon. Therefore, I do rise to condemn the acts of war \nperpetrated against the nation of Israel by Hezbollah forces operating \nin southern Lebanon.\n  Dozens of Katyusha rockets were fired at northern Israel on Wednesday \nand Thursday, and additional salvos have continued to rain down. \nIsraeli soldiers were attacked as they attempted to respond to this \nunprovoked assault across an internationally recognized border. As a \nresult of this aggression, eight Israeli soldiers are dead, two more \nare prisoners of Hezbollah, and the citizens of northern Israel are \nliving in fear.\n  I call on the international community to support Israel in its \nattempts to end terrorist operations in southern Lebanon, free the \ncaptive soldiers, and restore its territorial security.\n  In the name of peace, Israeli forces withdrew from all Lebanese \nterritory in the year 2000. The United Nations recognized this \nwithdrawal as fully compliant with all relative Security Council \nresolutions. Unfortunately, the government in Beirut has not done its \npart to ensure that this disengagement enhanced the security of both \nnations.\n  It is not surprising since 14 members of Lebanon's parliament and two \ncabinet ministers are members of Hezbollah. The Lebanese Government, \nwhich refuses to crack down on these terrorists, must be held \naccountable. In addition, Syria and Iran, whose governments sponsor \nHezbollah's activities, must be condemned and, if they do not cease \nthis support, sanctioned harshly.\n  I regret to say we will probably witness more violence in the days \nand weeks ahead. Many innocent people on both sides of the border will \nlikely suffer. It is incumbent on the United States and the \ninternational community to stand by Israel as she fights foreign-\nsponsored aggression on her borders, aggression that no sovereign \nnation could possibly be expected to tolerate\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I was dismayed to hear of the recent \nreprehensible actions taken by the terrorist group Hezbollah, in \nkidnapping two Israeli soldiers. This is an act of cowardice and also \ngrimly unsurprising. Supported by both Syria and Iran, Hezbollah has, \nfor almost a quarter of a century, targeted freedom; whether that be \nU.S. marines in 1983 in Beirut, U.S. airmen in the Khobar Towers \ntragedy, or repeated deadly attacks against innocent Israelis and \nongoing weapons' stockpiling. Besides regularly supplying weapons to \nHezbollah, Iran and Syria are also responsible for donating an \nestimated $100 million per year to Hezbollah. The Lebanese government, \nof which Hezbollah is an active part, bears a full measure of \nresponsibility for this act of war against Israel, and Israel has a \nright, under international law, to take actions necessary to rescue her \nsons. Israel fully withdrew from southern Lebanon in May 2000. This \nmove by Israel was certified by the U.N. Security Council as having met \nthe requirements of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which called \nfor an Israeli withdrawal and for Lebanon to assert control over the \narea vacated by Israel.\n  The appropriate, reasonable and legal response to the brutality and \ndishonor of terrorism is proactive self-defense. We would do no \ndifferent were these young men our own. Israel continues to be a force \nfor freedom and democracy and as a friend and ally to the United \nStates, deserves our full backing during this difficult time. \nFurthermore, as this body has reaffirmed time and again, we fully \nreject and denounce the terrorist activities fomented by both Iran and \nSyria. It is my fervent hope that those who dictate the activities of \nHezbollah, both inside Lebanon and outside its borders, will quickly \nsee the futility of this course of action, and make a move for peace \nand stability rather than chaos and war\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk briefly about the\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\ncurrent events in Israel and the Middle East.\n  I strongly condemn the ongoing murderous attacks by Hezbollah on \nIsrael and its soldiers. Several days ago, eight Israeli soldiers were \nkilled and two were kidnapped following an unprovoked attack on \nnorthern Israel. Hezbollah must immediately and unconditionally release \nall Israeli soldiers. Hezbollah has refused United Nations demands to \ndisarm and has been responsible for terrible acts of violence for many \nyears. No country should provide support for Hezbollah, which is a \nU.S.-designated terrorist group. Hezbollah's actions are contrary to \nthe interests of the Lebanese people and hurt the region.\n  The Hezbollah attack follows a June 25 attack by Hamas on a southern \nIsraeli military post that resulted in the kidnapping of an Israeli \nsolider and the killing of several others. Hamas must also immediately \nand unconditionally release the soldier it is holding and end attacks \non Israel.\n  The United States will stand by our longtime ally and friend. The \nIsraeli people have the right to live in peace and security. Israel has \nthe right to protect its citizens. I strongly condemn the ongoing \nmurderous attacks by Hezbollah and Hamas on Israel and its soldiers and \nbelieve that restraint is needed in the region to stop the escalation \nof violence and protect innocent lives.\n  I yield the floor\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I condemn Hamas's and \nHezbollah's unprovoked acts of war against Israel and to express strong \nsupport for Israel's right to defend itself.\n  On July 12, Hezbollah attacked an Israeli military unit patrolling \nthe Israeli border south of Lebanon, and two Israeli soldiers were \ntaken hostage. Hezbollah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, has \nadmitted that this was a calculated act, which Hezbollah had planned \nfor 5 months. Analysts agree that this act is a sign of support for the \nHamas kidnapping of another Israeli soldier on June 25. It is also a \nsign that two of the regions most recalcitrant terrorist organizations \nhave no interest in the peace and security of the people they \nsupposedly now represent in elected governments in Lebanon and the \nPalestinian Territories.\n  Both of these attacks were clear acts of war--attacks on Israeli \nsoldiers guarding undisputed Israeli territory. The Hezbollah attack \nwas also a blatant breach of Security Council resolutions 1559, 1655, \nand 1680, which certified Israel's full withdrawal from Lebanese \nterritory, called for the disarmament of all militias in Lebanon, and \ncalled for an end to attacks across the Israel-Lebanon border.\n  Despite these resolutions, Hezbollah remains an armed militia group \nwith unrestrained activity in Lebanon and has not been pressured by the \nLebanese Government to disarm. In fact, Hezbollah is a part of the \nLebanese Government now with 23 seats in the Lebanese parliament and \ntwo ministers in the Government. According to the Department of State, \nHezbollah receives $30-40 million a month in cash, aid, and arms \nsupport from Iran. Additionally, Syria is still a strong partner with \nIran in supporting, sheltering, and funding Hezbollah to the detriment \nof the people of Lebanon\n  Mr. President, I believe it is critical that the Senate recognize \nIsrael's right to defend itself, and call on the Government of Lebanon \nto immediately and unconditionally release the abducted Israeli \nsoldiers. The same holds true for the soldier held by Hamas in Gaza. At \nthe same time, we must insist that Iran and Syria immediately cease \ninterfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon and the Palestinian \nTerritories by ending all support for Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  I will shortly be introducing legislation to increase pressure on the \nGovernment of Lebanon to do the right thing and disarm Hezbollah. The \nLebanese people surely deserve better than to have their fate \ndetermined by this terrorist organization. But for now, Israel deserves \nour unwavering support as it aims to protect its people from these \nunprovoked attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7506-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PIEDMONT, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this year marks the 150th birthday of the \ntown of Piedmont, WV. This little town, charted in 1856, is located on \nthe North Branch of the Potomac River in the northeastern corner of \nWest Virginia.\n  In the late 19th Century, the town of Piedmont bustled with economic \nactivity. A period of prosperous growth began when the Baltimore Ohio \nRailroad established a locomotive shop complex and switching yard in \nthe area, and the town became an important freight-generating point on \nthe B line.\n  When local entrepreneurs persuaded surrounding railroads to turn from \nwood to coal for firing their locomotives, the coal industry in the \nregion boomed.\n  In the 1880s, William Luke established the West Virginia Paper \nCompany's paper mill--Westvaco--in Piedmont, which became a major \nsource of jobs for Piedmont residents. This included native \nAppalachians, migrant African Americans, and European immigrants, \nespecially Italians and Irish. Therefore, soon after the opening of the \npaper mill, Piedmont became a town saturated with ethnic neighborhoods. \nA resident of Piedmont has written that, ``Piedmont's character has \nalways been completely bound up with the Westvaco paper mill.''\n  This Town of Piedmont features some unique characteristics. For \nexample, ``Ripley's Believe It or Not'' once pointed out that Kenney \nHouse Hill in Piedmont is the only street in the world from which a \nperson can enter all three stories of the same building!\n  Piedmont is also known for a number of famous residents it has \nproduced. This includes Don Redman, a famous jazz musician and \ncomposer, who wrote a number of hit arrangements for American music \ngreats like Jimmy Dorsey, Harry James, and Count Basie.\n  Henry Gassaway Davis was a giant in the coal mining and banking \nindustries in the late 19th Century, and a two-term U.S. Senator from \nWest Virginia. In 1904, Davis was the Democratic nominee for Vice \nPresident--he was 80 years of age at the time, making him the oldest \nperson ever nominated for President or Vice President on a major party \nticket.\n  Thousands of people throughout the United States know of the town of \nPiedmont becauce of the writings of another of the town's famous \nresidents, the nationally renowned writer and eminent scholar, Henry \nLouis Gates. Dr. Gates is the W.E.B. DuBois Professor of Humanities at \nHarvard University and Chairman of Harvard's Department of African and \nAfrican American Studies Program.\n  In his memoir, Colored People, Dr. Gates discusses life in Piedmont \nduring the 1950s. The book, which reflects on his childhood in this \nsmall rural community, before and during the civil rights movement, is \na vivid portrayal of the people of Piedmont, whom he describes as \n``virulent nationalists--Piedmont nationalists.'' ``[N]estled against a \nwall of mountains, smack-dab on the banks of the mighty Potomac,'' \nwrites Dr. Gates, ``we knew God gave America no more beautiful \nlocation. `` According to Gates, the town's credo is: ``all New York's \ngot that Piedmont's got is more of what we got. Same but bigger.'' \n``Otherwise,'' he writes, ``the advantage was all to Piedmont.''\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the town of Piedmont, the little town \n``on the side of a hill in the Allegheny mountains,'' as Dr. Gates \ncalls it, on its 150th birthday which the town will celebrate with its \n``Homefest.'' I wish the town the best of success on this milestone \nevent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7506-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7506-S7507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   U.S. Army Lieutenant Shaw Vaughan\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to remember a Coloradan who was lost to us last month in defense \nof this Nation.\n  Shaw Vaughan was a loving and supportive son and older brother, an \navid hunter and fly fisherman. One of his most prized possessions was \nhis 1969 Jeepster Commando, an off-roading vehicle he had personally \nrebuilt, affectionately named Hercules. Hercules sits quiet today, its \nred finish gleaming undimmed in the mountain sun.\n  U.S. Army LT John Shaw Vaughan, of Edwards, in Eagle County in my \nState of Colorado, was killed on June 7 in Mosul, Iraq. Lieutenant \nVaughan\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nwas a young man with his entire life before him: He was a mere 23 years \nold, and had been in Iraq only a month.\n  As a middle school student, Shaw Vaughan caught the eye of our \nmilitary leaders for his regional science fair project: comparing the \naccuracy of store-bought ammunition with ammunition he had assembled. \nHe graduated Battle Mountain High School in 2001 and attended Embry-\nRiddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, FL. Upon graduation, \nLieutenant Vaughan was one of only 70 cadets, out of 5,000, to receive \na much-sought-after assignment in military intelligence in the \ninfantry. It was a high honor, reflecting his intellect, work ethic, \nand commitment to our Nation.\n  Lieutenant Vaughan was stationed in Alaska, a part of our country he \nhad visited with his family years earlier. I guess you could say that \nAlaska had ``hooked'' the fisherman in Lieutenant Vaughan, and he was \nlooking forward to his service there after he completed his time in \nIraq.\n  Lieutenant Vaughan was eager to get to Iraq, to serve with his unit. \nIn his e-mails and phone calls back home, Lieutenant Vaughan spoke of \nhow strongly he felt about America's mission in Iraq. He told stories \nof Iraqi families leading him into their homes, telling him horror \nstories of their families' sufferings under the brutal regime of Saddam \nHussein.\n  As one newspaper in my home State observed, it seems that every story \nabout Shaw Vaughan was different and yet the same: ``one of a great guy \nand a courageous man lost too soon.''\n  In Act III of William Shakespeare's classic ``Henry V,'' King Henry \nsays with pride, ``As I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts \nbecomes me best . . .''\n  I will think of this today as I bow my head in prayer for the loss of \nLieutenant Vaughan, a life of such great promise that was snuffed out \ntoo soon. He was living his life to its fullest, on the great adventure \nbefore him. But we can rest assured that Lieutenant Vaughan had the \nconvictions of his beliefs, and that he fulfilled his beliefs to the \nend.\n  Lieutenant Shaw Vaughan took pride in his life as a soldier, and it \nis truly a name that, in all of our thoughts, becomes him best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7507-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TWO YOUNG MEN OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to remember the 3-year \nanniversary of the death of two, brave fallen firefighters.\n  July 22, 2003, will be a day that is always remembered in the hearts \nof the family and friends of Jeff Allen of Salmon, ID, and Shane Heath \nof Melba, ID. These brave men lost their lives while trying to save our \npublic lands from a catastrophic wildfire in the Salmon-Challis \nNational Forest. Both men were experienced firefighters of the \nIndianola Helitack Crew.\n  This weekend a memorial will be dedicated to Jeff and Shane. Family \nand friends will gather to remember their strong spirits and the \nsacrifice they made. This memorial symbolizes the courage of Jeff and \nShane, the healing of the community, and helps us all to remember that \nwildfire spares no one.\n  Jeff Allen was 23 years old and had been a firefighter since 1999. He \nstarted working on the Salmon-Challis National Forest on a thinning \ncrew on the Salmon-Cobalt District in 1998. He served successfully in \nfighting devastating fires on the Salmon-Challis National Forest during \nthe 2000 fire season. Jeff was a marketing major at Boise State \nUniversity.\n  Shane Heath was 22 years old and was in his fourth season with the \nForest Service. He served on the Helitack crew as a certified sawyer \nand was also a student at Boise State University.\n  The tragic loss of these two men continues to be felt throughout \ntheir communities and their selfless acts of true bravery will not be \nforgotten. I commend the men and women who risk their lives every day \nby undertaking this terribly dangerous job with courage and \nprofessionalism.\n  Thousands of young men and women are on the fire fronts of the \nwildfires that are now sweeping across the West. As we enter the middle \nof fire season, with the devastating heat that we are having in the \nGreat Basin, and the West, I hope that we do not lose another \nfirefighter to wildfire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7507-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \npassed the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act, S. 2430. My \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and I believe that this \nlegislation will provide the resources and authority for the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service, the States, and the tribes to restore fish and \nwildlife in the Great Lakes.\n  The program has support from the States, tribes, and nongovernmental \ngroups because it is a good management tool. Over 140 fish species and \nover 500 species of migratory birds can be found in the basin. The \nGreat Lakes population has been growing, and like many coastal areas, \nthere is a large concentration of people and industry on the coasts. \nFurther, the Great Lakes are threatened by the continuing introduction \nof invasive species which impact the native food chain and habitat.\n  The fish and wildlife in the Great Lakes are under pressure, and the \nGreat Lakes Fish & Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 provides needed \nresources and authority. For instance, the bill would reauthorize the \ngrant program, increasing the amount available for grants to $12 \nmillion and add wildlife projects to the types of projects that may \nreceive grants. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service would award grants \nbased on the recommendations from the existing grant proposal review \ncommittee, though wildlife experts would be added to this committee.\n  The bill also authorizes up to $6 million each year for the U.S. Fish \n& Wildlife Service to undertake projects that have a regional benefit \nto fish and wildlife. Under this new authority, the Service would \nundertake projects based on the recommendations of States and tribes.\n  This bill reflects the collaboration of nongovernmental groups, as \nwell as tribal, State, and Federal agencies with jurisdiction over the \nmanagement of fish and wildlife resources of the Great Lakes. All of \nthose groups have the goal of protecting and restoring the Great Lakes \nfish and wildlife, and this bill will continue in the right direction. \nI thank all of these groups for their work in shaping this bill.\n  I also thank the staff at the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nparticularly Nathan Richmond and Jo-Ellen Darcy. I understand that \nNathan's work in preparing this bill for markup was interrupted by the \nearly arrival of his first child, so I appreciate the staff work \ninvolved in moving this bill\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7507-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7507-S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     WATER TREATMENT PLANT OPENING\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that will be celebrating its 100th anniversary. On July \n28-30, the residents of Bowbells will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Bowbells is a vibrant community in northwestern North Dakota, just a \nshort drive from the Canadian border. The town was founded in 1896 with \nthe help of the Soo Line Railroad that passed through the town. The \nname ``Bowbells'' came from the bells at the Church of St. Mary-le-Bow \nlocated in London, England, that were in the shape of bows. By 1913, \nthe town was served by two different railroad lines. Today, it is the \ncounty seat of Burke County, ND.\n  Many citizens of Bowbells support their families through agriculture, \nproducing a wide array of products, including canola, flax, barley, \nsunflowers, hard red spring wheat, and durum. Located near Bowbells is \nthe Des Lacs National Wildlife Refuge, which supports a large waterfowl \npopulation. Outdoor enthusiasts can also enjoy both fishing and hunting \nopportunities in and around Bowbells.\n  Citizens of Bowbells have organized numerous activities to celebrate \ntheir centennial. Some of these activities include a golf tournament, \nclass reunions, street dances, a 5K/10K walk/run, a parade, softball \nand baseball games, and all-faith services.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nBowbells, ND, and its residents on the first 100 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century. By honoring Bowbells and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great \npioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Bowbells that have helped to shape this country into what it is \ntoday, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Bowbells has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7508-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN HONOR OF ISRAEL HOROVITZ\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncelebrate the life and work of a special individual. At the end of this \nyear, Mr. Israel Horovitz will retire as artistic director of the \nGloucester Stage Company, and as he prepares to do so I am proud to \njoin with his colleagues, family, and fans in celebrating more than 25 \nyears of sustained artistic contributions to Massachusetts and the \ncountry.\n  Modern American theater has much to celebrate as a result of Israel's \nleadership at Gloucester Stage. Born in Wakefield, MA, he returned to \nhis home State to found the Gloucester Stage Company after holding such \nprestigious posts as the Royal Shakespeare Company's Playwright-in-\nResidence. Since the inception of Gloucester Stage in 1979, the theatre \nhas premiered the works of esteemed playwrights such as Terrence \nMcNally, Wendy Wasserstein, and in the years since has brought real \nmeaning to Horovitz's vision of a theatre that serves as a ``safe \nharbor for new writing.'' In the course of bringing the works of new, \nundiscovered playwrights to life, Gloucester Stage has hosted over 35 \nworld premieres of plays, many of which went on to successful runs on \nBroadway and beyond.\n  In addition to celebrating Israel as the artistic director, we must \nalso celebrate his writings. Horovitz is the author of more than 50 \nplays and he stands as one of the most internationally acclaimed \nAmerican playwrights of our time. He was presented with the prestigious \nElliot Norton Prize celebrating his work with the theatre. And his \nplays and screenplays have earned him many of the industry's most \nprestigious awards, such as the OBIE, which he earned twice, the Prix \ndu Jury of the Cannes Film Festival, the Prix du Plaisir du Theatre, an \nAward in Literature of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and \nthe Lifetime Achievement Award from B'Nai Brith, among many others. On \nMarch 29, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts honored Horovitz with a \nGovernor's Leadership Award and under his leadership Gloucester Stage \nhas received numerous Best of Boston awards as well as the New England \nTheatre Conference Award.\n  I am proud to represent a State where Israel's artistry has \nblossomed, inspired young and old minds alike, entertained generations, \nand lifted lives. He is one of our true cultural treasures, and he has \nhonored the best traditions of the theater by asking difficult \nquestions and using them to illuminate and celebrate the human \ncondition. I wish Israel and Gillian the very best as they look back on \nso many achievements and contributions to modern American culture, and \nI wish them the very best as they begin this new chapter in \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/13/senate-section/article/S7508-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7508-S7509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MORGAN HARRIS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I often rise to speak about the \nissues being debated on the floor of the Senate, whether it be to share \nmy thoughts on immigration, the war in Iraq, or the marriage \namendment--as was the case this past week. I am honored to speak for \nthe people of Alabama and to share their concerns with my colleagues in \nthe Senate. Today I wish, not to debate, but for a moment reflect on \nthe rich history of our Nation.\n  I have heard it stated, on more than one occasion, that the length of \na person's stay in Washington should be measured by the feeling they \nget standing on Constitution Avenue at dusk. As a public servant, I \nfind it impossible to look at the Capitol, illuminated against the \nnight sky, without reflecting on the history and sacrifice of our \nforefathers.\n  I was reminded of this while reading a speech written by Morgan \nHarris, a sixth grader at Hampton Cove Middle School in Huntsville, AL. \nMorgan, tasked by his English and Social Studies teachers to write a \nspeech about the flag, took the creative approach of writing from the \nflag's perspective. While there have been poems written from similar \npoints of view, I found Morgan's speech to be a refreshing reminder of \nthe history and importance of Old Glory. I share it with you today:\n\n                              Flag Speech\n\n                           (By Morgan Harris)\n\n       I am the flag. I was originated on June 14, 1777. I was \n     given 13 stripes alternating red and white with 13 white \n     stars in a field of blue. I am the flag. My content was \n     dictated, but my arrangement was not. Many made me appear in \n     different ways. My stripes usually stayed the same, but my \n     stars were often rearranged. For many years history has \n     taught that Betsy Ross was my original maker. Though she made \n     many flags, there is no proof that she made me first. In 1818 \n     my design was set. The only change was to add a star for each \n     new State. I was carried by soldiers into battle. I flew from \n     the masts of great ships. For 47 years I had 48 stars. In \n     1959 and 1960 I was given two stars for the new States of \n     Alaska and Hawaii. Today, I still have those same 50 stars \n     and 13 stripes. I am the flag.\n       To show respect and dignity for what I represent, rules \n     have been written for my use and care. When I am displayed \n     during the playing of the national anthem, men and women in \n     uniform stand at attention and salute me. All others stand at \n     attention with their right hand over their heart and men \n     remove their hats. During the Pledge of Allegiance, everyone \n     is to stand at attention with their right hand over their \n     heart. I am usually flown in the outdoors from sunrise to \n     sunset. However, I may be flown for 24 hours a day if lighted \n     during darkness. I should not be left out in the rain or bad \n     weather. I am flown at half-staff upon the death of great \n     people to show respect to their memory. I am draped over the \n     caskets of those who serve our country. No other flag is to \n     fly about me. I am the American flag.\n       I should never be allowed to touch the ground and should be \n     stored and protected. I should never be displayed upside \n     down, except as a sign of distress. I should always be \n     carried aloft and free. I represent a living country and I am \n     considered a living thing. Therefore, when I am worn as a pin \n     I should be worn on the left near the heart. When I am no \n     longer fitting for display, I am to be destroyed in a \n     dignified manner, preferably by burning.\n       The writer Henry Ward Beecher once said, ``The American \n     flag has been a symbol of Liberty and men rejoiced in it.'' \n     Mr. Beecher was stating how the flag represents our freedom \n     in America and this is what I love most about the flag.\n       When I see the flag flying high on a flag pole and hear \n     ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' played, I think of the freedom \n     we have as Americans. I think of the men and women who have \n     died so that we may have this freedom. It makes me proud to \n     be an American. The flag is our symbol of freedom.''\n\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I am sure it will come as no surprise to you that \nMorgan's speech won first place out of 148 entries at his school.

ROBERTO LANGER\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncelebrate the work of a great man whose work has an impact on lives \nthroughout this country and all over the globe. This month hundreds of \nscientists will gather at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to \ncelebrate one of their own, Doctor Robert Langer, and I am proud to \njoin them in doing so.\n  Most Americans will never meet Dr. Langer, but chances are his \nresearch has already affected their life. One of America's most \nbrilliant scientists, Dr. Langer has been on the front lines of the \nfight to cure cancer and continues to push the envelope of biomedical \nengineering. Dr. Langer studied chemical engineering in college after \nbeing inspired by the gift of a chemistry set as a child. He went on to \nreceive his doctorate from MIT in 1974. Doctor Langer accepted a \npostdoctorate fellowship at Children's Hospital in Boston with Judah \nFolkman, a leading cancer researcher.\n  Dr. Langer's return to MIT as a professor of chemical engineering \nresulted in the creation of the Langer Lab, one of the most cutting-\nedge biotechnology laboratories in the world. Researchers at the Langer \nLab study ways to utilize polymers to deliver life-saving drugs to \npatients with diseases such as diabetes and cancer, and the success of \nDoctor Langer's work earned him a place as one of CNN's ``100 Most \nImportant People in America.'' In 2004, Parade magazine selected him as \none of six ``Heroes whose research may save your life.''\n  Dr. Langer's genius has been recognized repeatedly by his scientific \npeers as well. He is the recipient of over 140 major awards, including \nin 2002 the premier award in science, the Charles Stark Draper prize. \nIn 1998, he was awarded the Lemelson-MIT prize for invention, and in \n2006 he was inducted into the Inventor's Hall of Fame. He holds nearly \n550 patents, 180 of which are licensed to medical, chemical, or \npharmaceutical companies.

    \n\n[Pages S7513-S7524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Sarbanes):\n  S. 3652. A bill to amend the definition of a law enforcement officer \nunder subchapter III of chapter 83 and chapter 84 of title 5, United \nStates Code, respectively, to ensure the inclusion of certain \npositions; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Law \nEnforcement Officers Retirement Equity Act. I am proud to be joined on \nthis bill by my colleague and friend, Senator Sarbanes. This \nlegislation will ensure that all Federal law enforcement officers have \nthe same retirement options and that their pay and benefits conform to \nthe federal law enforcement retirement system.\n  Under current law, most Federal law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal \nservice. But some Federal law enforcement personnel, such as customs \nand immigration inspectors at the Department of Homeland Security or \npolice officers at Veterans Affairs, are not eligible for these same\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nbenefits. This legislation will amend current law and grant the same \npay and 20-year retirement to all law enforcement officers.\n  We must honor our Federal law enforcement personnel. The names of \nFederal law enforcement officials who have died in the line of duty are \nengraved on the Law Enforcement Memorial. We include the names of the \nofficers from Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs. We honor them \nwhen they die, but we don't recognize them when they are living.\n  We need to make sure that all Federal law enforcement officers earn \nthe pay and benefits that they deserve. These brave men and women are \nthe country's first line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling \nof illegal drugs at our borders. They have the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel, and face the same \nrisks and challenges.\n  For example, U.S. Customs inspectors are responsible for the most \narrests performed by Customs Service employees. Yet they do not qualify \nfor law enforcement officer status. Along with U.S. Customs agents, \nuniformed U.S. Customs inspectors are helping to provide additional \nsecurity at the nation's airports and help enforce U.S. Customs laws. \nThey were among the first to respond to the tragedy at the World Trade \nCenter. After September 11, Customs inspectors are playing a critical \nrole in ensuring that terrorists don't get their hands on weapons of \nmass destruction and smuggle them into the country.\n  Like customs inspectors, immigration inspectors at the Department of \nHomeland Security are also on the front lines of defense against \nterrorism. Immigration inspectors enforce the Nation's immigration laws \nat more than 300 ports of entry. In the normal course of their duties, \nthey enforce criminal law, make arrests, interrogate applicants for \nentry, search persons and effects, and seize evidence. Inspectors' \nresponsibilities have become increasing complex as political, economic \nand social unrest has increased globally. The threat of terrorism only \nincreases these responsibilities.\n  This legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is created by this \nact is more than offset by savings in training costs and increased \nrevenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these critical \nemployees will reduce turnover, increase productivity, decrease \nemployee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention \nof a well-trained and experienced work force. These vital Federal \nemployees bear the same risks and work under similar conditions to \nother law enforcement officials and deserve to receive the same level \nof benefits.\n  This bill will improve the effectiveness of our Federal workforce to \nensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of the taxes \nand duties owed to the Federal Government. This bill is strongly \nsupported by the National Treasury Employees Union. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing support for \nthis bill and finally getting it enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 3654. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow a credit \nagainst income tax, or, in the alternative, a special depreciation \nallowance, for reuse and recycling property, to provide for tax-exempt \nfinancing of recycling equipment, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Recycling \nInvestment Saves Energy--RISE--Act of 2006 with my colleague Senator \nCarper. The RISE tax incentives will create jobs, increase \nproductivity, conserve energy and expand America's recycling \ninfrastructure.\n  I offer this bill to capture the significant energy savings available \nthrough greater recycling. For example, recycling aluminum cans saves \n95 percent of the energy required to make the same amount of aluminum \nfrom its virgin source. The amount of lost energy from throwing away \naluminum and steel cans, plastic PET and glass containers, newsprint \nand corrugated packaging was equivalent to the annual output of 15 \nmedium sized coal powerplants. Increasing the recycling rate of these \ncommodities by 10 percent would save enough energy annually to heat \n74,350 million American homes, provide the required electricity for 2.5 \nmillion Americans, and save about $771 million in avoid costs for \nbarrels of crude oil. As a result, recycling should be an integral \ncomponent of our nation's energy efficiency strategy.\n  The RISE Act would also help create quality jobs. Due to the \ndiminishing quantity and quality of available recyclable materials, \nmany companies currently are not able to obtain the volume of quality \nrecycled feedstock needed to meet demand. This new economic challenge \nmakes it even harder for recycled products to compete in the \nmarketplace. In some cases, recyclers have been forced to shut down \ntheir operations in the United States and relocate to other countries \ndue in part to insufficient or poor quality recycled feedstocks. This \nis particularly unfortunate as, on a per-ton basis, sorting and \nprocessing recyclables are estimated to sustain 10 times more jobs than \nlandfilling or incineration.\n  A national investment in our recycling infrastructure is necessary to \nreverse the stagnant or declining recycling rate of many consumer \ncommodities, including aluminum, glass and plastic. For example, 55 \nbillion aluminum cans were wasted by not being recycled in 2004, which \nrepresents approximately $1 billion of aluminum lost to industry. The \nrecycling rate of paper is estimated to be roughly 51 percent, glass \ncontainers 35 percent, and PET plastic bottles less than 20 percent.\n  The RISE Act will save energy and improve the quantity and quality of \nrecycled materials by allowing companies to claim either a 15-percent \ntax credit or a 50 percent accelerated depreciation deduction for the \npurchase of machinery and other equipment used exclusively to collect, \ndistribute or recyclable material. Recyclable material is defined \nbroadly to capture a wide variety of commodities, including plastic, \nscrap textiles, scrap rubber, scrap packaging, recovered fiber, scrap \nferrous and nonferrous metals, or electronic waste generated by an \nindividual or business. It does not include buildings, real estate or \nrolling stock used to transport reuse and recyclable materials.\n  The RISE Act aims to reverse the trend in recycling rates and \nresulting energy loss by incentivizing greater collection, distribution \nand recycling of quality recyclable materials. The bill will address \nquality concerns by reducing the barriers hindering investment in \noptical sorting and other state-of-the-art equipment needed at material \nrecovery and manufacturing facilities. It will make innovative \ntechnology more affordable, such as reversible vending machines that \ncollect and process empty containers. An earlier version of RISE was \nincorporated as section 1545 of the Senate Energy Policy Act of 2005, \nbut did not survive the conference committee.\n  The Rise Act will amend section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 by redefining ``solid waste facilities'' to ensure that recycling \nfacilities are eligible for tax-exempt bond financing under this \nsection. This latter provision was created to resolve an ongoing glitch \nin the law that prevents these facilities from being eligible for tax-\nexempt financing.\n  The following organizations support the RISE Act: American Beverage \nAssociation, American Forest & Paper Association, Association of \nPostconsumer Plastic Recyclers, Ball Corporation, Carolina Recycling \nAssociation, Glass Packaging Institute, Institute of Scrap Recycling \nIndustries, Inc., ISRI, National Association for PET Container \nResources, NAPCOR, National Recycling Coalition, National Solid Wastes \nManagement Association, Solid Waste Association of North America, Steel \nRecycling Institute, US Conference of Mayors/Municipal Waste Management \nAssociation, Waste Technology Equipment Association, WASTEC, Envision \nPlastics, EvCo Research, LLC, Florikan ESA Corporation, L B. Schmidt \nand Associates, Mid America Recycling Companies, MSS, Inc., Novelis, \nInc., formerly Alcan, NRT, Inc., O-I, formerly Owens-Illinois, Orwak \nGroup, Reynolds Recycling, Saint-Gobain Containers, Inc., Strategic \nMaterials, Inc., The Coca Cola Company, TiTech Visionsort, Tomra, \nUltrePET, United Resource Recovery Corporation, Van Dyke Bailer Corp/\nLubo USA, wTe Corporation, Paper Recycling Coalition, and Yemm and \nHart,\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nLtd. Mr. President, most of these organizations have submitted a joint \nletter in support of the RISE Act, and I will ask to have the letter \nprinted in the Record following the statement.\n  Reducing the barriers to recycling also serves a number of \nenvironmental goals, including lessening the need for new landfills, \npreventing emissions of many air and water pollutants, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and stimulating the development of green \ntechnology. But most importantly, recycling helps preserve resources of \nour children's future.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Recycling Investment Saves \n     Energy'' or the ``RISE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Recycling means business in the United States, with \n     more than 56,000 reuse and recycling establishments that \n     employ over 1.1 million people, generating an annual payroll \n     of nearly $37 billion, and grossing over $236 billion in \n     annual revenues. On a per-ton basis, sorting and processing \n     recyclables alone sustain 10 times more jobs than landfilling \n     or incineration.\n       (2) By reducing the need to extract and process virgin raw \n     materials into manufacturing feedstock, reuse and recycling \n     helps achieve significant energy savings. For example:\n       (A) Taken together, the amount of energy wasted from not \n     recycling aluminum and steel cans, paper, printed materials, \n     glass, and plastic equals the annual output of 15 medium \n     sized power plants.\n       (B) The reuse of 500 steel drums per week yields 6 trillion \n     Btu's per year, which is enough energy savings to power a \n     city the size of Colorado Springs, Colorado, for 1 year.\n       (3) Unfortunately, the United States recycling rate of many \n     consumer commodities, including aluminum, glass, and plastic, \n     are stagnant or declining, and businesses that rely on \n     recycled feedstock are finding it difficult to obtain the \n     quantity and quality of recycled materials needed. \n     Increasingly, United States manufacturing facilities that \n     rely on recycled feedstock are closing or forced to re-tool \n     to use virgin materials.\n       (4) The environmental impacts from reuse and recycling are \n     significant. Increased reuse and recycling would produce \n     significant environmental benefits, such as cleaner air, \n     safer water, and reduced production costs. For example:\n       (A) Between 2 and 5 percent of the waste stream is \n     reusable. Reuse prevents waste creation and adverse impacts \n     from disposal.\n       (B) On a per-ton basis, recycling of: office paper prevents \n     60 pounds of air pollutants from being released, saves 7,000 \n     gallons of water, and 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space; \n     aluminum saves 10 cubic yards of landfill space; plastic \n     saves 30 cubic yards of landfill space; glass prevents 7.5 \n     pounds of air pollutants from being released and saves 2 \n     cubic yards of landfill space; and steel saves 4 cubic yards \n     of landfill space.\n       (5) A national investment in the reuse and recycling \n     industries is needed to preserve and expand America's reuse \n     and recycling infrastructure.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Jim Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: On behalf of the undersigned \n     recycling industry organizations, companies and other groups \n     that support recycling efforts, we write to support the \n     ``Recycling Investment Saves Energy'' (RISE) bill. An earlier \n     version of RISE was incorporated as Section 1545 of the \n     Senate Energy Bill last year, but did not survive conference \n     committee. RISE would save energy and improve the quantity \n     and quality of recycled materials by allowing companies to \n     claim either a tax credit or accelerated depreciation for the \n     purchase of equipment used to collect, distribute or recycle \n     a variety of commodities.\n       Your support will be greatly appreciated by businesses that \n     are facing serious problems trying to secure a steady stream \n     of quality recycled materials including glass, paper, \n     plastic, steel and aluminum. This provision will create jobs, \n     increase productivity and conserve energy by encouraging \n     companies to invest in state-of-the-art recycling \n     infrastructure. With recycling levels for individual \n     materials either stalled or declining, we need to act now to \n     improve usable recovered material and to enhance the quality \n     of materials that are collected through curbside and other \n     recycling programs.\n       Every industry that uses recycled materials as a feedstock \n     realizes significant energy savings compared to production \n     using virgin materials. By providing tax incentives to \n     increase the quality and quantity of usable recycled \n     materials available, the RISE provision will enable these \n     industry segments to significantly reduce energy consumption.\n       Recycling associations and industries support this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Beverage Association; American Forest & Paper \n           Association; Association of Postconsumer Plastic \n           Recyclers; Carolina Recycling Association; Glass \n           Packaging Institute; National Association for PET \n           Container Resources (NAPCOR); National Recycling \n           Coalition; National Solid Wastes Management \n           Association; Paper Recycling Coalition; Solid Waste \n           Association of North America; Steel Recycling \n           Institute; U.S. Conference of Mayors/Municipal Waste \n           Management Association; Waste Technology Equipment \n           Association (WASTEC); Ball Corporation; Envision \n           Plastics; EvCo Research, LLC; Florikan ESA Corporation; \n           L B.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals eligible for veterans health benefits to contribute to \nhealth savings accounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce \nlegislation to allow veterans who use the VA health care system to \nestablish health savings accounts, HSAs. This legislation will increase \nhealth insurance options for veterans and their families, provide \nfuture options in the choice of health care providers for veterans, and \ncould ultimately allow veterans who are forced to rely on the VA health \ncare system today to choose to receive care from the private health \ncare system in the future.\n  As my colleagues are aware, current law allows individuals who \npurchase a high deductible health insurance plan to contribute funds, \non behalf of themselves and their family, to a health savings account. \nFunds are contributed to the HSA on a pretax basis and then can be \nwithdrawn for qualified health care expenses without any tax \nconsequence.\n  In order for a person's HSA to be in ``good standing'' with the IRS, \nthe individual cannot carry health insurance that provides coverage for \nany health services prior to reaching the deductible amount of the high \ndeductible plan. Of course, like many government programs, there are \nexceptions to the rules for certain circumstance. Most notably, a \nperson does not jeopardize an HSA by purchasing long-term care or \naccident insurance nor is the receipt of workman's compensation \ncoverage disqualified from contributing to an account. Yet the IRS has \nadvised the health insurance industry that VA health care would count \nas a health insurance plan that provides coverage for health care \nservices prior to reaching the high deductible limit. Therefore, \nveterans who use VA are not eligible to establish health savings \naccounts.\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\n  At the time this issue was brought to my attention, the argument was \nlimited to the narrow issue of service-connected veterans being denied \nan opportunity to avail themselves of the tax advantages of an HSA \nsimply because they suffered an injury related to their service in the \nmilitary and the government was providing care for that injury. Of \ncourse, that seemed outrageous to me. Like any employer, the Government \nhas an obligation to provide treatment for injuries sustained while \nmilitary personal are serving our country. And if workman's comp is a \ncurrent exemption, why not VA care?\n  So, I set out to draft a bill to allow service-connected veterans who \nuse VA for service-connected treatment to establish HSAs. But, the more \nI considered the arguments for allowing those who use VA for service-\nconnected conditions to have HSAs, the more I realized that the \narguments applied just as strongly to all VA patients. I would like to \ntake a moment to explain my arguments.\n  First, the current law unfairly affects families of veterans when the \nveteran is the sole provider of income for the family. As everyone \nknows, VA is not a family health care provider except in the extreme \ncase of a permanently disabled service-connected veteran. Therefore if \na veteran--even a service-connected veteran--uses the VA health care \nsystem, current law does not even allow that veteran to contribute \nmoney on behalf of his family to an HSA. What good does that do? Why \nwould we prohibit a veteran from providing health coverage to his or \nher family? In my opinion, that does neither the veteran nor his or her \nfamily any good. It is simply a well-intention policy when applied to \nHSAs, with a harmful, unintended consequence as applied to veterans.\n  Second, under current law VA is permitted to bill insurance carriers \nfor the treatment of nonservice connected conditions. Further, many \nveterans are required to pay copayments to VA in order to receive that \nsame care. So, veterans have out-of-pocket medical expenses and VA can \nbill their insurance provider. Yet we have a policy that disallows the \nestablishment of a tax free account to pay for those medical expenses \nand--even worse--provides a disincentive for the veterans to buy an \ninsurance policy that VA could one day bill. Again, I understand the \ngenesis of the policy. However, it is having unintended consequences \nwhen applied to our veterans.\n  Finally, while it is true that more and more veterans are choosing to \nuse VA as their provider of choice as a result of the excellent care \nprovided by the system, there are still hundreds of thousands of \nveterans who use VA because they are financially unable to afford the \nprivate health system. I am proud that this Nation stands by those \nveterans who cannot provide for their own care in the private system. \nHowever, I do not think we should statutorily preclude them from even \ntrying to take control of their own health care finances.\n  What harm would come if a veteran, who uses VA today because he or \nshe has no other option, was suddenly allowed to purchase a low \npremium, high deductible plan and then begin to contribute to a savings \naccount that he or she would now own. I say no harm at all. The only \nthing that could come of this is that the veteran may one day say to \nhis government: I was there for you when you needed me. You were there \nfor me when I needed you. Now, I no longer need you.\n  Again, I am not saying that veterans should feel as though I am \ntrying to get them to leave the VA system. I am not. But, I certainly \ndo not want to stop a veteran from choosing to buy insurance, start \nsaving in an HSA, and one day leaving the system. I think one of the \nthings government can do for its citizens is provide the tools and \nassistance that will allow Americans to provide for themselves. That is \nwhat this legislation is about.\n  I am confident that many of you will agree with the premise that it \nis a basic issue of fairness to support allowing service-connected \nveterans to establish HSAs. But, I also hope that I have demonstrated \nhere today that it is sound public policy to extend the HSA option to \nall veterans who use VA's health care system.\n  I urge my colleagues to be cosponsors of this legislation and I urge \npassage of the bill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Snowe:)\n  S. 3656. A bill to provide additional assistance to combat HIV/AIDS \namong young people, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce legislation to strengthen our international HIV prevention \nefforts for youth and empower the people on the ground who are fighting \nthis disease to design the most effective and appropriate HIV \nprevention program.\n  Our legislation does three things. First, it expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that sexually active youth who live in a country where HIV \ninfection is spreading through the general population should be \nconsidered at high risk of contracting HIV and provided with \ninformation on the complete range of tools to prevent the spread of \nHIV.\n  To date, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator has focused \nprevention programs for youth on abstinence only and ignored other \nprevention techniques such as the use of condoms.\n  Second, it defines ``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs as those \nprograms that place the highest, rather than exclusive, priority on \nencouraging individuals who have not yet married to abstain from sexual \nactivity.\n  And finally, it reserves at least one-third of funds for prevention \nof the sexual transmission of HIV--rather than one-third of all \nprevention programs--for abstinence-until marriage programs. This \nrecognizes that HIV prevention includes many types of activities and \nthose that target the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS, such as \nabstinence-until-marriage programs, are only a subset.\n  In 2003, I was proud to join my colleagues in passing the United \nStates Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of \n2003, a historic piece of legislation that expressed our resolve to see \nthe United States take a leadership role in the fight against the \nglobal HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  The bill recognized that prevention--along with care and treatment--\nis an essential component of that fight and demands a multipronged \napproach. It endorsed the ``ABC'' model for prevention of the sexual \ntransmission of HIV: Abstain, Be Faithful, use Condoms.\n  That bill also contained a provision that mandated that at least one-\nthird of global HIV/AIDS prevention funds be set aside for \n``abstinence-until-marriage programs.''\n  Three years later, we still face an uphill battle against the HIV/\nAIDS pandemic. Worldwide, 40 million people are infected with HIV. Each \nday, approximately 13,400 people are newly infected with HIV. In 2005, \nthere were 5 million new HIV infections around the world, 3.2 million \nin Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-\nthirds of the estimated 40 million people currently living with HIV.\n  Across sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence rate for the general \npopulation is 8 percent; 2.4 million adults and children died of AIDS \nin 2005.\n  Despite these devastating numbers, according to UNAIDS, less than one \nin five people at risk for infection of HIV have access to basic \nprevention services. Studies have shown that two-thirds of new HIV \ninfections could be averted with effective prevention programs.\n  Clearly, we still have a long ways to go to rein in this disease.\n  During the debate on the global HIV/AIDS bill, I expressed concern \nthat we were placing politics over science by requiring that at least \none-third of prevention funds go to ``abstinence only'' programs.\n  I argued that such an artificial earmark--which, by the way, was not \nbased on any scientific study or conclusive evidence--would tie the \nhands of HIV/AIDS workers and doctors on the ground and severely \ninhibit the ability of the administration to fund the most effective \nHIV prevention programs.\n  It would mean less money for funds to prevent mother-to-child \ntransmission; less money to promote a comprehensive prevention message \nto high risk groups such as sexually active youth; and fewer funds to \nprotect the blood supply.\n  Unfortunately, the evidence clearly shows that the one-third earmark \nhas\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\nhad a negative impact on our prevention efforts and inhibited the \nability of local communities to design a multipronged HIV prevention \nprogram that works best for them.\n  Last month, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a \nreport that found ``significant challenges'' associated with meeting \nthe abstinence-until-marriage programs. The report concluded that:\n  The 33 percent abstinence spending requirement is squeezing out \navailable funding for other key HIV prevention programs such as mother-\nto-child transmission and maintaining a healthy blood supply. Country \nteams that are not exempted from the one-third earmark have to spend \nmore than 33 percent of prevention funds on abstinence-until-marriage \nactivities, sometimes at the expense of other programs. The spending \nrequirement limited or reduced funding for programs directed to high-\nrisk groups, such as sexually active youth and; the majority of country \nteams on the ground reported that meeting the spending requirement \n``challenges their ability to develop interventions that are responsive \nto local epidemiology and social norms.''\n  Clearly, we are placing constraints on our ability to protect high-\nrisk populations around the world from HIV transmission and fund the \nwide range of prevention programs, such as mother-to-child \ntransmission.\n  Our bill seeks to address the problems highlighted in the GAO report \nand provide local communities the necessary flexibility to achieve the \ngoal we all share: stopping the spread of HIV, especially among young \npeople.\n  Let me be clear: our bill does not strike the 33 percent earmark for \n``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs.\n  In fact, our legislation is pro-abstinence. It maintains abstinence \nas a critical part our prevention efforts and places no limits on \nprograms that lead to this result. It even allows the administration to \nspend more than one third of funds for the prevention of HIV on \n``abstinence-until-marriage'' programs if the administration decides \nthat is the best use of those funds.\n  Simply put, our bill balances congressional priorities with public \nhealth needs. Under our legislation, country teams can take into \naccount country needs including cultural differences, epidemiology, \npopulation age groups and the stage of the epidemic in designing the \nmost effective prevention program.\n  One size does not fit all. A prevention program in one country may \nlook a lot different than a prevention program in another country.\n  A May 2003 report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and \nHenry J. Kaiser Foundation highlights that proven prevention programs \ninclude: behavior change programs, including delay in the initiation of \nsexual activity, faithfulness and correct and consistent condom use; \ntesting and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases; promoting \nvoluntary counseling and testing; harm reduction programs for IV drug \nusers; preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child; \nincreasing blood safety; empowering women and girls; controlling \ninfection in health care settings, and; devising programs geared \ntowards people living with HIV.\n  For example, studies have shown that combining drugs with counseling \nand instruction on use of such drugs reduces mother-to-child \ntransmission by 50 percent.\n  Such cost effective programs are not related to abstinence and should \nnot be constrained by the 33 percent earmark on funds for prevention.\n  I understand the importance of teaching abstinence. It is and will \nremain a key part of our strategy in preventing the spread of HIV.\n  But let us listen to the words of someone with first hand experience \nabout the challenges sub-Saharan African countries face in combating \nHIV/AIDS and the constraints the ``abstinence-until-marriage'' earmark \nplaces on those efforts.\n  In an August 19, 2005 op-ed in the New York Times, Babatunde \nOsotimehin, chairman of the National Action Committee on AIDS in \nNigeria, wrote:\n\n       Abstinence is one critical prevention strategy, but it \n     cannot be the only one. Focusing on abstinence assumes young \n     people can choose whether to have sex. For adolescent girls \n     in Nigeria and in many other countries, this is an inaccurate \n     assumption. Many girls fall prey to sexual violence and \n     coercion ..When dealing with AIDS, we must address the \n     realities and use a multipronged approach to improving \n     education and health systems, one that can reach all of our \n     people.\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       National governments must have the freedom to employ the \n     very best strategies at our disposal to help our people.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  If we want to help the girls of Nigeria and the youth of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, we cannot limit the information they receive about keeping them \nsafe from acquiring HIV.\n  Mr. President, I have been heartened to witness Republicans and \nDemocrats coming together to support a robust U.S. assistance package \nto fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We all share the same goal of the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to prevent 7 million new HIV \ninfections by 2010.\n  This bill is about helping us achieve that goal. When we put our \nfaith in the people on the front lines of this fight and allow them to \nuse all the tools and strategies at their disposal, we are one step \ncloser to making that goal a reality.\n  We do not have time to lose. I urge my colleagues to support our \nlegislation and support a pro-abstinence, multi-pronged approach to \npreventing the spread of HIV.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3656\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``HIV Prevention for Youth \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (in this \n     Act referred to as ``PEPFAR'') is an unprecedented effort to \n     combat the global AIDS epidemic, with $9,000,000,000 targeted \n     for initiatives in 15 focus countries.\n       (2) The PEPFAR prevention goal is to avert 7,000,000 HIV \n     infections in the 15 focus countries--most in sub-Saharan \n     Africa where heterosexual intercourse is by far the \n     predominant mode of HIV transmission.\n       (3) The PEPFAR strategy for prevention of sexual \n     transmission of HIV is shaped by 3 elements: the ABC model, \n     defined as ``Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms'', the \n     promotion of ``abstinence-until-marriage'', and deference to \n     local prevention needs.\n       (4) The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 requires that at least \n     one-third of all prevention funds be reserved for abstinence-\n     until-marriage programs. In implementing this requirement, \n     the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator has required that 50 percent \n     of prevention funding be dedicated to sexual transmission \n     prevention activities. This requirement severely limits \n     countries from employing strategies for the prevention of \n     sexual transmission other than abstinence, because the other \n     sexual transmission prevention programs under PEPFAR (such as \n     the purchase of condoms and management of sexually \n     transmitted infections) cannot exceed one-sixth of the total \n     prevention funds.\n       (5) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a \n     report in April, 2006, ``Spending Requirement Presents \n     Challenges For Allocating Funding under the President's \n     Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief'', that found ``significant \n     challenges'' associated with meeting the earmark for \n     abstinence-until-marriage programs.\n       (6) GAO found that a majority of country teams report that \n     fulfilling the requirement presents challenges to their \n     ability to respond to local epidemiology and cultural and \n     social norms.\n       (7) GAO found that, although some country teams may be \n     exempted from the abstinence-until-marriage spending \n     requirement, country teams that are not exempted have to \n     spend more than the 33 percent of prevention funds on \n     abstinence-until-marriage activities--sometimes at the \n     expense of other programs.\n       (8) Indeed, according to GAO, the proportion of HIV \n     prevention funds dedicated to ``other prevention'' activities \n     (i.e. the purchase and promotion of condoms, management of \n     sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, and messages \n     or programs to reduce injection drug use) declined from 23 \n     percent in fiscal year 2005 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2006 \n     for country teams that did not receive exemptions.\n       (9) GAO found that, as a result of the abstinence-until-\n     marriage spending requirement, some countries have had to \n     reduce planned funding for Prevention of Mother-to-Child \n     Transmission programs, thereby limiting services for pregnant \n     women and their children.\n       (10) GAO found that the abstinence-until-marriage spending \n     requirement limited or reduced funding for programs directed \n     to high-risk groups, such as services for married discordant \n     couples, sexually active youth, and commercial sex workers.\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n       (11) GAO found that the abstinence-until-marriage spending \n     requirement made it difficult for countries to fund medical \n     and blood safety activities.\n       (12) GAO found that, because of the abstinence-until-\n     marriage spending requirement, some countries would likely \n     have to reduce funding for condom procurement and condom \n     social marketing.\n       (13) In addition, GAO found that two-thirds of focus \n     country teams reported that the policy for implementing the \n     ABC model is unclear and open to varying interpretations, \n     causing confusion about which groups may be targeted and \n     whether youth may receive the ABC message.\n       (14) GAO found that the ABC guidance does not clearly \n     delineate permissible C activities under the ABC model. \n     Program staff reported that they feel ``constrained'' by \n     restrictions on promoting or marketing condoms to youth. \n     Other country teams reported confusion about whether PEPFAR \n     funds may be used for broad condom social marketing, even to \n     adults in a generalized epidemic.\n       (15) Each day, an estimated 13,400 people worldwide are \n     newly infected with HIV.\n       (16) Sub-Saharan Africa is home to almost two-thirds of the \n     estimated 40,000,000 people currently living with HIV.\n       (17) In many African countries, the epidemic has spread \n     among the general population. The HIV prevalence rate for the \n     general population is 8 percent across sub-Saharan Africa. \n     Among the United States focus countries in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, the HIV prevalence rate ranges from 4 percent in \n     Uganda to 37 percent in Botswana.\n       (18) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on \n     HIV/AIDS, young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are \n     ``the most threatened by AIDS'' and ``are at the centre of \n     HIV vulnerability''. Globally, this age group accounts for \n     half of all new HIV cases each year. More than 7,000 young \n     people contract the virus every day.\n       (19) Most young people in sub-Saharan Africa have sex \n     before marriage during their adolescent years. In many \n     countries, at least half of all women have sex before age 20 \n     and before marriage. Among young men, more than 70 percent \n     have premarital sex before age 20.\n       (20) Many adolescents, who are sexually active and not yet \n     married, have inadequate information on how to protect \n     themselves against HIV. Fewer than half of young people in \n     sub-Saharan Africa mention abstinence, monogamy, or condom \n     use as a way of avoiding HIV.\n       (21) Young people who have sex are at greater risk of \n     acquiring HIV than adults, partly because of their lack of \n     knowledge. They are apt to change partners frequently, have \n     more than 1 partner in the same time period, or engage in \n     unprotected sex.\n       (22) Coercion and sexual violence undercut the ability of \n     young people--women in particular--to prevent HIV and \n     contribute to the vulnerability to infection. In addition, \n     gender inequality makes it much more difficult for young \n     women to negotiate abstinence from sex or to insist that \n     their partners remain faithful or use condoms.\n       (23) Marriage does not protect young women from HIV, even \n     when they are faithful to their husbands. In some settings, \n     it appears marriage actually increases a woman's HIV risk. In \n     some African countries, married women aged 15-19 have higher \n     HIV infection levels than nonmarried sexually active women of \n     the same age.\n       (24) A recent USAID-funded review found that sex and HIV \n     education programs that encourage abstinence but also discuss \n     the use of condoms do not increase sexual activity as critics \n     of sex education have long alleged. Sex education can help \n     delay the initiation of intercourse, reduce the frequency of \n     sex and the number of sexual partners, and also increase \n     condom use.\n       (25) Young people are our greatest hope for changing the \n     course of the AIDS epidemic. According to the World Health \n     Organization, ``Focusing on young people is likely to be the \n     most effective approach to confronting the epidemic, \n     particularly in high prevalence countries.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that sexually active young \n     people, both unmarried and married, who live in a country \n     where HIV infection is spreading through the general \n     population, rather than being confined to specific \n     populations, such as sex workers and their clients, injecting \n     drug users, and men who have sex with men, and the rate of \n     HIV infection among people between the ages of 15 and 49 \n     exceeds 1 percent should be--\n       (1) considered at high risk of contracting HIV infection; \n     and\n       (2) provided with the knowledge, skill-building programs, \n     and tools to protect themselves from HIV infection, \n     including--\n       (A) medically accurate information on public health \n     benefits and failure rates of multiple strategies for \n     eliminating or reducing the risks of contracting HIV and \n     other sexually transmitted infections; and\n       (B) information about correct and consistent use of condoms \n     as well as abstinence and the importance of reducing casual \n     sexual partnering.\n\n     SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.\n\n       Section 403 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/\n     AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), in the second sentence, by striking \n     ``HIV/AIDS prevention'' and inserting ``prevention of the \n     sexual transmission of HIV''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Abstinence-Until-Marriage Programs.--The term \n     `abstinence-until-marriage programs' means programs that \n     place the highest priority on encouraging individuals who \n     have not yet married to abstain from sexual activity, which \n     if practiced 100 percent correctly and consistently is the \n     only certain way to protect against exposure to HIV and other \n     sexually transmitted infections. The programs include \n     information on the health benefits of delayed sexual debut in \n     reducing the transmission of HIV and may be used to support \n     the wide range of approaches that promote skill-building \n     strategies for practicing abstinence.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.\n\n       Section 104A(d)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2(d)(3)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``sexually active \n     young people, both unmarried and married, who live in a \n     country experiencing a generalized HIV epidemic,'' after \n     ``infected with HIV/AIDS,''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) In subparagraph (A), the term `generalized epidemic' \n     means, with respect to a country, that--\n       ``(i) HIV infection is spreading through the general \n     population of such country, rather than being confined to \n     specific populations, such as sex workers and their clients, \n     injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men; and\n       ``(ii) the rate of HIV infection among people between the \n     ages of 15 and 49 exceeds 1 percent.''.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join with my dear colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, to address a critical problem--the prevention of HIV \ninfection. HIV/AIDS affects people of all walks of life and all corners \nof the globe. Today over 40 million are infected with HIV. In the \nUnited States today, we have seen HIV infection become a much more \nmanageable disease as modern medications have enabled so many to lead \nproductive lives. That was certainly not so ten years ago.\n  Today the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, is \nintended to extend the progress we have made to countries where \nresources are so limited that HIV infection has inevitably led to AIDS \nand death. PEPFAR is intended to prevent 7 million new infections, to \nbring 2 million into treatment, and to provide care for approximately \n10 million with HIV/AIDS.\n  Prevention is clearly key to stopping this global epidemic. In Uganda \nwe have seen remarkable progress made in preventing infection when a \ncombined strategy was employed which promoted abstinence, faithfulness \nin marriage, and condom use--the ``ABC'' approach.\n  The Congress saw this strategy could be effective, and many sought to \nensure that abstinence would be supported in PEPFAR. In fact, a \nstatutory requirement mandates that one-third of all PEPFAR prevention \nmonies are dedicated to the exclusive use of abstinence and \nfaithfulness in marriage to prevent HIV infection.\n  It is critical to recognize that abstinence, and even marital \nfaithfulness, is not enough to stem the tide of this epidemic. \nAbstinence is not a relevant means of protection if you are, for \nexample, a married woman who has an HIV-positive husband. That woman \nneeds protection, whether that be a condom, a microbicide, or other \nmeans to protect herself.\n  We also recognize that sexual transmission is certainly not the only \nmeans of transmitting HIV. We have seen newborns and infants infected \nduring delivery and nursing. We have seen failures of hygiene in \nhospital settings cause HIV/AIDS. We have seen HIV spread by drug \nabuse. Each of these must be addressed to reduce the spread the HIV \nvirus.\n  So we can see that while devoting funds for abstinence programs to \nprevent sexual transmission of HIV may be justified, one certainly \ncould harm other efforts with a mandate that one-third of all funds be \nso dedicated.\n  That is indeed what has transpired. In April the GAO reported that \ncountries are encountering difficulty in meeting their prevention needs \nbecause they must spend one-third of all their prevention funds on \nabstinence and faithfulness programs. They know they should not ignore \nother prevention strategies. Sometimes they end up spending more than \nneeded on prevention as a result, while in other cases essential \nprevention programs are sacrificed.\n  Consider the actual impact of such a rigid funding requirement today. \nThe\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation has reported that in \nSwaziland, nearly half of the women visiting their health clinics are \nHIV-infected. Abstinence education is not germane to these women--nor \nis faithfulness. They wish to avoid infecting their children. So the \nneeds of a given country, and even of a local community, must take \nprecedence. A one-size-fits-all approach certainly does not work.\n  That is why I have joined Senator Feinstein today in introducing \nlegislation to address the problems which the GAO described. It does \nthis quite simply. First, it acknowledges that abstinence can play a \nrole in preventing HIV infection. As such, the bill maintains a \nrequirement for abstinence--so that at least one-third of funds used \nfor preventing sexual transmission will be dedicated to such programs. \nYet with two-thirds available for other means, we know countries can \nrespond with all appropriate prevention strategies.\n  By setting the abstinence funding requirement so it applies only to \nsexual transmission, we will avoid impacting those programs which \nprevent nonsexual transmission of HIV. We cannot forget that these \nother strategies--such as reducing mother-to-child transmission--are \nmajor needs in some localities.\n  Our legislation does a second critical thing. The current statute \nrequires exclusivity in funded abstinence programs. If, for example, \nyour program desired to dispense condoms, you could not do so, even if \nthis was a very minor part of your program's prevention efforts. Now \nconsider again the ``discordant'' couple--where only one spouse is \ninfected. Would anyone propose that in that marriage, one should not \nhelp the uninfected partner remain so? Our legislation provides a bit \nof flexibility and allows funded abstinence programs to utilize other \nstrategies such as condoms as a minor part of their prevention program. \nThat is simply commonsense. It follows what we have seen to work--the \n``ABC'' approach.\n  Finally, this legislation does a third thing, and that is to simply \nrecognize that sexually active youth who live in a country where HIV \ninfection is spreading through the general population should be \nconsidered at high risk of contracting HIV and provided with \ninformation on the complete range of tools to prevent the spread of \nHIV. We simply must not lose a generation to AIDS prevention can be so \neffective.\n  I thank the President for his leadership in bringing the PEPFAR \neffort forward to help millions realize the promise of a future in \nwhich HIV will no longer threaten their future. Today, I ask my \ncolleagues to join with Senator Feinstein and me in seeing this \nlegislation is enacted to ensure that we address the funding problems \nidentified by the GAO and effectively employ HIV/AIDS prevention to \nstem this global epidemic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 3657. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nbonds guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Banks to be treated as tax-\nexempt bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate, I have \ndevoted much of my time at looking for innovative ways to develop local \ncommunities in which our families can prosper. It is in that spirit \nthat I am introducing legislation today that will help local \ngovernments across the country meet economic development needs in a \nmanner that partners with the private sector and saves local taxpayers \nmoney. Specifically, I rise today to introduce legislation that would \nallow community bank members of Federal Home Loan Banks to provide \ncredit support to tax-exempt municipal development bonds, including \nletters of credit, LOCs.\n  Under current law, State and local governments are able to issue tax-\nexempt bonds to help fund community and economic projects. To ensure \nthat bond investors will be paid in full, Federal Home Loan Banks \nprovide a LOC. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, has \nclassified Federal Home Loan Bank LOCs as a Federal guarantee, a \ndecision that triggers the loss of a bond's tax-exempt status. By \nallowing community banks to partner with the Federal Home Loan Banks to \noffer credit support on municipal tax-exempt bonds, local communities \nwill be able to reduce the cost to local taxpayers for bonds issued for \nsuch projects as wastewater treatment facilities, fire stations, \nmedical clinics, school buses, long-term care facilities, and \ninfrastructure improvements.\n  Through their community bank owners, Federal Home Loan Banks have \noffered letters of credit for over 10 years. They can provide letters \nof credit for taxable municipal bonds and tax-exempt housing bonds; \nhowever, due to a quirk in the law, they cannot do so for tax-exempt \neconomic development bonds. My legislation would fix this inconsistency \nin the Tax Code.\n  Congress has already determined that credit support issued by other \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, GSEs, can support nonhousing \nmunicipal bond issues without losing tax-exempt treatment. The other \nGSEs mentioned in the code--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the \nFarm Credit System, and the Tennessee Valley Administration--are \nprivately owned corporations--Federal Home Loan Banks--whose \nobligations are also not guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Therefore, \ngranting the Federal Home Loan Bank letters of credit the same \nrecognition is simply an equitable proposition.\n  This legislation will have a positive economic impact for local \ncommunities. Allowing Federal Home Loan Banks to provide credit support \nfor tax-exempt municipal bonds will increase access to capital for \nmunicipalities which will spur economic growth and stimulate job \ncreation. Municipal bonds raise money for public purposes to build and \nstrengthen their communities. This is why groups like the Pennsylvania \nSchool Board Association supports this provision. They agree that this \nbill can ``potentially help school districts lower the costs for \nexpensive school projects, such as bus purchasing and building \nconstruction.'' Hospitals can gain the resources necessary to utilize \nthe most up-to-date technology to provide our children with the best \nhealth care possible. Municipal bonds help local officials finance \nrenovations of sewer systems, roads and highways to improve the quality \nof life for families.\n  This legislation is important because it gives local officials an \nadditional option as they strive to do more for their communities with \ntighter budget constraints. This bill is supported by the National \nLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America, the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, \nthe National Association of Homebuilders, and the American Bankers \nAssociation, the National Association of Higher Educational Facilities \nAuthorities, and the National Council of Health Facilities Finance \nAuthorities. In my state of Pennsylvania, this effort is supported by \nthe Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, the Pennsylvania Association \nof Community Bankers, the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, the \nPennsylvania School Boards Association, and the Pennsylvania League of \nMunicipalities. These groups have a strong reputation of supporting \neconomic development on the state and local level.\n  This bill will simply provide consistency in the Tax Code, but more \nimportantly, the benefits to our families and communities will be \nsubstantial.\n  Congress must continue to look for ways to spur economic development \nfor America's communities. This bill will help do just that, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3659. A bill to reauthorize and improve the women's small business \nownership programs of the Small Business Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the ranking member on the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join my colleague \nand chair, Senator Snowe, in introducing the Women's Small Business \nOwnership Programs Act of 2006. This legislation reauthorizes and \nstrengthens vital small business programs for women entrepreneurs \nnationwide.\n  Small businesses are the driving force behind innovation and national \neconomic prosperity in the United States. Employing over 19 million \nworkers, while pumping some $2 trillion into the economy, America's \n10.6\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nmillion women-owned businesses play an integral role in this endeavor. \nHowever, despite their critical contributions to our Nation, women \nentrepreneurs still face many obstacles in the business world. Without \nthe support and guidance of Women's Business Centers and other women \nsmall business ownership programs, which provide necessary tools to \nensure the long term success of women-owned firms, many female \nentrepreneurs would not be able to open their doors and stay in \nbusiness. Given women-owned businesses' contributions to our society, \nit is imperative that we continue to advocate on their behalf, and this \nlegislation does just that.\n  In recent years, the Small Business Administration, SBA, has seen its \nannual budget repeatedly slashed by the Bush administration--the most \nout of any other Federal agency. The fiscal year 2007 proposal was no \ndifferent. Among the various programmatic cuts within the President's \nfiscal year 2007 budget, technical assistance funding was set at just \n$104 million--down from his proposals of $108 million in fiscal year \n2006 and $111 million in fiscal year 2005. This funding plays a crucial \nrole in the development and sustainability of Women's Business Centers \nin states across the country. The SBA provides grants from technical \nassistance funding to help support over 80 Women's Business Centers \nNationwide. One such example is the Center for Women and Enterprise, \nwhich has served the greater Boston, Worcester, and Providence areas \nsince 1995. In that time, the center has certified over 150 women-owned \nbusinesses and served as a catalyst in helping entrepreneurs create \nover 15,000 new jobs.\n  More centers such as this ought to be in place in areas spanning the \nNation. That is why I made it a priority to author and pass the Women's \nBusiness Center Sustainability Act of 1999, to help successful centers \nremain open and viable in the areas they serve. This bill was signed \ninto law as a means of safeguarding successful centers with proven \nresults by authorizing continued funding for a set time period under \nsustainability grants. The theory behind this bipartisan legislation \nwas to continue to allow for new centers, but to also ensure that those \nwith a proven track record would continue to be helped. And yet, since \nits enactment, Senator Snowe and I have had to fight each year to \nensure that there is sustainability funding through the passage of \nnumerous temporary extensions and a series of exchanges with the SBA. \nThese centers are vital in equipping women entrepreneurs with the tools \nthey need to succeed in business, and it is unfortunate that this \nadministration has attempted to eliminate sustainability funding since \nPresident Bush took office. It is high time that all centers \ndemonstrating proven results year in and year out receive this \nsustainability funding.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, guarantees the future of the \nWomen's Business Center Program and bridges it with other SBA-related \nwomen's initiatives to ensure there exists a unified and cohesive \nmission driving the programs forward for women entrepreneurs across the \ncountry. In this, the bill not only makes permanent the Women's \nBusiness Center Sustainability Pilot Program--through the creation of \n3-year ``renewal'' grants for centers with sustainability grants, and \n4-year ``initial'' grants for new centers across the country--but it \nalso increases the program's authorization levels. Furthermore, our \nlegislation calls for the Office of Women's Business Ownership to make \nall Women's Business Center grants at $150,000 and to work in \nconsultation with Women's Business Centers whenever making improvements \nto the program.\n  Additionally, this legislation calls for a more streamlined approach \nfor the Women's Business Center Program's data collection, grant \napplication, and selection criteria, in an effort to ensure a smooth \ntransition from sustainability to the newly established program. The \nWomen's Small Business Ownership Programs Act of 2006 also contains \nprivacy protections for the Women's Business Council, Women's Business \nCenters, and their small business clients.\n  The bill's provisions make several minor, yet significant, changes to \nboth the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise, as well \nas the National Women's Business Council--enabling both entities to \nserve as a better resource for not only the administration and \nCongress, but the larger small business community as well. In order to \nincrease and strengthen women business owners' representation in the \nFederal Government, the bill reestablishes the Interagency Committee on \nWomen's Business Enterprise, and creates a Policy Advisory Group to \naide the committee's chairperson in the development of policies and \nprograms under this act. It also creates three subcommittees similar to \nthose created under the National Women's Business Council. \nAdditionally, in order to afford the National Women's Business Council \nmore flexibility in its use of funds, the bill gives it cosponsorship \nauthority, and directs it to act as a clearinghouse for historical \ndata.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that similar legislation drew \nwide bipartisan support in the 108th Congress. Despite arriving at a \nbipartisan Women's Business Center compromise on the Senate Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, the Republican majority failed \nto include this compromise in the last SBA reauthorization package. I \nwould like to thank Chair Snowe for her work in addressing the needs of \nAmerica's female entrepreneurs, and for her steadfast support for this \nlegislation. She is a true advocate for women-owned small businesses.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport the Women's Small Business Ownership Programs Act of 2006.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the Republican leader came to my office a \nfew minutes ago and indicated he had some family situation that he \nneeded to attend to. It was no emergency or anything, but it is late. \nIt is a quarter to 8.\n  On WRDA, we have cleared that on our side. And we have some \nnominations we have also cleared on our side. I am confident that \nWRDA--which we were planning to go to that Tuesday night after we \nfinished the stem cell legislation--I am very confident we can work \nthat out.\n  As I indicated, we are set mechanically to go forward on WRDA. It has \nbeen cleared on both sides, even the time on the amendments. We thought \nwe had the nominations worked out dealing with a very important agency \nof our Government.\n  I am confident, I repeat, that we will be able to do that as soon as \npeople are back in their offices.\n  So I do not in any way retract my statements about how it is possible \nto work on things together around here. This was shown with the \ndifficult time that Senators had working on the request that was \nbrought before the Senate just a half hour ago or so.\n  It is a very important bill. I have been chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee on two separate occasions. It is very \ndifficult to get things out of that committee because of different \nfeelings people have on issues. But Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer \nworked very well and got it to the floor.\n  So I am hopeful that even maybe tomorrow we can do the unanimous \nconsent request that has been laid before the Senate and have that \napproved. If not, we will do it Monday. I am hopeful and confident we \ncan do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
