Mr. President, this morning, as the world has taken \nnotice of the passing of Pope John Paul II, I rise to speak. I know the \nSenate today will be taking a resolution to speak to the issue of the \nPope's passing.\n  As a person of the Roman Catholic faith myself, I thought it \nimportant and appropriate that this morning I take a few moments to \nspeak to the greatness of this man and the contributions he made not \nonly to enriching the faith life of those of us who practice the Roman \nCatholic faith, but to the people of the world as a great statesman and \nmoral leader.\n  Pope John Paul was one of the remarkable people of our times. His \npapacy lasted 26 years, which is the third longest in the over 2,000-\nyear history of our church. But it was during tumultuous and difficult \ntimes. Pope John Paul was prepared for this papacy, prepared for this \nmantle of leadership through tremendous hardships in his life. As a \nyoung person, he lost his mother very early in life, only to be \nfollowed by the very dramatic loss of his only brother, and only a very \nfew years later the loss of his beloved father. So at a very young age, \nas a very young man, Pope John Paul was left alone in the world without \nany close family. He developed a long and strong network of friendships \nthat he maintained all through his life, and even through the days of \nhis papacy.\n  In addition, the Pope's youth was tempered by living under tyranny, \nby the fact that in his youth he had to be subjected to the tyrannical \noccupation by Germany of his Polish homeland and the persecution of \npeople such as himself--people of faith.\n  In addition, once that was over and he began to seek his vocational \npursuit in the priesthood, he had to do so underground, because \nsubsequent to the German occupation and the Nazi regimes, and \nimmediately thereafter, it was followed by the Communist takeover of \nPoland. Eastern Europe, as we\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nall know, became engulfed and contained by what came to be known, in \nthe words of Sir Winston Churchill, as the Iron Curtain, with Poland \nfalling behind the walls of that Iron Curtain, where religion was \nsuppressed, faith was not to be practiced openly, and where he could \nnot attend seminary openly. He would have to do it in an underground \nfashion.\n  The Pope's preparation for his priesthood and his papacy was forged \nin the difficult times that he faced not only personally but also in \nhis life as a citizen of Poland. It then fell upon him to be Pope at a \ntime when the world was undergoing change, and at a time when the \npeople of his beloved Poland were energized as no other in history by \nhis papacy and his theme of ``be not afraid.'' His trip back to Poland \nin the early years of his papacy was punctuated by his remarkable \nreception by the people of Poland--people thirsty for freedom, thirsty \nfor an opportunity to end the yoke of tyranny and communism. So the \npapal visit was a transcending moment in the history of Poland. As we \nnow know, it was a transcending moment in the history of our world \nbecause it did signal the beginning of the end of Communist rule in \nEastern Europe.\n  We know Pope John Paul worked closely with several U.S. Presidents \nbut none more closely than President Ronald Reagan, in those crucial \nyears when the Cold War came to a head, and when we saw the beginning \nof the fraying of what was a failed system, a system that had only been \nmaintained through terror and fear. His theme of ``be not afraid'' \nbegan to be heard and responded to, and the people of Poland began that \nsurge toward freedom, which was inevitable in all of Eastern Europe. So \nthe Pope's contribution there was crucial, critical, and was something \nthat I think we all saw as a tremendous contribution.\n\n  Of course, the Pope also visited the United States on many occasions. \nI believe I have heard over the last several days it was the second \nmost visited country after his beloved Poland. It was with great \nsignificance that we received him here, and it made a tremendous \ndifference in the life of our own country. More recently, he visited \nCuba 8 years ago. Cuba is an imprisoned land where there had never been \na papal visit. Also, it is a country ruled under the same tyrannical \ncommunism he saw in his native Poland during his youth and he battled \nall during his adult life being suppressed in his ability to worship \nfreely.\n  Cuba happens to be the place where I was born, where I began my life, \nand where the principles of the Catholic faith were taught to me early \nin life by my family and my church. It was in that same land that I \ncame to understand the meaning of oppression, tyranny, and the lack of \nreligious freedom the Pope had experienced in his youth. He and I, in \ndifferent parts of the world, in a sense shared a common experience and \nunderstanding of the limitations of freedom that are sometimes placed \nupon people by governments that do not respect what we find so basic \nand so rightful, which is the right of free speech and the right of \npracticing one's religion freely. The Pope's trip to Cuba was a \nmonumental thing because it helped the people to begin again to \npractice their faith in a more open way. His theme of ``be not afraid'' \nwas heard by Cuba, and thousands of Cubans were for the first time \nexpressing their faith in an open way, in a way they had not been \npermitted to do before, but which now they dare to do.\n  The Pope's visit did not have the same galvanizing political effect \nit had in Poland, where it also led to political change, but it did \nhave a strong pastoral theme, a message that the people of Cuba \nwelcomed with open arms. It also inspired the archbishop in Santiago, \nCuba, the second largest city in Cuba, to speak forcefully about \noppression in Cuba, the lack of religious freedom, and continuation of \noppression--the kind of religious oppression I felt in my life that led \nme to seek freedom in the United States, with the very help of the same \nchurch the Pope came to lead, the Catholic Church. His fight against \natheists and communism over the years also led him to conduct a program \ncalled Operation Peter Pan, which took 14,000 young people from Cuba to \nfreedom in the United States. I was lucky enough to be among them, so \nmy life began under the care of the Catholic church.\n  I understand fully the religious oppression the people of Cuba have \nsuffered, which continues to this day but which the Pope made a little \nbetter. He gave them a window, an opening, a moment, for the first time \nin over 35 years. Christmas was celebrated in anticipation of the papal \nvisit. Unfortunately, Cuba now has fallen back into a more repressive \npractice, and freedom of religion is curtailed even more today.\n  As we look at the Pope's life, at this moment in history, as we \nreflect on this remarkable man, his remarkable life, and the \ncontributions he made, we also must continue to understand there is \nwork still to be done. There are people in the world who still are \nhungry and suffer, and there are those who still lack the religious \nfreedoms to openly practice their faith, much as the Pope in his youth \nwas curtailed. People today in Cuba and other places around the world \nstill yearn for that opportunity to freely worship and to do what we \ndo. As we began our proceedings this morning, the Chaplain of the \nSenate offered a word of prayer.\n  I conclude by simply saying that we have been touched in our lives by \nthis remarkable man, this life which has shaped the world in which we \nlive. It is a life well lived. As he has come to the end of his \njourney, I hope those of us who share in his faith and in his ideals of \nthe respect of every human life and every human being will continue to \ncarry on the wonderful legacy he left for us.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I join in mourning the loss of Pope \nJohn Paul II. In my lifetime, he was the first Pope I can remember who \ncould actually be put in the category of being an evangelist.\n  No other Pope ever traveled as much as this Pope did, and no man ever \ntook the Word to the different corners of the world like this man did, \nand that is why he is so revered around the world.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns pertaining to the introduction of S. 696 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about three \nareas of accountability as we begin discussing a range of things in the \nSenate this week. The issue of accountability rises on the question of \nthe report offered to the American people and to the Congress by Judge \nLaurence Silberman and former Senator Chuck Robb. It deals with the \nquestion of intelligence preceding the Iraq war.\n  The 600-page report given us was largely a useless retelling of what \nwe know already. I do not want to completely diminish the effort, and \nthere are some things in that report that are interesting, but the fact \nis, we already know that the intelligence with respect to Iraq was dead \nwrong. The major question is, How was the intelligence used and for \nwhat purpose was it used?\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\n  We know what we were told prior to the Iraq war. All of us went to \nbriefings up in the room in the Capitol where we receive top secret \nbriefings, and we heard all kinds of language there and in the popular \npress by people in this administration and others who said that this \nwas a certainty, that they knew where the weapons of mass destruction \nwere in Iraq; it was urgent; there were unmanned aerial vehicles to \ndeliver weapons of mass destruction; this is a slam dunk.\n  Now we know not only from this report but from previous reports that \nthis intelligence was gathered, for example, with respect to one of the \nissues, as our Secretary of State told the world in the United Nations \npresentation, concerning the prospect that the Iraqis were developing a \nmobile chemical weapons lab to produce weapons of mass destruction. Now \nwe discover that information came from a source named ``curve ball.'' \nIt was a single-source piece of information. Some suspect that ``curve \nball'' was a drunk, at least when he met with our intelligence folks. \nIt says that he was suspected of having a hangover. We know that he was \na fabricator.\n  So on the basis of a fabricator, a drunk, single source, we told the \nworld through our Secretary of State that Iraq had mobile chemical \nweapons labs that threatened our country.\n  The aluminum tubes are another story. I am not going to go through \nall the stories, but the question is, Where is the accountability? We \nget a 600-page report that tells us what we already know; that the \nintelligence with respect to Iraq was dead wrong. Where is the \naccountability? Where does the buck stop?\n  Mr. Tenet, who was the head of the CIA--and this 600-page report \npoints certainly to him among others--was brought to the Oval Office, \nto the White House, and given the Medal of Freedom after he left the \nCIA. Where is the accountability? Is there accountability in this \ncountry for having gotten it not just wrong but, as the 600-page report \nsays, dead wrong? Will this Congress require accountability? I think it \nis very important.\n  This 600-page report is half the story. The other part of the story \nis not only bad intelligence, but how was it used, and what was the \npurpose of using it? Go to the Woodward book, go to the O'Neill book, \nand one gets some hint of the connection to this.\n  I think this Congress is owed additional answers. I think this report \nwas far too narrow.\n  Second, I want to ask about accountability with respect to an \nindependent investigation that is going on in this town. The Washington \nPost report was surprising to me because I was not aware of these \nfacts. The Washington Post did a story that said the cost of the \nCisneros probe nears $21 million over 10 years. This was a probe of \nHousing Secretary Henry Cisneros by independent counsel David Barrett. \nIn May of 1995, Mr. Barrett was appointed as independent counsel to \ninvestigate allegations that a then Cabinet Secretary lied to the FBI \nabout money that he had paid to a former mistress. That was May 1995.\n  In September 1999, Mr. Cisneros pleaded guilty, paid a $10,000 fine, \nand then following that he was later pardoned by President Clinton. By \nthen, the independent counsel had spent $10.3 million on his \ninvestigation, and since that time he has spent another $10 million-\nplus on the investigation.\n\n  Is there a screw loose someplace? What are they thinking about? There \nwas an independent counsel appointed 10 years ago to investigate an \nalleged impropriety by a Cabinet official. The Cabinet official pleaded \nguilty 4 years later, was pardoned a year after that. The independent \ncounsel is still working? He is supposed to be supervised by three \nFederal judges, but the fact is, they are leaking money down there.\n  I intend to offer an amendment to the supplemental to shut off the \nfunding. Ten years later, $21 million, investigating the question of \nwhether a Cabinet official lied about money paid to his mistress? He \npleads guilty to it and we have a guy 10 years later still \ninvestigating it?\n  I think waste is a disaster in the Federal Government. Talk about \nwaste, this is shameful, and if the three-judge panel does not have the \ncommon sense to shut this down, then the Congress, I hope, will have \nthe common sense to shut it down. I will offer an amendment during the \nsupplemental that shuts off the money and does it now.\n  The third area of accountability is this: As chairman of the Policy \nCommittee on our side, I have held a good number of hearings on the \nissue of contracting in Iraq. There is massive waste, fraud, and abuse \ngoing on with respect to contracting in Iraq. All of us know there is \nmoney going out of this Congress in wholesale quantities, tens of \nbillions of dollars.\n  Last year, Congress passed a bill for reconstruction money in Iraq. I \ndid not vote for it; I voted against it. In fact, I offered an \namendment to shut it down, reconstruction money to the tune of nearly \n$19 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq. In addition to that, we \nhave spent nearly $160 billion to $180 billion on the war in Iraq. \nThere is an $82 billion request before the Senate right now. That is \nthe supplemental I was referring to earlier. This is a massive amount \nof money being spent with respect to the operations in Iraq and also \nthe reconstruction in Iraq.\n  I will talk a bit about what we have learned. One contractor was \nfeeding our troops and charged the American Government, the Pentagon, \nfor feeding 42,000 troops a day. It turns out this contractor was only \nproviding 14,000 meals a day. We are getting billed for 42,000 meals, \nbut the contractor was only providing 14,000 meals. Someplace 28,000 \nmeals are charged for that were never offered to our troops, or perhaps \nnot needed.\n  I come from a small town, and they call that cheating in my hometown. \nThat contractor is still the largest contractor in Iraq being paid by \nthe U.S. taxpayer.\n  We had testimony from truckdrivers who were hired to move goods \naround Iraq, including fuel coming into Iraq by contractors. \nTruckdrivers testified that $85,000 brandnew trucks were left on the \nside of the road to be torched and looted because they had a clogged \nfuel pump or because they had a flat tire they could not fix. What did \nthey do? They left the truck beside the road, just abandoned the truck. \nThat is the kind of waste, fraud, and abuse that is going on.\n  We had a guy testify and show us a picture of the bags of cash that \nwere used to give to contractors in Iraq. One contract company started \nbusiness in Iraq with $450. They have been paid tens of millions of \ndollars now. Two of their employees, by the way, became whistleblowers \nand said: What we are seeing is making us sick, so we are going to tell \nsomebody about it.\n  Here is what they said: These two people who started this company and \nare contracting with the U.S. Government--it is called the Coalition \nProvisional Authority that we created in Iraq; it was us, we paid for \nit--were providing security at an airport, and they were alleged by the \nemployees to have taken forklift trucks off the airport property to a \nwarehouse, repaint them blue, and then bring them back to the airport \nand sell them to the U.S. taxpayers through the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority. Again, in my hometown, they call that fraud.\n  We had a big picture that one of the other whistleblowers had taken \nwho worked in Iraq, and he said: We told contractors in Iraq that when \nit was time to get paid, just bring a big bag because we are going to \ngive you cash. He showed us one picture of the contractor I discussed, \nthe one with respect to the forklift trucks. He showed one picture of \n$2 million wrapped in Saran Wrap in bundles sitting on a table and the \ncontractor comes with a big bag and they get their $2 million and waltz \noff.\n\n  This contractor, by the way, was also alleged to have created a \nsubsidiary in the country of Lebanon for the purpose of buying and \nselling to and from itself so it could inflate prices and therefore \nfurther cheat the United States taxpayer.\n  It is unbelievable what we have learned about contracting in Iraq. \nOne whistleblower came forward and said he was the buyer who was \nsupposed to buy towels for U.S. soldiers. He said this is the towel I \nbought under orders from my superiors. The company wanted to pay almost \ndouble the price of the towel in order to have the company's name \nembroidered on the towel the soldiers used--unbelievable waste.\n  When you think of what is happening, this Congress is shoveling out \ntens of billions of dollars in pursuit of\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nall of this and nobody is watching the store. You hear the stories \nabout us paying for reconstruction of a building in Iraq--and we are \ndoing it for thousands of buildings. We decide we are going to put an \nair conditioner in that building, so it is subcontracted to an Iraq \nsubcontracting company. First it goes to the contractors who are in \nIraq being paid by our Government, some of whom I have described here, \nand then it goes to an Iraq subcontractor, and then the subcontractor \nfor that subcontractor, and pretty soon that air conditioner in the \nbuilding became a ceiling fan and we paid for an air conditioner and \nthe ceiling fan doesn't work. So there you are.\n  The question is, who in this Congress is going to decide this matters \nat a time when we are up to our neck in debt, the largest debt in the \nhistory of this country, with a fiscal policy that is way off track, a \nPresident who sends us a budget with the highest Federal budget \ndeficits in history, and trade deficits that are the highest in \nhistory, a combined fiscal policy and trade deficit of over $1 trillion \nin the past year? We are sinking and drowning in debt. Who is going to \ncare about this kind of waste, fraud, and abuse, the most serious I \nhave seen in all the years I have served in the Congress?\n  I raise this because it relates to accountability, accountability \nwith respect to the use of intelligence prior to the war in Iraq, \naccountability with an independent counsel who spent $21 million 10 \nyears after the fact when he was supposed to investigate a Cabinet \nofficial who lied about paying money to his mistress. This is an \nindependent counsel who is still operating and has spent $21 million. \nWho is accountable for that? Who is accountable for waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Iraq?\n  Harry Truman had the famous sign on his desk, ``The buck stops \nhere.'' These days the buck doesn't seem to stop anywhere. Nobody seems \nto be accountable for anything.\n  I intend to offer another amendment. I don't know whether I will \noffer it on the existing bill or on the supplemental, but I will offer \nit again, setting up a Truman committee of sorts. In 1941, at the start \nof the Second World War, Harry Truman, then a Democratic Senator when a \nDemocrat was in the White House, traveled around this country and saw \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in military spending. He created a special \ncommittee and as a result of the investigation of that committee they \nunearthed massive fraud and massive waste. That was when a Democrat in \nthe Congress did it, when a Democrat was in the White House.\n  These days nobody wants to raise any questions. You don't want to \nmake any waves because we have one-party control and we don't want to \ntalk about this, that, or the other thing. The fact is, I have never \nseen the kind of waste that now exists with respect to our operations \nin Iraq. It undercuts and undermines our soldiers' efforts, in my \njudgment. It cheats America's taxpayers, and it represents the worst of \nGovernment.\n\n  We ought to be able to hire contractors who will do the job without \nallowing waste, fraud, and abuse to represent the major impact of what \nwe see happening in Iraq these days with respect to these contractors.\n  Part of this stems from greed. Part of it stems from the fact that \nmany of these contracts in Iraq are no-bid contracts--one company. I \nhave not mentioned Halliburton, but I could because a lot of it deals \nwith Halliburton and KBR--not exclusively, but a lot of it. Any time \nsomebody mentions Halliburton, somebody says: Oh, you are attacking the \nVice President. Not a bit. This happened after the Vice President left \nHalliburton. These are of recent vintage, these activities in Iraq. It \nis not an attack on anybody. It is in support of the taxpayers of this \ncountry. We ought not allow this to happen. Republicans and Democrats \nall ought to stand on their feet and demand accountability and demand \nthat the waste, fraud, and abuse stop--$8,000 a month to rent an SUV; \n$40 for a case of pop or soda--Coca-Cola.\n  There were 50,000 pounds of nails ordered by a contractor to Iraq. \nThey were the wrong length, so they dumped them. If anybody wants to \npick up 50,000 pounds of nails, they are laying in the sand in Iraq. It \nis unbelievable the waste, fraud, and abuse we hear about.\n  The reason I have held the hearings in the Democratic Policy \nCommittee is nobody else will hold hearings. No one else wants to hold \nthese contractors accountable. There are whistleblowers all over who \nare disgusted with what they saw, working for contractors and \nsupervising contractors in Iraq.\n  I have only described a brief portion of what we learned in these \nhearings. We intend to conduct additional hearings. My preference would \nbe that we not conduct these hearings in my committee. My preference \nwould be that the authorizing committees and the relevant committees \nthat should be assuming oversight of this would hold aggressive \nhearings, but they don't and they probably won't, and as a result we \nwill continue to do this.\n  I am intending to offer an amendment to create a Truman-type \ncommittee here in the Congress, as we did some decades ago, to take a \nhard look at what is happening through that kind of committee, an \ninvestigative committee that would include Republicans and Democrats, \nall of whom I hope would be committed and dedicated to the task of \ndeciding that waste, fraud, and abuse is not something that should \nhappen on any of our watches here in the Congress.\n  Again, I think the key issue here is accountability. There seems to \nbe none these days in almost any direction. I hope in all of these \nareas we can begin to decide there is accountability, at least here in \nthe Congress.\n  I yield the floor and make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3166-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3166-S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise this morning, just having returned \nto Washington from Colorado, to share a few comments about the Holy \nFather, Pope John Paul II.\n  My family's faith tradition--like yours, Mr. President--since time \nimmemorial has been Roman Catholic. In Pope John Paul II, we witnessed \na great spiritual leader, a conscience and a statesman.\n  Pope John Paul II exemplified the values and teachings of Jesus \nChrist in his humility, service to others, and in his struggle to have \nthe world recognize the dignity of every human being. John Paul II \nlived the creed of Jesus Christ as set forth in the Book of Matthew, \nChapter 23, Verses 11-12, where Jesus, speaking to the crowds and his \ndisciples, said:\n\n       The more lowly your service to others, the greater you are. \n     To be the greatest, be a servant. But those who think \n     themselves great shall be disappointed and humbled; and those \n     who humble themselves shall be exalted.\n\n  More than 26 years ago, in the eighth round of voting, Karol Wojtyla \nwas elected to head the Roman Catholic Church. His predecessor, Pope \nJohn Paul I, had died after only 32 days as Pope. The selection of the \ncharismatic Polish cardinal--the first non-Italian pope in 455 years--\nsurprised many people both inside and outside the Catholic Church.\n  In the quarter-century since then, Pope John Paul II continued to \nsurprise--and challenge--not only members of my church but, indeed, the \nentire world to recognize and celebrate the dignity of each and every \nperson.\n  But that was not all ``the Pilgrim Pope'' revolutionized. Where \nprevious pontiffs had often seemed distant from their flocks, Pope John \nPaul II traveled to more nations and spoke to more people--often times \nin their language--than any other pontiff in the history of the Roman \nCatholic Church.\n  His first trip abroad as pontiff was to a region in crisis. Latin \nAmerica, home of half the world's Roman Catholics, was ravaged not just \nby poverty and hunger but by violence and civil war that claimed tens \nof thousands of innocent lives.\n  His next trip was to his homeland, Poland, a land that been \nsubjugated for decades, first by Nazism, then by communism. One \njournalist wrote that the pope's visit to Poland ``helped bring about \nsuch profound, irreversible\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nchanges that Poland then became a country which was clearly ceasing to \nbe a communist country.''\n  John Paul also visited America during the first year of his Papacy, \nattracting huge crowds wherever he went. In my home State of Colorado, \n1993, he came to Denver, bringing a message of substance and hope to \nthe young people of the world. I remember that visit fondly--and recall \nmy father's excitement after he reached over a fence to touch the Pope.\n  This pope is recognized--and rightly so--as a sort of patron saint \nfor the Solidarity movement in Poland and a catalyst for the demise of \ncommunism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n  But that was only part of this pope's message. He has also warned \nrepeatedly about the shortcomings of capitalism. He reminded us all \nthat we have an obligation to help the poor and the oppressed.\n  In 1998, he traveled to Cuba, strengthening a Church that is doing \nmore and more to help that country's forgotten, and breathing life into \nan opposition movement that surprised the world--and that country's \nbackward regime--with a grassroots call for reform.\n  In 1999, he again visited the US, reminding us of our duty to not \nforget the poor and oppressed and continuing his special outreach to \nAmerica's young people and challenging them to fight for a better \nAmerica and a better world.\n  And in 2000, a visibly frail Pope visited the Holy Land to mark the \nMillennium and in an attempt to bring Jews, Christians and Muslims \ntogether. Both Jews and Muslims and Christians welcomed him--and \nrecognized and celebrated his visit--and applauded of optimism his \nwords and hope.\n  His efforts to heal the rift between the Vatican and Jews had to be \ncolored by his own experience with the brutality of anti-Semitism that \nhe had witnessed. In September 1939, he saw his university in Krakow \nshut down and eventually saw several of his friends and classmates sent \nto Auschwitz after the Nazis invaded Poland.\n  His efforts at healing historical rifts continued, evidenced by \nmeetings with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest ranking \nofficial in the Episcopal Church. Many wished he could have done more \non these hurtful rifts, but no one doubted that he began to confront \nthese challenges like no Pope has ever done in the history of our \nChurch.\n  For these nearly 27 years, the Pilgrim Pope John Paul II--an \naccomplished poet, an intellectual and a mystic in that fine Catholic \ntradition--was hailed as a visionary and attacked as a relic. Within \nthe Church itself--as in the scores of countries he visited--he was \ncriticized by critics on both the left and the right. That is because \nin the Church and on each of his many trips, he brought not only \ncomfort and hope--hope for peace in Latin America, freedom in Eastern \nEurope, reconciliation in the Middle East, and improvement in America--\nbut he also brought discomfort and challenges for all of us to do \nbetter.\n  In 2003, the Vatican had this to say about the role of the Church in \npublic life,\n\n       The Church does not wish to exercise political power or to \n     eliminate the freedom of opinion of Catholics regarding \n     contingent questions.\n       Instead, it intends--as is its proper function--to instruct \n     and illuminate the consciences of the faithful, particularly \n     those involved in political life, so that their actions may \n     always serve the integral promotion of the human person and \n     the common good.\n\n  None of us lived up to the challenges and prescriptions the Pope \nmapped out in 27 years in a perfect way. We could not because Pope John \nPaul II challenged all of us to do more, to be better.\n  Physically, the frail, stooped Pope we saw in the last weeks bore \nlittle resemblance to the athletic 58-year-old who ascended the throne \nof Peter nearly 27 years ago. But inwardly, he remained deeply \nconsistent--challenging us to uphold the dignity of each and every \nperson--and illuminated and instructed, as well as challenged and \nsurprised the entire world.\n  We will miss Pope John Paul II, but his vibrant legacy lives on in \neach of us and in the lessons and challenges he placed before us.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Zbibniew Brzezinski, the Polish-born \nnational security advisor to President Jimmy Carter, tells a story \nabout how the news of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla's election as Pope was \nreceived by the communist rulers of Poland.\n  On that day in October 1978, Mr. Brzezinski said, a group of \ncommunist writers and party leaders were meeting in Krakow. A police \ncolonel was speaking, complaining about the opposition of the church, \nwhen a woman ran into the room and said, ``Wojtyla has been elected \nPope!''\n  The second secretary of the party, not realizing his microphone was \nstill on, turned to the first secretary and said, ``My God, my God, now \nwe will have to kiss his''--and he did not say ``ring.''\n  The first party secretary, understanding the enormity of the moment, \nreplied, ``Only if he lets us.''\n  In neighboring Czechoslovakia, a dissident playwright was with \nfriends when news of the new Polish Pope came. Vaclav Havel, who would \ngo on to become the first elected president of the Czech Republic, said \nhe and his friends literally danced with joy when they heard the news. \n``We felt,'' he said, ``that he was a great and charismatic man who \nwill open the door to an unprecedented renaissance in Christianity and \nthrough it, to human spirituality in general, and who will \nfundamentally influence the future destiny and political order of the \nworld.''\n  More than 26 years later, those stories seem prophetic. Karol \nWojtyla, Pope John Paul II, did indeed change the world.\n  Today, he is being mourned not only in his beloved Poland, and not \nonly by Catholics, but by people throughout the world: Christians, \nJews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, people from every faith tradition, \nand many with no religious connections.\n  Last Friday, when it was clear the Pope was dying, a man in Havana, a \nself-described communist, told an Associated Press reporter, ``I don't \nbelieve in God. But if there is a God, let him send us a Pope as good \nas this one.''\n  In Istanbul, Turkey, the brother of the man who nearly killed the \nPope said his brother is grieving. ``He loved the Pope,'' his brother \nsaid.\n  Among the places in this country where this Pope's death has left \nmany with an aching sadness is the Five Holy Martyrs Church on the \nsouthwest side of Chicago, the historic heart of Chicago's large Polish \ncommunity. More Poles live in Chicago, IL, than any other city in the \nworld, other than Warsaw.\n  In October 1979, when Pope John Paul II made his first visit to \nAmerica as Pope, he said Mass at the Five Holy Martyrs Church, where \nthe Eucharist is still celebrated in Polish, on an altar in the church \nparking lot, surrounded by more than 17,000 people.\n  Today, the altar still stands in the parking lot; it is used once a \nyear for a special commemorative Mass. A portion of 43rd Street near \nthe Five Holy Martyrs Church has been renamed in the Pope's honor. And \nmany who saw him still recall it as one of the greatest days of their \nlives.\n  Think of this: half the people in the world today were not even born \nwhen Karol Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II. Most people under 40 have \nno memory of any other Pope, and remember John Paul only as an elderly \nand frail man.\n  Those of us who are a little older, though, remember just as clearly \nwhat a strong, athletic man he was before age and Parkinson's disease \nbegan to take their toll. ``God's athlete,'' some called him, and he \nshowed in his life how much strength he had.\n  He was a traditionalist and a revolutionary, a son of Poland, and a \ncitizen of the world. He was a mystic and a man of prayer, but he was \nalso a man of action and seemingly inexhaustible energy. Reporters \ndecades younger who accompanied him on his travels even in recent \nyears, said they returned home exhausted. But John Paul never stopped.\n  He was more than a spiritual leader; he was a major player on the \nworld diplomatic stage.\n  He visited more than 100 nations and every continent except \nAntarctica. All told, he traveled more than three times\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nthe distance from the Earth to the Moon.\n  He spoke more languages than many people can name. In 1993, he \nvisited Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia--his first trip as Pope to the \nformer Soviet Union. For that trip, he learned his 14th language, \nLithuanian, which I am sure my Lithuanian-born mother was very happy to \nhear.\n  Everywhere, his message was the same. It is what he told his fellow \nPoles on his first visit home as Pope in 1979: ``Be not afraid.'' There \nis more to this life than what you can see here and now. ``The moral \narc of the universe is long,'' as another great moral leader told us, \n``but it bends toward justice.''\n  He sided always with the oppressed, the marginalized, the voiceless, \nthe victims of war and injustice.\n  He was fearless and unflinching in the face of leaders of governments \nthat suppressed human rights and crushed human hopes. He defied the \nNazis who occupied Poland when he was a young man, and the communists \nwho followed them. He showed real strength that all of us admire.\n  His role in ending communism in Poland and bringing about the end of \nthe Soviet empire is well documented and rightly praised. He also \nhelped to bring an end to apartheid by refusing to visit South Africa \nuntil that repugnant form of government was abolished.\n  Peace, non-violence, the sanctity of life, the dignity of work, the \nrealization that we are all part of one human family and that every \nperson on earth shares ``a common dignity and a common destiny,'' the \nbelief that those who have much owe those who have less true justice, \nnot mere charity, these are the lessons John Paul preached.\n  He taught us about reconciliation. He apologized for the Church for \nthe Crusades, the Inquisition and the persecution of the Jews.\n  He showed us how to ask for forgiveness on his first trip home to \nPoland, when he visited the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and knelt in \nprayer before a memorial to Holocaust victims. He showed us again on \nhis first visit to Israel, in 2000, when he reached out his shaking \nhand to touch the Western Wall and leave a written prayer, a plea for \nforgiveness.\n  He showed us how to grant forgiveness when he visited the prison cell \nof the man who tried to kill him, and prayed with him.\n  He was the first Pope ever to visit a synagogue, or visit a mosque in \nan Islamic nation.\n  In his final days, he taught us another lesson: how to die with \ndignity.\n  John Paul II lived his life to try to heal the wounds that divide \nhumanity. It is a measure of this extraordinary man's success that he \nhas been praised in death by both Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres and \nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.\n  Karol Wojtyla had tears in his eyes when he became Pope. Many of us \nhave tears in our eyes as he leaves the papacy and this world.\n  Those of us who are Catholic feel a special connection to this Pope. \nMany of us did not always agree with him on matters of Church teaching \nand practice. That is not unusual. In every family, there are disputes. \nBut there is also great love. Even when we differed with him, we \nbelieve the Pope tried to do what he believed was right, and that is \nall we can ask of anyone.\n  During his visit to Chicago more than 25 years ago, the Pope said \nmass in Chicago's Grant Park. Many business closed that day to let \ntheir workers attend the mass. People stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the \npark.\n  Later that night, thousands of Chicagoans gathered at the Cardinal's \nmansion to sing ``good night'' to the Pope. It was late, but they \nweren't ready to let him go. He smiled as the crowd sang--and sang some \nmore. Finally, with that huge smile and that big, booming voice, the \nPope told them, ``Now you must go sleep.'' When no one moved, he smiled \nagain and repeated, like a stern but loving father, ``You must go \nsleep.''\n  All these years later, many of us still wish he could have stayed \nwith us just a little longer. But it was time for him to sleep.\n  So let us treasure the memory of this good man. And if we are moved \nto pay tribute to him, let us do our best to try to live the lessons he \ntaught us with his own extraordinary life.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Holy Father.\n  Pope John Paul II was an extraordinary ambassador for the betterment \nof humankind in every corner of the globe. His humanity shone through \nevery day for two and a half decades of his papacy and his impact on \nthe world will be everlasting.\n  He was a moral leader in so many of the great battles of our time. He \nfought Communism without violence, and he was dogged in his battles \nagainst war, injustice, and intolerance wherever he found them. He \nviewed the world in clear terms of good and evil, but he never once \ndescended to demagoguery. He was a man who at once understood both the \nfrailty and potential of the human spirit.\n  What other kind of man could have forgiven his would be assassin in \nperson and prayed with him in his jail cell?\n  His capacity for belief in the betterment of man moved the world.\n  What other kind of man could overcome centuries of mistrust and \nconflict to establish diplomatic ties between the Vatican and the State \nof Israel. That was truly a bold and historic move.\n  As a New Yorker, I also must offer to say a special thanks to the \nPope from the residents of our State and city. New York is an \ninternational city that attracts immigrants from all over the world who \ncome with the dream of finding a better life.\n  While the Pope might be the most famous Pole of his time, every one \nof our citizens admired and often shared his pluck, his expansiveness \nand his optimism, qualities that make New York the greatest city on \nEarth. That is one of the reasons he was revered as such a hero by all \nNew Yorkers, because the qualities that he exhibited of optimism and \npluck and expansiveness are characteristics of our city as well. So \nevery time he came here, there was a beautiful union. Like the Statue \nof Liberty that he quoted in his visit to Giants Stadium in 1995, his \nlife and work was a symbol to millions on these shores and beyond that \nthey, too, if they worked hard and stuck to their principles and moral \nvalues, could enjoy a better life.\n  And when terrible tragedy struck our city that awful day 4 years ago, \nthe Pope's poignant statements reassured all New Yorkers and all \nAmericans. He said at that time:\n\n       May the Blessed Virgin, bring comfort and hope to all who \n     are suffering because of the tragic terrorist attack that \n     profoundly wounded the beloved American people in recent \n     days. To all the sons and daughters of that great nation I \n     now address my heartfelt thoughts and participation. May Mary \n     receive the dead, console the survivors, sustain the families \n     which have been especially tried and help everyone not to \n     give in to the temptation to hatred and violence, but to \n     commit themselves to serving justice and peace.\n\n  And he didn't stop there. After the attacks he convened an inter \nfaith pilgrimage for peace to Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis. He \nonly led such a pilgrimage twice before--once during the Cold War, once \nduring the Balkans conflict. He led leaders of Orthodox, Anglican, \nProtestant, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Zoroastrian, \nTenrikyo, Shinto and traditional African faiths in prayer and \nmeditation. It was only a delegation he could have led.\n  Personally, I will never forget the Pope's visit to New York City in \n1979. One glance at him and you saw that his nobility and his common \ntouch combined so well in one human being was unforgettable for the \nmillions of New Yorkers who lined the streets to greet him. People of \nall faiths and background mourn his passing. I join the billions of \ncitizens around the world in a solemn prayer and remembrance of this \ngreat, wonderful, and holy man, Pope John Paul II.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I add my voice to the millions of people \nthroughout the world as we try to put in perspective the passing of \nPope John Paul II.\n  As has been said many times in many ways, probably more than anything \nwhat struck me the most about the Holy Father was his ability to \nunderstand what could be when other people only saw what couldn't be. \nHe understood that communism was an oppressive system. He lived under \nNazi rule, and as he had the power to bring about change, he used that \npower for the\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\ngood. He went back to his home country of Poland and challenged his \npeople to expect better and to demand better. That is what he did for \nthe world.\n  He tried to challenge his church, to stick to the principles of the \nchurch as he saw those principles to be. He challenged the world to do \nbetter when it came to the less fortunate. He was consistent. He saw \nwar as a bad thing. He understood that life was sacred and that the \nstate should not take life. He was in opposition to the death penalty. \nThere I may disagree, an honest disagreement.\n  But he had a consistency about him. When we try to put his beliefs in \nsecular terms of being liberal or conservative, we totally miss the \nmark of understanding the Pope. He understood the past, he changed the \npresent, and the future will be better because of his time on Earth.\n  His passing has left a void in a great religion. The Catholic faith \nhas lost a great leader. The world has lost a great voice for humanity, \nfor decency, for love, for caring, and that voice will echo throughout \nthe ages. As the Catholic Church embarks on picking a new Pope, I can \nunderstand the legacy that will have to be fulfilled.\n  The great religion called the Catholic faith is in mourning for the \nloss of a great leader, but all of us are in mourning for the loss of a \ngreat leader. Anyone who loves freedom, anyone who believes that there \nis a right and wrong when it comes to certain issues, has lost a great \nguidepost. I believe his legacy will be in challenging the status quo \nfor the common good, seeing pain and hearing the cries of the oppressed \nwhen other people only heard faint noises, and having the courage of \nhis convictions. He said, Be not afraid, and that is a lesson for us \nall.\n  He has gone to his eternal home. He deserves all the accolades he has \nbeen given. The world is better for his time on Earth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, also part of the greatest generation is \nsomeone whom I rise to pay tribute to today and that is to Pope John \nPaul II. I was saddened at the passing of Pope John Paul II. The Holy \nFather was an inspiration to me as well as to millions around the \nworld. His faith, his compassion, his eloquence, transcended religion \nor nationality. We so admired His Holiness because he stood for those \nwho suffered, those who were oppressed, those who could not give voice \nthrough their own advocacy for human rights. He offered faith and hope \nand courage with his famous phrase ``be not afraid,'' as he reached out \nto young people to give them a moral compass that they needed--that we \nall need to guide our lives.\n  Pope John Paul was the true people's Pope. Gosh, he traveled to over \n100 countries. He didn't just speak from the pulpit; he reached out and \ntouched people. He moved into the crowds, and he spoke the language of \nthe people, often literally because he spoke so many languages. The \nPope was the father of the church, but he was also a son of Poland, my \nown cultural heritage. I remember when I heard the news about the new \nPolish Pope, the first non-Italian in over 400 years. I live down the \nstreet from the Polish parish, St. Stanislaw's in Fells Point. We felt \nsuch pride and joy. The bells rang, the tugboats tooted. We closed the \nstreets and had a fantastic party. We were so excited.\n  In Baltimore we even knew him before he became Pope. He came to visit \nus as the cardinal from Krakow. He visited Holy Rosary Church, again \none of the Catholic churches serving large numbers in the Polish \ncommunity. I was so pleased to be there that day for this young, \nvigorous, athletic man who came from Poland to speak to us, wanting to \nknow about our own country, speaking to us in English also about our \nown hopes and aspirations. But because he had grown up under Nazi \nfascism and lived under the boot of communism, he spoke to us about \nwhat it was like to live behind the Iron Curtain.\n  As you so well know, he came from the captive nations. I was so proud \nthen to be part of the American delegation when he was Invested over 2 \nyears later. And even then we could see the hint of things to come. \nThere was a mass for hundreds of thousands of people in St. Peter's \nSquare, where His Holiness gave his first blessing and spoke the Word \nto the people in many tongues. Before he came over to greet the \ndiplomatic corps, he went over to a special section of children, and \nnot just ordinary children but extraordinary children--the mentally \nretarded, those with birth defects, cerebral palsy. And the first touch \nof the Pope was to those children. I think it touched us all.\n  One of my best memories was taking my parents to meet the Pope at the \nWhite House when Jimmy Carter was President and Brzezinski was his \nNational Security Adviser. I took my mother and father through the \nreceiving line, and they had a chance to talk with him in both Polish \nand English. He turned and smiled with his wonderful humorous way and \nsaid: Don't forget to listen to your mother and father and to the Holy \nFather.\n  Twenty-five years later, I joined my colleagues in the Senate to \npresent the Pope with our Congressional Medal, the highest honor we can \nbestow. The Pope doesn't usually accept awards, but he made an \nexception because we wanted to thank him for his stand for human rights \nand for peace and justice around the world. After the presentation and \nthe blessing, he said to us: God bless you and God bless America.\n  The Pope visited this country seven different times, both as a bishop \nand as Pope. And during those times, he always spoke to us about the \nneed for freedom. He knew what it was like to live under the \noccupation. During the dark days of communism, he led the church's \nsupport of the Solidarity movement. In 1979, after he became Pope, he \nmade his very first visit to his own native land. In 9 days, he was \nseen by 13 million people, from Warsaw to Krakow to Czestochova. He \ntouched every part of Polish society, and he encouraged them once again \nto be not afraid. One year later an obscure electrician working in a \nshipyard, named Lech Walesa, jumped over that wall. And when he jumped \nover the wall of the Gdansk shipyard, he took the whole world with him. \nThat was the beginning of the end of Communism.\n  The Pope forged a special relationship with President Ronald Reagan, \nand I believe helped bring about the end of the Cold War and pulled \ndown that Iron Curtain.\n  Pope John did more than any other leader of the church to reach out \nto different faiths. He was the first Pope to visit a synagogue. He was \nthe first Pope to visit a mosque. He reached out to Anglicans and to \nEastern Orthodoxy. But he didn't just reach out to different faiths; he \nreached also to the human heart. He reached back to the darker side of \nhistory. He was the first to acknowledge the Holocaust and to say that \nantisemitism was a sin and to officially visit Israel. He wanted the \nimprovement of relationships.\n  If we want to honor the Pope, we should do it not with words but with \ndeeds: To be not afraid, to speak up for truth, to speak truth to \npower, speak about justice, speak about human rights, to speak about \nthe marginalized and the oppressed. Today we grieve the death of the \nPope. We express our gratitude for his remarkable life and his \nremarkable leadership and legacy of faith and freedom and the enduring \npromise of the Gospels calling us to feed the hungry, care for the \nsick, and turn our spears into plowshares.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when Pope John Paul II died over the \nweekend, the Catholic Church lost its spiritual shepherd. The world \nlost a giant of a man. As successor of St. Peter, he began his papacy \nby reminding the world to ``Be not afraid.'' The captive people of \nEastern Europe and Latin America heard that message loud and clear. And \nas he prepared for his own death, he met his suffering with a \nfearlessness and hopefulness that was heard by us all.\n  For millions of American Catholics, including many Utahns, and many \nof my colleagues in this body, Pope John Paul II's passing represents \nthe loss of a profound spiritual leader. My prayers are with all of you \nand with the Pope.\n  For non-Catholics like myself the Pope's death is a cause for \nmourning as well. His was an example of strength, commitment, and moral \ncourage that we will all miss and that we will never forget. The \nCommunist tyranny that the Pope ultimately triumphed over once mocked \nthe power of the Catholic Church, asking how many divisions the Pope \nhad. While it is true that the Pope possessed no military might, his\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nwitness to hope, his faith that life would triumph over death, that the \nlight would prevail over the darkness, was more powerful than any army.\n  As a result of his simple faith, this humble man from Krakow, Poland \nemerged from behind the Iron Curtain, became the first non-Italian Pope \nin nearly 500 years, and concluded his life as one of the towering \nfigures of the Twentieth Century. I have no doubt that his example will \nguide us in the Twenty-first Century as well, and I understand why it \nis that so many Catholics are already referring to him as John Paul the \nGreat.\n  My career as a public servant began shortly before John Paul II \nbecame Pope. I am fortunate to have spent time with him on two \noccasions over the years, and so it was no surprise to me to watch the \nworld's and this country's admiration and love for him grow. I was \nstruck by his joyful and his charitable spirit. Yet behind that \npeaceful demeanor was a determination to challenge the totalitarian \nassaults on human dignity that stained much of the last century.\n  As a young man he was witness to the Nazi terror in his native \nPoland, and later as Pope he went to Poland and encouraged the \nSolidarity movement. He understood that all persons are created in the \nimage and likeness of God and that no matter how small, old or weak, no \nperson is without significance. I have no doubt that his powerful \nwitness to the dignity of all people contributed as much to the \ndownfall of the horror of communism as anything we accomplished in \nWashington. A year after he assumed the papacy, John Paul II went to \nPoland and awakened a sleeping giant. Today, I hear that over a million \nthankful Poles are en route to Rome to pay their respects to their \nnative son.\n  As the Pope grew older and he lost his youthful vigor, his own \nsuffering served as a powerful reminder of the need to nurture a \nculture of life. Catholics and non-Catholics alike have heard this \ncall. As President Bush put it the other day, it remains the duty of \nthe strong to protect the weak.\n  It only took about twenty-four hours before some commentators came \nout to declare the Pope's legacy a mixed one. The Pope was too strident \non certain issues, they say. He left certain groups unsatisfied. \nPerhaps. But I think that these criticisms really miss what this man \nwas about. John Paul II reminded us of the meaning that our human lives \ncan have. This truth is not something that you can focus group. The \ntruth about the universe, about our duty to God and to our fellow man, \nis not something that you can triangulate.\n  Still, some fault the Pope for not being more like a politician. He \nwas not accommodating enough. He should have compromised and found a \nmiddle ground. As elected officials, that is our charge. But as the \nspiritual head of the Catholic Church, the Pope's duty was greater than \nwhat we work to accomplish. He was a witness to truth. His message was \nnot always one that people on either side of the aisle wanted to hear, \nbut the call to the faithful is not often an easy one to swallow. The \nPope reminded us of the splendor of truth. I think what is revealed in \nthese criticisms of the Pope is the knee-jerk aversion by some to the \nvery idea that there are eternal truths. The Pope should be commended, \nnot criticized, for reminding us of them.\n  The talking heads have this exactly backward. They think that it was \nthe Pope who was inconsistent because he was not easily labeled as \npolitically liberal or conservative. It never occurs to them that it is \nwe who are conflicted; that our divisions are something to be overcome. \nThe Pope spoke to what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our \nnature. He was not someone seeking political advantage or gain. He \nsought peace and unity, and nowhere was this more clear than in his \nhistoric outreach to non-Catholic Christians, to the Jewish people, and \nto moderate Muslims.\n  Our commentators might not get this, but the world's people certainly \ndo. As is clear from the different languages one hears in Rome as \npeople wait to file past the Pope, this was a man who belonged to the \nworld. And the Pope's trips to this country will never be forgotten. \nPeople in this country stood in the rain to attend papal masses in \nBoston and Miami, New Orleans and New York. Youth from around the world \ncame to celebrate with him in Denver. Though this was a man with a \nuniversal message, I think that he had a certain American spirit as \nwell. He was a kindred spirit. His faith in the future, and in the \ninherent dignity of man, made him at home with the American people, and \nit is appropriate that this nation, which was blessed with his visits \non numerous occasions, will be flying its flags at half staff until his \ninterment on Friday.\n  This weekend the Catholic Church lost its shepherd. For over a \nquarter of a century, Pope John Paul II watched over his flock. With \nhis death this weekend, I am sure that there are some who feel lost, \nbut they should not forget the Pope's reminder: ``Be not afraid.'' When \nhe reminded his native Poles of this, they changed the course of \nhistory. In his passing we should take heed as well. We will miss him, \nand we will mourn, but we have faith that he is now at peace and at one \nwith his Lord.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on Saturday evening the world lost a \nvoice for peace, justice, and human dignity.\n  Born in Poland in 1920, Pope John Paul II grew up in the aftermath of \nWorld War I. As a young man, he witnessed the injustice of the Nazi \noccupation of his country, lived amid the horrendous crimes of the \nHolocaust, and survived decades of repression behind the Iron Curtain.\n  Out of those experiences, he developed a hopeful view of the world \nthat defined his 26 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, \nand he shared that vision with Catholics and non-Catholics worldwide.\n  As the first non-Italian Pope since 1523, Pope John Paul II was a \ntruly groundbreaking figure. He redefined the papacy, coming out from \nbehind the walls of the Vatican to travel to 129 countries and \nliterally reach out to people wherever he went.\n  Through his travel--more than any other Pope--he helped rejuvenate \nand expand Catholicism to areas far beyond its roots.\n  During his 26 years as Pope, the Catholic Church grew from 750 \nmillion people to over 1 billion, with most of that growth coming from \nthe third world.\n  For those in developing countries who struggled merely to survive, \nthe Pope was a strong advocate for economic justice. And for those who \nlived under repression, he was a powerful voice for freedom.\n  His 1979 visit to his native Poland is viewed as the spark that \nignited the labor movement which toppled communism in Poland and led to \nits demise throughout Eastern Europe a decade later.\n  It was his powerful yet simple belief in the value of human life that \nbrought him to challenge violence wherever he saw it.\n  He chastised the brutal Communist governments of Eastern Europe. He \ncriticized the military junta that governed Brazil in the early 1980s. \nHe condemned nuclear war while meeting with survivors of the Hiroshima \nbombing. He called for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland. And \nhe appealed for human rights in Cuba.\n  The Pope consistently urged leaders and citizens alike to seek peace \nand respect human life.\n  The Pope also sought to heal wounds. He apologized for the errors of \nCatholics over the last 2,000 years and for injustices against Jews, \nwomen, indigenous peoples, immigrants, and the poor. He acknowledged \nthe failure of many Catholics to help Jews during the Holocaust. And \nmore recently, he condemned the sexual abuse of children by priests in \nthe United States.\n  The Pope reached out to members of other faiths at a time of growing \nsectarian violence and religious strife.\n  He was the first Pope to pray in a synagogue, the first to visit \nAuschwitz, and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy \nLand--John Paul II made great strides in improving relations between \nCatholics and Jews.\n  And just as he acknowledged the mistakes made by his Church and its \nmembers, he also demonstrated a willingness to forgive those who had \ndone harm to him.\n  In December 1983, he met with the man who had attempted to \nassassinate him 2\\1/2\\ half years earlier. During that meeting, the \nPope forgave the man who had shot him three times.\n  The Pope regularly visited the United States and met with five \nPresidents. He believed that the U.S. had a\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nspecial responsibility to the world calling on our Nation to be ``for \nthe world, an example of a genuinely free, democratic, just and humane \nsociety.''\n  In recent years, even as his health deteriorated, he refused to give \nup. And in this, he served as a model to millions of people throughout \nthe world about how faith and willpower can overcome adversity.\n  Indeed, I cannot remember a Pope who has been more warmly received \nand loved. I had the great honor to meet him at the Vatican in 1982 \nwhere I presented him with a cross sculpted from handguns melted down \nafter being turned into police when they were banned in San Francisco. \nHe received my gift warmly, giving me a rosary in return.\n  The world has lost a strong voice for peace, justice, and human \ndignity. Pope John Paul II will be dearly missed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I watched with great sadness this weekend \nas the world lost a remarkable leader and faithful servant. Pope John \nPaul II, born Karol Wojtyla, was the leader of the world's largest \nchurch and shepherd to more than a billion Catholics throughout the \nworld. In my home State of North Dakota, more than 130,000 Catholics \nare mourning the Pope's death this week and praying for the repose of \nhis soul. I join these faithful and millions of others in grieving for \nthe Holy Father who spread a message of peace and charity during his \n26-year-long pontificate.\n  Reflecting on the Pope's legacy, I will forever admire his bravery, \nboth in answering God's call and in challenging corrupt governments for \nthe sake of humanity. In his first mass at St. Peter's Basilica in \n1978, Pope John Paul II called on Catholics throughout the world to \n``be not afraid.''\n  The Pope spent his entire life living that call. Born on the eve of \nWorld War II, Pope John Paul knew the horrors of war; the Nazis forced \nhim into labor when they invaded Poland in 1939. During this period, he \nfound comfort in his Catholic faith and challenged the Nazis by \nattending illegal prayer meetings. These experiences hardened his \nconviction that war is ``always a defeat for humanity.''\n  He again answered the call to ``be not afraid'' when he challenged \nthe Soviet Union and the tyranny of communism in his homeland, Poland. \nBoth as Archbishop of Krakow and then as Pope, John Paul II provided \nreligious strength to those fighting these regimes. He is credited with \nhelping to topple communism in Poland, and his steadfastness against \noppression in all forms will forever be honored.\n  There may be no event more telling of his commitment to bravery and \nmercy than the attempt on his life in 1981. After being shot twice, \nnearly resulting in his death, the Pope recovered and continued his \npublic works. Two years after the shooting, he visited his attacker in \njail and offered his forgiveness. Responding to this act of evil with \ncompassion and grace, John Paul served as a witness to what humanity \nshould strive to become.\n  The world has lost a great leader and the father of a religious \nfamily. John Paul II will be remembered as a teacher and defender of \nthe faith he was called to serve. He will be honored as a diplomat and \nas a revolutionary in the fight against injustice and oppression. And \nhe will provide us ongoing inspiration to respect human dignity and the \nworth of all humankind.\n  I am saddened by the loss of this just and holy man; however, I am \njoyful that he surely has passed to a more perfect place and is in \ncommunion with the God he served so faithfully. My thoughts and prayers \nare with the Catholic community and all those who mourn the death of \nPope John Paul II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3171-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (No. S. 600) to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State and international broadcasting activities \n     for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, for the Peace Corps for \n     fiscal years 2006 and 2007, for foreign assistance programs \n     for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be considering S. \n600, the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 and \n2007. The Foreign Relations Committee passed this bill on March 3 by a \nvote of 18-0. This is the third successive year that the Foreign \nRelations Committee has reported out a comprehensive Foreign Affairs \nAuthorization bill by a unanimous vote. We are pleased to have this \nopportunity to bring it to the floor for the Senate's consideration. I \nwant to especially thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader \nfor their assistance and support in bringing this measure to the floor.\n\n  This legislation gives voice to Senate views on issues touching every \ncontinent--from tbe threat of terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction, to the safety of Americans working in our embassies \noverseas, to an increased and focused effort to spur economic growth in \nthe poorest countries. It authorizes the executive branch to take \nimportant actions on a wide range of issues. And, it authorizes \nappropriations for our diplomats, our foreign aid workers, and our \nPeace Corps volunteers, as well as the programs and policies that they \nmanage on behalf of the United States.\n  These people are our civilian soldiers--they pursue a bold war on \nterrorism and a noble and far-sighted battle against disease, poverty, \nand humanitarian disasters. Most work in circumstances where the threat \nlevel is severe. American diplomats and aid workers frequently have \nbeen targets of terrorism while serving overseas. But they understand \nthe importance of representing the United States, and they go anyway.\n  At this time in our history we are experiencing a confluence of \nforeign policy crises that is unparalleled in the post-Cold War era. \nOur Nation has lived through the September 11 tragedy, and we have \nresponded with a worldwide war against terrorism. We have fought wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, where we are likely to be engaged in security \nand reconstruction efforts for years to come. We have been confronted \nby nuclear proliferation problems in North Korea and Iran that threaten \nU.S. national security and regional stability. We are continuing \nefforts to safeguard Russia's massive stockpiles of chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons and to prevent proliferation throughout \nthe world. We have experienced strains in the Atlantic Alliance, even \nas we have expanded it. We are trying to respond to the AIDS pandemic \nin Africa, the natural disasters in the Indian Ocean region, and the \nman-made calamity in Sudan. We are trying to take advantage of openings \nin the Middle East peace process and spur the advance of democracy in \nmany countries. Emerging powers, including China, India, and Brazil, \nmay soon reconfigure the world economically and politically in ways \nthat we do not yet comprehend.\n  There is a tendency in the media and sometimes in this body to see \ndiplomatic activities as the rival of military solutions to problems. \nWe have to get beyond this simplistic formulation. We have to \nunderstand that our military and our diplomats are both instruments of \nU.S. national power that depend on one another. They both help shape \nthe international environment and influence the attitudes of \ngovernments and peoples. They both gather information and provide \nexpertise that is vital to the war on terrorism. And they both must be \nunsurpassed in their capabilities, if the United States is going to \nsurvive and prosper.\n  Americans rightly demand that U.S. military capabilities be unrivaled \nin the world. Should not our diplomatic strength meet the same test? If \na greater commitment of resources can prevent the bombing of one of our \nembassies, or the proliferation of a nuclear weapon, or the spiral into \nchaos of a vulnerable nation wracked by disease and hunger, the \ninvestment will have yielded dividends far beyond its cost.\n  In considering this legislation today, it is important to remember \nthat since the end of the Cold War, the Foreign Affairs Account \nfrequently has suffered\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nfrom inadequate funding. The American public generally understands that \nthe United States reduced military spending in the 1990s following the \nfall of the Soviet Union. Few are aware, however, that this peace \ndividend spending reduction theme was applied even more unsparingly to \nour foreign affairs programs. In constant dollars, the foreign affairs \nbudget was cut in six consecutive years from 1992 to 1998. This slide \noccurred even as the United States sustained the heavy added costs of \nestablishing new missions in the fifteen emergent states of the former \nSoviet Union. In constant dollars, the cumulative effect was a 26 \npercent decrease in our foreign affairs programs. As a percentage of \nGDP, this six-year slide represented a 36 percent cut in foreign \naffairs programs.\n  By the beginning of the new millennium, these cuts had taken their \ntoll. The General Accounting Office reported that staffing shortfalls, \nlack of adequate language skills, and security vulnerabilities plagued \nmany of our diplomatic posts. In 2001 the share of the U.S. budget \ndevoted to the international affairs account stood at a paltry 1.18 \npercent--barely above its post-World War II low and only about half of \nits share in the mid-1980s, during the Reagan administration.\n  Under President Bush, funding for the Foreign Affairs Account has \nincreased substantially. The President has requested increases in each \nof the last four budgets. In this year's budget, the President has \nrequested a 13 percent increase over last year's appropriated amount \nfor the Foreign Affairs Account--the largest percentage increase of any \nmajor account in the budget. This is a tangible demonstration of the \nPresident's commitment to diplomatic strength. Congress must now do its \npart by providing the resources and authorities that the President \nneeds to carry out an effective foreign policy.\n  The bill before us preserves the funding decisions in the President's \nrequest. Inevitably, members will have some differences with the \nspecifics of the President's request. But we should recognize that this \nbill represents a generous attempt to raise the profile and \neffectiveness of U.S. diplomacy. Those of us who have advocated funding \nincreases for the 150 Account should take ``Yes'' for an answer. \nAccordingly, I believe that if amendments are offered to increase \nfunding for a particular program, they should include offsets.\n\n  The bill funds the Millennium Challenge Corporation at the \nPresident's requested level of $3 billion. Some have argued that the \nPresident should have requested $5 billion--the amount he originally \nhad conceived for the corporation's third year of funding. Others have \nargued that $3 billion is too much for a new venture that is just \ngetting off the ground, and that some of this money should be shifted \nto other priorities. My own view is that $3 billion is a reasonable \namount, given the scope of the program and its potential for spurring \ndemocratic reforms overseas. The credibility of the program, which \nforeign nations are observing closely, would be strengthened if the \nSenate endorsed the President's funding request. For these reasons, I \nwill oppose amendments that seek to use MCC funds as an offset for \nother priorities.\n  This bill contains numerous policy initiatives, most notably the \nbipartisan Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act, \nwhich was developed in the Foreign Relations Committee and included in \nlast year's bill. The bill before the Senate also includes a 10 percent \nincrease in danger pay for State Department employees who serve in \ndangerous posts overseas, funding for refugee assistance, and \nprovisions designed to improve protections for women, children, and \nother vulnerable populations in the context of war or disaster.\n  Since the mid-1980s, Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility to \npass an Omnibus Foreign Assistance Act. Several discrete measures, such \nas the Millennium Challenge Account, the global AIDS bill, the Freedom \nSupport Act, and the Support for Eastern European Democracy Act, have \nbeen enacted. But in the absence of a comprehensive authorization, much \nof the responsibility for providing guidance for foreign assistance \npolicy has fallen to the appropriations committees. Appropriators have \nkept our foreign assistance programs going, but in many cases, they \nhave had to do so without proper authorization. In some years, the \nCongress did pass a State Department authorization bill, but that bill \nonly authorizes about 35 percent of the Function 150 Account. To fund \nthe remaining accounts, appropriators frequently had to waive the legal \nrequirement to appropriate funds only following the passage of an \nauthorization bill.\n  Passing a comprehensive Foreign Affairs authorization bill is good \npolitics, as well as good policy. It is good politics because it \nunderscores the leadership of this Senate at a time when our country is \nin peril. It is good politics because foreign assistance is an \ninstrument of national power in the war on terrorism. It is good \npolitics because it recognizes that our standard of living, the \nretirements of our parents, our children's educations, advancements in \nour health care, and the security of Americans can be undermined by \nwhat happens overseas. It recognizes that American prosperity is far \nmore likely to be sustained if we are successful in spreading \ndemocracy, stability, and free market principles.\n  I thank the members of my committee for their hard work during the \nauthorization process. Members on both sides of the aisle devoted many \nhours and much thought to constructive approaches to a number of very \ndifficult foreign policy questions. Although this is a new bill \ndeveloped during the last several months, it reflects much work that \nhas been done by the Committee during the previous Congress. Committee \nhearings during the last 2 years on post-conflict stabilization and \nreconstruction, U.S. policy in the Middle East, developments on the \nKorean peninsula, relations between India and Pakistan, public \ndiplomacy, foreign assistance, and numerous other topics have been well \nattended. In fact, no Senate committee held as many hearings or met as \noften as the Foreign Relations Committee during the last Congress.\n  I especially thank the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, for his support of this process and his \nleadership in foreign policy matters. We have agreed on the vast \nmajority of provisions in this bill, and when we have disagreed, we \nhave worked hard to bridge our differences and find bipartisan \nsolutions. We have always shared the common goal of bringing good \nlegislation to the floor for the Senate's judgment.\n  It has long been my intent that the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee approach foreign policy problems in a bipartisan spirit. This \nlegislation reflects the committee's success in that regard. \nRepublicans and Democrats have worked together closely to seek \nconsensus, reason together, make compromises and craft excellent \nlegislation. Our committee is united in the belief that passing a \ncomprehensive Foreign Affairs authorization bill will enhance U.S. \nnational security.\n  I am looking forward to the debate on this bill and the constructive \ncontributions of Members at this important time in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 266\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 266.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent further reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the amendment to the limitation on the United \nStates share of assessments for United Nations Peacekeeping operations)\n\n       On page 55, strike lines 3 through 11.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I rise to offer an amendment that strikes section 401, a \nsection which establishes a permanent cap of\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\n27.1 percent on the American share of cost of U.N. peacekeeping \noperations. The Helms-Biden legislation passed in 1999 anticipated the \nU.S. share of peacekeeping dues would decline to 25 percent in total. \nThis remains an important goal of the U.S. policy toward the U.N.\n  This issue has raised strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. I \nappreciate the perspective of Senators who want to preserve a 27.1-\npercent cap as well as those who want the cap to be reduced to the 25 \npercent level in accordance with the Helms-Biden legislation. We would \nall like to see American financial responsibilities at the United \nNations reduced.\n  We should acknowledge that existing U.S. law sets 25 percent as our \ntarget for peacekeeping contributions. I believe we should give the \nU.S. negotiators the most leverage possible to attain the U.S. goals. \nPassing a permanent 27.1-percent cap in this bill at this moment might \nreduce that leverage.\n  In coming weeks Congress will have further opportunities to work with \nPresident Bush to craft the most effective means possible of reducing \nthe U.S. share of peacekeeping assessments. I believe this is an issue \non which further consultation with the executive branch is certainly \nwarranted. This is particularly true at a moment when the Secretary \nGeneral has recently put forward a substantial United Nations reform \nplan, and the President's nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. is \npending before the Senate.\n  After discussions with the majority leader and other Members, I have \ncome to the conclusion that we will facilitate further consultations on \nthe peacekeeping cap with the administration and improve prospects for \npassage of the underlying legislation if we strike this provision. \nConsequently, I am hopeful Senators will join me in passing this \namendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside in order that I may send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 267\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 267.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment \n     (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of Ukraine)\n\n       On page 277, after line 8, add the following:\n\n                 TITLE XXIX--TRADE TREATMENT OF UKRAINE\n\n     SEC. 2901. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that Ukraine has--\n       (1) made considerable progress toward respecting \n     fundamental human rights consistent with the objectives of \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974;\n       (2) adopted administrative procedures that accord its \n     citizens the right to emigrate, travel freely, and to return \n     to their country without restriction; and\n       (3) been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of \n     emigration provisions in title IV of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\n     SEC. 2902. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE \n                   TRADE ACT OF 1974 TO UKRAINE.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determinations and Extensions of \n     Nondiscriminatory Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et \n     seq.), the President may--\n       (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Ukraine; and\n       (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with \n     respect to Ukraine, proclaim the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to the products of that country.\n       (b) Termination of Application of Title IV.--On and after \n     the effective date of the extension under subsection (a)(2) \n     of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Ukraine, \n     title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 shall cease to apply to \n     that country.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we all know, the recent Orange \nRevolution in Ukraine marked a huge victory for the advancement of \ndemocracy in the world. The Ukrainian people made clear that they would \nnot stand idle as a corrupt regime sought to deny them their democratic \nrights. Now that the people of Ukraine have seized control of their \ndestiny, the United States must stand ready to assist them as they do \nthe hard work of consolidating democracy.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to repeal the so-called and well-\nknown Jackson-Vanik amendment, for it to be terminated with respect to \nUkraine. At his appearance yesterday with President Viktor Yushchenko, \nPresident Bush pledged to seek the termination of Jackson-Vanik. In a \nWhite House statement yesterday, both Governments stated that they \nsupport ``immediately ending the application of Jackson-Vanik to \nUkraine.'' We should all agree. This 31-year-old legislation is, with \nrespect to Ukraine, now anachronistic and inappropriate. I am pleased \nto offer this amendment along with Senator DeWine. And I know there \nwill be others.\n  Specifically, this amendment would authorize the President to \nterminate the application of Jackson-Vanik, which is title IV of the \nTrade Act of 1974, to Ukraine. Ukraine would then be eligible to \nreceive permanent normal trade relations tariff status in its trade \nwith the United States. Several Members in the Senate and House have \nalso introduced legislation to terminate Jackson-Vanik, and these bills \nin the Senate have been pending in the committee since the start of \nthis session. I am hopeful that today the Senate will agree to adopt \nthis amendment.\n  Beyond any benefits to our bilateral trading relationship, lifting \nJackson-Vanik for Ukraine constitutes an important symbol of Ukraine's \nnew democracy and its relationship with the United States. In February, \nalong with three other Senators and six representatives, I went to \nKiev, where we met with President Yushchenko, Prime Minister \nTymoshenko, and students who led protests in Independence Square. I was \nstruck by the great enthusiasm for democracy and freedom that has taken \nhold in Ukraine, and I know we all wish the new leaders all the best as \nthey begin the challenge of governing. I pledged to them that we would \nwork toward the lifting of Jackson-Vanik on Ukraine, and today I am \nhappy to move toward that end.\n  Tomorrow, President Yushchenko will address a joint session of \nCongress, an honor which we bestow on few foreign leaders. As we have \nthe privilege of welcoming this true hero of democracy, I can think of \nno better gesture than today terminating the anachronistic and \ninappropriate Jackson-Vanik restrictions on Ukraine.\n  I note the presence of my most respected colleague, Senator Lugar, \nwho has gained the respect and appreciation of all of us with his \nknowledge and expertise on issues of national security and foreign \naffairs and his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. I hope \nhe would see his way clear to have a look at this amendment, and I \nwould obviously seek his support.\n  Mr. President, we who follow events in that part of the world were \nthrilled at the Orange Revolution. We saw a flawed election that was \nrepudiated by the people of Ukraine in a peaceful manner. It was one of \nthe remarkable events in that part of the world.\n  I remind my colleagues that Ukraine is a very pivotal and important \ncountry in its own right, one with a tragic history of bloodshed and \nsacrifice but also, when its geostrategic location is considered, a \nvery important part of the world. Dr. Henry Kissinger once was quoted \nas saying: Russia with Ukraine is a Western power, without Ukraine is \nan Eastern power.\n\n  I fully agree with our President's stated commitment yesterday for \nrepeal of Jackson-Vanik as far as Ukraine is concerned.\n  Jackson-Vanik was a very incredibly important tool in asserting our \nsupport and advocacy for human rights in then-Iron-Curtain countries. I \nthink it is\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nvery clear that neither Senator Jackson nor Congressman Vanik \nenvisioned this anachronistic provision to apply to a country that is \nnow on the verge of a functioning democracy in a free and exuberant \nnation.\n  I am told by my staff that somehow the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, or probably more likely one of his zealous staffers, has \nsaid they would object to this provision because of the fact there are \ncertain problems with intellectual property or other reasons. I would \nhope that assertion of jurisdiction, or reluctance to approve of this, \nparticularly in light of this particular moment, would disappear in \nlight of the priorities that this repeal of Jackson-Vanik would send as \na sign of strong support and advocacy for democracy and process of an \nopen and free society which is obviously taking place in Ukraine.\n  So if there is a problem that we have with Ukraine, I would think the \nPresident of the United States would have articulated those views in \nhis meetings with President Yushchenko yesterday. And if the President \nhad a problem, he certainly would not have come out after the meeting \nand advocated the repeal of Jackson-Vanik.\n  Not many Americans even know what Jackson-Vanik is. But a whole lot \nof people in these countries that this law still applies to are very \naware of it. I think it would not only be appropriate to send a signal \nwith the repeal of Jackson-Vanik as far as Ukraine is concerned, but I \nthink it would be a slap in the face to the new Ukrainian Government \nand people because some committee of the Senate asserted its \njurisdiction at a time when we should be providing as much \nencouragement as we can to the process of democracy and freedom, which \nhas exhilarated all of us as we watched this marvelous transformation \ntake place.\n  So I urge adoption of the amendment. I hope we can dispose of the \namendment today. If the chairman of the Finance Committee or any of his \nstaff would like to debate this issue, I would be more than happy to \nengage in that at their convenience and have a recorded vote, which I \nthink would carry overwhelmingly in the Senate.\n  I again recognize the leadership and dedicated hard work on this \nlegislation by our distinguished and respected chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for his very thoughtful comments about my work in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I thank him for offering this amendment.\n  Let me point out, as the Senator from Arizona has already, a number \nof bills attempting to achieve repeal of Jackson-Vanik have been \nintroduced in both Houses. But they have not come to conclusion, and \napparently today that will happen.\n  I am one of the authors of one of those bills, S. 632, which \nauthorizes the extension of permanent normal trade relations treatment \nwith Ukraine. As the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, \nunfortunately Ukraine is still subject to the provisions of the \nJackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions \nnations for failure to comply with freedom of emigration requirements. \nMy bill, and I believe Senator McCain's bill, would repeal permanently \nthe application of Jackson-Vanik to Ukraine. As has been mentioned by \nthe distinguished Senator, that bill has been referred to the Finance \nCommittee, which still has it under consideration.\n  But I would offer this argument. In the post-Cold-War era, Ukraine \nhas demonstrated a commitment to meeting the requirements for the \nlifting of Jackson-Vanik and, in addition, has expressed a strong \ndesire to abide by free market principles and good governance.\n  Last November 21, I served as President Bush's personal \nrepresentative to the runoff election between Prime Minister Yanukovich \nand Viktor Yushchenko. During that visit, I promoted free and fair \nelection procedures that would strengthen worldwide respect for the \nlegitimacy of the winning candidate. Unfortunately, that was not \npossible at that time. The Government of Ukraine allowed, or aided and \nabetted, wholesale fraud and abuse that changed the results of that \nNovember 21 election. It is clear that Prime Minister Yanukovich did \nnot win that election.\n  In response, however, the people of Ukraine rallied in the streets \nand squares and demanded justice. After tremendous international \npressure and mediation, Ukraine repeated the runoff election. It was \nheld on December 26. A newly named Central Election Commission and a \nnew set of election laws led to a much improved process. International \nmonitors concluded the process was generally free and fair. Viktor \nYushchenko was inaugurated as President of, Ukraine, and tomorrow he \nwill address a joint session of our Congress.\n  Extraordinary events have occurred in Ukraine over the last several \nmonths since the December 26 election. A free press has revolted \nagainst Government intimidation and reasserted itself. An emerging \nmiddle class has found its political footing. A new generation has \nembraced democracy and openness. A society has rebelled against the \nillegal activities of its Government. It is in our interest to \nrecognize and to protect these advances in Ukraine.\n  The United States has a long record of cooperation with Ukraine \nthrough the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act.\n  Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world with \nthe fall of the Soviet Union. Through the Nunn-Lugar Program, the \nUnited States has assisted Ukraine in eliminating this deadly arsenal \nand joining the nonproliferation treaty as a nonnuclear state.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen United States-Ukraine relations \nis bilateral trade. Trade relations between the United States and \nUkraine are currently governed by a bilateral trade agreement signed in \n1992. There are other economic agreements in place seeking to further \nfacilitate economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine, \nincluding a bilateral investment treaty which was signed in 1996 and a \ntaxation treaty signed in the year 2000. In addition, Ukraine commenced \nnegotiations to become a member of the World Trade Organization in \n1993, further demonstrating its commitment to adhere to the free market \nprinciples of fair trade.\n  In light of its adherence to freedom of immigration requirements, \ndemocratic principles, compliance with threat reduction, and several \nagreements on economic cooperation, the products of Ukraine should not \nbe subject to the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik.\n  There are areas in which Ukraine needs to continue to improve. These \ninclude market access, protection of intellectual property, and \nreduction of tariffs. The United States must remain committed to \nassisting Ukraine in pursuing market economic reforms. The permanent \nwaiver of Jackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade \nrelations will be the foundation on which further progress in a \nburgeoning economic partnership can be made.\n  My colleagues on the Finance Committee have committed to joining me \nin supporting this important legislation. It is essential that the \nFinance Committee and the full Senate act promptly to bolster this \nburgeoning democracy to promote stability in this region. I am most \nhopeful that in the course of the day, we will take favorable action on \nthis amendment.\n  For the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise for the point of giving information \nto all Senators about the legislation we have in front of us. As the \nChair has observed, several minutes have passed without activity. We \nhave through staff attempted to notify all Senators who might be \nanticipating offering amendments or action on this bill. This will be \nan excellent opportunity to do so prior to the time the two party \nluncheons are held and a recess for that reason is called. We know that \nfollowing lunch, there will be two important amendments offered, and we \nwelcome those. I would like to proceed to\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nour debate and votes, with disposition of amendments that are now \npending.\n  I simply mention, Mr. President, that I recognize, as does the Chair, \nmany Senators are under some urgent requirements in terms of scheduling \nin this particular week, as we mourn the death of Pope John Paul II. \nSome Senators are contemplating potential travel to the funeral of the \nPope. Others have other requirements. So it would be my intent, as we \nconclude these amendments that are available, to move for final passage \nof the bill, to conclude activity on this bill today and as early today \nas possible.\n  My understanding is a potential debate on the Social Security issue \nwill ensue at some point this evening after we have concluded \nactivities on the authorization bill. So we might make that more \nreadily available and that time more certain. I mention this because \nfor Senators who do have amendments, even if they are not completely \nformulated, I request they bring those to the floor so that staff on \nboth sides of the aisle can work through those amendments to find an \nacceptable form. It would be at least our general view of a liberal \npolicy of adopting amendments that enhance the authorization process \nand do no violence at least to the foreign policy objectives of the \nUnited States.\n  With that in mind, hopefully those listening to the debate will hear \nour plea, proceed with amendments, and help us with the activities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Having spoken to the chairman of the committee, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business for no more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, and 277, \n                                en bloc\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send to the desk a group of amendments to \nS. 600 that have the approval of the managers of the bill. The package \nhas bipartisan support. I intend to ask they be agreed to by unanimous \nconsent as soon as the ranking member has joined me in the Senate.\n  I have received word that the presence of the ranking member will not \nbe required. Staff on both sides of the aisle have cleared these \namendments; therefore, I ask they be agreed to en bloc by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit grants to be used for broadcasting outside the \n                          Middle East region)\n\n       On page 59, strike lines 16 though 25 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(a) Authority.--Grants authorized under section 305 shall \n     be available to make annual grants to Middle East \n     Broadcasting Networks for the purpose of carrying out radio \n     and television broadcasting.\n       ``(b) Function.--Middle East Broadcasting Networks shall \n     provide radio and television programming consistent with the \n     broadcasting standards and broadcasting principles set forth \n     in section 303.\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the compensation paid to employees of the Middle \n                      East Broadcasting Networks)\n\n       On page 60, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       ``(C) not more than 5 officers or employees of the Middle \n     East Broadcasting Networks may be provided a rate of basic \n     compensation at such rate authorized for Level II of the \n     Executive Schedule provided in section 5313 of title 5, \n     United States Code, and such compensation shall be subject to \n     the provisions of section 5307 of such title.\n\n(Purpose: To require payments from the Broadcasting Board of Governors \n  for costs resulting from the creditable service of employees of the \n                   Middle East Broadcasting Networks)\n\n       On page 64, strike lines 3 through 6, and insert the \n     following:\n       (4) Creditable service.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 8332(b)(11) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended by inserting ``the Middle East \n     Broadcasting Networks;'' after ``the Asia Foundation;''.\n       (B) Other requirements.--With regard to creditable service \n     with the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, the Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors shall--\n       (i) pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability \n     Fund an amount determined by the Director of the Office of \n     Personnel Management to be necessary to reimburse such Fund \n     for any estimated increase in the unfunded liability of such \n     Fund that results from the amendment made by subparagraph \n     (4), computed using dynamic assumptions; and\n       (ii) pay the amount required by clause (i) in 5 equal \n     annual installments, together with interest on such amount \n     computed at the rate used in the computation required by such \n     clause.\n\n  (Purpose: To extend the United States Advisory Commission on Public \n                         Diplomacy until 2008)\n\n       On page 110, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 812.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay \ntribute to the passing of my good friend, our former colleague, Senator \nHowell Heflin.\n  Judge Heflin, as we often called him, was a stalwart in the Senate, \ndevoted to improving my State of Alabama and the Nation with each \ndecision he made and I believe every vote he cast.\n  When I first entered the Senate in 1987, Judge Heflin was the senior \nSenator from my State of Alabama. I considered him a good friend and \ncolleague over the 18 years he served here. I always appreciated his \nhumor and his solid values. I believe he will be remembered as one of \nAlabama's most respected politicians.\n  Judge Heflin was a strong voice for Alabama in the Senate. He served \nas chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and as a member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. He worked to ensure that Alabama was indeed \nwell represented in this body.\n  He was deeply devoted to his job, and, as we know, often spent \ndinners out that were meant to be time off as an opportunity to help \nhis constituents who happened to be at the same restaurant.\n  Howell Heflin was born June 19, 1921, in Poulan, GA, to Reverend \nMarvin Rutledge Heflin and Louise Strudwick Heflin. He graduated from \nColbert County High School in Leighton, AL, and Birmingham Southern \nCollege in Birmingham, AL.\n  Following his graduation from Birmingham Southern College in 1942, \nJudge Heflin enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. His military service \nduring World War II took him to the Pacific Theater, where he was \nwounded twice and awarded the Silver Star for bravery. He was also \nawarded two Purple Hearts.\n  Upon his return from World War II, he attended the University of \nAlabama School of Law and was admitted to the Alabama State Bar in \n1948. From 1948 to 1971, Judge Heflin was an attorney in Tuscumbia, AL.\n  He was elected as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in \n1970. He was well known for his efforts to modernize Alabama's legal \nsystem. It was because of his profound work as chief justice that he \nbecame affectionately known as ``The Judge'' even after he became a \nSenator. He was elected first to the Senate in 1978, and was reelected \nto two more terms, for a total of 18 years of service--three terms--in \nthe Senate.\n  In 1997, he left public life and returned home to Tuscumbia, AL, to \nenjoy time with his family.\n  Howell Thomas Heflin led a full life. Each chapter of his life--as a \nwar hero, a jurist, and a public servant--was completed with great \nfervor and devotion. He did nothing halfway, and everyone who knew him \nrecognized and appreciated that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, wish to speak in morning \nbusiness. What a passing of a great generation. I, too, want to pay my \nrespects to Senator Heflin, an outstanding Senator, a wonderful Senator \nfrom Alabama. When I came to the Senate in 1987, he was one of the men \nof the Senate who welcomed me with graciousness. He introduced me to \nhand-pulled barbecue from Alabama. He also introduced me to the \nMarshall Space Program. I had the opportunity to work with him in terms \nof creating jobs in Alabama and also creating opportunity through the \nSpace Program.\n  He embodied the qualities of hard work, honesty, humility, and humor, \nand he left this earth with a great legacy. Senator Heflin died on \nMarch 29, 2005, last week. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth Heflin; \na son, Howard Thomas Heflin, Jr.; a daughter-in-law, Corneila Hood \nHeflin; grandson Wilson Charmichael Heflin; and a granddaughter, Mary \nCatherine Heflin.\n  Senator Heflin was devoted to his family, his State, and his country. \nAs a World War II hero, he put his love of country above all else. He \nmade remarkable contributions to Alabama and the Nation as a whole. His \nwarmhearted personality will be remembered by all who knew him well. We \nwill all miss him. We will certainly miss him in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3176-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3176-S3189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN AFFAIRS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2006 AND 2007--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, very shortly there will be a unanimous \nconsent request on how to proceed on the Boxer amendment, which has not \nbeen introduced yet but will be spoken to shortly. I would like, with \nthe permission of my friend from California, to make a brief opening \nstatement relative to the overall bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator also then make the unanimous consent \nrequest for the 40/20 so I know that is in line?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, we are just clearing it \nwith the leadership. We are working that out. I am sure we will be able \nto move the amendment immediately after my statement which I don't \nthink will take more than a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, under the leadership of Chairman Lugar, we tried very \nhard to move this bill in the last couple of years. I hope the third \ntime is a charm. As I believe the chairman has explained, the bill \ncontains the basic authorization for all the major foreign affairs \nagencies and programs at the Department of State, foreign assistance \nprograms, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the Peace Corps.\n  The bill contains several initiatives I would like to briefly \nhighlight.\n  I am glad the bill includes the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act, \nwhich we have been trying to enact over 3 years. In recent years, the \nSARS epidemic and the avian flu epidemic have made us acutely aware of \nhow vulnerable the world is to a rapid spread of infectious diseases. \nWe face that same vulnerability for diseases that might be used as \nweapons of bioterrorism.\n  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act will combat the bioterrorism \nthreat by improving other countries' capabilities to detect and limit \ndisease outbreaks and by improving international investigation of \ndisease outbreaks. Because these diseases--whether they are natural \noccurrences or man-made--have no respect for borders, we are only as \nsafe as the weakest link in the chain is strong. This bill will go a \nlong way to help other countries at an early stage detect the existence \nof these diseases, these potential biodiseases that can be spread via \nwhat we call bioterrorism.\n  The majority leader, who cosponsored the original version of the act \nin 2001, is once again pressing for action on this bill. He added a \nvery useful provision to the act, which Chairman Lugar and I have \nhappily endorsed, calling for the executive branch to develop a real-\ntime data collection and analysis capability to serve as a warning sign \nfor a possible bioterrorism event. With the majority leader's support, \nI hope and believe this year we will finally enact this important \nmeasure.\n  I am also proud of the work the committee has done, with the \nchairman's leadership, to help the U.S. Government strengthen its \ncapacity to handle postconflict reconstruction.\n\n[[Page S3177]]\n\n  In the last decade, the United States has taken on stabilization \nmissions in countries such as Bosnia, East Timor, Haiti, Somalia, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq. In the decade to come, whether we like it or \nnot, nation-building and postconflict resolution and reconstruction \nwill remain important to our security. As the Presiding Officer knows \nbecause of all the work he has done in the Balkans, this is not \nsomething that gets done in a day and we are able to leave behind in a \nyear. We should not attempt to reinvent the wheel every time we are \nfaced with a stabilization crisis, such as the one we faced in the last \ndecade. It is inefficient and ineffective. Rather than address crises \nby cobbling together plans and personnel each time they occur as we \nhave been doing, we need to be better prepared.\n  This bill establishes a special office in the State Department for \nreconstruction and stabilization. It establishes a special corps of \ncivilian reconstruction experts who would be ready to be deployed on \nshort notice. The bill also creates a special emergency fund to deal \nwith such crises.\n  Finally, I am pleased the chairman and I are able to agree on the \ninclusion of a provision to protect vulnerable persons during \nhumanitarian emergencies--an undated version of a bill I first \nintroduced in 2003 called the Women and Children in Conflict Protection \nAct.\n\n  I have been concerned about the vulnerability of women and children \naffected by conflict and humanitarian emergencies for some time now. \nSince the accusations were made about sexual exploitation of refugees \nby humanitarian workers in west Africa nearly 3 years ago, that concern \nhas been heightened.\n  Most recently, we have been confronted with cases of rape used as a \nweapon of war in Darfur, sexual exploitation and abuse by U.N. \npeacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and concerns that the \nchildren affected by the tsunami in Asia could be vulnerable to human \ntrafficking.\n  This provision in the bill establishes a coordinator at the \nDepartment of State or AID specifically charged with ensuring that our \nassistance programs not only provide food and shelter, but also support \nprograms to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of those living in \nrefugee and internally displaced persons camps. It prohibits U.S. \nfunding of humanitarian organizations that do not sign a code of \nconduct prohibiting improper relations between aid workers and \nbeneficiaries. Finally, the provision authorizes the President to \nprovide aid specifically for things such as security for refugee camps \nor something as simple and inexpensive as buying firewood so women will \nnot have to leave these camps, which they have to do now, in order to \nfind material with which they can make a fire to cook and find \nthemselves subject to rape and exploitation outside the confines of \nthese camps.\n  We have a very good bill that was passed out of our committee 18 to \n0. I urge my colleagues, as Senator Boxer is about to do, to come \nforward with their amendments because I, like the chairman, would very \nmuch like to move this bill forward. It is within the budget. It is \nright on the button of the President's budget number. It has, as I \nsaid, unanimous support out of our committee. I believe it is a solid \nbill, and I hope we can move it forward this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in a short while, we hope to have a \nunanimous consent agreement so that Members will have a roadmap for the \nremainder of the afternoon. That is not at hand for the moment; \ntherefore, I hope the Chair might recognize the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, who will offer an amendment. Informally, we have \ntalked in terms of an hour of debate being the limit, 40 minutes for \nthe Senator from California, 20 minutes for me or others I may \ndesignate. We will encapsulate, hopefully, a unanimous consent \nagreement in due course during the course of this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask my chairman, for whom \nI have great respect and admiration, am I then to send the amendment to \nthe desk at this time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I prefer the Senator send it to the desk \nand our debate commence.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 278\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 278.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the application of certain restrictive \neligibility requirements to foreign nongovernmental organizations with \n  respect to the provision of assistance under part I of the Foreign \n                        Assistance Act of 1961)\n\n       On page 172, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2227. GLOBAL DEMOCRACY PROMOTION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, in determining eligibility for assistance authorized \n     under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government funds for advocacy and \n     lobbying activities other than those that apply to United \n     States nongovernmental organizations receiving assistance \n     under part I of such Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to \noverturn the so-called Mexico City policy which undermines some of our \ncountry's most important values and goals. The Mexico City policy is \nalso known as the global gag rule, and I will explain what it does in a \nmoment.\n  Most of my colleagues know the history of this policy. It was named \nthe Mexico City policy because that is where it was announced in 1984. \nBut it is also known, as I said, as the global gag rule because that is \nexactly what it does--it gags international organizations that receive \nUSAID family planning funds.\n  What does that mean? It means, for example, that a family planning \nclinic in Nepal that receives USAID funding is prohibited from using \nits own funds--the clinic's own funds--to provide, advocate for, or \neven talk about abortion to the women they serve, even talk to a woman \nabout her options.\n  Let's be clear what we are talking about one more time. We are not \ntalking about spending one slim dime or one penny of U.S. money to pay \nfor abortions abroad because that has been illegal under the Helms Act \nsince 1973. So since 1973, U.S. funds abroad cannot be used in any way \nto advocate for abortion, to allow women to have an abortion, or to \nrefer her for an abortion. U.S. funds since 1973 can never be used for \nany of those purposes.\n  We can debate that, but I am not going to debate that. What I am \ngoing to debate is why the greatest, freest country in the world, the \nUnited States of America, would put a global gag rule, put a tape over \nthe mouths of organizations that are trying to help the women in their \ncountry if they use their own funds--not U.S. funds but their own \nfunds--for those purposes.\n  I cannot understand for the life of me how we can in good faith, as \nthe leading democracy in the world, sending our troops abroad--and they \nare dying every day for freedom of speech and for the kind of \nconstitution we hope others will have--how we could put a global gag \nrule on those organizations when in this country we could not even \nconsider it for 2 seconds because it would be completely \nunconstitutional.\n  This is a free country. We are proud of the fact that it is free. We \nare proud of the fact that we do not tell our citizens what they can \nthink, what they can say, if it is on their own dime. Yet abroad, in \nsome of the poorest countries in the world, we are saying if they\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nwant to get a penny of Federal funds, USAID or the like, they cannot \nuse their own funds in any way they would like. We are telling family \nplanning clinics that are in the toughest of circumstances, treating \nwomen in the direst poverty, that they are gagged if they want to \nreceive any U.S. funds.\n  Again, these restrictions we are placing on these nonprofit agencies \nwould be unconstitutional and unacceptable in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Ironically, what is very interesting is the global gag rule is even \nstricter than the requirements put on by the Helms amendment. So this \nis an unbelievable move by this administration, after these \nrestrictions were removed in 1993, to place these restrictions back.\n  It is true that the White House, depending on who is in the White \nHouse, has shifted back and forth on the advisability of the global gag \nrule, but the Senate has always said it has no place as part of \nAmerican law. The Senate has stood proud, Democrats and enough \nRepublicans, yes, to make sure that we do not have a double standard, \nthat we do not say with the one hand to these countries we want \ndemocracy for them, we want freedom for them, we want freedom of speech \nfor them, and then on the other hand say, but if they exercise it they \nare going to be punished.\n  Tell me how that makes sense for America. Tell me how that makes any \nsense for our credibility in the world.\n  The last time we debated this global gag rule and the Mexico City \npolicy in this Chamber was about 2 years ago. I introduced this exact \namendment, and it passed with bipartisan support. We hope we will \nachieve that same outcome today. It will be a close vote--we have had \nsome changes in this body--but we still think and hope we have the \nvotes. We will find that out.\n  What is at stake is do we want to have an America that lives what it \nsays, that not only says to the world freedom is good and freedom of \nexpression is good, and if groups work hard and raise their own funds, \nas long as they spend them consistent with their own laws in their own \ncountries, we will say it is their right. But, oh, no, that is not what \nthis administration has done. One of the first things the President did \nwhen he got elected the first time was to put back in place this global \ngag rule.\n  This global gag rule is not fair. We are a country that believes in \nfundamental fairness. Yet this global gag rule tells foreign \nnongovernmental organizations--these are people working in the toughest \nof circumstances--how they should spend their own money.\n  For example, it tells clinics they cannot use their own money to help \na woman in deep despair who comes in with a serious problem, an \nunintended pregnancy that perhaps was even forced on her. It tells the \nNGOs, the nongovernmental organizations, they cannot use their own \nfunds even to advocate for less restrictive laws.\n  For example, let's say there is a law on the books in one of these \npoor countries that says if a person is raped or a victim of incest \nthey cannot have an abortion, and in this country we changed that. If \none is a victim of rape or incest we say Federal funds can be used to \nhelp her. Let us say there is a country that has a total restriction, \neven if someone is raped or there is incest involved, and the \nnongovernmental entity is trying to change that law in their country. \nUnder the global gag rule we say they will lose all of their Federal \nAmerican dollars if they advocate to change what I would call ignorant \nlaws.\n  This global gag rule tells clinics that they cannot use their own \nfunds to even tell a woman who comes before them what her options could \nbe. Even if the woman asks what she can do, they cannot tell her. In \nour country, that would be illegal, unconstitutional. But, no, we put \nthis on the poorest nations of the world. That is not Uncle Sam, that \nis Imperial Sam, and none of us wants to be imperial. At least that is \nmy impression. We want to be democratic. But we are not acting in a \ndemocratic fashion when we have this double standard around the world.\n\n  We believe in freedom of speech and yet the global gag rule tells \nforeign nongovernmental organizations they cannot in any way express an \nopinion on this subject without losing their funds. We do not tell \norganizations of the United States of America what they can say and \nwhat they cannot say in this country, even if we find it offensive. \nThere are a lot of organizations that I find we would be better off \nwithout. I do not think their advocacy is right, but I have no right as \na Senator to tell any organization in America I am tired of hearing \nwhat they are saying, do not say it anymore, because if I tried to stop \nthem I would be ruled out of order, unconstitutional, and that would be \nthe right thing.\n  Yet we do it to foreign nongovernmental organizations.\n  Some Senators just came back from Iraq. I was one of those people. We \nsaw the unimaginable challenges facing our soldiers, government \nofficials, and the Iraqis themselves as they struggle to deal with a \nvery dangerous insurgency in that country. Our soldiers are putting \ntheir lives on the line so that the Iraqis have a chance to live in \nfreedom. One of the foremost freedoms in our country that we wish for \nother people is freedom of speech. Government will not interfere with a \nperson no matter what they say. As long as they are not hurting anybody \nor inciting anybody, they can hold an opinion. That is why our soldiers \nare over there fighting so that the Iraqi people can write a \nconstitution that gives them the same freedoms we have.\n  We heard the Iraqis tell us, the up and coming leaders: We read your \nconstitution, we read your history, we know about your filibuster, and \nhow it protects minority rights. These are the Iraqis. We heard our \nsoldiers say they are willing to risk their lives so the Iraqis can \nhave freedom. Well, that includes freedom of speech. Yet we take away \nthe freedom of nongovernmental organizations to tell the truth to the \nwomen who may come before them seeking help with their reproductive \nfreedom.\n  Our policy should be a model for the world, but the gag rule instead \nsends a bad signal. It enforces a dangerous code of silence. It tells \npeople if the government in power does not agree with them, then they \nshould put a gag over their mouth and just suck it up and not tell the \ntruth about how they feel and keep vital information from the women \nthey are serving. Whether one is pro-choice or anti-choice, this has \nnothing to do with it. It is a question of freedom of speech. I hope \nthat regardless of how we come down on the issue of choice, we would \nagree that it is fair to debate it. I may not like to hear your opinion \nif I do not agree with you, it may be hard for me to handle, but that \nis part of this great country. We have to listen to each other. We have \nto debate and we have to respect each other's views. But I am not \nshowing respect if I walk up to a Senator on the floor and say, you \nknow what, I am tired of hearing your point of view and I am going to \nput a gag over your mouth. How ridiculous. If they did that to me? How \nridiculous. It is freedom of speech we are talking about, and the \nglobal gag rule takes a hammer to our Constitution, to our credibility, \nand I think just knocks us down in the eyes of the world. And it makes \nhypocritical what we are asking our soldiers to do across this globe.\n\n  I want to give some examples. In Peru, for example, family planning \nNGOs funded by the U.S. were barred from advocating against a \nconstitutional clause banning abortion. It was not the Peruvian \nGovernment gagging their own people, it was our Government. And it was \nnot all Peruvian NGOs who were barred from participating in that \ndebate, it was only those who opposed the abortion ban. The other \npeople were free to talk about it.\n  What is that about? America comes in and says if you want our money \nyou can only advocate for the position that the Government in power \nwants. You cannot have another opinion. I think that is beyond \noutrageous.\n  Just listen to what one nongovernmental organization leader in Peru \nsaid, and I am quoting this individual:\n\n       We used to hold debates, invite medical doctors, produce \n     research publications. We cannot speak as freely now. No one \n     knows at what point it becomes prohibited speech. USAID told \n     us we couldn't lobby for abortion liberalization or \n     decriminalization. If we attend a general conference and the \n     issue of abortion comes up, we can speak. But we don't know \n     how much we can talk about it before it crosses over to not \n     being permitted anymore. We, for example, can do research on \n     unsafe abortions, but if we draw any conclusions someone can \n     say, ``that's lobbying,'' [and we will lose all of our \n     money.]\n\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\n\n  This is a terrible thing, this global gag rule. I am so proud of the \nSenate. Every time we have brought it up we overturned it. I hope that \nwill be the case today.\n  I want to tell you a story about a real case in Nepal. In 2001, this \nissue came to my attention. There was a nongovernmental organization \nthat had to make a Hobson's choice: Do we take USAID money which we \ndesperately need to help our people if it will force us to remain \nsilent on the issue of reproductive freedom? What should we do? Should \nwe give up the money and retain our freedom?\n  Let me tell you what this organization did. It gave back the USAID \nmoney, even though it put them in a very precarious financial position. \nThey did it because of a 13-year-old girl named Min Min. I brought her \npicture with me to the Senate floor 2 years ago because I wanted my \ncolleagues to see the face of what we are talking about here today. \nThis is not just about freedom of speech. This is about real, live \npeople and what happens to them if they cannot get reproductive health \ncare.\n  Min Min was raped by a relative. She was raped by an uncle. She \nbecame pregnant, and it was a shame upon the family and the family said \nyou must have an illegal abortion. As a result of that illegal abortion \nof a girl 13 years old who was raped by her uncle, someone was \nsentenced to 20 years in prison. Who was it? Was it the rapist? No. Was \nit the parents who said you have to end the pregnancy? No. It was this \ntiny girl, 13 years old, who was sent to jail for 20 years for the \ncrime of being raped by a relative and being forced by her family to \nhave an abortion.\n  The nongovernmental organization wanted to go to bat for this child, \nso they turned back American money. Can you believe it? We punished an \norganization that wanted to go to bat for a 13-year-old rape victim--\nincest victim, really. We took the side of the rapist. That is what we \ndid. We said to the NGO: If you want to help this child, give back the \nmoney because you cannot advocate for changing the law in your land.\n\n  So this clinic in Nepal turned back their money--our money--and \nfought for Min Min. She had her 14th birthday in prison. She had her \n15th birthday in prison. But then, because they did not take American \nmoney and they were free to lobby in behalf of Min Min, they succeeded \nin changing the laws of Nepal, and they helped set that little girl \nfree.\n  For their valor and their courage and their success in freeing a \nchild from prison who was put there after she was raped by her uncle, \nthis is what they had to do. They had to give up $100,000 in USAID \nfunding, and they had to let 60 staff members go. They couldn't help \nmore than 50,000 other people who desperately needed them.\n  These are the real stories behind this Presidential edict of the \nPresident, when he steps up to the plate and says I am putting in place \na gag rule.\n  I am ashamed. I am ashamed that we were on the side of the rapist and \nagainst the side of a little girl who was a victim of incest. How can \nthis Senate look at that story and say, yes, that's right, we want to \nbe on the side of the rapist? Why should the rapist suffer? We don't \nwant to change the laws in Nepal. To me, this example alone is enough \nreason to do away with this global gag rule.\n  Here is another point. We should always look at our policies and ask \nthe question: Are our policies decreasing the number of abortions that \ntake place worldwide because all of us want to decrease the number of \nabortions taking place worldwide. Frankly, the Mexico City global gag \nrule makes it far tougher to reduce the number of abortions. We support \nfamily planning counseling and care. We support family planning, I \nthought, because we want to prevent abortions. Between 1988 and 2001, \nmodern contraceptive use in Russia increased by 74 percent, and the \nabortion rate went down 60 percent. So there is a direct correlation \nbetween contraception and education on how to use contraception and the \nabortion rate. I say this, even though I believe this should be a known \nfact, but sometimes we seem to forget it. So what happens when we \npunish a nongovernmental organization that is involved with family \nplanning, such as that clinic in Nepal I talked to you about, that had \nto give back $100,000 and lay off 60 people? They could no longer serve \nthe women who so desperately needed their help.\n  Is this President saying he wants to keep contraception away from \nwomen who are asking for it? Because if that is what he wants to do, \nthis global gag rule is doing just that. This is a radical thing we are \ndealing with because when you tell agencies they have to make a deal \nwith the devil, take money and then be gagged, many of them will say: I \ndon't want your money. I would rather be able to advocate.\n  And if they do not take the money, then they are in a terrible \ncircumstance because they have to lay off people who would otherwise go \nout and counsel young women about family planning. Then, when those \nyoung women, in the poorest of the poor nations, are desperate, \nunfortunately they may seek what we called here, when abortion was \nillegal, back-ally abortions--and women died. Many women have died, \nthousands every year across this globe, because of illegal, unsafe \nabortions.\n  I believe very much that family planning is the answer. It can bring \nus all together, whether we believe in a woman's right to chose or we \nbelieve the Government should be involved in it, we should not tell a \nwoman, tell a family how to live their lives regardless of what side \nyou are on. My goodness. Family planning ought to bring us together.\n\n  For those of us who believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, \nthe way to get to that place is to have adequate family planning. For \nthose of us who believe the Government should prohibit the jailing of \nwomen and doctors who have or give abortions, they should want to have \nfamily planning services so we have fewer abortions.\n  Why don't we hold hands on this vote as we have in the past and walk \ndown the aisle together across those divides and say family planning is \nthe way to make abortion rare? That is the key. But the global gag rule \nhas the opposite impact. The global gag rule is causing more abortions \nbecause the nongovernmental organizations will not take the funding, \nthey won't be gagged, and they won't have the staff to go out and give \nthose women the advice and the contraceptions that they are asking for.\n  There is another issue that comes into play here, and that is the \nissue of HIV/AIDS. Preventing AIDS is very important. The use of modern \nfamily planning methods will help us prevent AIDS.\n  This global gag rule is dangerous. It is dangerous directly, and it \nis dangerous indirectly. It goes against our Constitution and freedom \nof speech. If this President tried to put this kind of gag rule on in \nAmerica, he would be laughed out of the courts. Of course, they do not \ndo that because we have something called the Constitution and freedom \nof speech. We don't go around putting a gag on doctors who have their \nown practices. We let them do what they think is right--to do no harm \nand to help people.\n  I want to talk about a school in Uganda where three of its students \ndied from unsafe abortions. The same man impregnated the three girls. \nIt was a horrible tragedy. But the local clinic still didn't know what \nto do since it received USAID funding. They had a situation where three \ngirls were impregnated by the same man, and they didn't want to give \nback the money they had gotten from the United States of America. This \nis what they said.\n  What should the school do? Refer the girls to the clinic? It is a \nvery difficult situation for the nurses. What can they counsel about? \nIt is a problem if the provider is a member of that community. A person \ncannot even speak as a community member or a parent. Because how can \nyou differentiate between an individual and the fact that they are an \nemployee of a nongovernmental organization?\n  The point here is that if someone in the clinic in the area where one \nman impregnated three girls in the school feels that he or she can't \nspeak out in their capacity as an individual citizen because they work \nfor a nongovernmental organization that could be forced to give up its \nfunding--this is a very bad policy. We are saying to clinics throughout \nthe world that are supposedly trying to help that you must choose \nbetween limiting your services\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nto a woman who comes to you in desperate need or shut down your doors \nbecause you have to give back the funding from the United States of \nAmerica. It is really a stunning and unfair policy.\n  One of the Planned Parenthood chapters in my State is in Ethiopia \nright now. They are seeing firsthand the impact of the global gag rule \non women's lives. Think about what it means to try to get health care \nin Ethiopia. If you are lucky, you might have only a 3-day or 4-day \nwalk to a clinic--a 3-day or 4-day walk to a clinic in Ethiopia.\n  Less than 8 percent of the population has access to contraception. \nOnly 20 percent get prenatal care. One in seven women die from \npregnancies or unsafe abortions. In fact, backyard abortions are the \nsecond leading cause of death among women only, behind tuberculosis.\n  Because of the global gag rule that this administration has put in \nplace, supplies to the largest planning provider in Ethiopia have been \ncut. They have been cut because they refuse to be gagged. The people in \nEthiopia are looking to America with our Constitution and our freedom \nand our freedom of speech, and they are saying: We are not going to \nallow the President of the United States of America and this Congress \nto gag us. We will have to give back the money.\n\n  That is the most counterproductive thing we can do. Why? Because they \nare running out of the contraceptives because they don't have the \nmoney. They are less able to serve rural areas, only 7 percent of which \nhave access to basic sanitation. They are less able to curb the rising \ntide of HIV which is sweeping over the population, leaving shattered \nlives and families in its wake.\n  Why would we want to be responsible for that? We don't have to be \ntoday. We are going to have a chance to do what the Senate has done \nyear after year after year. We have stood up for women's health. We \nhave stood up for freedom of speech. We have stood up for the right of \npeople--even the poorest of the poor--to get access to health care, to \nfind out what their options are, to know what the possibilities are, to \nfight for changes in the law.\n  The Senate has stood on the right side of this issue--on the correct \nside of this issue--for years. I am so proud of the Senate. We did it \nwith almost all Democrats and many Republicans standing with us. I hope \nthat happens today. If it doesn't, a message will be sent throughout \nthe world--yes, to our troops in Iraq who are fighting to bring freedom \nof speech around the world, that here in the U.S. Senate, we have just \nstood with a global gag rule. I hope that is not the message we send.\n  I don't want to see us continue this global gag rule. It is hurting \nthe very people we say we care about--the poorest of the poor, the \nwomen, the girls, the victims of rape, the victims of incest.\n  The amendment I plan to offer and which we have actually set aside is \nidentical to the one we passed 2 years ago. It is very simple. It \nsimply says that nongovernmental organizations cannot be denied funding \nsolely because the medical services they provide with their own funds \ninclude counsel and referrals. They cannot be denied funding solely \nbecause they use their own funds to advocate for new laws. That is all \nwe say.\n  In this amendment we admit very straightforwardly that no NGO can \nviolate its own country's law. If abortion is illegal and you cannot \nrefer people in your country, if they say that is the law of the land, \nof course, we support people paying attention to the laws of their \ncountry. But we do not say, and we shouldn't say and we wouldn't say it \nhere, that these NGOs shouldn't be able to lobby for new laws. This is \nvery important.\n  In Nepal they sent a 13-year-old girl away for 20 years. She was a \nvictim of an uncle's incest. They let the rapist go free and there were \nno penalties for the parents who forced her to have an abortion. That \nNGO, that clinic that turned back USAID funding, said we are not \nselling out our people. We are not selling out a child for some \ndollars.\n  I cannot believe the side that we were on. The global gag rule put us \non the side of a rapist. That is what the global gag rule did. That is \nnot a side anyone in this Chamber wants to be on. I hope everyone in \nthis Chamber will vote to be on the side of the women who were the \nvictims. They need us to be by their side.\n  Basically, what we are saying in our amendment is we believe in human \nrights. We believe in freedom of speech. We believe other countries \nshould have the same freedoms we have in this country. And if we cannot \ngag people in this country, let's not do it abroad just because we can. \nAlmost 60 years ago in the dark shadows of World War II, it was our \ncountry that championed the universal declaration of human rights, \nsetting a standard for human rights all over the world. This is what \nthat declaration said:\n\n       [T]he advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy \n     freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want \n     has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common \n     people.\n\n  That is America after World War II. Can someone explain to me how \nAmerica feels it is on the side of the good when we will punish a \nnongovernmental organization that goes to bat for a rape victim who is \n13 years old? We are not on the side of human rights. We are on the \nside of people who are doing evil. That is wrong. That is not what our \nGovernment ought to be doing.\n  The aspirations of our country and of our people should be reflected \nin our policies. That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to do what they have done over and over again: Stand up and be \ncounted on the side of freedom and justice and the American way. It is \nthe American way to foster freedom and justice, to allow people, even \nwhen we do not agree with them, to take their complaints and their \npoints of view to their governments. That is what our soldiers are \nfighting for and dying for in Iraq, yet with this policy we stand on \nthe side of tyranny.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with us again. This is a bipartisan \nBoxer-Snowe amendment. I urge Members when the time comes--and I hope \nthe chairman will let us know at what point we will be voting--I urge \nMembers to stand with Senators Boxer and Snowe in this bipartisan \namendment to end the global gag rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, once again the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has presented her case, as always, with conviction and with \neloquence. She is an able and a remarkable advocate for her position on \nthis very important and controversial issue.\n  When President Bush restored the so-called Mexico City policy upon \ncoming into office in 2001, he stated his conviction that United States \ntaxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or for those who \nactively promote abortions as a means of family planning.\n  It should be made clear this does not lessen our country's commitment \nto strong international family planning programs. Indeed, President \nBush's fiscal year 2005 budget requests $425 million for population \nassistance, the same funding level appropriated during fiscal year \n2001, President Clinton's final year in office.\n  President Bush has confirmed his commitment to maintaining these \nfunding levels for population assistance because he knows that one of \nthe best ways to prevent abortions is to prevent unwanted pregnancies \nthrough voluntary family planning services. This is the policy of our \nGovernment today and it is one that President Bush advocates in the \nfuture.\n  I expect we will continue to have debates in the Senate on the Mexico \nCity policy. As the distinguished Senator from California has pointed \nout, that has been the case for several years. Over the years there \nhave been numerous attempts to reach compromise language that would \nsatisfy all sides on this important issue, but no acceptable \naccommodation has thus far been found. This is why President Bush has \nadvised us he will veto any legislation that seeks to override the \nMexico City policy.\n  USAID can and does provide the family planning information services \nin developing countries through many foreign NGOs. The President has \ndetermined that such family planning assistance will be provided only \nto those foreign grantees whose family planning programs are consistent \nwith the policies of this administration. Every\n\n[[Page S3181]]\n\nPresident since 1984 has exercised that right.\n  As manager of the President's bill, I, along with every other \nSenator, must take seriously the President's statements that he would \nveto the legislation if it were presented to him without the Mexico \nCity policy intact. I believe it is highly unlikely that he will change \nhis mind at this point. The President has been very clear and the \ndirectives with regard to administration policy on this legislation are \nalso clear.\n  I will oppose this amendment. I ask other Senators to do so for the \nreasons I have given.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nCorzine and Mikulski to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, women around the world should have access \nto safe health care, especially those who are struggling in some of our \nworld's poorest nations. That is why I am in the Senate this afternoon \nto support the Boxer amendment. I thank Senator Boxer for standing up \non an issue that affects women around the globe. I am very proud to be \na cosponsor and supporter of this amendment.\n  This amendment is about ensuring that women around the world have \naccess to health care that they need, especially reproductive health \ncare. It does not get much attention, but in the developing world, \ncomplication from pregnancy is one of the leading causes of death for \nwomen. It ranks right up there with tuberculosis. According to the \nWorld Health Organization, more than half a million women die every \nyear of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. That is more than \none woman dying every minute of every day. That is what we are talking \nabout with this amendment. That is a crisis.\n  Now, you know when there is a medical crisis, something that kills \nhundreds of thousands of people every year, we do not just stand by. We \nwork to make things better. In poor countries around the world, medical \nprofessionals and nongovernmental organizations are simply trying to \nmake things better. They have set up clinics. They have done an \nexcellent job. They are reaching out to poor communities. And they are \nopening the doors of access to women and families who desperately need \nhealth care. They are doing great work. But today their hands are tied, \nand even worse their hands are tied because the Bush administration has \nimposed a political ideology on the world. We cannot allow this \nundemocratic policy to deny women and their children health care and \nultimately sentence them to die.\n  As my colleague, Senator Boxer, has talked about, when President Bush \ntook office in 2001, he signed an Executive order known as the global \ngag rule. It denies U.S. funds to any overseas health clinic unless it \nagrees not to use its own--its own--private, non-U.S. funds for \nanything related to abortion. If you are a medical professional living \nin an impoverished country trying to help people, save lives, you are \ngagged from even talking about certain reproductive health services.\n  We would not stand for that in the United States. We know how \nimportant the doctor-patient relationship is. When we go to a doctor, \nwe want to know that the doctor is giving us all the advice we need--\nnot holding something back because of a gag rule imposed on him by \nsomeone else. But that is exactly what the global gag rule does. It is \nforced on women in poor countries around the world, and that is just \nsimply wrong.\n  I am not going to take the time to go into detail on why I believe \nthis gag rule is so wrong, but I just want to mention a few things. \nSimply put, the gag rule undermines reproductive health care, it hurts \nour efforts to prevent HIV and AIDS, and it limits access to \ncontraceptives. The gag rule places limits on women and doctors that we \nwould never accept here in the United States.\n  But here is the bottom line and something all of our colleagues \nshould remember as we go to vote on this amendment: This is about \nprotecting women's lives. Today, the women around the world are being \ndenied the care they need because of an ideological policy, and they \nare dying as a result. We cannot tolerate that as Americans, and that \nis why I have come to the floor this afternoon, to urge my colleagues \nto support the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank young very much, Mr. President. I thank my \ncolleagues for discussing this important issue and I appreciate Senator \nBoxer's concern. This is well-plowed ground that we have traveled over \nseveral times. We have been over this issue a number of years. The \nMexico City Policy was first introduced by Ronald Reagan. It is a \ncommonsense policy that President Reagan first put forward in 1984, \nbased in part on his belief that U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to \nsubsidize or support organizations that perform or promote abortions \nthrough international family planning programs, period.\n  President Reagan, as was typical in his way, looked at the root of \nthe issue and said: I understand we have an enormous debate in America \nand around the world about the issues surrounding the questions ``when \ndoes life begin? Does it begin in the womb or not?'' There is an \nenormous debate about these important questions--and I am going to set \nthat debate aside, President Reagan said, but I am going to say as \nwell, the American public has very clearly defined itself on the issue \nof taxpayer funding of abortion. The people are saying: We may debate \nback and forth about the life issue, but we do not want taxpayer \nfunding to provide for abortions, particularly overseas. That is just a \nbridge way too far for me to cross, too far from the very fundamentals \nof the debate, for now the country is a pro-life country and generally \npeople are opposed to abortion taking place.\n  That was the 1984 decision put in place by Ronald Reagan, later \noverturned by President Clinton, later put back into place by President \nBush. One of George W. Bush's first acts in office was to reinstate the \nMexico City Policy. The Mexico City Policy simply prohibits provision \nof Federal taxpayer funds to organizations that ``perform or actively \npromote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.'' It \nis a very simple issue. It is a very direct, straightforward issue. I \nwant to say as well, that when individuals try to frame this debate by \nsaying this is about women's rights and issues, and a lack of our \nsupport of them on the international level, I want to step aside for \njust a minute and point out the record of the Bush administration on \nwomen's rights, on issues in Afghanistan where women are now voting and \nactively participating in politics and society, is just tremendous.\n  Senator Boxer and I both put forward a bill about women's rights in \nAfghanistan, and, in addition, the Bush administration is implementing \nand remedying concerns for women in Iraq who are now voting and are now \nproudly waving their fingers with the ink stain upon them. Brave women \nare demonstrating their rights and standing up to defend their rights \naround the world. This administration, on a very practical level, is \nputting forth and implementing programs in great strides to assure \nwomen's rights around the world, and they should be congratulated for \nthat and thanked for all their efforts.\n  Now, you can try to tie this question of taxpayer funding for \nabortions oversees back into that issue, but I do not think that is a \nfair point of the debate. The fair point of the debate is, it is \ntaxpayer dollars. It involves the very difficult, sensitive issue of \n``when does human life begin?''--a question which we have failed to \nresolve in this country as of this moment.\n  Should American taxpayers be funding abortions in many countries all \naround the world? People say: Well, there is more family planning now. \nThe dollars do not go directly for abortion. The money is fungible. It \ncan go into an organization and be used to replace dollars that can \nthen be used for abortion. Why should we put that sort of ideology \nforward on another country when we have not resolved it ourselves?\n  I think the Bush doctrine, formerly the Reagan doctrine, the Mexico \nCity Policy, should stand for good reason. It stands with the American \npublic. We\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nshould not be using Federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortions \noverseas. That is the view of 75 to 80 percent of Americans.\n  Many Americans do not like the way we handle foreign assistance now \nanyway. I personally think we should be generous in our foreign \nassistance and in some cases do substantially more to alleviate \npoverty. But if you frame the debate into these sorts of issues alone, \nyou start to drive away people's support for foreign aid and for \nsupporting the good that is taking place in other countries. That is \nnot a good thing to do, particularly when we have been given so much as \na nation. I would hope we could help more overseas, but it has to be in \na sensible way that the American public agrees with.\n  So while I appreciate being able to work with my colleague from \nCalifornia on many issues, this is one where we will have to part \ncompany. I really think President Reagan got this principle right, and \nthe continuation of the Mexico City Policy by President Bush is right \nas well. Respectfully, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I so appreciate my colleague coming to the \nfloor and taking time to express his views, but I think it is very \nimportant to straighten out the record.\n  What my colleague is talking about is putting strings on U.S. \ntaxpayer funds. That is the Helms amendment, and that has been the law \nsince 1973. What the global gag rule does is different. It tells \nnongovernmental organizations abroad that they will lose U.S. funding \nif they use their own funds not ours, but theirs--to lobby to change \negregious laws in their country.\n  In order for a nongovernmental organization to fight to change an \negregious law, like the one that used to exist in Napal--which I know \nmy friend would not agree with--that nongovernmental organization, I \ntell my friend, had to give back their USAID money because they were \nusing their own funds to change the laws of Nepal. So we gagged this \nnongovernmental organization from helping a child who was raped. The \nrapist did not go to prison. The rapist--the uncle--was free. The \nparents did not go to prison even though they forced her to have an \nillegal abortion. The child went to prison.\n  The only way the nongovernmental organization was able to work to \nchange the law in that country, which punished a child who was a victim \nof incest, was to give back the USAID money. Otherwise, they could not \nlobby for law changes in their own country.\n  Now, I use that example because it shows why this law is so \negregious. And again, to make the point to my friend, the Helms \namendment, which has been in place since 1973, already precludes U.S. \nFederal funds from being used by nongovernmental organizations in any \naspect having to do with abortion. They already cannot use our funds to \nperform abortion. They already cannot use our funds to refer.\n  They already can't use funds to advocate. That is taken care of. The \nglobal gag rule is different from that. It is putting a gag around the \nvery people who are trying to help prevent pregnancies, who are trying \nto help girls such as Min Min in Nepal who was the victim of incest. \nThat is plain wrong. I don't mind my friend disagreeing with me. And we \ndo agree on many issues and have worked together and will continue to. \nBut I would hope we would not confuse the Helms amendment, which has \nbeen in place since 1973 and does not allow a penny of taxpayer funds \nto go in any way to the provision of abortion services. Don't confuse \nthat with the gag rule, which keeps nongovernmental organizations from \nbeing able to use their own funds as they see fit to help women and \ngirls in tragic circumstances such as the one I described by changing \nthe repressive laws in some of their countries.\n  I urge my friend to please be clear that these are different issues. \nWe already deny the use of Federal funds for anything having to do with \noverseas abortion or its lobbying. But the gag rule takes it a step \nfurther and says these organizations that work so hard in the toughest \nenvironments cannot use their own funds in the way they see fit to \nadvocate for changes in the law, to help women understand what their \noptions are. And it is antithetical to the United States of America, to \nfreedom of speech. My friend knows we couldn't do that here. We \ncouldn't tell people here that they can't talk to their patients. That \nwould be unconstitutional.\n  I urge my colleagues to please vote on what this issue is, not on \nwhat this issue is not. We live with the Helms rule. We are not \nchanging that. We simply want to get rid of this global gag rule today. \nI hope Members will vote aye on the Boxer-Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we are looking forward to conclusion of \nthis debate and another debate prior to getting into the voting \nsequence at about 4:30. May I ask the participants, the distinguished \nSenator from California and the distinguished Senator from Kansas, \ncould there be agreement that the amendment would come to conclusion in \n20 minutes of time and that this be apportioned 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from California and 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas? There would be no other speakers and \nthat would conclude the debate. Then we would be able to proceed with \nan amendment by Senators Craig and Baucus.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may respond to the chairman, I have no problem. I \nwould like to close the debate. That will be fine with us as long as I \nmay conclude.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No objection from myself.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that debate be of 20 minutes \nduration, that the time be under control of the Senator from California \nand the Senator from Kansas, and that the Senator from California be \nable to conclude the debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, 10 minutes each and no \nsecond-degree amendments; is that part of it?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That would be correct, no second-degree amendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair and the Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, responding to a couple of the comments \nof my colleague from California, I would like to cite and include in \nthe Record a Congressional Research Service report on international \nfamily planning, the Mexico City policy. This report is dated April 2, \n2001. And then another one, an updated one on population assistance and \nfamily planning programs, issued for Congress, May 19, 2003.\n  In the 2003 report, I want to cite this briefly because we are \ngetting involved in a discussion about what the wording of the Boxer \namendment does and what it does not do. I contend that clearly what \ncould take place with the passage of the Boxer amendment, is that money \ncould go to a foreign organization that performs abortions. These \norganizations can't use the money directly for abortions, but they can \nmove private money to do abortions while using the government money for \nadvocacy. That is what I am saying. My colleague is giving the \nillustration of this tragic situation that has occurred where there has \nbeen a rape in Nepal and this is a heart-rending example of these types \nof cases right before us now.\n  Regardless of how you view life, and when human life begins, we are \ngoing to set that issue aside but I hope we get to debate that issue \none of these days. In this CRS report dated 2003, USAID issued \nadditional guidelines on the implementation of the Mexico City Policy \nand stated that organizations could not ``perform abortions in a \nforeign country except where the life of the mother would be endangered \nor in cases of forcible rape or incest.'' So where my colleague is \ntalking about a case of forcible rape taking place and a choice of an \norganization having to choose between performing an abortion or losing \ntheir funding, the USAID policy says that performing such an abortion \nis a specific exemption from this Mexico City policy that is squarely \non point in this CRS report.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record selections from the \ntwo CRS reports that I have mentioned.\n\n[[Page S3183]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At Mexico City, Reagan Administration officials emphasized \n     the need for developing countries to adopt sound economic \n     policies that stressed open markets and an active private \n     sector.\n       Again nearly a decade later, the Clinton Administration \n     changed the U.S. position on family planning programs by \n     lifting restrictive provisions adopted at the Mexico City \n     Conference. At the 1994 Cairo Conference, U.S. officials \n     emphasized support for family planning and reproductive \n     health services, improving the status of women, and providing \n     access to safe abortion. Eight years later, President Bush \n     revoked the Clinton Administration position on family \n     planning issues and abortion, reimposing in full the Mexico \n     City restrictions in force during the 1980s and early 1990s. \n     Throughout this debate, which at times has been the most \n     contentious foreign aid policy issue considered by Congress, \n     the cornerstone of U.S. policy has remained to be a \n     commitment to international family planning programs based on \n     principles of voluntarism and informed choice that give \n     participants access to information on all major methods of \n     birth control.\n       Nevertheless, the controversy spilled over into U.S. \n     foreign aid policy almost immediately when Congress approved \n     in late 1973 an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (Section 104(f)) prohibiting the use of foreign \n     development assistance to pay for the performance of \n     abortions or involuntary sterilizations, to motivate or \n     coerce any person to practice abortions, or to coerce or \n     provide persons with any financial incentive to undergo \n     sterilizations. Since 1981, Congress has enacted nearly \n     identical restrictions in annual Foreign Operations \n     appropriation bills.\n       For the past 25 years, both congressional actions and \n     administrative directives have restricted U.S. population \n     assistance in various ways, including those set out in the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and more recent executive \n     regulations and appropriation riders prohibiting indirect \n     support for coercive family planning (specifically in China) \n     and abortion activities related to the work of international \n     and foreign nongovernmental organizations. Two issues in \n     particular which were initiated in 1984--the ``Mexico City'' \n     policy involving funding for non-governmental-organizations \n     (NGOs), and restrictions on funding for the U.N. Population \n     Fund (UNFPA) because of its activities in China--have \n     remained controversial and continue as prominent features in \n     the population assistance debate.\n       During the Bush Administration, efforts were made in \n     Congress to overturn the Mexico City policy and rely on \n     existing congressional restrictions in the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 banning direct U.S. funding of abortions and \n     coerced sterilizations. Provisions adopted by the House and/\n     or Senate that would have reversed the policy, however, were \n     removed from legislation under threat of a presidential veto.\n       Efforts to Legislate the Mexico City Policy. Beginning in \n     1993, abortion opponents in Congress attempted to legislate \n     modified terms of the Mexico City policy. Under the threat of \n     a Presidential veto and resistance from the Senate, Mexico \n     City restrictions had not been enacted into law until passage \n     in November 1999 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for \n     FY2000 (P.L. 106-113).\n       In USAID-issued certification forms, organizations had to \n     state that they would not engage in three types of activities \n     with either USAID or non-USAID funds from the date they \n     signed an agreement to receive FY2000 USAID population funds \n     through September 30, 2001: perform abortions in a foreign \n     country, except where the life of the mother would be \n     endangered, or in cases of forcible rape or incest; violate \n     the laws of a foreign country concerning the circumstances \n     under which abortion is permitted, regulated, or restricted; \n     or attempt to alter the laws or governmental policies \n     concerning circumstances under which abortion is permitted, \n     regulated, or restricted.\n       If an organization declined to certify or did not return \n     the certification form, it was ineligible to receive FY2000 \n     USAID population funds unless it was granted a waiver under \n     the $15 million exemption cap.\n       The regulations also contain exceptions: abortions may be \n     performed if the life of the mother would be endangered if \n     the fetus were carried to term or abortions performed \n     following rape or incest; health care facilities may treat \n     injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions \n     (post-abortion care).\n       The new Administration Mexico City guidelines state that \n     U.S. cannot furnish assistance to foreign NGOs which perform \n     or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning \n     in USAID-recipient countries, or that furnish assistance to \n     other foreign NGOs that conduct such activities.\n       Examples of what constitutes the promotion of abortion \n     include: operating a family planning counseling service that \n     includes information regarding the benefits and availability \n     of abortion; providing advice that abortion is an available \n     option or encouraging women to consider abortion; lobbying a \n     foreign government to legalize or to continue the legality of \n     abortion as a method of family planning . . .\n       The regulations also contain exceptions to these policies:\n       abortions may be performed if the life to the mother would \n     be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or abortions \n     performed following rape or incest.\n       health care facilities may treat injuries or illnesses \n     caused by legal or illegal abortions (post-abortion care).\n       ``passive'' responses by family planning counselors to \n     questions about abortion from pregnant women who have already \n     decided to have a legal abortion is not considered an act of \n     promoting abortion.\n       referrals for abortion as a result of rape, incest, or \n     where the mother's life would be endangered, or for post-\n     abortion care are permitted.\n       Recipients of USAID grants, however, could use their own \n     funds to engage in abortion-related activities, but were \n     required to maintain segregated accounts for U.S. money in \n     order to show evidence they were in compliance with the \n     abortion restrictions.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Furthermore, I want to back up to an earlier point \nthat I engaged on with my colleague. We live in a wonderful nation. \nThis is a beautiful land. I have traveled to many of the developing \ncountries around the world. They look up to America. They seek help and \nsupport from America. They seek our ideals. When we go there and we \npush issues such as abortion or are associated with groups that push \nissues such as abortion, we are reduced as a nation. Actions like this \nsays to developing countries: We have issues such as malaria, we have \nissues such as HIV/AIDS, feeding our poor people, and you are out here \npushing this ideology. Why are you doing that?\n  I go home to my constituents in Kansas. They think the foreign aid \nbudget is about 25 percent of the budget, which it is not. It is about \n1 percent. But then if a case such as this comes up, tax payer funding \nof abortions in developing countries--and they don't say it as much \nnow--they say: We are funding abortions overseas, and we don't like it. \nI remember in 1994 hearing many people saying things such as that.\n  If we pursue this sort of policy, it diminishes our possibility to go \nto the public and say: We want to do whatever we possibly can to end \npoverty, hunger, and alleviate suffering in the world. We can do more \nand we want to do more. We are out there pushing to do more. If we \nforce policies such as this, it cuts the knees out from underneath all \nour other efforts because then a number of people say: How are you \ndoing alleviating poverty by funding a group that funds and works for \nabortion? How is this work alleviating suffering and poverty? It seems \nas though you are going against the very message you ought to be \ndriving and pushing forward.\n  My colleague and I have come together to discuss and work on many \nimportant issues, but we disagree sometimes. We have different views on \nthe point of life. But, from my work, I know that there are great \ngroups of people in this country and a pretty strong majority that says \nwe need to help more overseas. But it has to be sensible help. There \nhave to be ways we can feed more people and ways we can take care of \nsickness, where we can end the fighting in places such as Darfur, where \nwe can move forward in economic development, in ways such as the \nMillennium Challenge Account Program is structured to do.\n  Amendments such as this have a harmful overall impact on the body \npolitic of this country, disrupting a chance to do something that is \nvery noble and good. I understand my colleague is putting it forward as \na noble cause. I don't think it is being received or can be viewed in \nthat way.\n  With all due respect to my colleague and her heart for her goodness \nto do the right thing, this amendment is not helpful on many levels. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my colleague misses the entire point. The \nreason this child was sent to prison in Nepal after incest by an uncle \nand being forced by her parents to have an abortion is because of the \nformer law in Nepal. And the policy my friend is supporting, the global \ngag rule he extolls, prohibited that clinic from going to bat for this \nchild and using its own funds to change the laws. To do that, they had \nto turn back their U.S. funding. Are you proud of that? They decided, \nthis nongovernmental organization, to give back the money because they \nfelt it was that important to fight for that child who was the victim \nof incest and get that law changed.\n  It took them several years. That child had a 14th birthday in prison, \nand\n\n[[Page S3184]]\n\nshe had a 15th birthday in prison. But they succeeded. One would think \nwe would be on their side. One would think the United States of America \nwould be on the side of a child who was raped and against a man who \nperformed that act. One would think that is the side we would be on, \nthe side of this child. But, oh, no, the global gag rule told that \nclinic: You cannot change the law because if you do that, you are \nviolating the global gag rule.\n  That is the point. It is true there is an exception for rape and \nincest in the rule, but it does not apply if the country does not make \nan exception for rape and incest. So what we should say in those \ncases--at least work with me on this--is allow them to keep their money \nif they are working to change the law on rape and incest in their \ncountry. But my friend is not doing that. He wants the status quo.\n  Then we have the case in Uganda where three underage girls died from \nbotched abortions. The same man impregnated them, and the clinic was \nafraid to help because they could lose all their American money. The \ngirls died.\n  Is that what we are celebrating today, a policy that allows a child \nto rot in prison if she is raped, a policy that allows a rapist to be \nfree, a policy that says three girls impregnated by the same man should \ndie in a back alley? I hope not. This is very serious. This is not only \nabout words. This is not a debate about when life begins. We can have \nthat debate any day of the week.\n  I will tell my friend right now, I would die for his right to believe \nwhat he believes on that issue, and I hope he would die for my right to \nbelieve what I believe on that issue because that is a question between \nus and our God. That is not on the table today.\n  What is on the table is a real-life question: With whom do we stand? \nI hope when we come to this vote, which we are going to have shortly \ntoday, we are going to stand with the women and girls of the world who \nneed our protection, not our vengeance, who need to know we are not \ngoing to gag the people who are there to help them, but, in fact, allow \nthe people who are there to help them, to use their own funds to tell \nthe truth about their life and their options and their health. This is \na very serious matter.\n  Mr. President, if the other side will yield back its time, I will be \nglad to yield back mine; otherwise, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could have 1 minute. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will address directly one point, if \nthe Senator does not object. I read from the CRS document May 19, 2003, \non this topic:\n\n       In USAID-issued certification forms, organizations had to \n     state that they would not engage in three types of activities \n     with either USAID or non-USAID funds from the date they \n     signed an agreement to receive FY2000 USAID population funds \n     . . . :\n       Perform abortions in a foreign country, except where the \n     life of the mother would be endangered, or in cases of \n     forcible rape or incest;\n       Violate the laws of a foreign country concerning the \n     circumstances under which abortion is permitted, regulated, \n     or restricted; or\n       Attempt to alter laws or governmental policies concerning \n     circumstances under which abortion is permitted, regulated, \n     or restricted.\n\n  As I understand it, USAID is required by the Mexico City language, \nthat in horrific difficulties and circumstances, such as the case the \nSenator discussed, individuals may work with organizations who provide \nabortions. But it is on a narrow set of circumstances because the \nAmerican public does not agree with taxpayer funding of abortions \noverseas.\n\n  I submit the report for the Record, and I yield the floor. If my \ncolleague is prepared to yield back time, I am prepared to yield back \ntime, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond.\n  Again, my colleague has made my point. He read into the Record \nexactly what I said. Under the gag rule, you cannot perform abortions \nexcept for rape, incest, or life of the mother. That is right. But here \nis the second point: You cannot attempt to alter the laws, and that is \nthe exact reason I cited for why the nongovernmental organization that \nis prohibited from altering the laws of their country had to give back \ntheir funding. That is exactly the point.\n  My friend made my argument for me by reading what I have been saying. \nThis nongovernmental organization wanted to change the laws in Nepal so \nthat a child who was raped or a victim of incest would not rot in \nprison. They were precluded from using their own money to alter the \nlaws of their country. My friend read it right into the Record, and I \nthank him for that. He made my point.\n  So, yes, at the end of the day, we stand with the rapist in this case \nagainst the child, and that is wrong, and that is the reason I hope my \ncolleagues will join with me.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in an effort not to belabor this too \nmuch, there is a set of semantics being argued back and forth. I invite \nmy colleague to submit suggestions on regulatory changes to the USAID \nto try to address this narrow point, if that is, indeed, the case. I \nhope we do not, in focusing on a particular very narrow tragic issue \nand circumstance--and nobody is celebrating that tragedy--I hope we do \nnot lose focus of the broader issue of taxpayer funding of abortions \noverseas.\n  We can focus in on this very narrow point of view--and it is a tragic \ncircumstance, I will concede that to my colleague. Maybe we can \nnegotiate a regulatory change to address these important concerns if \nthese words do not do it. I think we are arguing semantics here. Let's \nnot lose sight of the fact, which is that this amendment would send \ntaxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is as if we are talking past each \nother. My friend made the case for me. He read the restriction which is \nthat no organization can attempt to alter the laws of their country. \nAnd so we are standing against people having their rights at self-\ndetermination. Can you imagine if we sent out a notice to our people, \nlet's say on both sides of the gun debate, and said to both sides: You \ncannot discuss this matter with your representatives. We could not do \nthat for 3 seconds. First, we would be run out of office on a rail. But \nwe are willing to be an imperial power and tell others in other \ncountries they cannot advocate on behalf of the people of their \ncountry.\n  The last point I will make is my friend keeps repeating the phrase \n``U.S. taxpayer funds.'' He is confusing the debate. There was an \noutright ban written in 1973 by Jesse Helms which has been upheld in \nthe Congress ever since that not a dime of U.S. taxpayer money could be \nused in any way, shape, or form to provide abortion. And there is \nanother law that says you cannot use U.S. taxpayer funds to lobby. So \nthose things are already set.\n  What we are talking about is an additional law put into place by the \nBush administration after it was off the books for 8 years which says \nforget about U.S. taxpayer money, we are telling nongovernmental \norganizations that to get that money, they cannot use their own funds \nin any way to provide abortion, to counsel women, to tell women their \noptions, or--and this is the case in point--even to lobby their \nlegislature to change laws, such as the one that put this child in \nprison who is the victim of incest. I do not understand how we can \nstand on that side of this issue.\n  I can give you 100 examples. I do not want to take the Senate's time \nto do that. The other case was in Uganda where the clinic was gagged \nand could not tell these girls where they could go to get a safe \nabortion to end a pregnancy forced on them by a gentleman--I should not \ncall him a gentleman--a man who impregnated three of his students, and \nthe clinic was scared to say anything, and these girls got illegal, \nwhat they call backyard abortions in that country and died.\n  Now, why do we want to stand on the side of the law that is resulting \nin girls going to jail when they are raped by a\n\n[[Page S3185]]\n\nrelative and girls dying from botched abortions because we put a gag on \nthe clinic? I hope this Senate will pass the Boxer-Snowe bipartisan \namendment that will send a signal to the world that we believe very \nstrongly in their rights to aggressively approach their government and \ntalk about laws that may need changing, their rights to look a woman or \na girl in the eye and say, look, regardless of what your religion is or \nwhat your feeling is, these are the options you have.\n  I do not think keeping women ignorant is a very liked policy, and \nanyone who votes for this global gag rule votes to keep the women of \nthe world ignorant. I hope my colleagues will vote for the Boxer-Snowe \namendment. I look forward to a successful vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators for this \ndebate. A vote will occur on it at a time in the future, probably in \nsequence with the 4:30 vote.\n  At this point, I have two points of important business. These are \namendments that have been agreed upon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 279\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 279.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                    (Purpose: To strike section 207)\n\n       On page 24, strike lines 1 through 5.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, this amendment strikes section 207. It was \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office as containing direct spending \nthat needed an offset. While there is some disagreement between the \nexecutive branch and Congressional Budget Office on the scoring, if \nsection 207 were not stricken, the legislation would be subject to a \nbudget point of order. I understand the staff of the Budget Committee \nand the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have come to an \nagreement, and this amendment removes the threat to the legislation. We \nknow the State Department considers section 207 important. We will do \nour best to provide these authorities, but we must do so in a way that \nis budget neutral.\n  For this reason, until a way can be found to resolve the scoring \ndifficulties, we ask unanimous consent that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 279) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 280\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator \nSchumer, I send an amendment to the desk. This is an amendment that \nrequires that foreign assistance be withheld from foreign countries \nthat owe parking fines in Washington, DC, or New York City. The amount \nwithheld would be 110 percent of the fines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Schumer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 280.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

What was the Senator's conditioning on the second degree?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The request is 36 minutes total for the amendment, 18 \nminutes per side, that concluding at the time of our voting sequence \nstarting at 4:30.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Including all amendments?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, with no second degree.\n  Mr. CRAIG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, the minority leader staff \ntells me we have to check with other Senators on this side who may want \nto speak to this amendment, but why do\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nwe not proceed. I would object for the moment, but hopefully I can \nresolve this very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CLARIFICATION OF PAYMENT TERMS UNDER TRADE \n                   SANCTIONS REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF \n                   2000.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 908(b)(1) of the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. \n     7207(b)(1)) is amended by inserting after subparagraph (B) \n     the following:\n       ``(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the term \n     `payment of cash in advance' means the payment by the \n     purchaser of an agricultural commodity or product and the \n     receipt of such payment by the seller prior to--\n       ``(i) the transfer of title of such commodity or product to \n     the purchaser; and\n       ``(ii) the release of control of such commodity or product \n     to the purchaser.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on February 22, 2005.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a second degree of \ntime certainty to the most important legislation of the Senator from \nMontana, S. 328, that was produced in bill form and now we hope can \nbecome an amendment to the State Department's authorization bill that \ndeals with agricultural export facilitation. I speak to that most \nimportantly because of the tremendously positive work that has been \ngoing on in agricultural exports between this country, our agricultural \nproducers, and the Nation of Cuba.\n  I am in complete agreement with the President when he said:\n\n       Open trade is not just an economic opportunity, it is a \n     moral imperative. When we negotiate for open markets, we are \n     providing new hope for the world's poor. And when we promote \n     open trade, we are promoting political freedom. Societies \n     that open to commerce across their borders will open to \n     democracy within their borders, not always immediately, and \n     not always smoothly, but in good time.\n\n  That was a quote in 2001. It is most appropriate today. Senator \nBaucus, myself, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, Senator Lugar, and 25 \nother Members of this Senate have grown increasingly frustrated with \nthe bureaucratic effort at the Department of Treasury literally to shut \ndown the intent of very important legislation that became law in 2000. \nThe Trade Sanctions Reform Act recognized a need and an opportunity to \nsell agricultural products to Cuba for cash, that we would not ask the \ntaxpayers of this country to facilitate. In fact, we would be very \nstrict and very narrow in those relationships with the nation of Cuba \nbecause of overwhelming interests in a variety of other areas at that \ntime, and it passed the Congress.\n  That became law. That law began to work. In the course of its \nworkings, Cuba grew from a trading partner that was the 226th largest \nagainst all of our trading partners to the 21st largest this past year. \nWe have produced and sold nearly $1 billion worth of agricultural \nproducts to Cuba since that law became operative in 2000. It has become \none part of a total of valuable tools that the agricultural community \nof this Nation uses in trade.\n  Nearly 34 States have sold products to Cuba and that clearly speaks \nabout the broad base of support that this legislation has.\n  Somehow and for some apparently very biased reason--let me be blunt--\nCold War bureaucrats in the Department of Treasury at OFAC decided, no, \nwe are going to change the law by regulation.\n  We are going to squeeze and push and deny, and as a result we will \ncollapse the ongoing trade with Cuba that is clearly within the law and \nwithin the Trade Sanctions Reform Act of 2000.\n  What we do with this amendment offered to the State Department \nauthorization bill, and my second-degree amendment, is very clear. We \nsimply restate the law, the intent of the law. We want OFAC to \nunderstand what Congress's intent was. We define what a cash payment in \nadvance is. We authorize the issuance of a general license for U.S. \nagricultural producers to travel to Cuba for the purpose of \nagricultural trade. We authorize direct cash payments to U.S. banks, \ncash payments. It is very important we understand that. We repeal \nsection 211 as it relates to the 1999 Omnibus Act, and trademarks, and \nwe clarify a variety of other issues.\n  What is most important, and for our colleagues who support us in this \neffort and support the agricultural community in our country's ability \nto sell to Cuba for cash, we say we are for all intents and purposes \nreinstating the intent of Congress as expressed in the 2000 law. That \nis what is important here. We do not believe it is the right or \nresponsibility of Treasury to change the rules or the name of the game \nor the intent of the law. That is why the Senator from Montana and I \nhave come to the floor, for that purpose. The Senator remains on the \nfloor and I know wants to express his concern.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, second my good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, and other \nSenators who have cosponsored this amendment. There are at the present \nmoment about 30 cosponsors of this amendment. It is bipartisan. I might \nsay there is tremendous interest in this legislation also in the other \nbody.\n  To review where we are, back in the year 2000, not too many years \nago, we in the Congress approved legislation called the Trade Sanctions \nReform and Export Enhancement Act, otherwise known as TSREEA. What was \nthe point of that legislation? It was legislation which authorized \ncash-in-advance food and medicine sales to Cuba. That is, the Congress \ncarved out a substantive area of food and agricultural sales to Cuba. \nIt did not provide a broad-brush authorization for trade with Cuba; \nrather, it narrowed it to food and to medicine for humanitarian \nreasons. It just made sense for the United States to be able to send \nits medicine and its food products, its agriculture, to Cuba. Clearly \nthis made a lot of sense. Food should never be used as a weapon, and \nsurely no dictator has ever missed a meal.\n  Second, big government has no business telling the U.S. farmers and \nranchers to whom they could sell their products, for a lot of reasons. \nOne is agriculture is facing such dire straits in many parts of our \ncountry. In addition, U.S. agriculture is facing a shrinking trade \nsurplus. It used to be agriculture products exported overseas were the \none big bright spot in the trade imbalance. That is no longer true. \nAgricultural programs are under tremendous pressure from budget cuts--\nmore so now than has been the case in the past.\n\n  We should be looking around for new markets for American products, \nnot\n\n[[Page S3187]]\n\ncutting out export markets for American agricultural products. Cuba \ncertainly presents a promising market for Montana and for American \nagriculture. Yet, unbelievably, the Treasury Department has recently \nissued a new rule. That rule makes it harder, it makes it much more \ndifficult, for U.S. farmers and ranchers to sell agricultural products \nto Cuba. It makes it much more difficult in spite of the intent of the \nlaw we passed in 2000.\n  This rule by Treasury requires Cuba to pay for goods before shipment \ninstead of before delivery, as was the case in the last 3 years after \nthe act was passed. For some reason, here in 2005, a few years after \nthe act has been in operation and working, the Treasury Department \npasses new regulations, just out of the blue, which make it much more \ndifficult for American farmers to sell their products to Cuba. If Cuba \npays for the goods while they are still on U.S. soil, these goods, \nunder this new rule, become Cuban assets, which make them vulnerable to \nseizure to satisfy unrelated claims.\n  What is the effect of that? That has a very chilling effect. Treasury \nsays it issued this rule as a ``clarification'' of the intent of \nCongress in the bill we passed in the year 2000. Let me be clear. My \ncolleagues and I did not vote for a bill to enhance exports to Cuba \nthat contained payment restrictions so severe as to render U.S. exports \nuncompetitive or worse. Clearly we did not pass a bill, we did not vote \nfor a bill which makes it more difficult to sell agricultural products \nto Cuba rather than less difficult, and this regulation makes it more \ndifficult. That was not the intent of Congress. We pass the laws. We \ndecide what the laws of the Nation should be. It was our intent that \nagricultural sales should proceed unimpeded on a cash basis to Cuba.\n  When Treasury proposed this rule, I and colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle in both Chambers made our point very clear that we did not \nintend this. It was not our intent to have this interpretation.\n  Why is this so important? Cuba, the largest island in the Caribbean, \nwas worth $400 million to U.S. agriculture exporters in the year 2004. \nSince 2001, Cuba has purchased more than $800 million in agricultural \nproducts from 35 States in our Nation, making that island the 25th \nlargest export market for agricultural products.\n  A year and a half ago, I led a trade mission to Cuba, and I walked \naway with what I think is a pretty good deal for my State of Montana: \n$10 billion in agricultural products on a cash basis; and the fact is \nthey bought $10.4 million of agricultural products from my State of \nMontana. I went back last December and signed a new agreement, this \ntime worth $15 million for Montana agricultural products. \nUnfortunately, that agreement is now in jeopardy because of the new \nrule.\n  In the interim, Treasury passed this new rule. It also applied this \nnew rule even to sales completed months earlier on a retroactive basis, \nwhich is totally unfair. The rule is wrong in the first place. It makes \nit doubly wrong when it is retroactive. We have $3 million worth of \nwheat and pea shipments lined up, and now they have to be renegotiated \nor abandoned because of this Treasury rule. That is wrong, just dead \nwrong. I, in this body, have worked hard to sell agricultural products \nto Cuba and will not stand idly by while Government bureaucrats try to \nundo all that hard work.\n\n  First, this reverses that Treasury rule and clarifies the intent of \nCongress for Cuba to pay cash for delivery of U.S. goods before \ndelivery, not before shipment. This will ensure that cash sales \ncontinue as they have without interruption.\n  Second, the amendment gives general license to producers and port \nauthorities to travel to Cuba whenever they have agreements to \nnegotiate. This is a big point. Very often, the United States makes it \nvery difficult with a huge amount of bureaucracy and paperwork to go \nthrough when the American agricultural exporter wants to go to Cuba to \nnegotiate an agreement. It makes it difficult to do so if we can't go \nto Cuba to put the deal together.\n  Third, it requires greater transparency in visa processing for the \nCuban buyers and inspectors who have legitimate itineraries in the \nUnited States related to the sale or inspection of TSREEA-authorized \nproducts.\n  Again, if a State has sales to Cuba, it only makes sense if the State \nDepartment can allow a representative for the Government of Cuba or the \nrepresentative of agriculture, the purchaser, to come visit that State \nto see what products that State has in mind. So far the Government is \nmaking it very difficult for that to happen.\n  Fourth, this authorizes direct banking relations for authorized \nagricultural sales only. We are not talking about any other product. We \nare talking just about authorized agriculture sales--direct banking \nrelations which would have the effect that U.S. banks can deal directly \non this matter rather than as currently is the case where they would \nhave to go through a third party, where European banks are making money \noff the U.S. agricultural sales.\n  Finally, this amendment repeals an obscure trademark law that \nbenefits no U.S. company, but puts at risk thousands of U.S. \ntrademarks, including those branded food products sold to Cuba in the \npast 3 years. Section 211's supporters say it protects confiscated \ntrademarks but in fact makes very clear no government--not even Fidel \nCastro's--can expropriate legally registered trademark rights. It is \nimpossible to do. That is why this provision must be enacted.\n  The truth is, section 211 was enacted to interfere in an ongoing rum \nlabel dispute. The fight is not my concern. But what concerns me is \nunless we fully repeal section 211, Cuba has the right, under \ninternational trademark law, to deny U.S. trademarks reciprocal \nrecognition. That does not make any sense.\n  In conclusion, I am here to urge us to pass this amendment. It allows \nAmerican farmers and ranchers a break. More importantly, let them do \nwhat we intended them to do when we passed that law in the year 2000. \nLet us send a message to Treasury that when we pass laws, we mean it. \nIt is not for Treasury. They are the executive branch, and they are \nsupposed to implement the laws, not make new laws, which in effect \nTreasury is doing by changing its regulations. They are being totally \nirresponsible. There comes a time when, frankly, it is up to us to put \na stop to it and say this is not right and we are going to change it.\n  I see many of my friends on the floor. I thank my good friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Dorgan, who cosponsored this amendment.\n  I say also that I support the trade amendment offered by Senator \nCraig, a perfecting amendment which will help implement the major \nunderlying amendment which I described.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we under a time agreement at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments about \nthis, and first credit my colleagues Senator Craig, Senator Baucus, and \nmany other colleagues who have worked so hard on this. Their leadership \nis especially appreciated.\n  Go back 5 years to the year 2000 when I, then-Senator John Ashcroft, \nand my colleagues Senators Craig, Baucus, and others passed an \namendment here in the Senate that became law. The amendment we offered \nwhich became law said that American farmers could sell food into the \ncountry of Cuba as long as Cuba paid cash for that food. Since that \ntime, we have sold over $1 billion worth of agricultural commodities \ninto Cuba. When we debated that 5 years ago, I was on the floor of the \nSenate saying I think it is almost immoral for any country to use food \nas a weapon. Food ought not be a weapon in foreign policy.\n  Does anybody here think that for 40 years when we prevented the sale \nof food to Cuba we injured Fidel Castro? Does anybody believe Fidel \nCastro missed breakfast, or lunch, or supper, or dinner, because of our \nembargo on food, because we decided to use food as a weapon? It didn't \nhurt Fidel Castro. When we use food as a weapon, it hurts hungry, sick, \nand poor people. That is what happens.\n  One day not too long ago--a couple of years ago--22 train carloads of \ndried feeds left the State of North Dakota, my home State, to go from \nour farms\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\nto Cuba to be fed to the Cuban people. Cuba paid cash for it. It was \nthe first shipment in 42 years.\n\n  We have people who never liked that law; didn't like the fact that \nCongress passed that law; still want to use food as a weapon. What has \nhappened is the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control \nhas decided to illegally, in my judgment, redetermine how they \ninterpret that force of law that requires cash payment for food. \nNormally, when you buy something, when they give you the product, you \npay cash and they give you the product. That is the way it is. You pay \nthe money, they give you the product.\n  What the Department of Treasury has decided in OFAC is that the \nCubans would have to pay for this. By the way, they paid cash through a \nEuropean bank because they can't use a U.S. banking institution. They \nhave to pay for it before that shipment even leaves the local country \nelevator. It dramatically changes the circumstances of being able to \nsell and be competitive. They are doing it for one reason, because \nthose who did this don't want American farmers to sell food into the \nCuban marketplace. The Canadians sell into the Cuban marketplace. The \nEuropeans do. But they want to go back to the good old days when the \nAmerican farmers were paying the cost of an embargo. They are dead \nwrong.\n  It is interesting. We are told repeatedly and have been told for \nyears that the way to move Communist countries into the mainstream \ntoward democratic reform is through trade and travel. I have been to \nthe country of China; I have been to Vietnam--both Communist countries. \nWe encourage trade and travel with Communist countries, China and \nVietnam. But when it comes to Cuba, a Communist country headed by Fidel \nCastro, who admittedly keeps sticking his finger into our country's \neye--I understand that. It is not about Fidel Castro. It is about our \nfarmers being able to sell food into the Cuban marketplace. When it \ncomes to Cuba and Castro, he has lived through 10 Presidents and over \n40 years of an embargo.\n  The fact is this amendment is necessary in order to stop the Treasury \nfrom doing something that the Congressional Research Service says they \ndo not think is legal.\n  Let me make another couple of comments that relate more generally to \na related issue. The Office of Foreign Asset Control is an agency down \nin Treasury that is supposed to be tracking money supporting terrorism. \nThat money supporting terrorism is to be intercepted by OFAC in their \ninvestigations, trying to figure out who is supporting Osama bin Laden, \nand how do we shut down their funding. Guess what. This little agency, \nwhich has 21 people, triple the number of people who are working on \nOsama bin Laden's funding supply, is trying to figure out how they shut \ndown trade and travel to Cuba. They are investigating American citizens \nwho are under suspicion of having taken a vacation in Cuba without a \nlicense.\n  I have a picture of a young woman I have shown on the floor of the \nSenate many times. Her transgression was she went to Cuba to pass out \nfree Bibles on the streets of Cuba and OFAC tracked her down and fined \nher $10,000.\n  Trade and travel are two related issues that I believe would work \nwith Cuba, as they work with China and Vietnam. I believe the Communist \ncountries I have described, China and Vietnam as examples, have moved \ntoward more democratic reforms, not completely, but as a result of our \npolicy called engagement, travel, and trade.\n  With respect to Cuba, we have had this some 40-plus years embargo \nthat simply hasn't worked. But the piece of the embargo, the piece of \nthat issue my colleagues Senator Craig and Senator Baucus and I and \nothers now want to address is to correct something that is happening \ndown at the Treasury Department that we believe misinterprets current \nlaw to correct something the Congressional Research Service says is \nbeing done which they believe is not legal. We will find any way we can \nto force this correction.\n  My colleagues have described--I shall not go into any greater \ndetail--the provisions. It allows generally visas for agricultural \nsales to Cuba. If you are going to sell and have a trade relationship, \nyou have to go there and talk about what you have to sell. It would \nexpress the sense of Congress that we should issue visas to Cubans who \nwant to buy U.S. agricultural goods, and want to come here. They have \nsystematically refused to give visas to some of these top food-buying \nCubans who would come to this country to purchase food. It also fixes \npayment and advance issues and resolves those kinds of problems that \nhave arisen in recent months with the new ruling by OFAC.\n  One final point: The current Secretary of the Treasury knows, as did \nthe previous Secretary of the Treasury, that what is happening is \ngoofy; totally without good sense. They know that.\n  I had a hearing one day when I was chairing a subcommittee, and \nTreasury Secretary O'Neill was there. I asked him about four or five \ntimes. He didn't answer. I knew why he wouldn't answer; it was because \nhe would get in trouble if he did. But about the fifth or sixth time I \nasked the question--I knew he would eventually answer--he finally \nanswered candidly. I said, Wouldn't you, if you had the choice, rather \nthan track people suspected of vacationing in Cuba, rather than trying \nto shut down agricultural trade, if you had the choice, use your assets \nin OFAC to track terrorist money and shut down terrorism?\n  He finally said, of course. The next day he was chastised publicly by \nthe White House for saying that. We do not get that kind of answer out \nof anyone in the administration anymore.\n  This is very simple. It is not a partisan issue. It is the expression \nof Congress, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats, that we \nought not use food as a weapon. It is immoral. Farmers should not the \npay the cost of this country's foreign policy. It makes no sense to \nallow the Treasury Department to misinterpret law and to try to shut \ndown the ability of United States farmers to sell food to Cuba.\n  To close where I began, let me say again, these policies have never \nhurt Fidel Castro. He has never missed a meal. It hurts poor people, \nhungry people, and sick people in Cuba, and it hurts American farmers. \nThe policymakers who do this know that, they know both of those \ncircumstances and they do it, in my judgment, to perpetuate a political \nadvantage they think exists somewhere in about two States in our \ncountry. I think they are wrong.\n  On behalf of this country's farmers and on behalf of the people in \nCuba who would buy and who would need that food, I believe we ought to \npass this amendment to the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 273, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an amendment \nnumbered 273, previously agreed to, be modified with language that is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 273), as modified, was agreed to as follows:\n\n       On page 12, strike lines 16 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) Availability of funds.--\n       (A) Fiscal year 2006.--Fifteen percent of the funds \n     appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2006 \n     are authorized to remain available until September 30, 2007.\n       (B) Fiscal year 2007.--Fifteen percent of the funds \n     appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2007 \n     are authorized to remain available until September 30, 2008.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that following \nthe vote at 4:45 on the resolution regarding Pope John Paul II, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment; provided \nfurther that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3189]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will take the time before the vote to \nrise in support of the Craig-Baucus amendment. I am a cosponsor of S. \n328, the bill on which the amendment is based. I appreciate the views \nof the Senators on both sides of the Cuban embargo issue. In the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, concerned Senators have offered \nconstructive ideas on how to approach Cuba with the goal of \ntransforming that island into a democracy, even as Senators disagree on \ninterim policy steps.\n  My view is within the defined limits of Trade Sanctions Reform and \nExport Enhancement Act of 2000, United States businesses and farmers \nshould be able to sell products to Cuba. In the interest of expanding \nopportunities for U.S. agriculture, 5 years ago Congress enacted this \nlaw. It exempts from the trade embargo on Cuba commercial sales of \nagricultural and medical products and allows only for cash sales. No \ncredit or subsidies to the Cuban Government are allowed.\n  This law has provided a new market for our farmers and ranchers. The \nAmerican Farm Bureau has reported that since the passage of the bill, \nUnited States farmers have sold approximately $800 million in \nagricultural products to Cuba. Exports to Cuba have more than doubled \nsince 2002, reaching approximately $400 million in 2004. Growth in the \nCuban market has become especially important as the United States \nagricultural trade surplus has narrowed over the last 2 years.\n  Recently, the Bush administration issued a clarification to our Cuban \nexport policy which changed the payment terms of cash sales to Cuba. \nThe Treasury Department rule will make it more difficult to sell \nagricultural products to Cuba.\n  The amendment would reverse the Treasury rule by returning it to the \nstatus quo payment terms. That has worked well since 2001. It also \nwould cut some of the redtape that makes United States producers less \ncompetitive in the Cuban market.\n  Expanding international markets in our hemisphere and the world will \nhave a positive impact on the lives of Americans. All sectors, \nespecially American agricultural, benefit from the opportunity to sell \nproducts to other nations that create jobs in the United States. My \nhome state of Indiana is a world leader in agricultural production and \nmanufacturing. If we hope to sustain our economic strength in the 21st \ncentury, we must participate in an expanding global economy. We must \naggressively pursue opportunities in new markets and we must keep our \ncompetitive advantage and sell our products worldwide.\n  As a Senator, I worked in the Congress to support trade and economic \npolicies that I believe are in the best long-term interests of our \nNation. Constricting agricultural sales to Cuba would have little or no \neffect on the Cuban regime, particularly since the rest of the world \ndoes not participate in our embargo. It would, however, limit the \nability of our farmers and our ranchers to sell their products abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Craig-Baucus amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

It is very important to make sure women around \nthe world are given the health care they deserve. Since 1973, the Helms \namendment has been in place. That means no American funds can ever be \nused for anything to do with abortion. But the global gag rule which we \nare trying to overturn goes much further. It says nonprofit \norganizations overseas cannot use their own money to help a\n\n[[Page S3190]]\n\nwoman by giving her options, by giving her a referral. It even says a \nnongovernmental organization would lose all their USAID funding if they \nadvocated to change a very restrictive law in their own country. This \nis clearly unconstitutional if it were applied here in America.\n  With our men and women dying around the world for freedom, I do not \nthink we should say there should be no freedom of speech in these \ncountries. We overturned this law many times. I hope we will do it \nagain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. This is well-\nplowed ground. We have been around this issue since 1984, with Ronald \nReagan putting this policy in place. The Boxer amendment overturns that \npolicy. This is about taxpayer funding of abortion overseas.\n  We can separate the issue of abortion here altogether and say we are \nnot going to talk about that, but this is taxpayer dollars used to \nsupport organizations supporting abortion overseas. We talk about \ndifferent semantics. That is what it does. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment. Clearly, 70-plus percent of the American public \nwould be against that. Let's work on foreign policy issues and funding \nof things on which we have great unity, not ones on which we are \ndivided.\n  I respectfully urge a vote against the amendment of my colleague, \nSenator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

China's anti-succession law is destabilizing to regional \n     peace and stability, and is therefore of grave concern to the \n     United States;\n       2. The United States Government should employ all \n     diplomatic means to encourage the repeal of that law so the \n     regional stability can be restored;\n       3. The United States Government should continue to speak \n     out with respect to China's human rights practices and \n     advocate the release from detention of all political and \n     human rights activists;\n       4. The United States Government should more effectively \n     promote United States economic and trade interests by \n     insisting that the People's Republic of China lives up to its \n     international trade obligations to respect and safeguard U.S. \n     intellectual property rights and cease artificially pegging \n     its currency exchange rates; and\n       5. The United States Government should undertake a \n     comprehensive review of the implications of China's growing \n     international economic and political influence that are \n     byproducts of its expanding network of trade agreements, its \n     aggressive shipbuilding programs, its efforts to cement \n     scientific and technological cooperation arrangements, and \n     secure additional oil and gas contracts; and should determine \n     what steps should be taken to safeguard the U.S. industrial \n     base and maintain and enhance United States economic \n     competitiveness and political interests.\n\n  Mr. DODD.

We would be prepared to discuss it in the morning, \nbut we will be happy to have it set aside for other business on this \nlegislation. I want to say also it is not our intention in any way to \ndelay this legislation. It is a very important amendment to us and I \nthink to the Senate.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, I thank Senator Lugar and \nSenator Biden, in particular, for working this arrangement out with \nSenator Dorgan and me. We think this is a waste of money. We are \nanxious to talk about it tomorrow after folks have had a chance, \novernight, to look at it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the chance to make these brief \nremarks.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it appears there are a couple of minutes \nbefore we move on. I will debate the amendment, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, more extensively in the morning. I will not \ntake a lot of time. But as long as the floor was available, I wanted to \nindicate that the amendment we just laid down deals with TV Marti.\n  We fund broadcasts into Cuba on something called Radio Marti which \nare very effective. The Cuban people listen to Radio Marti. Of course, \nthey can listen to Miami radio stations as well. But we also fund \nsomething called TV Marti, and we have done it for years. The \nGovernment of Cuba, of Fidel Castro, jams the signals. We have Fat \nAlbert, an aerostat balloon up there thousands of feet in the air, and \nthe American taxpayer is paying for a fancy studio down on the ground. \nAnd up through this cable to Fat Albert we actually send signals into \nCuba, television signals that the Cuban people can't see. \nTraditionally, they have been broadcast from 3 to 8 in the morning, and \nthey are systematically jammed.\n  We have been spending about $10 to $12 million a year, and we have \nbeen doing it for years. We have spent almost $200 million doing it. \nNow the President wants to double the funding. There is something \ncalled waste, fraud, and abuse. I am not exactly sure where this fits, \nbut it is one of the three. It fits with something else called \nstupidity.\n  We ought not continue to pay to send television signals to a country \nthat can't receive them or television signals to people who can't see \nthem because the Government is jamming them. Let me say that the Acting \nDirector of the International Broadcasting Bureau, Mr. Brian Coniff, \ntestified before the House Subcommittee on International Operations and \nHuman Rights.\n  He said: Transmission to China has been consistently jammed by the \nCuban Government. The American official said that. This transmission of \ntelevision signals has been systematically jammed by the Cuban \nGovernment. We don't have any official evidence that the audience has \nincreased due to broadcast schedule change. They did have some \nanecdotal evidence that just a smattering of Cubans would be able to \nspot the signal that we broadcast into Cuba. Before the Castro \ngovernment caught the signal and jammed it, they would get a minute or \ntwo. So that is a sighting. That is a Cuban who was able to see the \nsignal of TV Marti. They finally stopped measuring that because the \naudience was so miniscule as to be almost zero.\n  Finally their argument was, the same official says: TV Marti, though \njammed, is well positioned to be an important instrument of U.S. \nforeign policy should a crisis occur on the island.\n  So there we are. We have big, old Fat Albert up there, an aerostat \nballoon sending signals to the Cuban people they can't see. We spend \n$10, $12 million a year on something we don't have. And now the \nPresident says we should double that. And do you know how we are going \nto do it? A balloon isn't enough and a balloon causes problems because \nthe balloon got off of its aerostat mooring and went over the \nEverglades, and we had people on grappling hooks and ladders trying to \ntame the balloon that was broadcasting signals into Cuba. So now they \nwant to buy an airplane.\n  If this were a television show, it would be a comedy. Now they want \nto buy an airplane for $8 million to send signals into Cuba that they \ncan't receive. All of this would be funny were it not for the fact that \nthis is paid for by American taxpayers. If ever there was a case of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in government spending, it is this.\n\n  It is not partisan. There is no Democratic waste or Republican waste. \nThere is just plain old waste. It seems to me when you see something \nthat doesn't work, isn't needed, shouldn't be done and doesn't function \nat all, maybe it is time for all of us to say: This we can get rid of.\n  This is not the largest amendment offered this year. It is roughly \n$20, $21 million. But it saves money; $21 million is a lot of money in \nmy hometown. It saves the taxpayers money and stops doing something \nthat has always been completely ineffective.\n  We broadcast in Radio Marti. That is effective. The Cubans listen to \nit. They can listen to commercial stations from Miami for that matter. \nBut Television Marti has never worked because the Castro government \nsystematically jams it. So we send signals no one can receive.\n  This amendment, I hope, should be simple enough. I know there will be \nsome who may have an apoplectic seizure about my offering this \namendment because there are a couple of States where the Cuban vote is \nvery important and there are some in the Cuban community who think we \nare doing something very important and very worthy if we send signals \nfrom this country that can't be seen by the Cuban people. That escapes \nsome notion of mine that would represent logical thinking. But \nnonetheless there may be some who will feel that way.\n  We will have a broader discussion of this tomorrow. I support many of \nthe broadcasting programs we have. Many have been very effective. But \nthis is pure, solid, thoughtless waste. It is time for this Congress to \ntake a stand to shut this spending down.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden\n\n[[Page S3192]]\n\nbe recognized in order to offer a substitute amendment to the language \nproposed to be stricken; provided further that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided for debate this evening; provided further that at 10 \na.m. tomorrow, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Biden \namendment, with no amendments in order to the Biden amendment prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the Lugar amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 286 in lieu of the language proposed to be stricken \n     by amendment No. 266.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a second degree amendment related to the United \n States share of assessment for United Nations Peacekeeping operations)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken, insert the \n     following:\n       ``Section 404(b)(2)(B) of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (P.L. 103-236) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) For assessments made during calendar years 2005, \n     2006, and 2007, 27.1 percent.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The amendment I have \nsent to the desk does a simple thing. It maintains the current cap on \nthe amount that the United States contributes to the United Nations \npeacekeeping missions. It keeps it at 27.1 percent for the next 2 \nyears.\n  For those who may be watching, they may wonder what that is all \nabout. When a peacekeeping mission gets sent overseas, authorized by \nthe United Nations, the countries in question have a prior assessment \nas to how much they are going to pay, usually based on the size of \ntheir countries and the size of their economies, and it has been agreed \nto by us that the appropriate figure for the United States to chip in \nis 27.1 percent. So if it costs $1 million for peacekeeping, our share \nwould be $271,000, and so on.\n  Let me briefly explain the history of the law and what this does to \nthe Lugar amendment.\n  In 1994, Congress unilaterally limited what we would pay for the \npeacekeeping endeavors of the United Nations. We said we will no longer \npay any more than 25 percent. I believe at the time we were paying 31 \npercent. That is what the previous administrations had agreed to. That \nis what the U.N. was assessing us, 31 percent. We said in 1994: No, no, \nwe are not going to pay any more than 25 percent.\n  What happened was, we never negotiated that rate with the United \nNations. We unilaterally stated that. We did not go back to the U.N. \nand say: Look, we want to reconfigure how much we are paying. We want \nto go down from 31 percent, which we had been paying, to 25 percent. It \nnever occurred, and the U.N. continued to bill us at 31 percent. So if \na peacekeeping mission was $1 million--and none are as cheap as $1 \nmillion--we were getting billed $310,000 and we only agreed to pay \n$250,000. So we were in arrears of $60,000.\n  The bill that my former colleague Jesse Helms and I did in the late \n1990s to clear up what the United States allegedly owed--everybody used \nto call it dues, but it was more than dues. This peacekeeping is part \nof what people euphemistically refer to as dues. The accumulated \nobligation that we owed to the United Nations, although somewhat in \ndispute, was a little over $1 billion.\n  Senator Helms, and many others, when he was chairman of the \ncommittee, argued that we should not be paying any of this; we did not \nowe any of these arrears. Senator Helms, after conferring with his \ntrusted aide who has passed away, the Staff Director for the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Admiral Bud Nance, when he realized a lot of this \nwas owed to some of our friends such as Great Britain, Europe, and \nothers, he said I did not realize that; OK, we should pay that amount \nwe owe. But in the process Senator Helms, Senator Lugar, myself, and \nmany others also thought there should be reforms that should take place \nin the United Nations. In addition to settling this arrears question, \nwe wrote a much larger bill that required some changes and commitments \non the part of the United Nations as well. In the process of doing \nthat, Senator Helms agreed and the Helms-Biden legislation said we \nwould only pay at 25 percent.\n  The Ambassador to the United Nations at the time was Richard \nHolbrooke. Richard Holbrooke, who was in negotiation with the United \nNations to try to get them to agree that we would only pay 25 percent \nand that they would agree with that beyond us unilaterally asserting \nit, worked out an agreement that said the United Nations agreed we \nwould only pay 27 percent. I know what I am talking about sounds \narcane, but it is real money. Senator Helms and I said: OK, close \nenough. And we agreed to amend the Helms-Biden law to let these \narrearage payments flow.\n  What we never did was repeal the underlying law that was passed in \nthe Congress, signed by the President in 1994, that said we would pay \nno more than 25 percent. The underlying law in 1994 was never repealed.\n  In 2002, because these arrearages are running up again, the \ndifference between 25 percent and what the U.N. thought we owed and \nwhat we had been paying at the 27 percent, we put in a provision in the \nlaw, a 3-year amendment that amended the 1994 law putting a ceiling on \nour payments at 27, not 25, percent through the year 2004.\n  Last year, we came up against this issue again, and the \nAppropriations Committee, because we were unable to get our bill \npassed, extended the 27-percent number through calendar year 2005. So \nif nothing else is done now, the 1994 law kicks back in, and our \nmaximum payment drops from 27 percent to 25 percent, and we are back in \nthe same old tangle of building up arrearages of whatever the 2-percent \ndifference would be every year that we thought we solved initially. So \nwe need to address this issue. We do not want to get into this fight \nagain.\n  The U.N. peacekeepers perform critical functions in the area of \nconflict and instability around the world. They monitor cease-fires, \nhuman rights conditions, clearing minefields, disarming combatants, \nproviding humanitarian assistance, and organizing and observing \nelections, which all costs money.\n  The U.N. peacekeeping missions have become increasingly critical in \nthe past year as authorizing missions that support U.S. policy \nobjectives for stabilization in Burundi, Haiti, and other places, as \nwell as an operation to Sudan which will begin to deploy in the \nupcoming weeks.\n  Through missions such as these, the United States contributes to \ninternational peace and stability while sharing the cost of doing so \nwith other nations. Therefore, it is my view that we need to continue \nto pay our U.N. peacekeeping bill, the one negotiated by Holbrooke, \nparticularly at this point in time when we are asking for and need U.N. \ncooperation on issues such as democracy building in Iraq, post-tsunami \ndisaster relief in Indonesia, and other areas.\n  I remind my colleagues, and I am in no way being critical of my \nchairman, the bill we reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee \ncorrected the problem. It said we are lifting the 25-percent cap passed \nin 1994, and we are doing it permanently. What the chairman of the \ncommittee is doing is introducing an amendment saying: I guess, on \nsecond thought, I do not like that idea very much. I want to now go \nback and amend what passed 18 to 0 and say we are going back to the 25-\npercent level.\n  I know that is complicated for all the Members, but the bottom line \nis my amendment does what the President's budget request proposed. I \nwant to do it permanently, but the President said keep it at 27 percent \nfor another 2 years. That is what the President requested. That is what \nI am attempting to amend the Lugar amendment with. If I prevail, the \nPresident's position prevails. We no longer go in arrearages, and we \nput off another 2 years reckoning with the underlying problem.\n\n[[Page S3193]]\n\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is in the Chamber. With the \npermission of the Senator from Indiana, I would be happy to yield to \nhim on this point. There is a time agreement. I do not know how much of \nmy time I have used, but I am sure we could accommodate the Senator for \nthe time he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise in very strong \nsupport of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware. I do it out of respect for his past efforts in addressing \nthis issue, along with Senator Helms. I have to confess that, at the \ntime, I thought we should pay all of our arrearages without those \nconditions. We had a very difficult situation in the U.N., but in the \nend, the situation was negotiated out and an agreement was reached on \nthe 27 percent. So as long as we pay that amount, we are not falling \ninto arrears.\n  If we drop the 27 percent down to 25 percent, as I understand the \namendment of the chairman of the committee would do, we immediately \nthrow ourselves back into a situation where we start building up \narrears. In effect, we end up going back on an agreement that was \nreached after very intense negotiations with the U.N., as I recall, led \nby Ambassador Holbrooke at the time.\n  Interestingly enough, the current administration, the Bush \nadministration, as I understand it, is supportive of the position that \nthe Senator from Delaware is offering with this amendment. This \namendment is consistent with what the administration has sought in \nterms of extending the 27-percent cap.\n  Now, the bill as it came out of the committee extended that cap \npermanently. This amendment would extend it for 2 years. I understand \nthat is the administration's position. Given all of that and the \nimportance of this, I would hope that the chairman of the committee \nwould find it within his reasonable judgment to accept this amendment. \nI do not think we ought to be having an intense division over this \nbecause it seems to me it makes extraordinarily good sense to do this \namendment. Earlier, we imposed a unilateral cap. It did not work. We \nhad very complicated relationships. We were able to work that out. We \nwere able to pay off our arrears.\n  Our influence is going to be diminished in any international body if \nwe are sitting at the table and our representative is in a position \nwhere the United States is in arrears to these very institutions that \nwe helped to found and establish and to make a success over the years.\n\n  In fact, we are going to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the \nfounding of the United Nations this year. So it seems to me that is a \nvery sensible amendment. It does pull back a bit from what was in the \ncommittee-reported bill, from a permanent 27 percent cap to a 2-year \nextension, which conforms to the administration's position. But to go \ndown to 25 percent, as the underlying amendment proposes, would simply \nrecreate all of the difficulties we previously encountered and \npreviously went through.\n  In a sense, I appeal to the chairman of the committee to see the \nwisdom in the amendment offered by the Senator from Delaware as a very \nreasonable, positive, and constructive way in which to address this \nissue.\n  So I very much hope he will find it possible to accept the amendment \nof the Senator from Delaware as we proceed in trying to move this bill \nthrough the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The time of the Senator from \nDelaware has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the distinguished Senators from Delaware \nand Maryland pointed out, and certainly Senator Biden was very heavily \ninvolved in the Helms-Biden legislation of 1999, that legislation which \ncame after considerable argument in the committee and in the Senate, \nperhaps in the country, about what our fair share ought to be, the \nHelms-Biden decision was that the U.S. share of peacekeeping duties \nwould decline to 25 percent of the world total. That still remains the \nlaw and important goal of U.S. policy toward the United Nations, at \nleast for many Senators.\n  Expression has been made tonight that perhaps our Nation ought to be \nmore generous, and that could very well be the result of negotiations \nwith the United Nations, but the intent, at least, of the amendment \nthat I offered earlier in the day would strike section 401, which \nestablished a permanent cap of 27.1 percent. Senator Biden's substitute \nchanges that permanent idea to a 2-year cap of 27.1 so that perhaps \npragmatically there is some room and time to come to some agreement \neither up or down from that point.\n  I simply observe that this issue, long before Senator Helms and \nSenator Biden reached a bipartisan compromise in 1999, exercised strong \nfeelings on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate very much the \nsentiment of the Senators who wish to preserve the 27.1 cap. As I \npointed out earlier in the day, I believe that we ought to pay our \ndues.\n  Furthermore, I believe the United States has obligations of a \nhumanitarian sort, quite apart from the pragmatic aspects of \npeacekeeping, which are important. Nevertheless, my hope had been that \nby in essence setting aside the issue out of this bill that we would \ngive the U.S. negotiators the most leverage possible to obtain whatever \nour goals and objectives may be. I think there may be some ambivalence \nas to what those goals are. It may be ambivalence of a generous sort; \nnamely, given all of the problems occurring in the world, we may wish \nto take on more. On the other hand, I would observe, as certain other \nSenators have, that the United Nations is in the process now of a great \ndeal of reform thinking.\n  The Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has suggested very substantial \nreforms. We are about to have a hearing on the nominee for our \ncountry's representative at the United Nations, John Bolton. I am \ncertain many Senators on the committee will question Secretary Bolton \non his ideas about reform and how he could be effective in bringing \nabout a stronger United Nations and what the correct presence ought to \nbe and what the correct leadership ought to be. Peacekeeping ought to \nbe a part of that negotiation.\n  I would further observe that in the coming weeks Congress will have \nfurther opportunities to work with President Bush and his \nadministration to craft the most effective means of reducing the U.S. \nshare of assessments or increasing them, as may be our preference. I \nbelieve this is an issue in which further consultation with the \nexecutive branch is desirable.\n  For the moment, I appreciate that Senators will continue to have \nstrong feelings about the United Nations generally, as well as our \ndegree of participation financially and otherwise. That has been the \nnature of several debates over the years, and each time one of our \nauthorization bills comes to the floor, this issue arises in one form \nor another. Nevertheless, I will oppose the Biden amendment with the \nrecognition that, as a substitute, if it is adopted, it will be \nlanguage that I hope at least goes to final passage of this \nlegislation.\n  If the Senator's substitute is not adopted, then he has assured me \nthat by voice vote we will adopt the amendment I offered earlier on and \nproceed on to other considerations.\n  I hope the Senate will adopt my point of view because I believe it \noffers more latitude for our administration and offers, perhaps, a more \nconstructive avenue for reform of the United Nations and perhaps some \nleverage for both. In any event, I appreciate the sincerity of the \ndebate, the importance of the issue, the recognition of the history of \nthis debate over several years of time, and at least the resolve that \ntonight is the point at which I think we must make a decision.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I realize I have no more time. I ask unanimous consent for \n2 additional minutes off the time of the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield the Senator 2 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, necessarily, the \nadministration has not asked for any latitude. The administration is \nquite clear. They came up and said there is nothing we are trying to \nnegotiate on 27 percent for dues. They didn't ask for that. Speaking to \nthe Secretary of State, I asked her\n\n[[Page S3194]]\n\nabout Assistant Secretary Bolton, nominee for the United Nations post. \nShe assured me he shares the administration's view. The \nadministration's view was sent to me in writing. It said we ask you to \nextend for 2 more years at the 27-percent number. There may be \nnegotiation in the future. But as recently as an hour ago--although \nthis was not the subject matter, in my discussions with the Secretary \nof State--no reference was made by me to anyone in the administration \nthat they were desirous of having a stronger negotiation in hand by \nkeeping this at 25 percent.\n  So it may turn out to be that. The administration's statement says--\nthis is Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and \nBudget, date April 5, 2005:\n\n       Section 401 makes permanent the 27.1 percent United Nations \n     peacekeeping rate, which is not consistent with the \n     Administration's request for a two year extension.\n\n  So they are asking for a 2-year extension. They didn't want to make \nit permanent, but they asked for 2 years. That is the only point I want \nto make.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What does the Senator's amendment do?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My amendment does exactly what the administration asks. I \nthank the Senator for the additional 2 minutes.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Tomorrow the vote is set for 10, and I believe \nthe Senator from Delaware will have 2 or 3 minutes before the vote?\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor. I see our friends are on the \nfloor to debate another substantive issue, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will conclude at least my portion of the debate by \nsaying I recognize the Senator from Delaware does visit and works \ncarefully with our administration. I appreciate that. I think it is \nimportant that America present as united a voice and face to the world \nas we can. I would just observe, pragmatically, that the administration \nin my judgment would like to have some latitude on an issue that has \ndivided the Senate as well as the country for some time.\n  I don't think this is a monumental subject. I think it is one that, \nclearly, constructive people can resolve. My hope is we can simply \nstrike the peacekeeping issue from the bill so that latitude is \navailable for whatever reform, reconstruction, and debate the \nadministration reformers may wish to have at the U.N. in the coming \nmonths.\n  Having said this, I appreciate Senators staying with this debate. We \nunderstand another will be on the way and there will be a short debate \non this issue at 10 o'clock or thereabouts tomorrow, and then a vote on \nthat issue before we retire to see the distinguished leader from \nUkraine.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for S. 600, \nthe State Department and Foreign Assistance Authorization bill. I \ncommend Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden for their efforts to make the \nauthorizing role of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee real again, \nand to thank all of my colleagues on the committee for their hard work \non this bill, which represents a strong bipartisan consensus in favor \nof energetic, engaged diplomacy.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill contains a number of \nprovisions that I authored, including a provision emphasizing the \nimportance of supporting press freedom in Ethiopia. Many of my \ncolleagues may be aware of the Government of Ethiopia's recent \ntroubling decision to expel representatives of the National Democratic \nInstitute, the International Republican Institute, and the \nInternational Foundation for Election Systems from the country in the \nlead-up to the May elections. But I suspect fewer people know about the \nEthiopian Government's well-established pattern of suppressing the \nindependent press. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, \n``in the run-up to 2005 elections, the ruling Ethiopian People's \nRevolutionary Democratic Front came under increasing criticism from \nlocal journalists and international media organizations for its \nantagonism toward the country's private press. Authorities continued to \nimprison journalists for their reporting and to intimidate others into \nsilence on sensitive issues, such as government infighting and \nEthiopia's tense relations with its neighbors. Throughout 2004, local \njournalists and international press freedom groups petitioned the \nEthiopian government to revise a repressive press bill, with little \nsuccess.'' The United States-Ethiopian relationship is an important and \ncomplex one. American support for a truly free press should be a part \nof it.\n  This bill also contains a provision I authored encouraging a more \nfocused effort to combat impunity and build judicial capacity in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. In the \neastern part of the DRC, government troops and rebel fighters have \nraped tens of thousands of women and girls, but fewer than a dozen \nperpetrators have been prosecuted. The brutality of these crimes and \nthe staggering scale of the problem, which has gripped the region for \nyears without attracting adequate international attention, demand \njustice. Similarly, impunity for brutal crimes against civilians is the \nnorm in Burundi. But if Burundi's peace process is to deliver lasting \nstability and bring an end to the horrifying violence that keeps \nfamilies afraid to sleep in their homes at night, the international \ncommunity must work to help create a strong and independent judiciary \nin the country. Rwanda continues to struggle with the backlog of \nserious cases relating to the 2004 genocide, and in Northern Uganda, \ncivilians are too often trapped between the thugs of the Lords \nResistance Army and a military presence that has not proven able or \nwilling to provide security or justice. These problems are moral \noutrages, but they are also destabilizing factors. Over the long run, \nreasserting the rule of law in Central Africa must be a part of ending \nthe cycle of conflict in the region, and creating space for peaceful \ndevelopment.\n\n  This bill also contains authorizing language for the administration's \nGlobal Peace Operations Initiative based on language that I authored \nfor the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program, \nor ACOTA, which is subsumed in the Global Peace Operations Initiative. \nThis language will ensure that Congress and the administration have a \nshared set of understandings about the nature of this program and about \ncriteria for participation as we move forward with this effort to \nstrengthen global capacity to share the burden of difficult \npeacekeeping missions. By clearly stating that human rights standards \nand democratic governance are important factors in determining \neligibility for participation, and by explicitly calling for outreach \nto civil society in participating countries, this language can help \nbuild confidence in this important program and avoid the mistakes of \npast military assistance initiatives.\n  I know that the administration and colleagues on both sides of the \naisle share my conviction that the global fight against HIV/AIDS is one \nof the most important and urgent issues of our time. This bill contains \nan amendment that I offered that supports efforts to provide treatment \nto the millions infected with HIV, by requiring full transparency \nregarding the price of the HIV/AIDS drugs being purchased with U.S. \nassistance under the auspices of the President's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. Last year, the GAO found that PEPFAR is \npurchasing antiretroviral drugs that differ in price by as much as $328 \nper person per year from corresponding generic drugs. Shining a light \non what is being accomplished with US taxpayer dollars will help us all \nto determine if there are responsible ways to stretch those dollars \nfurther to save more lives. My provision does not require that any \nspecific drugs--be they generic or brand name--be purchased. It simply \nrequires reporting on what is purchased and on how much it costs. I \nhave asked Ambassador Tobias in the past directly about his support for \nthis kind of transparency, and he has assured me that he absolutely \nsupports transparency. I firmly believe that this kind of transparency \nis in everyone's interest, protecting taxpayers and supporting AIDS \nrelief efforts.\n  The bill also contains a provision I authored related to Indonesia. \nThis provision simply requires the administration to report to Congress \non the status of the ongoing investigation of the murder of American \ncitizens that occurred on August 31, 2002 in Timika,\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\nIndonesia, before releasing funds for certain military assistance \nprograms for Indonesia in 2006. As my colleagues know, for the past two \nyears Congress has supported language restricting Indonesia's access to \ncertain, very narrowly defined types of military assistance, pending a \ndetermination that the Indonesian Government and military are fully \ncooperating with the FBI in the investigation of the murder of American \ncitizens that occurred on August 31, 2002 in Timika, Indonesia. \nSecretary Rice has made such a determination for the current fiscal \nyear, but this issue is by no means resolved. The FBI considers this an \nongoing investigation, and the FBI has not exonerated anyone. A number \nof questions remain unanswered, and clearly other conspirators were \ninvolved.\n\n  Most importantly, I believe that resolution of this case means that \nefforts are made to hold those responsible for the ambush accountable \nfor their actions in a court of law. But even the one individual \nindicted by the U.S. remains at large, and has been neither indicted \nnor arrested by Indonesian authorities. It is important to keep \nCongress apprised of ongoing cooperation in this ongoing investigation, \nas this case tells us a great deal about the context in which our \nbilateral relationship is moving forward. I look forward to receiving \nthis report, and I certainly hope that it will contain positive news \nthat will reinforce the United States-Indonesian bilateral \nrelationship.\n  This bill also contains the text of several important measures that I \nhave cosponsored and strongly support. The Global Pathogen Surveillance \nAct, which will help strengthen international capacity to cope with the \nthreats of biological terrorism and infectious disease, has been turned \ninto a title in this bill, and I commend Senator Biden for his \nexcellent work on this issue. Similarly, the Protection of Vulnerable \nPopulations during Humanitarian Emergencies Act is also reflected in \nthis larger authorization bill. This provision will help place the U.S. \nGovernment on a firmer footing to address the special vulnerabilities \nof women and children confronted by humanitarian crisis. Once again, I \ncommend Senators Biden and Lugar for their efforts on this issue.\n  This bill is not perfect. Reflecting the administration's budget \nrequest, this bill cuts the Development Assistance, Child Survival, and \nInternational Organizations and Programs accounts in order to \ndramatically increase the budget of the Office of Transition \nInitiatives. But the administration acknowledges that OTI will not \nactually administer this new money. The reasoning behind this request \nis to give the administration more flexibility with four very different \ncountries--Haiti, Sudan, Afghanistan, and Ethiopia. While I am \nsympathetic to the need for flexibility in these important countries, I \nam also alarmed at essentially putting the entire foreign aid budget \nfor these countries in an account that does not operate under the rules \nand restrictions that apply to other types of foreign assistance. I am \nalso concerned about the likely consequences for OTI itself, which has \nnever handled a budget of more than $50 million and was always intended \nto be a small, highly flexible, very special entity. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider these provisions carefully and to oppose this \nblank check approach to foreign assistance.\n  Overall this bill is a vitally important step toward placing the \ncongressional role in foreign policy on a more serious footing. When we \nconsider the stakes in world affairs; when we consider the potential \nfor the developing world's vast youthful populations to grow into \nallies rather than resentful enemies, when we consider the potential \nfor increased international cooperation in fighting terrorism, we can \nsee that our constituents and future generations stand to gain a great \ndeal from getting foreign policy right. At the very least, we need to \nstart by taking these issues seriously, authorizing important \nactivities and programs, and giving important initiatives the support \nthey deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the passing of a \ngreat Marylander, Frank Perdue, Sr., who helped build the poultry \nindustry on the Eastern Shore, a leading entrepreneur, a \nphilanthropist. He passed away of Parkinson's disease a few days ago.\n  Born in Parsonburg, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Frank Perdue \ngrew up working in his family's egg business--collecting and cleaning \neggs from childhood. But Frank Perdue was determined to take the family \nbusiness to another level--and it was his tremendous capacity for hard \nwork that did just that. When Perdue said, ``It takes a tough man to \nmake a tender chicken,'' America listened, and Frank Perdue became both \na savvy businessman and a cultural icon. Today Perdue Farms employs \nmore than 20,000 people across America and has annual sales of about $3 \nbillion.\n  I am proud to work have worked with Frank Perdue--and now with his \nson Jim Perdue--to fight for fair trade policies that enable Maryland \nchicken producers to export around the world.\n  As Frank Perdue's business soared, he worked to bring Maryland with \nhim. He became a great benefactor to Salisbury University, establishing \nthe Perdue School of Business with a generous gift. Once a college \nbaseball player and always a baseball fan, Frank Perdue brought the \nDelmarva Shorebirds to Salisbury in 1996, and then built the team and \nthe Eastern Shore community a stadium. It is for both his business \nsense and his philanthropic heart that I salute him today.\n  Frank Perdue and I came from different ends of the political \nspectrum. Yet we both believed that the best social program is a job--\nand that we must give help to those who practice self-help. We joked \nthat we should do an ad for a group we both support--we would say--\nwe're two tough birds from the right wing and the left wing--but we \nboth support this tender cause.\n  Today as we grieve the loss of one of Maryland's finest, Frank \nPerdue, we send our thoughts and prayers to his family and his many \nfriends and colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3195-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Staff Sergeant Shane Koele\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I speak in remembrance of an Iowan \nwho has died in service to his country. A member of the 212th Military \nPolice Company, SSG Shane Koele died on the 16th of March from injuries \nsustained when his military vehicle ran over a land mine the day before \nnear Shindand, Afghanistan. He was 25 years old and is survived by a \nwife, Cheryl, a young daughter, Kiley, a mother, Mary Donnenwerth, a \nfather, Keith Koele, and two sisters.\n  Staff Sergeant Koele grew up in Hartley, IA, and graduated in 1998 \nfrom Hartley-Melvin-Sanborn High School. He attended college at \nNorthwestern College and Wayne State before joining the Army. After \nserving in Iraq for 6 months in 2003, Shane returned home to get \nmarried. He was sent to Afghanistan on March 13, 2005.\n  SSG Shane Koele is remembered by family and friends as a true hero. \nPresident Ronald Reagan once said, ``Those who say that we're in a time \nwhen there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.'' Today, \nwe don't have to look far. We have only to remember with pride SSG \nShane Koele and all those who have died in courageous service to their \ncountry. As his family and friends grieve their loss, I can only offer \nmy prayers and my gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3195-4", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3195-S3196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with extreme disappointment that I\n\n[[Page S3196]]\n\ncome to the floor today. This week the New York Times ran a story \ndetailing a recent agreement signed between Wal-Mart Stores and the \nDepartment of Labor. Wal-Mart was fined just over $135,000 for 24 child \nlabor violations that occurred in New Hampshire, Arkansas, and \nConnecticut. One of the most egregious violations involved a boy who \ninjured his thumb while using a chain saw to cut Christmas trees. \nOthers were operating cardboard balers and chain saws, which are \nillegal for anyone under the age of 18 to work on. The $135,000 figure \nis a paltry figure that demonstrates DOL's lax enforcement policy. A \n$135,000 penalty against a company the size of Wal-Mart has the same \nfinancial impact as a 40-cent penalty for a million-dollar company. DOL \nhas sent American companies a message with this settlement: violators \nof child labor laws needn't worry about child labor, even if they are \ncaught.\n  Beyond this minimal fining of Wal-Mart, the Labor Department recently \nreleased new regulations that place young workers at greater risk of \nserious injuries. The new regulations are the first since the May 2002 \nrelease of a report detailing dozens of deficiencies in our Nation's \nchild labor laws. The report, published by NIOSH, recommended over 40 \nchanges in child labor laws to better protect America's employed youth \nfrom dangerous jobs and equipment. Since the 2002 release, it is \nestimated that more than 600,000 child workers have been injured in the \nUnited States. Among the disappointments in the new regulations, fast \nfood restaurants can now employ 14- and 15-year-olds to operate deep \nfryers and grills that are cooled to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. According \nto NIOSH, however, half of all burn injuries among child laborers occur \nin fast food restaurants. In another regulatory change, 16- and 17-\nyear-olds are now allowed to load paper balers and compactors that meet \nspecified safety standards. Since 1954, children under the age of 18 \nhave been prohibited from any contact with these machines. As with \ncooking, compliance with this standard will require vigilance by \nemployers who put youth in contact with these machines. Unfortunately, \nthe Labor Department requires no specific training for young workers \nunder these new regulations. Issuing regulations that sometimes allow \nexposure to certain machines, equipment, and hot surfaces, but not to \nothers, is confusing both to workers and employers. It is bound to \nresult in young workers being exposed to greater dangers. Additionally, \nyoung workers still work at dangerous heights, on tractors, in \npesticide handling, and in exposure to lead and silica. These hazards \nand more are recognized in the NIOSH report but have yet to be \naddressed by the Labor Department.\n  Sadly, this is not the first instance of Wal-Mart employing dangerous \nand illegal child labor. In March 2000, the State of Maine fined the \ncompany $205,650 for violations of child labor laws in every one of its \n20 stores in the State. In January 2004, a weeklong internal audit of \n128 stores found 1,371 instances in which minors worked too late at \nnight, during school hours, or for too many hours in a day. In the most \nrecent fine levied against Wal-Mart, the average fine per violation is \napproximately just $5,600. This is about half of DOL's maximum penalty \nof $11,000 per violation. Wal-Mart banks $285 billion in annual sales. \nThis is not what one would classify a financial hardship.\n  The most disturbing part of Wal-Mart's settlement with the Labor \nDepartment is not even the small and insignificant fines, however. The \ndistressing part of the agreement are the special favors handed out to \nWal-Mart. The agreement, which was signed on January 6, was not even \nmade public until now. It took a reporter to question officials about \nconcerns raised by several DOL employees that the agreement gave Wal-\nMart special favors. Those employees have remained anonymous, however, \ndue to their fear of retaliation.\n  What special favors were given to Wal-Mart? First off, DOL promises \nto give the retailer 15 days' notice prior to any ``wage and hour'' \ninvestigation, like failure to pay minimum wage or overtime. As my \ncolleagues will recall, I have tried for the past year to get the \nDepartment of Labor to reverse their damning new overtime provisions \nwhich stripped overtime pay benefits from thousands of American \nworkers. This administration's Labor Department continues to stand \nopposed to respecting worker rights, child labor rights, and overtime \nrights. But Wal-Mart is really their perfect ally, since they do not \nallow their workers to unionize. DOL's cozying up to Wal-Mart is \noutrageous and completely unacceptable. By doling out these special \nprivileges, worker rights in America are taking a giant leap backwards.\n  The degree to which the current administration has relaxed worker \nrights should not be seen in a partisan light. Elizabeth Dole, U.S. \nSecretary of Labor in the first President Bush administration, launched \na crackdown amidst record levels of reported child labor law violations \nin America in 1990. She reminded all Americans that ``the children of \nAmerica are our future. The Department of Labor will do everything \nwithin its power to protect children against those who violate our \nchild labor laws. The first step in this process is to reassess our \nfine structure and take immediate action to step up enforcement.'' This \nwas the view of a previous Republican Department of Labor. Sadly, we \nhave regressed.\n  According to John R. Fraser, who was our Government's top wage \nofficial under the first President Bush and President Clinton, said the \nadvance-notice provision was unusual. Quoting Mr. Fraser from the New \nYork Times article:\n\n       Giving the company 15 days' notice of any investigation is \n     very unusual. The language appears to go beyond child labor \n     allegations and cover all wage and hour allegations. It \n     appears to put Wal-Mart in a privileged positions that to my \n     knowledge no other employ has.\n\n  And an anonymous DOL employee, who is a 20-year veteran of the \nDepartment's Wage and Hour Division, said ``with child labor cases \ninvolving the use of hazardous machinery, why give 15 days' notice \nbefore we can do an investigation? What's the rationale?''\n  I don't know what the rationale is, Mr. President. There is no viable \nexcuse for this agreement. It flies in the face of our labor laws. It \nseems more than coincidental that this Labor Department which has taken \naway overtime pay is now coming close to rewarding a corporation for \ndoing the same. Is it mere coincidence also, then, that Wal-Mart gives \nmore money to the Republican Party than any other corporation in \nAmerica? Wal-Mart's political action committee, the biggest company PAC \nin America, gave Republicans 81 percent of its $1.3 million in \ndonations in the past 2 years, the highest proportion of any of the top \n25 corporate PACs, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, a nonpartisan \nWashington-based group.\n  Wal-Mart's top three managers each gave the maximum individual \ncontribution of $2,000 to President Bush's campaign last year and Jay \nAllen, vice president for corporate affairs went one step further. He \nraised at least $100,000 to reelect the President, earning him the Bush \ncampaign's designation of ``Pioneer.''

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the University \nof North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team on their national \nchampionship. This is the fourth NCAA Division I title for this storied \nprogram and a well deserved finish to an amazing season.\n  Now, I know some of you are wondering . . . Yes, I am a Duke graduate \nand a Duke fan, and as you know, Duke\n\n[[Page S3197]]\n\nand North Carolina have one of the most legendary rivalries in the \nnation. That being said, I truly have been behind this team--I even \nwore Carolina blue to several events in North Carolina last week to \nshow my support!\n  On Monday night, the Tar Heels defeated the Illinois Fighting Illini \n75-70 in a remarkable display of teamwork and talent. Led by the \nperformance of Raymond Felton and Sean May, the Tar Heels played strong \nbasketball on both ends of the court. They were able to make critical \nbaskets when the game was on the line and played tenacious defense that \nstifled their opponent. With this victory, this year's Tar Heel team \nhas solidified its place in college basketball history alongside \nCarolina greats such as Michael Jordan and James Worthy.\n  Roy Williams, who returned to his home state and alma mater just two \nyears ago, earned his first title and demonstrated once again why he is \none of the best coaches in college basketball. Under his leadership, \nthis group of talented young men developed into truly great players \nwith heart and determination.\n  The Tar Heels' Sean May was named most outstanding player in the \nFinal Four for his dominant scoring and rebounding. Sean finished an \nincredible season with 26 points and 10 rebounds against Illinois.\n  This year started with great expectations as the Tar Heels were \npicked as the pre-season #1 team by Sports Illustrated. However, in \nrecent years, such impressive rankings were not always the case. \nSeniors on this Tar Heel team faced great adversity early in their \ncareers as they fought to overcome a disappointing 8-20 season their \nfreshman year. Still, these players were determined to work hard to \nbecome a better team. And did they ever. Just 4 years later, these \nyoung men completed an incredible turnaround and are now able to call \nthemselves national champions.\n  Today is a proud day for Coach Williams, his terrific players and the \nstate of North Carolina. College basketball is a special tradition for \nso many North Carolinians. It is a pastime shared from generation to \ngeneration and amongst neighbors and friends. It's what so many folks \nchat about at the grocery store, before class, over dinner, and after \nchurch. We are so proud of the North Carolina Tar Heels' \naccomplishments this season and delighted that they gave us yet another \nmemory to talk about for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3197-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS MEN'S BASKETBALL SEASON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Monday night in Saint Louis a dream season \ncame to an end. The University of Illinois was defeated for only the \nsecond time this season as they fell to the University of North \nCarolina Tar Heels. But as painful as the loss was, it does not detract \nfrom a remarkable season.\n  Head coach Bruce Weber and his Illini should know there is nothing to \nbe disappointed about. As much as I would have enjoyed seeing the \nIllini conclude their remarkable run with an NCAA championship, there \nis no doubting what the Illini have accomplished. The team tied an NCAA \nrecord with 37 victories. They made the first championship game \nappearance in the school's 100-year basketball history. They won \nregular-season and conference tournament Big 10 championships and were \nranked first overall in the Associated Press poll since early in the \nseason.\n  If I could pick one word to describe the Illini this season, it would \nbe ``team.'' Rarely has a group of young men worked together as well as \nthe Illini has. After Illinois defeated Louisville 72 to 57 on Saturday \nevening, Louisville head coach Rick Pitino said, ``I don't know if they \nnecessarily had the greatest talent I've seen from a Final Four, but \nthey're the best team I've seen in some time.''\n  The Illini are the ultimate team, and that is the ultimate compliment \nto coach Weber and his players.\n  Every man on the floor was capable of leading the team to victory, \nwhether it was guards Dee Brown, Luther Head or Deron Williams, or \nforwards James Augustine or Roger Powell. Yet Illinois plays within \nhead coach Bruce Weber's system and doesn't allow ego, personal \nstatistical goals, or anything else to disrupt their teamwork.\n  Unfortunately, they came up short against North Carolina. But the \nState of Illinois is proud of their Illini. An orange hue has been cast \nacross the State as Illinoisans got behind the team for their NCAA \ntournament run. So many people have enjoyed this tournament and they \nwon't soon forget where they were when the Illini shocked Arizona, or \nwhen Roger Powell slam-dunked the rebound from his own three-point shot \nagainst Louisville.\n  I would like to congratulate B. Joseph White, who became the \nUniversity's 16th president on January 31 of this year, and the \nadministration, faculty, staff, student body, and fans of the \nUniversity of Illinois on making it to the championship game of the \n2005 NCAA tournament.\n  To the coaches, Illini players, and their families, thanks for the \nmemories. Thanks for showing us what teamwork is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3197-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ARLEN LANCASTER\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a longtime staff \nmember who is moving onto a new and exciting work challenge. Arlen \nLancaster has been a valued member of my staff since the start of my \nfirst term in the Senate in 1999. He is leaving my staff to become the \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Arlen joined my staff as a legislative correspondent and worked his \nway through two promotions. He now serves as senior policy adviser, \ncovering agriculture, conservation, rural development, energy and the \nIdaho National Laboratory, natural resources and public lands, defense \nas well as serving as the staff director of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee on Forestry, Conservation and Rural Revitalization. Arlen \nwas instrumental in the work that I have done regarding the \nconservation title in the 2002 farm bill and shepherding the historic \nHealthy Forest Restoration Act through Congress.\n  While Arlen's family hails from the Burley area in my home State of \nIdaho, he lived in many areas due to his father's work with the U.S. \nAir Force. He attended high school and college in Utah, graduating with \na political science degree from the University of Utah. He is \ndefinitely a Westerner at heart and his work for me has benefited many \nin Idaho.\n  On a personal note, Arlen was great to work with. He is decisive, \ninsightful and innovative. His easy-going personality and sense of \nhumor permeated all that he did in his public service for the people of \nIdaho and the United States. He provided a certain spark to my office. \nIn fact, he sparked so much with another LA that they will be getting \nmarried this summer and Arlen and Staci have my best wishes for a long, \nhappy life together.\n  I am excited by Arlen's new challenge at USDA and know he is well up \nto the task. Although I won't have the same opportunity to work with \nhim on a daily basis, I look forward to our new working relationship \nand Arlen's continuing successes. His extensive knowledge of \nagriculture, natural resources and other policy issues will serve Arlen \nwell in his new capacity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3197-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3197-S3198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  LIEUTENANT COLONEL ANTONIO R. BAINES\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nan exceptional officer in the United States Army, Lieutenant Colonel \nAntonio R. Baines, upon his retirement after more than 20 years of \ndistinguished service. Throughout his career, Colonel Baines has \npersonified the Army values of duty, integrity, and selfless service \nacross the many missions the Army provides in defense of our Nation. As \na Congressional Legislative Liaison Officer in the office of the \nSecretary of the Army, many of us on Capitol Hill have enjoyed the \nopportunity to work with Lieutenant Colonel Baines on a wide variety of \nArmy issues and programs, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments. I commend his superb service to the United States Army \nand this great Nation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Antonio R. Baines, the son of Mr. Albert and \nYolanda Baines of Jonesboro, GA, attended high school in Hephzibah, GA,\n\n[[Page S3198]]\n\nand was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Signal Corps after \ngraduating from North Georgia College in 1984. His first assignment was \nas the Battalion Signal Officer for the 6th Battalion, 37th Field \nArtillery, 2nd Infantry Division in Korea. He has served in multiple \nassignments within the United States, including two tours at Ft. \nGordon, GA, and notably as the Signal Officer for 1st Squadron, 9th \nU.S. Calvary Regiment at Fort Lewis, WA, and the 82nd Aviation Brigade, \n82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. Lieutenant Colonel Baines \nserved two tours in Europe as the Signal Officer for the 3rd Battalion, \n34th Armor Regiment in Stuttgart, Germany, and deployed to South West \nAsia as part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Later as the \nAssistant Division Signal Officer for the 1st Infantry Division in \nWurzburg, he again deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina. As a signaler, \nLieutenant Colonel Baines excelled in a wide variety of leadership and \nstaff assignments to include Platoon Leader, Battalion Adjutant, \nCompany Commander, Brigade Adjutant and Battalion Executive Officer.\n  In 1999, Lieutenant Colonel Baines was selected to be a Force \nDevelopment Officer with assignment to the Pentagon. He served on the \nG-3 and G-8 staff as the Army's Systems Integrator for all tactical \nradios systems. He was subsequently selected as a Congressional \nLegislative Liaison Officer in the office of the Secretary of the Army, \nCongressional Legislative Liaison, Programs Division from June 2001 \nthrough June 2005.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Baines maintained constant liaison with the \nProfessional Staff Members of the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees on issues relating to Army Procurement programs focusing on \nArmy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Information \nTechnology, and Ammunition Procurement. In 2003, Lieutenant Colonel \nBaines was selected to be the team chief of the hardware section of the \nPrograms Division.\n  Throughout these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Baines provided \noutstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on \nnumerous critical issues of enduring importance to both the Army and \nCongress. Antonio's actions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders \nand Members of Congress as they considered the impact of important \nissues. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nColonel Baines, his wife Peggy, and his entire family for the \ncommitment, sacrifices, and contribution that they have made throughout \nhis honorable military career.

TROST, U.S. NAVY, RETIRED\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to ADM \nCarlisle A.H. Trost, U.S. Navy, Retired, as he steps down after 17 \nfaithful, diligent, and honorable years as the chairman of the board of \ndirectors of the George and Carol Olmsted Foundation of Falls Church, \nVA. In years past it was a privilege to have worked closely with both \nGeorge Olmsted and Admiral Trost.\n  Admiral Trost, who ascended to the position of Chief of Naval \nOperations during his long and distinguished career as a naval officer, \noffered his services first as a director, then as chairman of the \nboard, of the prestigious Olmsted Foundation. Demonstrating a vital \nunderstanding of this complex world, he led the foundation in its \nexpanding role to educate young, talented, and dedicated military \nofficers in learning foreign languages and in understanding foreign \ncultures through the awarding of scholarships to study overseas for 2 \nyears. With our military deployed for wars in over 100 countries across \nthe globe, the importance of having officers imbued with the cultural \nsensitivities and language capabilities provided by this special \neducation is essential. Thanks to Admiral Trost's innate understanding \nof the importance of the training provided to Olmsted scholars and his \nvisionary leadership, the number of scholars studying annually doubled \nand the foundation's endowment increased dramatically.\n  Admiral Trost also established the Tri-Service Academy Cadet and \nMidshipman Overseas Travel and Cultural Immersion Program at our three \nservice academies in 2001. He later extended this important training \nand educational program to the three Service Reserve Officer Training \nCommands, ROTC, and the six senior military colleges, title 10 schools. \nAdmiral Trost graduated from the Naval Academy in 1953, where he was \nfirst in his class of 925 midshipmen. He went on to become an Olmsted \nScholar in 1960, studying in the German language at the University of \nFreiburg from 1960 to 1962. From there he had a most successful tour as \na submarine officer, eventually commanding the blue crew of the \nnuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, USS Sam Rayburn, SSBN 635.\n  As a young captain, he was selected by his superiors to serve as a \nnaval aide to the Under Secretary and, later, Secretary of the Navy. It \nwas my good fortune to have served in these positions and to have \nlearned from this great teacher, peer, and life-long friend. Whether as \na submarine group commander, a numbered fleet commander, Commander of \nthe Atlantic Fleet, or as Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Trost \nalways served his country with honor and dignity.\n  Admiral Trost has provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound \nprofessional judgment on many critical issues and at many key levels of \ndecision making for both the Navy and the Nation. Indeed, his actions \nand wise counsel over the years have been of enduring importance to the \nU.S. Congress. Though he is a modest man, he truly is an extraordinary \nindividual and leader who has contributed so much to this country and \nthe cause of freedom. He has been dedicated fully to mission \naccomplishment, education, leadership, and professionalism in the \nhighest traditions of the American spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3198-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3198-S3199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THIRTY YEARS FOR R.J. VIAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, every session in Congress, we \nspend a large amount of time discussing education in this country. \nDebates range from accountability to school construction to teacher \nrecruitment. While our discussions are of the utmost importance, it is \nthe implementation of our decisions by individuals within the education \nsystem that changes how our children learn. Today, I honor an \nelementary school in Paradis, LA that has served as an example of a \ngreat school that is achieving the goals we set forth in these halls.\n  R.J. Vial Elementary School will turn 30 years old this Friday, April \n8th. There will be festivities and celebrations for students, alumni, \nteachers, administrators, and parents. But I would like to take a \nminute to talk about the real celebration of this school. In the past 5 \nyears, R.J. Vial Elementary School has steadily increased the number of \nstudents passing the LEAP 21 test in all four areas that the test \ncovers. R.J. Vial is clearly meeting its mission of developing \nrespectful, lifelong learners. That is what I would like to celebrate \ntoday in the United States Senate.\n  In the April 2005 Community Newsletter of R.J. Vial Elementary \nSchool, Principal Frederick A. Treuting wrote, ``Our greatest and \nperhaps only truly effective discipline tool is a strong relationship \nthat bonds us to our children.'' Principal Treuting could not be more \ncorrect. If we are to succeed in educating our children to the best of \nour ability, we must reach out to them and work to raise academic \nachievement in our public schools by putting the priority on \nperformance instead of process, delivering results instead of \ndeveloping rules, and on actively encouraging bold reform instead of \npassively tolerating failure.\n  At 510 Louisiana Street in Paradis, LA, R.J. Vial Elementary School \nis already doing these things and because of that, has become one of \nthe finest schools in the state of Louisiana. There is no greater \ninvestment we can in our future than in the education of our children. \nI commend the hard work of all the people who have and currently work \nat and with R.J. Vial Elementary School; you are giving the best gift \nyou can to our youth. It has been said that it takes a village to raise \na child, so we must all work together to see that we educate our \nchildren to the best of our ability. And to the students, both past\n\n[[Page S3199]]\n\nand present, of R.J. Vial, I offer my congratulations. Because of your \nefforts in the classroom for the past thirty years, R.J. Vial \nElementary School has become the beacon of success that it is today.\n  Happy Birthday, R.J. Vial Elementary School! My heartfelt \ncongratulations to all involved with the school, and best wishes to \nanother great 30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3199-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING POPE JOHN PAUL II\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Having been an original cosponsor of the resolution, I would \nhave supported the measure if present.\n  As we mourn the passage of Pope John Paul II, we also pause to \nreflect on the many blessings his life bestowed upon the world, This \ngreat man was not only a defender of his faith, but of the weakest and \nmost vulnerable among us. He will be remembered, without doubt, as one \nof the most significant and influential figures of the 20th Century. \nHis influence transcended the Roman Catholic Church and has had an \nimpact on everyone's relationship with the Creator. I humbly pay my \nrespects and honor the legacy that he leaves behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3199-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NICOLE WAYANT AND CORMAC O'CONNOR\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I congratulate and honor two \nyoung Kansas students who have achieved national recognition for \nexemplary volunteer service in their communities. Nicole Wayant of \nTopeka, KS, and Cormac O'Connor of Prairie Village, KS, have just been \nnamed State Honorees in The 2005 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards \nprogram, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and \none middle-level student in each State, the District of Columbia, and \nPuerto Rico.\n  Ms. Wayant is being recognized for creating a youth health council to \npromote the benefits of an active, healthy lifestyle among the students \nin her school district.\n  Mr. O'Connor is being recognized for implementing an \nintergenerational arts program that brought senior citizens and at-risk \nchildren together for classes in visual arts, movements, theater and \njazz.\n  In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are \nless involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital \nthat we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these \nyoung people have made. People of all ages need to think more about how \nwe, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to \nensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young \nvolunteers like Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor are inspiring examples to \nall of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.\n  The program that brought these young role models to our attention--\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential \nFinancial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that \ntheir contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to \ninspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 10 \nyears, the program has become the Nation's largest youth recognition \neffort based solely on community service, with more than 170,000 young \npeople participating since its inception.\n  Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor should be extremely proud to have been \nsingled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of \ntheir recognition, they will come to Washington in early May, along \nwith other 2005 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country, \nfor several days of special events, including a congressional breakfast \non Capitol Hill. While here in Washington, 10 will be named America's \ntop youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national selection \ncommittee.\n  I applaud Ms. Wayant and Mr. O'Connor for their initiative in seeking \nto make their communities better places to live, and for the positive \nimpact they have had on the lives of others. I also salute the other \nyoung people in my State who were named Distinguished Finalists by The \nPrudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer \nservice. They are Shawn Bryant of Leavenworth, KS; Brad Harris of Saint \nPaul, KS; Amanda Knox of Clifton, KS; and Creighton Olsen of Larned, \nKS.\n  All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and \naccomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world and they \ndeserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that \nyoung Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, \nand that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous \npromise for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3199-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3199-S3200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1454.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 regarding the transfer of students from certain schools; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act with regard to the transfer \nof students from certain schools. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 \nincludes a requirement that schools not meeting adequate yearly \nprogress--the AYP--for 2 consecutive years must provide transfer within \nthe school district, and if no such schools exist, make efforts to \nprovide transfers between school districts to the extent practical. \nThis is the school choice provision. However, the current law's \nguidance on school choice does not adequately define practicality or \nfeasibility, and where definitions are provided, they are overly broad.\n  We have just come off the Easter break. We had an opportunity to talk \nto a lot of educators and students. We return to our work starting \ntoday to make some significant--maybe not significant changes, but \nlittle changes to No Child Left Behind to make it more practical and \nmake it more common sense in States such as Montana.\n  When we start looking at these maps, and as the President pro tempore \nleaves the Chamber, he understands what rural is when he looks at his \nState of Alaska. We are not nearly as big as Alaska. However, when we \nlook at the State of Montana--and for those who wonder about distances \nand sizes, from the Yak, which is up in the northwest corner of the \nState, to Alzada in the southeast corner, it is farther than it is from \nChicago to Washington, DC. So there is a pretty fair chunk of land out \nhere, and we have young folks who go to school in just about every part \nof the State.\n  These are the elementary schools I am going to talk about as I speak \non No Child Left Behind and the legislation I am introducing today.\n  The bottom line is No Child Left Behind is not a one-size-fits-all \nlegislation. We have some of the greatest teachers there are in the \ncountry, and we have some of the brightest minds to teach. Accordingly, \nit is imperative that Congress continues to hear the needs and concerns \nof America's rural education communities.\n  Just to give my colleagues an idea, I had a little bit to do with the \npassage\n\n[[Page S3204]]\n\nand the shaping of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. In that bill, we \nhad a piece included called broadband. Back in those days, most folks \nhad not heard of the Internet, broadband, or digital. There were not \nvery many of us around here who were even computer literate. We are \ngetting better. We are getting a little younger.\n  I can remember when we put the broadband section in the bill, \nprimarily to do two things in my State: distance learning, allowing \nthese smaller schools in rural areas to access the Internet and classes \nto be taught via a two-way interact from another location so that their \ncurriculum could be broadened, just like a school, say, located in \nBillings, Great Falls, Missoula. Just because someone was born way out \nhere and went to school in Jordan, MT, where we have a county the size \nof Rhode Island--it only has 1,800 folks and only one high school. It \nused to be a boarding school. I do not think it is anymore. But it used \nto be when you took your student to school on Monday morning, you did \nnot see them until Friday night after the football game was over. So we \ndeal in a little bit different kind of environment and situation.\n  The Federal law must recognize the significant differences between \nurban and rural school districts with regard to student transportation, \nschool spacing, and, of course, the school-of-choice options. Although \nNo Child Left Behind leaves the State of Montana in control of \ndetermining the feasibility of transfers between different school \ndistricts, it is much less flexible when it comes to transfers within \nthe same school district.\n  My legislation would add to existing guidelines on the practicality \nand the feasibility of school choice that a school district would not \nbe required to provide a student with a transfer option to another \nschool if providing the option is impractical due to the distance to be \ntraveled, a geographical barrier or hazard, the duration of the travel, \nor an unusually high cost of travel. However, if choice is not offered \nunder the latter circumstances, students in affected schools will still \nreceive valuable supplemental education services, and school districts \nwill still have the option to provide students school learning choices \nthrough distance learning programs or virtual schools or several other \noptions offered under current law.\n  We are pretty sparse in eastern Montana. From Miles City to Jordan is \nabout 90 miles. I was talking about Jordan a while ago up on the big \ndry creek. You heard me say I have a lot of dirt between light bulbs \nout there. Well, we have a lot of land between schools out there also, \nand school districts can be quite large. The centers of Billings, Great \nFalls, Missoula, the Flat Head, or even Bozeman are grouped pretty \nclosely. In eastern Montana, however, they are far apart. We have \nelementary schools not even on paved roads, still on gravel. I know one \nthat is still on a mud road. If it rains real hard or during the spring \nthaw, they cannot get a car in there or a pickup truck or even a four-\nwheel drive vehicle, so they all ride horses, which is not a bad idea. \nIt saves on gas, and as high as gas is, it probably isn't a bad idea at \nall. This is a map of the elementary schools to give an idea of where \nthey are located way out there.\n  Now, I want to take a look at the high schools. There are not as many \nof them. What are you going to do if a school in Miles City is in need \nof improvement under the current law? Where are you going to send them? \nTo Broadus? I don't think so. That is another 80 or 90 miles. Pretty \nsoon the miles start adding up.\n  Right now the law requires the schools to pay for students to \ntransfer them in the same district unless doing so is too expensive. In \nMontana, as with many rural schools in rural States, there are \nconsiderations greater than just cost. While the law makes sense in \nBillings, it does not work in districts where the schools are farther \napart.\n  Take the Broadus County School District in southeastern Montana as an \nexample. As we can see, there is a lot of distance between schools. \nThere are not very many schools out there. These are high schools. \nThese are not elementary schools but high schools. Some may take up to \n2 hours one way to drive. It not only hurts the family life of the \nstudents, but it disrupts what they do and also has an adverse effect \non their academic performance.\n  Sometimes this type of commute may be necessary. My legislation makes \nthis decision a matter for rural States to decide instead of the \npoliticians here in Washington, DC, or by a rule written into a law \nthat just is unworkable in my State.\n  I realize No Child Left Behind had some built-in flexibilities, and I \nalso realize that some States did not take advantage of some of those \nflexibilities. Now we are locked into a situation where it is almost \nimpossible to change unless we change the legislation and reword it. My \nlegislation simply clarifies what is feasible and practical for school \nchoice transfers within school districts and gives the States, \nespecially my State, the ability to treat schools in rural Broadus \ndifferently than it treats schools in more urbanized Billings, MT.\n  I would imagine the Senator from Florida who is new to this body and \na terrific addition to this body has some rural areas in Florida. We \nthink of Florida as more urbanized, but they have some rural areas too, \njust like Montana. That does not mean there are kids out there whose \nneeds should not be addressed.\n  When we visit schools, we get all kinds of questions from the \nstudents. I was visiting a sixth-grade class the other day. They came \nup with all kinds of questions. Some of them were pretty good, some \nwere not so good. I did have one that was just a little bit different. \nThis young man stood up in sixth grade, and he said: Senator, what do \nyou want written on your tombstone? My gosh, I never had that question \nbefore, and I did not know exactly how to handle it, so I just told \nhim: He's not here yet. That is the only way I could answer him.\n  These young people are very bright. They like their schools in these \nareas with distance learning. And we have telemedicine. We are \ndelivering medical care much differently now. We are doing it with \nbroadband services. We have 14 counties that do not have a doctor. It \nis done by physician assistants and many other people.\n  The other day a student from our part of the country enrolled at \nMontana State University at Billings. He had taken enough courses in \nhis senior year in distance learning from MSUB that he has a full \nsemester completed. So when he goes away to school, he already has half \na year done.\n  This is why we have the Telecommunications Act. This is why we have \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. We have to look at schools and libraries \nand some of the kinks we have to work out in that law so that these \nsmaller schools and libraries can get their moneys so they can offer \nthis online education. This is just another part of tweaking the No \nChild Left Behind law to make it work in rural areas.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues, especially those from rural States, to \njoin me in cosponsoring this bill because it is very important. If we \nare really dedicated to the program of No Child Left Behind, we cannot \nleave rural children behind either, and we have to make it work.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Schools Geography \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are significant differences between urban and \n     rural school districts with regard to student transportation, \n     distances between schools and school districts, and school of \n     choice options. Local educational agencies (LEAs) in rural \n     areas often have only 1 school servicing a particular grade-\n     level, and the distance between these schools is often much \n     greater than in urban areas. These differences are not \n     addressed by existing guidelines under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965.\n       (2) In 2000, rural schools (those in communities with \n     populations below 2,500) taught 32 percent of the children in \n     the United States, but rural schools accounted for \n     $5,670,000,000 of the Nation's spending on school \n     transportation, or nearly half of such spending.\n       (3) Rural transportation costs, per-pupil, are double that \n     of urban transportation\n\n[[Page S3205]]\n\n     costs. As a percentage of total spending, rural areas spend \n     77 percent more than urban areas for education \n     transportation.\n       (4) Commutes in rural areas are much more likely to be on \n     rougher, unpaved roads. This not only undermines the physical \n     health of the students, but makes transportation during poor \n     weather much more difficult or impossible. Students with \n     longer commutes are more likely to miss school because of \n     inclement weather. School attendance is an important factor \n     in school performance.\n       (5) School students who have long commutes actively avoid \n     advanced and high-level courses because they do not have time \n     for the extra homework. This self-imposed restriction retards \n     maximization of educational potential.\n       (6) Students with long commutes are less likely to engage \n     in in-home and out-of-home activities, such as family \n     dinners, after-school jobs, and athletic or musical \n     extracurricular activities. Participation in these activities \n     benefits overall educational progress.\n       (7) Section 1116(b)(10)(C) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 instructs that the lowest achieving \n     children be given priority for out-of-district \n     transportation. Thus, the negative impacts of long commutes \n     disproportionately affect the very students who need the most \n     help.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION \n                   ACT OF 1965.\n\n       Section 1116 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(i) Geography Limits.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) \n     and (c), a local educational agency shall not be required to \n     provide a student the option to transfer to another school \n     pursuant to this section if providing the option is \n     impractical due to the distance to be traveled, a \n     geographical barrier or hazard, the duration of the travel, \n     or an unusually high cost of travel.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Secretary of Education, not later than 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, shall promulgate such \n     regulations as the Secretary determines necessary to \n     implement this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendment made by section 3 shall take effect on the \n     first July 1 that occurs after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 697. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve \nhigher education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Higher \nEducation Opportunity Through Pell Grant Expansion Act of 2005, or HOPE \nAct.\n  Right now, in schools, playgrounds, and backyards across America, \nchildren are dreaming about what they want to be when they grow up. As \ntomorrow's astronauts, doctors, and teachers dream about their futures, \ntheir parents know that so many of those dreams are dependent on a \ncollege diploma.\n  The families I have met in Illinois are worried that they might not \nbe able to give their kids a chance at that diploma. Everywhere I go, I \nhear the same story: we work hard, we pay our bills, we cut corners, \nand we put away savings, but we just don't know if it is going to be \nenough when the tuition bill comes in the mail.\n  The facts and statistics are not encouraging. College tuition is \nrising at a stunning rate of almost 10 percent a year, and over the \nlast 25 years it is gone up an astounding 519 percent. Because of these \nrising prices, over 200,000 students were priced out of a college \neducation last year.\n  In a country with so much wealth and opportunity for education, it is \ndifficult to imagine there are parents who are forced to say to their \nkids: ``We're sorry. We can't afford to send you to college.'' None of \nus in the Senate should rest until those parents can start saying \n``yes'' to their kids.\n  This bill would start us down that path by increasing access to Pell \ngrants. Today, these need-based awards are used by 5.3 million \nundergraduate students to fund their education. Unfortunately, the \nawards just haven't kept up with the rising price of tuition or even \ninflation. As a result, the current $4,050 Pell grant maximum is $700 \nless in real terms than the maximum grant 30 years ago. Pell grants now \ncover only 23 percent of the total cost of the average 4-year public \ncollege.\n  The HOPE Act would correct this problem by raising the Pell grant \nmaximum to $5,100, and it would continue to raise this maximum in \nfuture years to keep up with inflation. The bill also would make sure \nthat no student sees a reduction in Pell grant assistance due to recent \nchanges in the eligibility formula.\n  Because working families are already burdened with too many taxes, \nthis bill would not add to the deficit or raise a dime of taxes. \nInstead, it will close two loopholes that guarantee banks and private \nlenders an additional $2 billion in taxpayer subsidies every year on \ntop of the interest that college students and their families are \nalready paying on their loans. In a country where 200,000 students were \npriced out of college last year, our tax dollars shouldn't be spent \nsubsidizing banks that are already making record profits.\n  When our children dream about their future, they need to know those \ndreams are within their reach. A college education forms the foundation \nof the opportunity society that will keep this country strong and \ngrowing in the 21st century. I know we can work together to get this \ndone, and I look forward to doing so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the HOPE Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Higher Education Opportunity \n     Through Pell Grant Expansion Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal Pell Grants are need-based and are used by \n     5,300,000 undergraduate students to fund their college \n     educations.\n       (2) Over 90 percent of Federal Pell Grant recipients come \n     from a family with a combined income of less than $40,000.\n       (3) Because of the rising cost of college tuition, the \n     maximum Federal Pell Grant amount of $4,050 for academic year \n     2004-2005 is $700 less in real terms than the maximum Federal \n     Pell Grant amount for academic year 1975-1976.\n       (4) Federal Pell Grants for academic year 2003-2004 cover \n     only 23 percent of the total cost of the average 4-year \n     public college.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) eligible undergraduate students should receive the \n     maximum Federal Pell Grant amount established by the \n     amendment made by section 3(b) of this Act; and\n       (2) sufficient funds should be appropriated to allow the \n     awarding of the maximum Federal Pell Grant amount for which \n     students are eligible pursuant to the amendment made by \n     section 3(b) of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. FEDERAL PELL GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Appropriation of Funds for Federal Pell Grants.--In \n     addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated to carry out \n     subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, there are authorized to be appropriated \n     and there are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2006, for carrying out such subpart 1, an \n     additional $2,000,000,000.\n       (b) Authorization Amount and Maximum Federal Pell Grant.--\n     Section 401(b)(2)(A) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1070a(b)(2)(A)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2)(A)(i) The amount of a Federal Pell Grant for a \n     student eligible under this part shall be $5,100 for academic \n     year 2005-2006, less an amount equal to the amount determined \n     to be the expected family contribution with respect to that \n     student for that year.\n       ``(ii) The Secretary shall cumulatively adjust the amount \n     in clause (i) every 2 academic years beginning with academic \n     year 2006-2007 to account for any percentage increase in the \n     Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ALLOWANCE FOR STATE AND OTHER TAXES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the annual \n     updates to the allowance for State and other taxes in the \n     tables used in the Federal Needs Analysis Methodology to \n     determine a student's expected family contribution for the \n     award year 2005-2006 under part F of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.), published \n     in the Federal Register on Thursday, December 23, 2004 (69 \n     Fed. Reg. 76926), shall not apply to a student to the extent \n     the updates will increase the student's expected family \n     contribution under such part F.\n\n     SEC. 5. TERMINATION OF EXCESSIVE ALLOWANCES.\n\n       Section 438(b)(2)(B) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1087-1(b)(2)(B)) is amended by striking clause (v) \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(v) This subparagraph shall not apply to--\n\n[[Page S3206]]\n\n       ``(I) any loan made or purchased after the date of \n     enactment of the Higher Education Opportunity Through Pell \n     Grant Expansion Act;\n       ``(II) any loan that had not qualified before such date of \n     enactment for receipt of a special allowance payment \n     determined under this subparagraph; or\n       ``(III) any loan made or purchased before such date of \n     enactment with funds described in the first or second \n     sentence of clause (i) if--\n\n       ``(aa) the obligation described in the first such sentence \n     has, after such date of enactment, matured, or been retired \n     or defeased; or\n       ``(bb) the maturity date or the date of retirement of the \n     obligation described in the first such sentence has, after \n     such date of enactment, been extended.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. WINDFALL PROFIT OFFSET.\n\n       Section 438 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1087-1) is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g) Windfall Profit Offset.--At the end of every fiscal \n     quarter for which an eligible lender does not receive a \n     special allowance payment under this section, the eligible \n     lender shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit \n     into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts a windfall profit \n     offset payment for the fiscal quarter equal to the amount by \n     which--\n       ``(1) the aggregate amount of all payments of interest \n     received by the eligible lender from borrowers on all loans \n     made, insured, or guaranteed under this part during the \n     fiscal quarter; exceeds\n       ``(2) interest guaranteed the lender under this section for \n     the fiscal quarter, irrespective of the amount received under \n     subparagraph (A).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Talent, \n        and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 702. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe occupational taxes relating to distilled spirits, wine, and beer; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ncolleagues Senators Bunning, Johnson and Talent today in introducing \nlegislation that will repeal the special occupational tax on taxpayers \nwho manufacture, distribute, and sell alcoholic beverages.\n  The special occupational tax is not a tax on alcoholic products, but \nrather operates as a license fee on businesses. The tax is imposed on \nthose engaged in the business of selling alcohol beverages. Believe it \nor not, this tax was originally established to help finance the Civil \nWar. That war is over, and this inequitable tax has outlived its \noriginal purpose. Repealing the SOT will also simplify the tax code for \nthousands of small businesses.\n  The SOT on alcohol dramatically increased during the budget process \nin 1988 and has unfairly burdened business owners across the country \nsince. From Thompson Falls to Sidney, from Chinook to Billings, small \nbusinesses are burdened with yet another tax in the form of the SOT. \nAccording to the Alcohol and Tobacco, Tax and Trade Bureau, there are \n426,193 locations nationwide that pay the SOT every year, including \n399,657 retailers. These retail establishments account for $99 million \nout of $103 million collected in SOT revenues.\n  In Montana, there are 2,969 locations which together pay nearly $1 \nmillion in the SOT every year. Seasonal resorts in Whitefish and \nYellowstone, ``mom and pop'' convenience stores in Butte, and bowling \nalleys, flower shops, and restaurants across Montana, and the United \nStates, pay the Federal Government over $100 million per year for the \nprivilege of running businesses that sell beer, wine, or alcoholic \nbeverages.\n  The SOT is extremely regressive. Retailers must annually pay $250 per \nlocation; wholesalers pay $500; vintners and distillers pay $1,000. \nBecause the SOT is levied on a per location basis, a sole \nproprietorship must pay the same amount as one of the nation's largest \nretailers, and locally-owned chains having to pay per location, would \nhave to pay as much as, if not more than, the nation's largest single \nsite brewery. This is not what Congress had in mind 150 years ago, and \nI don't believe it's a situation we want today.\n  Repealing the SOT on alcohol is supported by a broad-based group of \nbusiness organizations and enjoys wide-spread bipartisan support on \nCapitol Hill. Last year, we made progress in ending this burdensome tax \non small businesses. We repealed the tax for three years. More can be \ndone. Business owners across the United States deserve assurance that \nthey won't be hit with this antiquated tax down the line.\n  The legislation preserves the TTB's record-keeping requirements, \nwhile removing the agency's enforcement burden, and will save over $2 \nmillion per year. The GAO examined SOT efficacy several times, and \nfound it fundamentally flawed. The Joint Committee on Taxation called \nfor the elimination of SOT in its June 2001 simplification study.\n  More than 90 percent of all SOT revenue comes from retailers--a great \nmajority of those are small businesses. Our small business sector is a \ngreat strength of our economy. President Bush has said that the best \nway to encourage job growth is to let small businesses keep more of \ntheir own money, so they can invest in their business and make it \neasier for somebody to find work. Repealing the SOT would provide an \nimmediate and visible tax cut to small business owners.\n  In recent months, there has been much talk of tax reform inside the \nbeltway. President Bush has made tax reform one of his key priorities \nand established a panel that will make recommendations to the \nDepartment of Treasury for a better tax system. Getting rid of a tax \nthat has outlived its original purpose is one small step toward reform \nthat makes sense for Montana and our country. We urge our colleagues to \njoin us in this endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Interagency Council on Meeting the \nHousing and Service Needs of Seniors, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish an Interagency Council on Meeting the Housing and Service \nNeeds of Seniors, which will help the Federal Government work with its \npartners to meet the growing housing and related needs of senior \ncitizens around the country. The Interagency Council will work to \nbetter coordinate Federal programs so that seniors and their families \ncan access the programs and the services necessary to allow them to age \nin place or find suitable housing alternatives.\n  It is important that we take note of the needs of this rapidly \ngrowing senior population. In 2000, the population over 65 years of age \nwas 34.7 million. This number is expected to grow to over 50 million by \n2020. By the year 2030, nearly one-fifth of the United States \npopulation will be above 65 years of age.\n  In recognition of the importance of this issue, in 1999 Congress \nestablished the Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Facility \nNeeds for Seniors--``Seniors Commission''--to assess the Federal role \nin senior housing, health and supportive services. The Seniors\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nCommission made a number of significant findings. For example, the \ncommission found that seniors require a wide array of housing options \nwith access to services, including meal preparation, transportation, \nhealth care, and assistance with daily activities. According to the \nSeniors Commission, over 18 percent of senior citizens--over 5.8 \nmillion seniors--who do not reside in nursing facilities have \ndifficulty performing their daily activities without assistance. Over a \nmillion of these seniors are severely impaired, requiring assistance \nwith many of their basic tasks. Many other seniors, those that can \nperform their daily functions, still require access to health care, \ntransportation and other services. Without enhanced housing \nopportunities, such as service-enriched housing or assisted living \nfacilities, these seniors find it increasingly difficult to remain \noutside of nursing homes or other institutional settings. In fact, the \nSeniors Commission found that ``many seniors across the income spectrum \nare at risk of institutionalization or neglect due to declining health \nand the loss or absence of support and timely interventions.'' For many \nseniors, in-home care, service-enriched housing, retrofitted homes and \napartments, and assisted living-type facilities are sorely needed so \nthat seniors can access necessary services where they live.\n  While there are numerous Federal programs that assist seniors and \ntheir families in meeting these needs, they are fragmented across many \ngovernment agencies, with little or no coordination. In fact, the \nSeniors Commission found that ``the most striking characteristic of \nseniors' housing and health care in this country is the disconnection \nof one field from another.'' For example, housing assistance is \navailable from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nwhile health care and supportive services are most likely accessed \nthrough various branches of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, such as the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and \nthe Administration on Aging, as well as through the Department of \nTransportation and the Department of Labor.\n  The Seniors Commission concluded that ``the time has come for \ncoordination among Federal and State agencies and administrators.'' The \nlegislation I am introducing today, the ``Meeting the Housing and \nService Needs of Seniors Act of 2005,'' answers the commission's call \nto action by implementing the recommendation for better federal \ncoordination.\n  Through a high-level interagency council the Federal Government will \ntake a simple, but critical, step in addressing this fragmentation. \nThis Council will have a variety of functions. The council will review \nall Federal programs designed to assist seniors, identify gaps in \nservices, make recommendations about how to reduce duplication, \nidentify best practices for relevant programs and services, and most \nimportantly, work to improve the availability of housing and services \nfor seniors. The council will also monitor, evaluate, and recommend \nimprovements in existing programs and services that assist seniors in \nmeeting their housing and service needs at the Federal, State, and \nlocal level, and will work to more effectively coordinate programs at \nthe federal level, as well as at the state level, where many of the \ndecisions regarding health and service needs are made. In addition, the \ncouncil will be responsible for collecting and disseminating \ninformation, through a variety of means, about seniors and the programs \nand services relating to their needs. Through collaboration with the \nFederal Interagency Forum on Aging Statistics and the Census Bureau, \nthe council will consolidate data on these needs and identify and \naddress unmet data needs.\n  With improved collaboration and coordination among the Federal \nagencies and our State partners, we can ensure that seniors are better \nable to access housing and services. To ensure its effectiveness, the \ncouncil will be comprised of top-level officials who oversee the \nprograms which assist seniors in this country, including the \nSecretaries of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services; the Department of Labor; the \nDepartment of Transportation; and the Department of Veterans Affairs; \nas well as the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration; the \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and \nthe Administrator of the Administration for the Aging.\n  This is a step we must take. It is essential that we make it easier \nfor seniors and their families to access housing and supportive \nservices together, so that when faced with difficult decisions, they do \nnot have to navigate a confusing maze of programs and services, and \nwork through multiple bureaucracies. We must also make it simpler for \ndevelopers and providers to link housing and services so that greater \nsupportive housing opportunities are available to the senior \npopulation. Through the Interagency Council, it is my hope that we will \nmove toward a model of providing housing and services to seniors around \nthe country.\n  If we are to successfully address these growing needs, it is clear \nthat much work must be done. The establishment of an Interagency \nCouncil on Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors is a \ncritical first step in this endeavor. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill together with letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Meeting the Housing and \n     Service Needs of Seniors Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The senior population (persons 65 or older) in this \n     country is rapidly growing, and is expected to increase from \n     34,700,000 in 2000 to nearly 40,000,000 by 2010, and then \n     will dramatically increase to over 50,000,000 by 2020.\n       (2) By 2020, the population of ``older'' seniors, those \n     over age 85, is expected to double to 7,000,000, and then \n     double again to 14,000,000 by 2040.\n       (3) As the senior population increases, so does the need \n     for additional safe, decent, affordable, and suitable housing \n     that meets their unique needs.\n       (4) Due to the health care, transportation, and service \n     needs of seniors, issues of providing suitable and affordable \n     housing opportunities differ significantly from the housing \n     needs of other families.\n       (5) Seniors need access to a wide array of housing options, \n     such as affordable assisted living, in-home care, supportive \n     or service-enriched housing, and retrofitted homes and \n     apartments to allow seniors to age in place and to avoid \n     premature placement in institutional settings.\n       (6) While there are many programs in place to assist \n     seniors in finding and affording suitable housing and \n     accessing needed services, these programs are fragmented and \n     spread across many agencies, making it difficult for seniors \n     to access assistance or to receive comprehensive information.\n       (7) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, \n     as is better coordination at State and local levels, to \n     ensure that seniors can access government activities, \n     programs, services, and benefits in an effective and \n     efficient manner.\n       (8) Up to date, accurate, and accessible statistics on key \n     characteristics of seniors, including conditions, behaviors, \n     and needs, are required to accurately identify the housing \n     and service needs of seniors.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) The term ``housing'' means any form of residence, \n     including rental housing, homeownership, assisted living, \n     group home, supportive housing arrangement, nursing facility, \n     or any other physical location where a person can live.\n       (2) The term ``service'' includes transportation, health \n     care, nursing assistance, meal, personal care and chore \n     services, assistance with daily activities, mental health \n     care, physical therapy, case management, and any other \n     services needed by seniors to allow them to stay in their \n     housing or find alternative housing that meets their needs.\n       (3) The term ``program'' includes any Federal or State \n     program providing income support, health benefits or other \n     benefits to seniors, housing assistance, mortgages, mortgage \n     or loan insurance or guarantees, housing counseling, \n     supportive services, assistance with daily activities, or \n     other assistance for seniors.\n       (4) The term ``Council'' means the Interagency Council on \n     Meeting the Housing and Service Needs of Seniors.\n       (5) The term ``senior'' means any individual 65 years of \n     age or older.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Elderly Housing Coalition (EHC) \n     is comprised of organizations that represent providers of \n     affordable housing and supportive service for the elderly. We \n     are writing in enthusiastic support of your legislation that \n     would establish the Interagency Council on Housing and \n     Service Needs of Seniors. This Council is desperately needed \n     and will help federal, state and local governments better \n     serve the housing and service needs of our elderly \n     population.\n       According to the Congressional Commission on Affordable \n     Housing and Health Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st \n     Century, we must integrate our current fragmented system of \n     programs that seniors rely on to find the housing and \n     services they need. As the number of seniors grows \n     exponentially and will, in fact, have doubled by 2030, we \n     must find a way to use our resources more effectively.\n       Your bill will be a great first step to bringing the key \n     governmental agencies together to identify how they can best \n     work to maximize program efficiency and streamline access. \n     Again, we are pleased to offer our support for this \n     legislation establishing an interagency council and thank you \n     for your leadership on this issue.\n       If there is anything that the Elderly Housing Coalition can \n     do to help or if you have any questions about the EHC please \n     contact Nancy Libson or Alayna Waldrum at (202) 783-2242.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alliance for Retired Americans.\n       American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging.\n       American Association of Service Coordinators.\n       Association of Jewish Aging Services of North America.\n       B'nai B'rith International.\n       Catholic Charities USA.\n       Catholic Health Association of the United States.\n       Council of Large Public Housing Authorities.\n       Elderly Housing Development and Operations Corporation.\n       Kinship Caregiver Resources/Intergenerational Village \n     Project.\n       Local Initiatives Support Corporation.\n       National Association of Housing, Cooperatives.\n       National Association of Housing and Redevelopment \n     Officials.\n       National Housing Conference.\n       National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n       National PACE Association.\n       Stewards of Affordable Housing for the Future.\n       Volunteers of America.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2005.\n     Re Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs of \n         Seniors Legislation.\n\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of AAHSA, I am writing to \n     thank you for introducing legislation to establish an \n     Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs of Seniors. \n     AAHSA members serve two million people every day through \n     mission-driven, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to \n     providing the services people need, when they need them, in \n     the place they call home. Our members offer the continuum of \n     aging services: assisted living residences, continuing care \n     retirement communities, nursing homes, senior housing \n     facilities, and outreach services. AAHSA's mission is to \n     create the future of aging services through quality the \n     public can trust.\n       Half of our members own or operate federally subsidized \n     senior apartment buildings and work collaboratively with home \n     and community based service providers that operate programs \n     governed by a maze of departmental regulations. This unique \n     perspective gives us and our members a bird's eye view of how \n     important it is for the various federal agencies to work \n     together to ensure the best care in the most responsive and \n     efficient manner possible.\n       In 2002 the Commission on Affordable Housing and Health \n     Facility Needs for Seniors in the 21st Century reported to \n     Congress that a top priority for the federal government \n     should be integrating the existing fragmented system of \n     programs that seniors rely on to piece together the housing \n     and services they need. Time is precious--the United States \n     is facing exponential growth in our senior population, which \n     will double by 2030. AAHSA members have created a number of \n     successful models for combining services and senior housing. \n     Unfortunately these are limited and difficult to replicate \n     because of the programmatic barriers. Now is the time to get \n     the policymakers to the table to address the barriers and \n     opportunities that exist in our federal programs and how to \n     make them work.\n       We know that this can be done. AAHSA strongly supports your \n     bill, which will help the Executive branch and Federal \n     agencies better coordinate the successful aging programs, as \n     an important first step. Thank you for your leadership. If \n     there is anything that AAHSA or my staff can do to support \n     you, please do not hesitate to let me know. I can be reached \n     at (202) 783-2242.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Larry Minnix,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                         Service Coordinators,\n\n                                      Columbus, OH, April 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the 1,600 members of \n     the American Association of Service Coordinators (AASC), I \n     want to express our support for your proposed legislation to \n     establish an Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs \n     of Seniors. AASC believes that this bill is urgently needed \n     to assist service coordinators and others seeking to bring \n     together the various federal and other programs needed by \n     older persons and other special populations.\n       In my testimony, before the Commission on Affordable \n     Housing and Health Facility describing the present fragmented \n     system, I stated that ``even for long-time professionals, the \n     current `crazy-quilt' tapestry of services and shelter \n     options makes it difficult to fully grasp their complexities, \n     let alone try to access them. The results are confusion among \n     consumers, duplication of service delivery, government \n     agencies not knowing who supplies what service or that some \n     services even exist, reduction in qualified service workers, \n     regulations that impede dedicated service providers from \n     providing the service they were hired and want to perform.''\n       One of AASC recommendations to the Commission was the \n     establishment of a cabinet-level department that would \n     encompass in one entity housing, health care and other \n     federal support programs serving the elderly to better focus \n     federal policy and regulatory efforts, in conjunction with \n     states and communities. AASC believes that your bill is an \n     important step to establish a permanent national platform to \n     address many of the cross-cutting needs and issues \n     confronting increasing numbers of frail and vulnerable older \n     persons.\n       As you may know, AASC is a national, nonprofit organization \n     representing professional service coordinators who serve low-\n     income older persons and other special populations living in \n     federally assisted and public housing facilities nationwide, \n     their caregivers, and others in their local community. Our \n     dedicated membership consists of service coordinators, case \n     managers and social workers, housing managers and \n     administrators, housing management companies, public housing \n     authorities, state housing finance agencies, state and local \n     area agencies on aging and a broad range of national and \n     state organizations and professionals involved in affordable, \n     service-enhanced housing. Background information on AASC is \n     available on our website: www.servicercoordinators.org.\n       We are grateful for your leadership on the vital issue. \n     Please let me know how AASC\n\n[[Page S3211]]\n\n     can assist you to expedite enactment of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Janice Monks,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Elderly Housing Development &\n\n\n                                       Operations Corporation,\n\n                               Fort Lauderdale, FL, April 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am pleased that Elderly Housing \n     Development and Operations Corporation (EHDOC) representing \n     over 40 senior housing facilities in 14 states, is joining \n     with other non-profit organizations involved with federally \n     assisted senior housing to strongly support your bill to \n     establish an Interagency Council on Housing and Service Needs \n     of Seniors. We believe that the establishment of this \n     Interagency Council will provide a cost-effective and \n     efficient means to promote coordination between the various \n     federal agencies involved with senior housing and services, \n     particularly HUD and HHS.\n       EHDOC is well aware of the need to improve collaboration \n     between the various federal agencies based on our efforts to \n     assist low-income, frail elderly in Council House in \n     Suitland, MD. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to link \n     the various services needed to enable many frail elderly to \n     remain in their homes as they age due to the existing \n     fragmentation of federal housing, services and health care \n     policies and programs.\n       The difficulty experienced by EHDOC with linking housing \n     and services is repeated by many nonprofit sponsors of \n     federally assisted senior housing throughout the country. As \n     you know, I was I honored to serve as your appointee to the \n     recent Commission on Affordable Housing and Health Care \n     Facilities Needs of Older Persons. We repeatedly heard \n     testimony from public and private agencies involved with \n     senior housing, supportive services and health care, older \n     persons and others, of their difficulties in bringing \n     together these services to meet the needs of older persons.\n       As stated in the Senior Commissions' final report, ``the \n     very heart of this Commission's work is the recognition that \n     the housing and service needs of seniors traditionally have \n     been addressed in different `worlds' that often fail to \n     recognize or communicate with each other.'' Findings of the \n     Commission concluded ``while policymakers have struggled to \n     be responsive to the needs of seniors, the very structure of \n     Congressional committees and Federal agencies often makes it \n     difficult to address complex needs in a comprehensive and \n     coordinated fashion. For example: medical needs of seniors \n     are addressed by Medicare and Medicaid; social service needs \n     are addressed by Medicaid, the OAA, and other block grant \n     programs; housing programs are administered by HUD and the \n     Department of Agriculture's RHS; and transportation programs \n     are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation \n     (DOT).''\n       We commend you for your leadership in addressing this \n     critical need to effectively bring together the various \n     federal agencies and others involved with affordable housing \n     and service needs of older persons through the establishment \n     of an Interagency Council on Senior Housing. Please let me if \n     you have any questions or how EHDOC can assist you with the \n     enactment of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        National PACE Association,\n                                                    April 5, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the National PACE \n     Association (NPA), I want to express our support for your \n     bill to establish an Interagency Council on Housing and \n     Service Needs of Seniors. NPA believes that this legislation \n     is essential to provide effective linkages between housing, \n     health care and services, and that the proposed Interagency \n     Council will facilitate an effective national forum to \n     promote coordination among key federal agencies involved with \n     these programs, particularly HUD, HHS, CMS, and DOT.\n       As you may know, NPA represents non-profit organizations in \n     21 states, including Hopkins ElderPlus in Baltimore that are \n     providers of PACE--a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the \n     Elderly. PACE programs coordinate and provide all needed \n     preventive, primary, acute and long term care services so \n     that older persons can continue living in the community. PACE \n     serves individuals who are aged 55 or older, certified by \n     their state to need nursing home care, are able to live \n     safely in the community, and live in a state designated PACE \n     service area. PACE provides a ``one stop shop'' for health \n     and long-term care, and our members clearly understand \n     through their extensive experience with the holistic needs of \n     frail elderly, the interrelationship between housing, \n     services, health and long-term care.\n       While housing is not a direct PACE benefit, our members \n     have long recognized the importance of housing as a vital \n     aspect of promoting wellness and quality of life for older \n     persons. In fact, nearly all PACE programs nationwide serve \n     enrollees who reside in public and federally assisted \n     multifamily senior housing, and nearly one third of our \n     members co-locate their PACE health care centers with senior \n     housing or assisted living. Unfortunately, it is often \n     difficult to link housing, services and health care due to \n     conflicting funding streams, licensing, eligibility, and \n     other factors.\n       Additional background information on PACE, NPA, and our \n     members are available at our website: www.npaonline.org. Our \n     members strongly support your bill and the prompt \n     establishment of an Interagency Council on Senior Housing and \n     Services. We are grateful for your leadership with this \n     effort. Please let me know if you have any questions or how \n     NPA can assist you with this effort to benefit low-income, \n     frail elderly.

A bill to reduce preterm labor and delivery and the risk of \npregnancy-related deaths and complications due to pregnancy, and to \nreduce infant mortality caused by prematurity; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver \nInfants Early Act, or PREEMIE Act. This bipartisan bill expands \nresearch into the causes and prevention of prematurity, babies born 3 \nweeks or more early, and increases education and support services \nrelated to prematurity. I am pleased that Senator Dodd is once again my \npartner on this legislation and we hope the Senate will pass the \nPREEMIE Act in this Congress.\n  In June 2004, the Subcommittee on Children and Families, which I \nchaired, held a hearing to learn about the problem of premature birth. \nUnfortunately, Tennessee has the fourth highest rate of premature birth \nin the country. Fourteen percent of Tennessee babies are born \nprematurely. In an average week in Tennessee, 210 babies are born \nprematurely. Premature infants are 14 times more likely to die in the \nfirst year of life. It is the No. 1 cause of infant death in the first \nmonth of life. Premature babies who survive may suffer lifelong \nconsequences including: cerebral palsy, mental retardation, chronic \nlung disease, and vision and hearing loss.\n  In February 2004, the National Center for Health Statistics, NCHS, \nreported the first increase in the U.S. infant mortality rate since \n1958, from 6.8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2001 to 7.0 in \n2000. This increase is extremely disturbing because the infant \nmortality rate is a measure of the health of society. NCHS subsequently \nreported that 61 percent of this increase in infant mortality was due \nto an increase in the birth of premature and low birthweight babies. \nAlmost half the cases of premature birth have no known cause--any \npregnant woman is at risk. We must address this issue.\n  Finally, this is a costly problem. In 2002, the estimated charges for \nhospital stays for infants with a diagnosis of preterm birth or low \nbirthweight, LBW, were $15.5 billion. The average hospital charge per \ninfant stay with a principal diagnosis of prematurity/LBW was $79,000, \nwith an average hospital stay of 24.2 days. Hospital charges for \nnewborn stays without complications averaged $1,500 in 2002, with an \naverage hospital stay of 2.0 days. Employers carry much of the burden. \nAlmost half of that $15.5 billion was billed to employers or other \nprivate insurers, according to the March of Dimes. The other half is \nbilled to Medicaid.\n  As a nation, we must address this problem. The PREEMIE Act calls for \nexpanding Federal research related to preterm labor and delivery and \nincreasing public and provider education and support services. It is \nsupported by the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the \nAssociation of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, and many \nothers.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in the fight to ensure a healthy \nstart for all of American's children by cosponsoring and working with \nme for passage of the PREEMIE Act during this Congress.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 707\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prematurity Research \n     Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early \n     Act'' or the ``PREEMIE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Premature birth is a serious and growing problem. The \n     rate of preterm birth increased 27 percent between 1982 and \n     2002 (from 9.4 percent to 11.9 percent). In 2001, more than \n     480,000 babies were born prematurely in the United States.\n       (2) Preterm birth accounts for 24 percent of deaths in the \n     first month of life.\n       (3) Premature infants are 14 times more likely to die in \n     the first year of life.\n       (4) Premature babies who survive may suffer lifelong \n     consequences, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation, \n     chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss.\n       (5) Preterm and low birthweight birth is a significant \n     financial burden in health care. The estimated charges for \n     hospital stays for infants with any diagnosis of prematurity/\n     low birthweight were $15,500,000,000 in 2002. The average \n     lifetime medical costs of a premature baby are conservatively \n     estimated at $500,000.\n       (6) The proportion of preterm infants born to African-\n     American mothers (17.3 percent) was significantly higher \n     compared to the rate of infants born to white mothers (10.6 \n     percent). Prematurity or low birthweight is the leading cause \n     of death for African-American infants.\n       (7) The cause of approximately half of all premature births \n     is unknown.\n       (8) Women who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely as \n     nonsmokers to give birth to a low birthweight baby. Babies \n     born to smokers weigh, on average, 200 grams less than \n     nonsmokers' babies.\n       (9) To reduce the rates of preterm labor and delivery more \n     research is needed on the underlying causes of preterm \n     delivery, the development of treatments for prevention of \n     preterm birth, and treatments improving outcomes for infants \n     born preterm.\n       (b) Purposes.--It the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) reduce rates of preterm labor and delivery;\n       (2) work toward an evidence-based standard of care for \n     pregnant women at risk of preterm labor or other serious \n     complications, and for infants born preterm and at a low \n     birthweight; and\n       (3) reduce infant mortality and disabilities caused by \n     prematurity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years \n     2005 through 2009.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Alexander in \nreintroducing the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for \nMothers Who Deliver Infants Early (PREEMIE) Act--legislation intended \nto address the growing crisis of premature birth in our nation.\n  I think when many of us hear about a baby being born early, we don't \ngive much thought to what it means. After all, it is not all that \nuncommon--I'm sure that almost all of my colleagues knows someone born \nprematurely. Thanks to modem medicine it is also not uncommon for a \nbaby born early to end up healthy and happy.\n  But this feeling that prematurity is somehow ``normal'' or to be \nexpected masks a growing health crisis. Prematurity has real \nconsequences in health and economic terms. We need to bring to light \nthis issue that affects some of the most vulnerable members of our \nsociety: newborn babies.\n  As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) \nCommittee I, along with my colleagues, have devoted much time and \neffort to improving the health of our nation's children and infants. \nAnd yet despite our efforts, the problem of prematurity continues to \npersist and even grow. What is so striking about prematurity is how \nmany parents face these enormous emotional and financial burdens. \nNearly 1 out of every 8 babies in the United States is born \nprematurely--that's 1,300 babies each day, and over 470,000 each year \n(including more than 4,000 in my home state of Connecticut).\n  Despite all of the health care advances of the last decades, the \nproblem of prematurity is not in any way abating. According to recent \ndata released by the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2002 the \ninfant mortality rate actually increased for the first time since 1958. \nMuch of this increase is attributable to infant death in the\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nfirst month of life--of which prematurity is the leading cause. Since \n1981, the premature birth rate has increased by 27 percent. This stands \nin stark contrast to some of the breathtaking medical discoveries of \nthe past two decades. We can now treat and even cure many types of \ncancer, but we can't prevent babies from being born too soon.\n  Mr. President, the consequences of prematurity are devastating. As I \nmentioned earlier, it is the leading cause of neonatal death--a tragedy \nthat no family should have to face. For those infants that survive, a \nlifetime of severe health problems is not uncommon. Prematurity has \nbeen linked to such long-term health problems as cerebral palsy, mental \nretardation, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss. \nPremature babies have the deck stacked against them from the moment \nthey are born. And even in the fortunate cases where there are no life-\nlong health consequences, the experience of a premature birth takes an \nenormous emotional toll on a family.\n  Prematurity also carries a significant economic cost. According to a \nrecent study conducted by the March of Dimes, hospitalizations due to \nprematurity cost a total of $15.5 billion during the year 2002--\naccounting for nearly half of all hospital charges for infants in this \ncountry. And this number does not even include the cost of care for \nproblems later in life resulting from a premature birth. Much of this \ncost falls on employers who are already bearing the weight of \nskyrocketing health care costs.\n  Given the emotional and economic toll that prematurity takes on this \ncountry, we know remarkably little about why it happens, and how it can \nbe prevented. Some of the risk factors associated with preterm birth \nare known, including advanced age of the mother, smoking, and certain \nchronic diseases. But nearly 50 percent of all premature births have no \nknown cause. And because we know so little about the causes of \nprematurity, we also do not know how to prevent it.\n  For such a large (and growing) problem, it is astounding how little \nwe know. It is critical that we make a national commitment to solving \nthis puzzle. We must do everything we can to expand research--both \npublic and private--into the root causes of prematurity.\n  Senator Alexander and I are introducing the PREEMIE Act for precisely \nthis reason. Our bill would coordinate and expand research related to \nprematurity at the Federal level. It would also educate health care \nproviders and the general public about the risks of prematurity, and \nmeasures that can be taken before and during pregnancy to prevent it. \nPregnant mothers need to know the warning signs and symptoms of \npremature labor--and they need to know what to do if they begin to \nnotice those signs.\n  Finally, because we will never eliminate prematurity completely, our \nlegislation would provide support services to families impacted by a \npremature birth. As we're investigating the causes of prematurity and \nincreasing awareness in expectant parents, we need to reach out to the \nmothers and fathers across our country whose children are born too \nsoon. We need to give them emotional support during the difficult days, \nweeks, and months that often follow a premature birth. We need to make \nsure that the doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who care for \npremature babies are sensitive to the needs of their parents, their \nbrothers, and their sisters. And we need to make sure that when the \ntime finally comes to bring a premature baby home, parents have all the \ninformation they need to make that transition.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will complement and support some \nof the efforts going on in the private sector--such as the March of \nDimes ambitious campaign to increase public awareness and reduce the \nrate of preterm birth. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Wyden (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 708. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide medicare beneficiaries with access to information concerning \nthe quality of care provided by skilled nursing facilities and to \nprovide incentives to skilled nursing facilities to improve the quality \nof care provided by those facilities by linking the amount of payment \nunder the medicare program to quality reporting and performance \nrequirements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long Term \nCare Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2005. Medicare \nspending for skilled nursing facilities grew rapidly during the late \n1980s and 1990s increasing from almost $4 billion in 1992 to $12.9 \nbillion in 1997. While spending has increased under Medicare, there has \nnot been an effort to reward skilled nursing facilities that have \nprovided exceptional care to seniors.\n  The bill I am introducing today with my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, will establish a system to reward skilled nursing \nfacilities that provide exceptional care. We should take steps to \nensure that skilled nursing facilities that are providing the best care \nbe rewarded. We must also create incentives for other facilities to \nstrive to provide excellent care.\n  The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act \nof 2005 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish \n10 to 15 quality measures for skilled nursing facilities. While \nestablishing these measures, the Secretary must consult with residents \nof skilled nursing facilities, patient advocacy organizations, state \nregulatory representatives, representatives from the skilled nursing \nfacility industry and quality measure experts. The quality ratings for \nthe facilities will then be published on the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services' website and published in newspapers with a national \ncirculation.\n  The quality measures created by this bill will be used as an \nincentive for facilities to provide excellent care. Skilled nursing \nfacilities that submit data shall receive a full market basket update \nand starting in fiscal year 2006 skilled nursing facilities that are in \nthe top 10 percent of facilities will receive a 2 percent payment \nbonus. Skilled nursing facilities that are below the top 10 percent, \nbut within the top 20 percent shall receive a one percent payment \nbonus.\n  The increased public disclosure of facility-specific quality data and \nthe financial incentives included in this bill will spur competition \nand improved performance in skilled nursing facilities. I believe that \nwe need to help the 77 million elderly and disabled Americans who are \nin nursing homes by making sure they receive the highest quality care \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my fellow Senators and \nwith the chairman of the Finance Committee on this important bill in \nthe upcoming months, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Wyden. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I am introducing \ntoday, ``The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Act''.\n  As we begin discussions on how to assure that we reward quality \nhealth care, I believe we need to include long term care as part of \nthat discussion. Nursing homes sever some of the most vulnerable among \nus, and assuring quality of care is encouraged and rewarded is \nimportant. I hope that this bill will spark a serious debate about how \nwe pay for quality care. This proposal establishes a voluntary system \nunder which nursing homes providing better quality of care would \nreceive higher payment and in turn would provide more information about \nthe quality of care provided. Information would include nurse staffing \nratios and would be made public to consumers and their families.\n  Historically, Americans have been paying the same for quality health \ncare as for mediocre care. Efforts have been made by some in the \nprivate sector to better recognize and provide incentives for those \nproviders who consistently provide a higher level of care. The \nInstitute of Medicine in its report ``Leading by Example,'' declared \nthe government should take the lead in improving health care by giving \nfinancial rewards to hospitals and doctors who improve care for \nbeneficiaries in six Federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid \nand the Veterans Health Administration. The IOM report also said the \ngovernment should collect and make available to the public data \ncomparing\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\nthe quality of care among poviders. The Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services has begun pilot programs. I think nursing homes \nshould also be an area in which we explore payment policies that regard \nthose providing a higher quality of care.\n  I look forward to continuing the discussion with all stakeholders \nabout these concepts so we can assure a high level of care and find \nways to help providers improve the level of care they provide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 709. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \ngrant program to provide supportive services in permanent supportive \nhousing for chronically homeless individuals, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague, Senator \nJack Reed, to reintroduce the Services for Ending Long-Term \nHomelessness Act. I would like to thank Senator Reed for his support in \nintroducing this bill and for his dedication and commitment to this \nissue. I also would like to thank Senator Burr for his work on this \nbill. Senator Burr introduced a similar version of this bill when he \nwas a member of the House of Representatives. I appreciate his support \nand the support of Senator Dodd, as well. Both are co-sponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  The chronically homeless represent about 10 percent of the entire \nhomeless population, but consume a majority of the services. There are \napproximately 200,000 to 250,000 people who experience chronic \nhomelessness. Those numbers include the heads of families, as well.\n  Tragically, for these individuals, the periods of homelessness are \nmeasured in years--not weeks or months. They tend to have disabling \nhealth and behavioral health problems: 40 percent have substance abuse \ndisorders, 25 percent have a physical disability, and 20 percent have \nserious mental illness. These factors often contribute to a person \nbecoming homeless, in the first place, and are certainly an impediment \nto overcoming it.\n  The President has set a goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 \nyears. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, chaired \nby the Ohio Department of Mental Health Director, Mike Hogan, \nrecommended that a comprehensive program be created to facilitate \naccess to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who \nare chronically homeless. This recommendation is so important because \naffordable housing, alone, is not enough for this hard to reach group. \nAnd, temporary shelter-housing does not provide the stability and \nservices needed to provide long-term positive outcomes. Only supportive \nhousing, where the chronically homeless can receive shelter and \nservices, such as mental health and substance abuse treatment, has been \neffective in decreasing their chances of returning to the streets and \nincreasing their chances for leading productive lives.\n  Not only is it right to help this group of hard to reach individuals, \nbut it is also fiscally responsible. This group is one of the most \nexpensive groups to serve. As I mentioned previously, they represent 10 \npercent of the overall homeless population, however, they consume a \nmajority of homeless services. They consume the most emergency housing \nand health care services, which are also the most costly to provide. By \nencouraging supportive housing, we are providing the services necessary \nfor these individuals and families to really get back on their feet. We \ncan either continue to provide expensive emergency services to these \nneedy people or we can give them the right kind of help--the type of \nhelp they need for their long-term well-being and the long-term well-\nbeing of our communities.\n  Unfortunately, current programs for funding services in permanent \nsupportive housing, other than those administered by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, were not designed to be coordinated with \nhousing programs. These programs also were not designed to meet the \nchallenging needs of this specific subgroup of the homeless. That is \nwhy the bill we are introducing today would provide the authorization \nto fund services for supportive housing by providing grants which can \nbe used with existing programs through HUD and state and local \ncommunities.\n  Our bill also would encourage those who provide services to the \nchronically homeless, such as SAMHSA within the Department of Health \nand Human Services, to work with and coordinate their efforts with \nthose who provide the physical housing, such as HUD. Under the current \nadministration, these two departments have started to truly coordinate \ntheir efforts, and this bill would encourage and support that continued \ncollaboration.\n  This is a good bill, Mr. President, and it could make a real \ndifference in the lives of so many individuals in need. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us in support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Services for Ending Long-\n     Term Homelessness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nationally, there are approximately 200,000 to 250,000 \n     people who experience chronic homelessness, including some \n     families with children. Chronically homeless people often \n     live in shelters or on the streets for years at a time, \n     experience repeated episodes of homelessness without \n     achieving housing stability, or cycle between homelessness, \n     jails, mental health facilities, and hospitals.\n       (2) The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \n     recommended the development and implementation of a \n     comprehensive plan designed to facilitate access to 150,000 \n     units of permanent supportive housing for consumers and \n     families who are chronically homeless. The Commission found \n     that affordable housing alone is insufficient for many people \n     with severe mental illness, and that flexible, mobile, \n     individualized support services are also necessary to support \n     and sustain consumers in their housing.\n       (3) Congress and the President have set a goal of ending \n     chronic homelessness in 10 years.\n       (4) Permanent supportive housing is a proven and cost \n     effective solution to chronic homelessness. A recent study by \n     the University of Pennsylvania found that each unit of \n     supportive housing for homeless people with mental illness in \n     New York City resulted in public savings of $16,281 per year \n     in systems of care such as mental health, human services, \n     health care, veterans' affairs, and corrections.\n       (5) Current programs for funding services in permanent \n     supportive housing, other than those administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, were not \n     designed to be closely coordinated with housing resources, \n     nor were they designed to meet the multiple needs of people \n     who are chronically homeless.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL \n                   HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 501(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     290aa(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (17), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (18), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(19) collaborate with Federal departments and programs \n     that are part of the President's Interagency Council on \n     Homelessness, particularly the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development, the Department of Labor, and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and with other agencies \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     particularly the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration, the Administration on Children and Families, \n     and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to design \n     national strategies for providing services in supportive \n     housing that will assist in ending chronic homelessness and \n     to implement programs that address chronic homelessness.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. GRANTS FOR SERVICES FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS \n                   INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.\n\n       Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``PART J--GRANTS FOR SERVICES TO END CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS\n\n     ``SEC. 596.

Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, Senators DeWine, \nDodd and Burr to introduce the Services for Ending Long-Term \nHomelessness Act, (SELHA).\n  It is estimated that two to three million Americans experience a \nperiod of homelessness in a given year. While the majority of these \nindividuals find themselves homeless for a brief period of time, a \ngrowing segment are experiencing prolonged periods of homelessness. \nRoughly 200,000 to 250,000 Americans fall under the category of \nchronically homeless.\n  In March 2003, former Department of Health and Human Services \nSecretary Tommy Thompson issued a report from a work group and an \ninteragency subcommittee that was assembled to define the issues and \nchallenges facing the chronically homeless and develop a comprehensive \napproach to bringing the appropriate services and treatments to this \npopulation of individuals who typically fall outside of mainstream \nsupport programs.\n  Similarly, the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health \nrecommended the development of a comprehensive plan to facilitate \naccess to permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who \nare chronically homeless. However, affordable housing, alone, is not \nenough for many chronically homeless to achieve stability. This \npopulation also needs flexible, mobile, and individualized support \nservices to sustain them in housing.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is critical to the \ndevelopment and implementation of more effective strategies to combat \nchronic homelessness through improved service delivery and coordination \nacross Federal agencies serving this population. It directs the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to coordinate \ntheir efforts not only with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, but with other Federal departments and the various \nagencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that \nprovide supportive services.\n  Mr. President, SELHA is an important bipartisan measure which will \nhelp to ensure that the growing number of Americans experiencing \nchronic homelessness have access to the range of supportive services \nthey need to get them back on their feet, living in permanent \nsupportive housing and taking the steps necessary to become productive \nand active members of our communities again.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues toward expeditious \npassage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 711. A bill to amend the Methane Hydrate Research and Development \nAct of 2000 to reauthorize that Act and to promote the research, \nidentification, assessment, exploration, and development of methane \nhydrate resources; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to re-\nauthorize a critical program for our energy future. It is widely \nbelieved that the U.S. must diversify its energy portfolio and explore \nnew domestic sources and technologies for energy to curb our dependence \non foreign oil. As a senior member of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, I know we have\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nbeen assessing the potential for a variety of energy sources for the \nfuture including natural gas, clean coal technology, nuclear energy, \nrenewable energy, and others. This bill, the Methane Hydrate Research \nand Development Reauthorization Act of 2005, will reauthorize a small \nbut important program on methane hydrate research and development, a \nkey and abundant non-conventional source of energy.\n  I would like to extend my appreciation to my cosponsors, Senators \nMurkowski and Stevens, who share my interest and determination in \nexploring the potential of methane hydrates for energy production. We \nshare a common goal to see that we fully understand the prospects for \nthis domestic energy resource. This new legislation will foster the \nresearch and development needed to expand our knowledge to better \nassess both the opportunities and challenges this potential energy \nresource presents. Our legislation provides for a higher level of \nscientific research and partnering between government agencies, \nacademic institutions, and industry.\n  The United States and the world will require substantially increased \nquantities of natural gas, electricity, and transportation fuels over \nthe next 20 years. Global competition for tightening supplies of oil \nand natural gas with emerging economies such as China and India will \ndrive energy prices higher, and makes it apparent that the United \nStates needs to capitalize upon its domestic energy resources. The \nUnited States must continue to diversify and expand the Nation's access \nto natural gas supplies through continuing research and development \nefforts in technologies for tapping non-conventional natural gas \nsupplies, such as methane hydrates.\n  Methane hydrates were discovered in the 1960s and consist of methane \ngas trapped in lattice-like ice. They are found largely in ocean bottom \nsediments lying below 450 meters and in permafrost. There are several \npublished estimates of the total amount of methane stored in gas \nhydrates worldwide. These estimates vary. However, it is widely \nbelieved that there is more energy potentially stored in methane \nhydrates than in all other known fossil fuel reserves, combined. The \nNational Commission on Energy Policy's December 2004 report, Ending the \nEnergy Stalemate--A Bipartisan Strategy To Meet America's Energy \nChallenges, estimated that the United States could possess one quarter \nof the world's supply of methane hydrates.\n  The United States will consume increasing volumes of natural gas well \ninto the 21st century. United States natural gas consumption is \nexpected to increase from approximately 22 trillion cubic feet in 2003 \nto more than 32 trillion cubic feet in 2020--a projected increase of 40 \npercent. Natural gas is expected to take on a greater role in power \ngeneration, largely because of the increasing demand for clean fuels \nand the relatively low capital costs of building new natural gas-fired \npower equipment. The National Commission on Energy Policy reported that \nthe United States resource base may contain up to two hundred thousand \ntrillion cubic feet of methane, onshore in the Alaskan permafrost, and \noffshore on much of the Nation's deep continental shelf. If even one \npercent of the estimated domestic resource base proves commercially \nviable, it would roughly double the Nation's technically recoverable \nnatural gas reserves, according to the Department of Energy's Office of \nFossil Energy.\n  Given the growing demand for natural gas, the development of new, \ncost-effective supplies can play a major role in moderating price \nincreases and ensuring consumer confidence in the long-term \navailability of reliable, affordable fuel. Today, the potential to \nextract commercially-relevant quantities of natural gas from hydrates \nis not yet viable. With no incentive to fund its own research and \ndevelopment, the private sector is not vigorously pursuing the research \ncurrently needed that could make methane hydrates technically and \neconomically viable. Therefore, cooperation between the federal \ngovernment and private industry remains the best effort in which the \nUnited States can explore the viability of an energy resource whose \nlong-range possibilities might one day dramatically change the world's \nenergy portfolio.\n  Uncertainties exist regarding the nature of these deposits and, in \nparticular, how best to extract the enormous quantity of natural gas \nthey contain in an economic and environmentally sensitive manner. \nHowever, some alternatives are worse. For example, transporting natural \ngas from foreign gas fields to the United States by shipping it in \nliquid form at negative 162 degrees Celsius is an expensive undertaking \nand one that is attractive to terrorists. Methane hydrates, on the \nother hand, can be found domestically, in Alaska and the Gulf of \nMexico, and with our ally to the north, Canada. Hydrates are likely to \nprovide commercially viable natural gas supplies by 2025. Their long \nterm potential to meet United States energy demands for natural gas is \nconsiderable.\n  The Methane Hydrate Research Act of 2000 invigorated methane hydrate \nresearch in the United States. The act also mandated that the National \nResearch Council study the program initiated by the act and to make \nrecommendations for future research and development needs. Without a \ndoubt, the National Research Council concluded in its 2004 report, \nCharting the Future of Methane Hydrate Research in the United States, \nthat the U.S. must continue its investment in hydrates research and \ndevelopment because of the size of the resource. Furthermore, the \nreport commended the program's excellent coordination and cooperation \nbetween federal agencies, industry, and academia involved in methane \nhydrates research. The legislation I am introducing incorporates the \nrecommendations of the National Research Council, and improves upon the \nact by requiring external scientific peer reviews, strengthening the \nadvisory panel, broadening the field work proposals to include test \nwells, increasing the appropriations needed to conduct the research, \nand emphasizing the need to promote education and training in the field \nof methane hydrate research and resource development. The bill also \nincorporates comments from the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, science and technology have and will continue to help \nus learn more about our world, and I believe, help us solve some of our \ntoughest problems, not only domestically but globally. These are \ncomplex and significant problems relating to the impact of human \nactivities on our environment, our heavy dependence on finite fossil \nfuels from sources that may not prove reliable, and limited energy \nsupplies in the face of growing demands of expanding national economies \nthat are increasingly intertwined in a global economic network. I \nbelieve the Federal Government must continue to foster the needed \nresearch and development in the field of methane hydrate research.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor today \nto introduce legislation of vital importance to our Nation. Enactment \nof the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Reauthorization Act of \n2005\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\nwill provide the authorizations necessary to unlock a potentially huge \nsupply of domestic natural gas, enough gas to supply our Nation for \ngenerations.\n  However, before I introduce this legislation, I would first like to \nthank my good friend and colleague, Senator Akaka, for his dedication \nto helping address our Nation's energy crisis through legislation that \nshould dramatically increase our domestic supply of environmentally \nfriendly, clean burning natural gas. Without Senator Akaka's hard work \nand focus on this issue we would not be introducing this legislation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is facing an energy crisis. Oil and natural \ngas prices are at historic or near historic high levels. Oil prices are \nover $50 a barrel. Natural gas prices are over $7.00 a MMBtu. Indeed, \nUnited States natural gas prices have increased by almost 350 percent \nsince 1998 and are currently the highest in the world. Despite this \nhuge increase in cost, domestic natural gas production has declined by \nalmost 5 percent and Canadian imports have declined by almost 25 \npercent from 2001 to 2004. Estimates are that during the past 5 years \nUnited States natural gas consumers have paid nearly $200 billion more \nfor natural gas than they paid in the preceding 5 years.\n  These extraordinarily high natural gas prices are having a profound \nimpact on every segment of our economy. Chairman Greenspan identified \nour current natural gas price and supply situation as a crisis that \ncould have a devastating impact on the United States economy. In fact, \nestimates are that the natural gas crisis has significantly contributed \nto the loss of 2.5 million United States manufacturing jobs. Indeed, \nthe ongoing ``demand destruction'' caused by current gas prices with \nits devastating impact on United States manufacturing will only \ncontinue unless we address the current natural gas supply shortage and \nhigh prices.\n  Today, the United States produces about 22 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas each year. By 2025, the Energy Information Administration \nestimates that United States natural gas consumption will reach 31 \ntrillion cubic feet. That's an increase of more than 40 percent. Much \nof the new electric generation that will come on line during the next \ntwo decades will require natural gas according to a study by the \nAmerican Gas Foundation. Indeed, clean burning natural gas remains the \npremium fossil fuel for electric power generation.\n  The EIA estimates that by 2025 the United States will produce only \n21.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas meeting just 70 percent of the \nNation's expected demand. Thus, absent securing a new domestic supply \nof gas, the United States will have to import 30 percent of its natural \ngas supply. We have already gone down this path with our petroleum \nsupplies. We have witnessed the unacceptable national security, balance \nof payments and general economic consequences of this level of reliance \non foreign sources for our nation's critical supply of oil. We must not \nrepeat this reality with natural gas.\n  This is why I am proud to introduce the Methane Hydrate Research and \nDevelopment Reauthorization Act of 2005. As stated in the findings \nsection of the legislation, the National Research Council has estimated \nthe total United States methane hydrate resource base to be on the \norder of 200,000 trillion cubic feet. Alaska alone is thought to have \npotential hydrate resources of 32,000 trillion cubic feet. Indeed, a \nreport issued by the National Commission on Energy Policy states that \nthe United States may be endowed with over one-fourth of the methane \nhydrate deposits in the world. This is an immense supply of secure, \ndomestic energy that could supply our country for many, many years.\n  The Methane Hydrate Reauthorization Act of 2005 builds upon the \nsuccess of the original Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of \n2000. The new act incorporates certain changes to the 2000 legislation \nsuggested by the National Research Council of the National Academies \nand the Department of Energy. The 2000 act established an advisory \npanel to advise the Secretary of Energy on potential applications of \nmethane hydrate and to assist in developing recommendations and \npriorities for methane hydrate research and development programs. The \nnew act strengthens the role of the advisory panel to ensure that the \nresearch funds are put to their most effective use. The 2005 act also \nincreases the use of a scientific peer review process in determining \nwhich projects will be funded. Further, the new legislation directs the \nfunding of fellowships and graduate education and training programs to \nestablish a solid, scientific foundation of expertise in the United \nStates on methane hydrates. Finally, the 2005 act authorizes increased \nfunding for the methane hydrate program. The increased funding is \ncritical in order to allow for the transition from a largely research \noriented program to one that will foster the beginning of the \ncommercialization of our Nation's methane hydrate resources.\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Akaka and his staff for their hard work and \ncommitment to this legislation that is so important to our nation's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3220-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 95--RELATING TO THE DEATH OF THE HOLY FATHER, POPE \n                              JOHN PAUL II\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nSantorum, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. \nAllen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nBond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Burr, Mr. \nByrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, \nMr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. DeMint, \nMr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ensign, \nMr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nGregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Mr. Kohl Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLevin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Martinez, \nMr. McCain, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Agricultural Export \n     Facilitation Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2902. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The export sector of United States agriculture makes an \n     important positive contribution to this country's trade \n     balance.\n       (2) The total value of United States exports of \n     agricultural products shipped to Cuba since 2000 when such \n     sales were first authorized by Congress is approximately \n     $1,000,000,000, including transportation, port fees, and \n     insurance costs. In December 2001, Cuba purchased \n     approximately $4,300,000 in food and agricultural products. \n     In 2002, Cuba purchased approximately $138,600,000 in food \n     and agricultural products. In 2003, Cuba purchased \n     approximately $256,900,000 in food and agricultural products. \n     In 2004, Cuba purchased approximately $380,000,000 in food \n     and agricultural products. Cuba ranked at the bottom of 226 \n     agricultural export markets for United States companies in \n     2001; ranked 50th of 226 in 2002; ranked 35th of 219 in 2003; \n     and ranked approximately 25th of 228 in 2004. Cuba is \n     therefore an important source of revenue for United States \n     agriculture and its affiliated industries, such as \n     manufacturers and distributors of value-added food products.\n       (3) To be competitive in sales to Cuban purchasers, United \n     States exporters of agricultural products and their \n     representatives, including representatives of United States \n     air or sea carriers, ports and shippers, must have ready and \n     reliable physical access to Cuba. Such access is currently \n     uncertain because, under existing regulations, United States \n     exporters and their representatives must apply for and \n     receive special Treasury Department licenses to travel to \n     Cuba to engage in sales-related activities. The issuance of \n     such licenses is subject to both administrative delays and \n     periodic denials. A blanket statutory authorization for sales \n     and transport-related travel to Cuba by United States \n     exporters will remove the current bureaucratic impediment to \n     agricultural product sales endorsed by Congress when it \n     passed the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \n     of 2000.\n       (4) On many occasions United States visas have been delayed \n     and often denied to prospective Cuban purchasers of products \n     authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000. The result has been that family \n     farmers and other small producers and distributors of \n     agricultural products who lack the resources to fund sales \n     delegations to Cuba have been denied access to potential \n     purchasers in that country. A simple solution is for the \n     Department of State to issue visas to Cuban nationals who \n     demonstrate an itinerary of meetings with prospective United \n     States exporters of products authorized under the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. In \n     addition, visas should be issued to Cuban phytosanitary \n     inspectors who require entry into the United States to \n     conduct on-premise inspections of production and processing \n     facilities and the products of potential United States \n     exporters.\n       (5) The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \n     of 2000 requires ``payment of cash in advance'' for United \n     States agricultural exports to Cuba. Some Federal agencies \n     responsible for the implementation of the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have expressed the \n     view that ``cash in advance'' requires that payment be \n     received by a United States exporter in advance of shipment \n     of goods to\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n     Cuba. Indeed, late last year payments due United States \n     exporters from purchasers in Cuba were frozen in United \n     States banks while the terms of those payments were reviewed \n     unnecessarily. This action by the Department of the Treasury \n     has created a climate of commercial uncertainty that has \n     inhibited agricultural sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform \n     and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to Cuba.\n       (6) There is nothing in either the Trade Sanctions Reform \n     and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 itself or its legislative \n     history to support the view that Congress intended payment to \n     be made in advance of the shipment of goods from this country \n     to Cuba. It was and is the intent of Congress that a seller \n     of a product authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n     Export Enhancement Act of 2000 receive payment only before a \n     Cuban purchaser takes physical possession of that product.\n       (7) At present it is the policy of the United States \n     Government to prohibit direct payment between Cuban and \n     United States financial institutions. As a result, Cuban \n     purchasers of products authorized under the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 must route their \n     payments through third country banks that charge a fee for \n     this service. Allowing direct payments between Cuban and \n     United States financial institutions will permit the United \n     States exporters to receive payment directly to their \n     financial institutions within hours instead of days and will \n     eliminate an unnecessary transactional fee, thereby allowing \n     Cuban purchasers to purchase more United States origin \n     agricultural products.\n       (8) Trademarks and trade names are vital assets of the \n     United States companies that export branded food products, \n     including those who today or in the future may sell such \n     products to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \n     Enhancement Act of 2000. Hundreds of United States companies \n     have registered their trademarks in Cuba in order to ensure \n     the exclusive right to use those trademarks when the United \n     States trade embargo on that country is lifted. Moreover, \n     following the enactment of the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n     Export Enhancement Act of 2000, many United States companies \n     are today exporting branded food products to Cuba where they \n     hope to establish their brands with Cuban purchasers in order \n     to benefit from current sales under the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, as well as \n     position themselves for the larger post-embargo market for \n     United States goods in Cuba.\n       (9) Sales to Cuba of branded products of United States \n     companies contribute to the livelihoods of American workers \n     and the balance sheets of United States businesses. Those \n     sales depend on the security of United States trademarks and \n     trade names protected in Cuba by reciprocal treaties and \n     agreements for the protection of intellectual property. Among \n     such treaties and agreements are the Agreement on Trade-\n     Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and \n     the Inter-American Convention for Trademark and Commercial \n     Protection.\n       (10) The United States District Court for the Southern \n     District of New York ruled that section 211 of the Department \n     of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 \n     abrogates, with respect to Cuba, the Inter-American \n     Convention on Trademarks and Commercial Protection. The \n     court's ruling was affirmed by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n       (11) Cuba's international remedy under customary \n     international law (as codified by Article 60 of the 1969 \n     Vienna Convention on Treaties), for a breach by the United \n     States of the Inter-American Convention, is to suspend or \n     revoke the protections Cuba currently affords United States \n     trademarks and trade names.\n       (12) In order to preserve the rights of United States \n     nationals holding trademarks in Cuba, including those engaged \n     in authorized sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform and \n     Export Enhancement Act of 2000 now and in the future, the \n     United States must repeal section 211 of the Department of \n     Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 and \n     the United States must comply with all treaty obligations \n     owed Cuba as they relate to trademarks and trade names.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to remove \n     impediments to present and future sales of United States \n     agricultural products to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 and to otherwise \n     facilitate such sales.\n\n     SEC. 2903.

(a) Findings.--\n       (1) During most of last four years relations between the \n     United States and the People's Republic of China have been \n     relatively stable;\n       (2) The recently released 2004 State Department Country \n     Report on Human Rights continues to characterize China's \n     human rights as poor;\n       (3) Bilateral economic and trade relations are important \n     components of the US/Chinese relationship,\n       (4) China's growing international economic and political \n     influence has implications for the United States competitive \n     position and for maintaining a strong domestic industrial \n     base;\n       (5) Taiwan remains an extremely sensitive and complex \n     bilateral issue between the US and the Peoples Republic of \n     China;\n       (6) The US decision to establish diplomatic relations with \n     the People's Republic of China in 1979 was based upon the \n     premise that the future of Taiwan would be determined solely \n     by peaceful means and in a manner that was mutually \n     satisfactory;\n       (7) The Taiwan Relations Act makes clear that peace and \n     stability in the region are in the political, security and \n     economic interests of the United States;\n       (8) The United States has consistently urged restraint by \n     both China and Taiwan with respect to their actions and \n     declarations; and\n       (9) The anti-succession law adopted by the Chinese National \n     People's Congress on March 14, 2005 targeted at Taiwan's \n     independence advocates was a provocative action which has \n     altered the status quo in the region.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       1. China's anti-succession law is destabilizing to regional \n     peace and stability, and is therefore of grave concern to the \n     United States;\n       2. The United States Government should employ all \n     diplomatic means to encourage the repeal of that law so the \n     regional stability can be restored;\n       3. The United States Government should continue to speak \n     out with respect to China's human rights practices and \n     advocate the release from detention of all political and \n     human rights activists;\n       4. The United States Government should more effectively \n     promote United States economic and trade interests by \n     insisting that the People's Republic of China lives up to its \n     international trade obligations to respect and safeguard US \n     intellectual property rights and cease artificially pegging \n     its currency exchange rates; and\n       5. The United States Government should undertake a \n     comprehensive review of the implications of China's growing \n     international economic and political influence that are \n     byproducts of its expanding network of trade agreements, its \n     aggressive shipbuilding programs, its efforts to cement \n     scientific and technological cooperation arrangements, and \n     secure additional oil and gas contracts; and should determine \n     what steps should be taken to safeguard the United States \n     industrial base and maintain and enhance U.S. economic \n     competitiveness and political interests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 284.

ASSISTANCE TO THE PHILIPPINES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On May 19, 2003, President George W. Bush and President \n     of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued a joint \n     statement that stated that ``[t]he Presidents agreed that \n     relations are deeper and warmer today than at any time in \n     recent history and noted that those ties are rooted in shared \n     history, shared values, and a common interest in global peace \n     and prosperity. President Bush and President Macapagal-Arroyo \n     paid tribute to a revitalized and maturing bilateral alliance \n     and pledged to strengthen the partnership further in the \n     years ahead.''\n       (2) According to the Department of State, ``[t]he U.S. has \n     important security, commercial and political interests in the \n     Philippines, a treaty ally that straddles important air and \n     sea lanes. . . . In recognition of the critical nature of \n     Philippine support to the Global War on Terrorism, President \n     Bush designated the Philippines as a major Non-NATO ally.''\n       (3) On February 16, 2005, the Director of Central \n     Intelligence stated: ``In the Philippines, Manila is \n     struggling with prolonged Islamic and Communist rebellions. \n     The presence of Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists seeking safe \n     haven and training bases adds volatility and capability to \n     terrorist groups already in place.''\n       (4) According to the United States Agency for International \n     Development, ``[c]orruption and conflict continue to impede \n     the Philippines' economic and social development. Forty-six \n     percent of the country's population lives on $2 per day or \n     less. . . . The Philippines continues to suffer some of the \n     worst effects of underdevelopment: a 2.36 percent rate of \n     population growth; destructive exploitation of natural \n     resources; and vulnerability to political instability. . . . \n     Nevertheless, the Philippines has maintained its democratic \n     institutions and its market-based economic system, as well as \n     its historic ties with the United States.''\n       (5) Despite the importance of the bilateral relationship \n     between the United States and the Philippines, the budget \n     request submitted by the President for fiscal year 2006 \n     contains decreases in assistance to the Philippines in \n     several important foreign assistance accounts.\n       (b) Assistance to the Philippines.--There are authorized to \n     be appropriated to the President for assistance for the \n     Philippines the following amounts for fiscal year 2006:\n       (1) For ``Development Assistance'' to carry out the \n     provisions of sections 103, 105, 106, and 496 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151a, 2151c, 2151d, and \n     2293), $27,576,000.\n       (2) For ``Child Survival and Health Programs Fund'' to \n     carry out the provisions of sections 104 and 496 of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b and 2293), \n     $26,800,000.\n       (3) For ``Economic Support Fund'' to carry out the \n     provisions of chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.), $34,720,000.\n       (4) For ``International Narcotics and Law Enforcement'' to \n     carry out the provisions of section 481 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2291), $2,000,000.\n       (5) For ``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and \n     Related Programs'', $5,150,000.\n       (6) For ``International Military Education and Training'' \n     to carry out the provisions of section 541 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2347), $1,000,000.\n       (7) For ``Foreign Military Financing Program'' grants to \n     carry out the provision of section 23 of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763), $55,000,000.\n       (c) Report Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Administrator of the Agency for International \n     Development, shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees a report containing a 10-year strategy for \n     providing assistance to the Philippines.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include projected funding levels to help the Government of \n     the Philippines deal effectively with a number of issues \n     facing the country, including poverty, corruption, military \n     reform, economic development, environmental damage, \n     international terrorism, democracy building, and narcotics \n     trafficking.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 290.

Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments and then I \nwill yield to Senator Dorgan a couple of minutes as respective chairmen \nof the policy committees of both parties to describe what is going to \nhappen briefly.\n  Sometimes, people watching C-SPAN will see a lone Senator giving a \nspeech on the floor of the Senate and that passes for debate, and they \nask, Where is the debate? Where is the joinder of the issues with one \nside asking the other a question and one side responding to the other's \nquestions?\n  As a result of the fact that we don't have enough of that real debate \nin the Senate, what Senator Dorgan and I and our respective parties \nhave agreed to is to conduct real debate, such as high school or \ncollege debates that many are familiar with, where there is a set \ntime--in this case, 70 minutes--and each of four speakers, two on the \nRepublican side and two on the Democratic side, have a few minutes, in \nthis case 6 minutes, to make a presentation. Then when those \npresentations are over, each will ask the other questions. They will \ntake a minute to ask the question with 2 minutes to respond; then, when \nthe questions are over, there will be a brief summing up period\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nof time. That can allow the positions of the parties to be articulated \nwell and yet permit an exchange of rebuttal and surrebuttal, which \nactually enables the parties to question each other, to challenge each \nother's premises and then to respond; in effect, conduct a real debate. \nThe exact time limits are known to the parties.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent, without reading the agreement \nwhich has been agreed to by both parties respecting the relative time \nand order of presentation, that the agreement be deemed read and agreed \nto, and that it be deemed self-executing in the event that either \nSenator Dorgan or I should not be on the floor for purposes of yielding \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the next 70 minutes, as soon as Senator \nDorgan is done with his preliminary comments, we will conduct this \ndebate on the subject of Social Security. I invite those who are \nwatching C-SPAN, as well as our colleagues, to tune in here because \nthis may be one of the few real debates that we have until this \nsubject actually is taken up on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Finally, the subjects are chosen by mutual agreement, and we hope to \nhave more of these debates this year and the following year, conducted \nroughly in this same kind of format so we can engage on other subjects \nas well.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. We are the chairmen \nof our respective policy committees, Republican and Democratic parties. \nWe have on previous occasions decided to arrange some debates on the \nfloor of the Senate about some significant issues. I participated in \nprevious debates. For this evening, however, the debate will occur \nbetween Senator Durbin and Senator Stabenow on the Democratic side, \nSenator DeMint and Senator Santorum on the Republican side. This debate \nis about Social Security, the larger issue, and also the merits of \nprivate accounts in Social Security.\n  I assume this will be a spirited discussion because it is a \ndiscussion that has been moving around the country at a very \nsignificant pace in recent weeks. It was said once that when everyone \nin the room is thinking the same thing, no one is thinking very much. I \nhappen to think debate strengthens this democracy of ours.\n  I recall several years ago I picked up the Washington Post and there \nwas a big debate going on about something very controversial, and \nsomeone was quoted in the Washington Post. They said, This whole thing \nhas degenerated into a debate about principles. I read that, and I \nguess that is why I came here. I hope so. I hope that is what debate is \nabout.\n  Tonight, we will one more time begin a discussion and a debate, in \nthis case on a subject that is very important in this country. I thank \nthe two Republicans and the two Democrats, distinguished colleagues, \nwho have agreed to participate in this debate. As my colleague Senator \nKyl indicated, this debate will be self-executing. The rules are known \nto all participants.\n  With that, let me turn this debate period over to the participants \nwho have agreed to begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader or his designee is now \nrecognized for 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank both chairmen for \nstructuring this debate.\n  I am here to talk about the problems confronting the Social Security \nsystem. Then my colleague Senator DeMint will talk about in more detail \nthe solutions we are putting forth--many of us on the side of the aisle \nare putting forward.\n  The problem with Social Security is it is driven by demographics. \nSocial Security is a pay-as-you-go system. That means the people \nworking pay into the system for those who are retired. The system \nworked well when you had a lot of people working and only a few people \nretiring. But that has fundamentally changed over the years. As a \nresult of that change, what you see in the red line is a dramatic \nincrease in taxes--from 2 percent, which is what the tax was on Social \nSecurity in 1936, now up to 12.4 percent. It was 2 percent on the first \n$3,000 you made. That is the green bar. Now it is up to 12.4 percent of \nthe first $90,000 you make. If you are working in the system now, that \nis when you start, high based; in other words, almost every dollar most \npeople make is going be taxed at a very high rate.\n  This is a big tax burden on future generations of America as we stand \ntoday. But this tax right now doesn't pay for the benefits that are \ngoing to be provided for future generations. Why? Demographics are \nchanging.\n  The first thing to happen is the fact that we are not having as many \nchildren. There are some exceptions to that. But we are not having as \nmany children as we had in previous years. You see the baby boom \ngeneration, 6.3 children of women of childbearing age. We are now going \nto be below a sustainable birth rate. But for immigration, we would be \nlosing population in America.\n  We see a gradual decline in the number of workers going into the \nsystem. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, we have a problem--a good problem. People are living longer. \nLife expectancy at the time Social Security started was age 61. Truly, \nat the time, Social Security was an old-age program. What does that \nmean? It was for people who could no longer work. People didn't live to \nage 65 back in 1936. Now we are seeing seniors living to age 77, and \nincreasing 1 month every 2 years.\n  What we are going to be asking future generations of Americans to \ndo--these workers, fewer of them--is to support seniors up to almost \none-third of their lifespan in ``retirement'' on Social Security.\n  People are living longer, fewer people paying benefits, and the final \nbig blow to the demographic perfect storm is the number of people \nturning 65.\n  If you look back over the last 40 years, back and beyond 1982, the \naverage number of people turning 65 in America was 2 million. When \nboomers start to retire, as you can see in the year 2011, the average \ngoing out over the next 40 years is going to be 4 million people. We \nare going to double the number of people retiring, and they are going \nto be living longer, and fewer people are coming into the workplace to \npay for those benefits. As a result of this combination of three \nfactors, we see this very important distinction. This is what is \ndriving the personal accounts. That is what is driving the need for \nchanges in the Social Security system. It worked fine when you had a \nlot of people paying 42 to 1.\n  Now we have a system where almost one person is paying for one person \nin retirement; it is two to one. Franklin Roosevelt would never design \na system where workers were paying for retirees if you only had two \nworkers paying for one retiree. No one designing a system today would \ndesign a system with demographics looking like this. In a sense you are \nalmost paying for one person's retirement.\n  If you do that, anyway, why not have a personal account? Why not have \nthe money paid to you and accrue that money over time, earn interest, \nhave the miracle of compound interest being used to benefit from the \ntaxes you are paying, instead of simply paying it to someone who is \ngetting a transfer payment from you as you work today.\n  Franklin Roosevelt was right; Members never thought a Republican \nwould say that. He was right to design a system such as this because it \nmade sense. There was a very small burden on taxpayers. But we have \nchanged. America has changed. And as a result of that change we need to \nlook at the system differently.\n  Here is what happens now because of this demographic. Huge deficits \nin the future. Why? Fewer people paying and more people retired live \nlonger. We have a short window of 10 or 12 years when we are paying \nmore into the system than we need to pay benefits.\n  Why don't we lockbox that? How do you lockbox it? You can't lockbox \nit. Every Senator I have ever talked to says the money goes to pay for \nother Government programs. The answer is right. How do we lockbox it? \nPut it into personal savings accounts for their benefits in later \nyears. That is how you lockbox Social Security today. That surplus that \nis there right\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nnow, put it into personal accounts. If we don't do that, we will have a \ncashflow problem in our ability to pay benefits. We cannot pay benefits \nwith IOUs. The President showed that today in Parkersburg, WV. You have \nto pay benefits with cash. That is the cash deficits we will be running \nin the Social Security Program alone: $63 billion in 10 years, $250 \nbillion cashflow. What does that mean? Someone will have to pay more in \ntaxes in 10 or 15 years, someone will get less benefits, or we will \nhave huge borrowing to pay current benefits--not doing anything about \nsaving money, not doing anything about having a better benefit, just to \npay the current benefits being promised and that we cannot deliver on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleagues.\n  Sometimes by accident the Senate lapses into something which \nperilously resembles debate. This may be one of those moments.\n  For those who are following it, welcome to the Senate as I hoped it \nwould be. I congratulate my colleagues on the Republican side and my \ncolleague Senator Stabenow for engaging in this debate.\n  The first question the American people ought to ask is a very basic \nquestion: Congress, if you did nothing, if you didn't change one word \nin the Social Security law, how long would the Social Security system \nmake payments to every retiree with a cost-of-living adjustment every \nsingle year? To listen to my colleague from Pennsylvania, it sounds as \nthough doomsday for Social Security is right around the corner. But the \nprofessionals tell us it is 35 to 45 years away; 35 to 45 years if we \ndo nothing.\n  President Bush and Senator Santorum and others have said, but what \nabout beyond that date? That is a legitimate challenge to all of us. \nWhen I came to Congress in 1983, I faced that challenge on a bipartisan \nbasis. We met that challenge. We extended the life of Social Security \nfor 59 years with commonsense changes. That is what we should do again.\n  Yet the President comes to us and proposes privatization. Now I have \nsaid it. I said the word which drives the Republicans into a rage. They \ndon't want to use ``privatization.'' It is as Senator Bumpers said, \nthey hate privatization like the devil hates holy water. But the fact \nis when the Cato Institute dreamed up this scheme, that is exactly what \nthey called it.\n  So now the Republicans have a softer side of privatization; they call \nit personal accounts. But it comes down to the same thing. If you are \ngoing to take money out of the Social Security trust fund to invest it \nin the stock market, the first and obvious question you have to ask is, \ndoes this strengthen Social Security? The President has already \nanswered that question: It doesn't. It weakens Social Security. It \nmeans the Social Security trust fund will run out of money sooner. That \nis obvious. You are taking money out of the trust fund.\n  What else does it do? It forces you to cut benefits for Social \nSecurity retirees. There is less money in the trust fund. You cannot \npay out as much in a pay-as-you-go system. That is fairly obvious.\n  How would they achieve that? The White House memo that was released \nsaid they would move to this new price index. Wage index to price index \ndoes not mean much to the average person until you sit down and ask, \nwhat does that mean in realistic terms? So we ask, what does that mean \nfor today's retirees? What if we had dealt with a price index instead \nof a wage index?\n\n  The yellow line on the chart suggests current law; the red line price \nindexing. What it tells us is 20 or 30 years from now, under the \nPresident's approach, we would see a 40-percent cut in benefits paid to \nSocial Security, forcing millions of seniors below the poverty line. \nThat is part of privatization. The other part, the part which they hate \nto talk about, is that as you drag these trillions of dollars out of \nthe Social Security trust fund, the only way to make it up is to add it \nto our national debt, $2 trillion to $5 trillion of national debt over \n20 years, debt that is financed by Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan, \ndebt our children would carry.\n  So there we have the perfect storm. All three have come together: A \nprivatization plan that doesn't strengthen Social Security but weakens \nit; a privatization plan that is going to cut benefits dramatically in \nthe outyears; and a privatization plan that is going to create a \ndeficit of $2 trillion to $5 trillion.\n  If we moved to the President's plan immediately, the Social Security \nsystem would go bankrupt even sooner, be insolvent even sooner. How can \nthat be the right approach?\n  Now, let's get down to the politics of this situation. This is all \nabout choices. We have made some choices. We had a vote as to whether \nwe were going to cut taxes in America or save Social Security. Look at \nthese Bush tax cut votes where we asked our Republican friends who \nwanted to join us in saving Social Security, are you willing to \nsacrifice a penny in tax cuts to make Social Security stronger. Time \nafter time after time, to amendments offered by Senator Byrd, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Conrad, Senator Reid, Senator Hollings, they have said \nno, we would prefer tax cuts even for the wealthiest people in this \ncountry rather than to strengthen the Social Security trust fund. The \nreason the Social Security trust fund may be in peril in the outyears \nis we have taken so much out of it to finance tax cuts.\n  I have a chart which shows what the tax cuts mean, the Social \nSecurity shortfall and the cost of other administration politics over \nthe next 75 years. The Social Security shortfall is about the same as \nthe President's tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans. If we took \nthe money we are giving in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in America \nand put it back into the Social Security system, we would not be having \nthis debate. We would be talking about other issues that are equally if \nnot more important.\n  Look at this chart. As a percentage of gross domestic product, Social \nSecurity will be at 48 percent in the year 2075. Look at Medicare and \nlook at Medicaid. As we talk about this light at the end of the tunnel, \n35 or 45 years from now, there is a locomotive looming, about to run \nover us, called Medicaid and Medicare and cost of health insurance.\n  So why aren't we sitting down on a bipartisan basis as we did in \n1983, working out commonsense solutions that don't privatize Social \nSecurity, weakening it, cutting benefits, creating a massive debt for \nour children? Why don't we work on a bipartisan basis to make it \nstronger?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired. There is 6 \nminutes for the minority.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, thanks to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for arranging in this incredibly important debate, Senator Kyl \nand Senator Dorgan, for bringing us together in this way.\n  Social Security is a great American success story. Senator Durbin and \nI, while we were not around when it was created, are very proud of the \nfact that we as Democrats led the way to create a great American \nsuccess story. Our goal today is to keep the security in Social \nSecurity. That is the fundamental issue, I believe, for each American \nfamily.\n  We are very proud of the fact that Social Security is a great \nAmerican success story because prior to Social Security, half of the \nseniors in our country, half of older Americans, were in poverty. Today \nit is about 10 percent. We still need to work on the 10 percent but \nthis is a great American success story. We want to make sure nothing is \ndone to unravel this.\n  It is important we have this debate, though, and we talk about the \nfact that Social Security is America's insurance policy. It is our \nfamilies' insurance policy because it is more than just retirement, \nwhich is so critical. But it is also a disability policy. Most of us do \nnot have a private disability policy. In fact, 75 percent of us do not. \nIt is a disability policy; it is a survivors policy.\n  Heaven forbid if mom or dad lose their life, where they are not there \nto care for their children. In fact, in my husband's own family, when \nhe was 10 years old, his father died. His mom was older and not well, \nand he and his mom literally survived on Social Security.\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\n  This is a great American success story. Anything we do that pulls \ndollars out of an insurance policy will cut those who are left. No \nmatter how forcefully the President or our colleagues say that somehow \nsome folks can be protected, when you pull dollars out of an insurance \nsystem, it is not possible. I think it is very important for us to \nunderstand that as well.\n  Also, we can each have our own opinions but not our own facts. There \nare a couple of different numbers floating around, but I would suggest \nto you that the folks whom we are obligated to look to, the \nCongressional Budget Office--the folks where nobody is appointed by the \nPresident, such as the Social Security trustees--those who are the \nnonpartisan folks we refer to all the time, they tell us, as has been \nsaid, that the trust fund can pay 100 percent of its obligations until \n2052, and after that, if nothing was done, it would be about 80 \npercent, maybe 78, 80 percent the trust fund could pay.\n  There is no question there is a gap, and we are here to say we want \nto work with you to address that gap. That is what we ought to be \ndoing.\n  What we know, and the President has already admitted, as have others, \nis the privatization scheme proposed does nothing to fix this; nothing. \nIt does not add a day, does not add an hour to 2052. In fact, it makes \nit worse.\n  There is a solution. In fact, there are a number of things we can \ntalk about. But 2 weeks ago we had a vote on the floor on the budget \nresolution. This was a vote based on an amendment that Senator Kent \nConrad and I had to put Social Security first. I know people are \nconcerned about Social Security, those who support continuing it. But \nthe reality is, we had a vote 2 weeks ago on an amendment that simply \nsaid, before we permanently extend tax cuts predominantly to those most \nblessed in our country, who are the least worried about Social \nSecurity, or before we add new mandatory spending, we should secure \nSocial Security first.\n  It is staggering when we look at the differences in values and \npriorities in this Congress and with the administration. Mr. President, \n$3.7 trillion is a lot of money; $3.7 trillion would secure Social \nSecurity for 75 years. That is, what, a third, a third maybe, of what \nwe are going to be asked to vote on later this year and beyond to \nextend tax breaks predominantly for the wealthiest Americans for 75 \nyears.\n  What are our values? What are our priorities? What does this say \nabout us as a country? We can easily, by putting Social Security first, \nfill that gap for 75 years. And I believe we ought to do it.\n  Specifically, on why privatization is something that does not make \nsense. Privatization does three things we are concerned about: It \nincreases the national debt drastically; it increases administrative \ncosts; and it adds deep benefit cuts. No matter who says, ``We'll \nprotect this group or that group, these folks will be OK,'' if you take \nmoney out of the insurance system, everybody gets cut. That is the \nreality.\n\n  The first thing is the budget deficit, the deficit for the country. \nWhen we look at what is happening right now, it is astounding. We have \nthe largest Federal deficit right now in the history of the country. We \nshould all be extremely concerned about it. It is $4.6 trillion, \nprojected. This adds, over 20 years, another $4.9 trillion. It more \nthan doubles the national deficit in order to do privatization.\n  One of the things I am particularly worried about, both as a member \nof the Banking Committee and a member of the Budget Committee, is who \nis buying that debt? Who is buying that debt from us? This is at a time \nwhen we are concerned about national security and trade deficits and \nwhat is happening around the world.\n  Well, the top two folks buying it are Japan and China. But can you \nimagine, South Korea and OPEC own some of our deficit. What happens \nwhen we add more to that deficit? And what happens when foreign \ncountries buy more and more of our debt? This is a bad idea to add more \nto our debt.\n  Let me add a couple of points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will do that later. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority is now recognized for 6 minutes.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues as well.\n  This is a great opportunity to discuss such an important program. I \nappreciate all three of my colleagues who have spoken who have stressed \nhow important it is that we keep the promise of Social Security. We \nhave heard a lot of numbers and different information. If I could, I \nwould like to try to make it a little simpler so at least I could \nunderstand it.\n  I am reminded, as I hear some of the information, of a TV commercial \nI have seen that the AARP has sponsored. Some of you may have seen that \ncommercial. The Presiding Officer may have seen it as well. In the \ncommercial they have a wrecking ball that is tearing down a house and a \nCaterpillar tractor tearing down the walls and a family fleeing, and \nthey are saying: This is what the President is trying to do to our \nSocial Security system, to tear it down completely when all it takes is \na few simple adjustments.\n  I think the real truth here is the house is more like one I saw on \nthe news during the rains and the mud slides in California: a beautiful \nbig house sitting on the mountainside, and from the front it looked \nperfect. It was perfect in the inside. The roof was perfect. It did not \nleak. But when you looked around the back, from the air with a \nhelicopter, you could see that half of the foundation had been washed \naway, and it was precariously perched there on the side of the \nmountain. But it looked perfect from the front. A few hours later they \nshowed a clip from the air where the whole house went down the side of \nthe mountain.\n  Unfortunately, what we have happening today is we have a Social \nSecurity program that has worked, and it looks good, just like that \nhouse, but the foundations have been eroded for many years, and we are \ncoming to the point where we have to rebuild those foundations.\n  I appreciate what the President is doing. This President has been \nwilling to confront the most difficult issues of our generation. He has \nconfronted terrorism head on. He is the world leader now in exporting \nfreedom and democracy. He has taken the education issue on, recognizing \nwe were leaving children behind, and made it more accountable. He saw \nthat seniors were not able to buy prescriptions, and he has worked with \nthe Congress to make sure they could. He sees that Social Security is \nlike the house on the cliff and that we need to fix it.\n  Now, I am afraid my Democrat colleagues and the AARP and some other \ngroups are still showing people around the house and telling them it \nlooks fine. And it does. But, folks, the real truth is, the foundation \nof our Social Security system has been eroded. The President is trying \nto show us the truth, that we need to rebuild the foundation.\n  Senator Santorum painted a clear picture. The foundation of our \ncurrent Social Security system was based on a lot of workers and few \nretirees, a lot of workers putting in $60 or less a year. Today, we \nhave the average family putting in over $5,000 a year. The problem with \nthat foundation and why it is being washed away by today's demographics \nis there is no savings. We have not saved 1 penny. Even though the \naverage American family puts in over $5,000--some dual-income families \nover $15,000 a year--we are not saving any money in the Social Security \nsystem.\n  I am afraid while the trust fund is a nice idea, it is no more real \nthan Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. The President today pointed out \nthat the trust fund is simply a file cabinet with a bookkeeping record \nof how much the Federal Government has borrowed from Social Security. \nThis money was being borrowed before our tax cuts. It is being borrowed \ntoday. This year, there is $75 billion in Social Security surpluses. It \nis being spent. And if we had not had the tax cuts, it would have all \nbeen spent because there is no way in our current Social Security \nsystem to save real money. That is all the President is talking about, \nrebuilding the foundation of our Social Security system with real \nsavings. And that is what we are trying to do.\n\n  I will put up a chart. I want to point something out that is very \nimportant. So much has been said that we are taking money out of the \nSocial Security system. But what we are doing with\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\npersonal accounts is welding them to the current Social Security \nsystem.\n  As you will see with the first bar on the chart, this year, in 2005, \nall of the benefits to today's retirees are being paid from the current \nsystem. But what we are proposing, since the current system is running \nout of money, is to begin to add personal savings within the Social \nSecurity system. By 2025, over half of the benefits that will be paid--\nand it is important to see that the benefits will be the same--will be \npaid in part by personal savings and in part by the traditional system.\n  Now, by the time my children retire, in 2045, all of the benefits \nwill be paid from a funded Social Security system, from real savings, \nand people will actually get better benefits in the future than they do \ntoday.\n  Let me point out on a second chart, it is important to recognize no \nmoney is going out of the system. It is all part of a system that has a \nnew foundation of real savings.\n  This is something we require of every corporation in the country that \noffers a pension plan, that they have real money in it. That is what we \nneed to do to Social Security.\n  One of the benefits of this--in addition to structuring a program \nwhere we can guarantee benefits; we don't change disability; survivors \nbenefits can be even better--is the average American worker, if you \nlook at 2035, average median income at 35, it is already close to \n$400,000 that they can work with their current system. The benefit \nthere is that if you die before you are 65 instead of today when you \nhave nothing, it is left to your heirs. It is part of your estate. More \npeople can inherit wealth.\n  We can continue to talk about this as we go through the questions and \nanswers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority is now recognized and has 1 \nminute to pose a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will ask the first question. If you take \nup to 2 percent out of the Social Security trust fund--and it is a pay-\nas-you-go system--it is clear you don't have enough money to pay the \nbenefits. The White House memo suggested that the way to deal with this \nis to reduce the amount of benefits paid to Social Security retirees. \nSo I would like to ask my Republican friends if they support the White \nHouse memo that called for the price index that would cut benefits for \nSocial Security retirees in years to come up to 40 percent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would answer that and say that as you see, we have a \nsurplus right now that can be used to fund these accounts for the next \n10 years. After that we run a deficit in the Social Security Program, \nand we would have to come up with a way of financing that deficit.\n  What the President has suggested is that with Social Security, if we \nfix it the old-fashioned way, the way you did in 1938, which was \nincrease taxes and cut benefits, workers would be paying more and \ngetting less. With personal accounts, you have the opportunity of \ngetting more because you use the compound interest, you use the miracle \nof the markets, and a balanced investment portfolio that is being used \nby pension funds all over the country to fund their accounts. And so \nwhat we would suggest is you initially use the surplus money and then \nyou balance for future workers--again, no reduction in benefits today, \nbut you balance for future workers.\n  What the President has talked about is a promise, a lower promise of \nbenefits but a better opportunity for a return because you have the \npersonal savings accounts which can exceed the promised benefit. So you \nhave at least the opportunity to do as well as the current system \npromises but cannot pay--promises but cannot pay--and you have the \nopportunity of not having to have future tax increases, again, because \nyou are able to compensate with the amount of money that is earned in \nthese accounts, again, because of the compounding of interest and \nbecause of the diversified portfolio of investments you have.\n  To me, this is a balanced approach. It takes the good part of the \nSocial Security system which is the security of having money go into \nthis old system, keeps that in place for about two-thirds of the money, \nand a third of the money will be able to offset what would have to be a \nfuture reduction of benefits with the growth in the personal account.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nmajority is now recognized for 1 minute to ask a question.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair. I would like to ask a question about \nthe 6 percent of the workforce that does not participate in Social \nSecurity. They are State and local workers. My first question is, Do \nyou support requiring--just as you did in 1983 by requiring Federal \nworkers to participate in Social Security--those State and local \nworkers to participate in Social Security? And if you do not, then why \nwould you deny current workers who are in the Social Security system \nthe opportunity to have a personal account like those workers do and \nallow them to continue to have their funded pension system and funded \nSocial Security system, not allow current workers to have at least a \npartially funded Social Security system?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say that many of these people are teachers and \nfirefighters and policemen who pay into their pension systems. They \nunderstood the arrangements when they went in and usually pay as much \nor more than Social Security requires. And for us to now change their \nsystem and bring them into Social Security fails on two counts. First, \nit doesn't solve the Social Security solvency problem. It is worth \nabout 20 percent of the total that we are dealing with. And second, it \nis going to demolish their own pension plans. So you are going to find \nthese people who are being interrupted into their current employment \npaying into pension plans who will now either pay more into Social \nSecurity and/or less into their pension plans.\n  Is that what we want to achieve? Do we want to take pension plans \nthat people paid into for a lifetime and weaken them? Is that our way \nto solve the Social Security crisis? I don't think so. I listened to my \nfriends on the Republican side likening the Social Security trust fund \nto Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and a file cabinet. They may not \nrecall it, but it hasn't been that long ago, 6 or 7 years ago, when we \ngenerated surpluses in the Federal budget. The Social Security Program \nwas stronger. We were borrowing less money from it.\n  Since President Bush arrived we have borrowed $800 billion out of the \nSocial Security trust fund. The so-called file cabinet has been very \ngenerous to the President when he wanted to finance his tax cuts. If he \nhadn't given tax cuts to the wealthiest people, that file cabinet would \nhave been full of money for Social Security recipients, lengthening the \nlife of this program.\n  Also, this whole thing about the miracle of the markets,\n  I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania. Thank you for finally \nsaying the words. You said we are talking about lower benefits but the \nopportunity to do better. That is what it is all about. So there is a \nguarantee of lower benefits to Social Security and the possibility of \nmaking more money on your investment.\n  Does the phrase ``past performance is no indication of future \nresults'' ring a bell? That is what you see at the bottom of every ad \nfor stocks and bonds and mutual funds. There is risk involved. Some may \nprofit, others may not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now has 1 minute to pose a \nquestion of the majority. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, to follow up on the fact that we are \nhearing that there is no money in the trust fund, I am quite shocked to \nhear that because back in the 1980s, when the decision was made to come \ntogether, President Reagan, based on Alan Greenspan's commission, with \nBob Dole and Tip O'Neill, they came together and on purpose designed a \nsystem to create surpluses for all of us baby boomers so there would be \nmore dollars available in a surplus. And, in fact, what the President \nlooks at, of course, just like when you go to a bank, you don't look in \nand just see dollars because there are investments being made and so \non.\n  In the Social Security trust fund, individuals have been given \nsecured bonds, the equivalent of a secured bond, an IOU, each one of us \nas individuals, with the full faith and credit of the United States \nbehind it.\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\n  My question is this: We are giving those same kinds of assurances to \nthose who buy our foreign debt, that we have the full faith and credit \nof the United States behind it. Would you suggest that we would pay \nChina back and Japan back and our foreign creditors before we would pay \nback the people of America who have paid into the Social Security trust \nfund and have been given a secured IOU?\n  Mr. DeMINT. An excellent question. Those are legal obligations of the \nFederal Government which we have to honor. But the Supreme Court has \nsaid Americans have no legal right to a Social Security benefit. It is \nnot their money. They don't own it. Unfortunately, the Social Security \ntrust fund could not write one check to a Social Security retiree \ntoday. There is no money.\n  The only place the money can come from for the trust fund is if it \ncomes back from the general fund to the trust fund. In other words, \nthese cash deficits that we have talked about are the money that has to \ncome out of the General Treasury, out of our education fund, our \ntransportation fund, out of our military, in order to pay these IOUs \nthat are in this so-called trust fund. And we don't have the money to \ndo that.\n  And the talk of tax cuts hurting the Social Security trust fund, I am \nafraid, is ridiculous. The money was all being spent anyway. If we had \nnot had a tax cut, more would have been spent. This year there is $75 \nbillion in a Social Security surplus that we are spending.\n  My question to the Senator is, would the Senator support a proposal \nthat actually saved the Social Security trust fund--that is all we do--\nsave the money that is surplus between now and the time that runs out \nin 2017--and that is when the program is in trouble because that is \nwhen we have to start pulling money out of the general fund. But my \nquestion to both of my Democratic colleagues is, would they support a \nproposal to save the Social Security surplus today?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I say to my friend and colleague, \nI am shocked to hear him say the people of America who have paid into \nthe Social Security trust fund, the baby boomers, do not have a secured \nobligation by all of us. Is the Senator saying whether it is moral or \nwhether it is legal, or is he saying we do not have to pay those \nbenefits? He is actually saying that for the folks who have paid in as \nbaby boomers that we are not obligated to pay those benefits?\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is what the Supreme Court----\n  Ms. STABENOW. I want to make it clear that we Democrats believe with \nall our hearts and souls we have a responsibility to pay and we will \npay those obligations. To somehow say that it is different to pay a \nforeign country than it is to pay our own people the obligations when \nthey are both secured obligations--this is not something written down \non a little piece of paper. This is a secured obligation with the full \nfaith and credit of the United States of America behind it.\n  So I ask my colleague in return, the simple thing to do here, the \nvery simple thing to do would be to go back and vote again on simply \nmaking a policy statement. Why didn't my colleagues, either of my \ncolleagues, vote to say ``put Social Security first,'' let's make sure \nwe secure the obligation, keep it secure for 75 years, and then we can \ngive 70 percent of the tax cuts; to say to those most blessed in this \ncountry, will you take 70 percent of $11.6 trillion rather than 100 \npercent so every single person cannot only have retirement, but have a \ndisability policy, have survivor benefits?\n  Isn't that based on the great values of America in terms of paying \ninto a system, knowing it is going to be there, working hard all your \nlife and creating a way for people to care about each other and have \ncommunity? To me this would be the easiest thing, and we could do it \ntomorrow if we had the votes to do it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the chart is not accurate. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, extending the tax cuts \nwould cost about .7 percent of the gross domestic product between now \nand 2050, whereas the Social Security deficit is 1.4 percent of GDP. \nEven if we repeal all the tax cuts, not just on the wealthiest but on \neverybody that we provided--that is child credit, that is marriage \npenalty, all of those things--if you take all of those tax reductions \nthe President has put forward, they only make up half, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, of the shortfall. It does not solve the \nproblem, No. 1, and it also would be mixing apples and oranges.\n  We have never in the history of this system had a general fund tax \ntransfer to Social Security. We have always funded Social Security \nwithin the Social Security system through payroll taxes, and I showed \nthe increases of taxes over time. So now we are talking about something \nfundamentally different. We are talking about general fund revenue to \nfund Social Security. I do not think most people would see that as an \ninsurance policy anymore. I think they start to see it as a transfer \nprogram looking more like a welfare program than what has historically \nbeen a social insurance program.\n  I do not think we want to head down that road. I think we want to \nkeep the integrity of the Social Security system in place. That is why \nwhat we are suggesting, which is personal retirement accounts, where \nthe money stays in the system--there is a lot of talk saying you are \ntaking money out to put in these accounts. Remember, these accounts pay \nSocial Security benefits. The money stays in the system. It does not \ncome out of the system. It is used as a way of actually saving and \ncapturing this money that right now is going to the Federal Government \nto spend, and in exchange we are getting this IOU.\n  Is the IOU an obligation to pay? Yes. How does the Government pay \nbenefits? It pays benefits on the ability to take either tax revenue or \nborrow money and pay out benefits.\n  What we are suggesting with this chart of showing the cashflow \nproblems is the deficits are going to be huge in the future, and that \nis going to be a problem of cash-flowing benefit payments in the \nfuture. It is not that we will not pay them; it is the deficits are \ngoing to be huge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The majority \nhas 1 minute to pose a question to the minority.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask either of my colleagues, they have \nheard of the solution we have put forward, and I guess the question I \nhave is, the Senator from Illinois suggested we can fix it the way we \nfixed it in the past. The way it was fixed in the past is we raised the \npayroll tax from about 10.4 percent to 12.4 percent and we raised the \nbase and indexed it. And then secondly, we increased the retirement age \nfrom 65 to 67. Also, we taxed benefits for the first time on higher \nincome individuals. We taxed benefits, increased the retirement age, \nand we raised taxes.\n\n  So my question is: If my colleagues do not want to go the personal \naccount route, and if they accept at some point--pick the time--at some \npoint there will be a shortfall in the system, how are we going to \nsolve this problem? What tax are we going to increase or by how much? \nHow much are we going to cut benefits, or how much are we going to tax \nbenefits?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think it is an honest question, and it \nis one we should face honestly. The last time we did, in 1983, Mr. \nGreenspan's commission came up with a list of recommendations and said: \nChoose from this chart and you will lengthen the life of Social \nSecurity dramatically.\n  Finally, we came up with a package, as the Senator from Pennsylvania \ndescribed. A final vote in the House of Representatives included 81 \nRepublicans voting with 158 Democrats. When it came to the Senate, \nthere were more Republicans than Democrats supporting the Greenspan \nCommission proposal.\n  Yes, it gets down to basic math, and that is what troubles me about \nsome of the statements made by my colleagues on the floor. It seems we \nthink we can defy the laws of gravity and the laws of mathematics, and \nit simply gets down to this: If you want to strengthen a program such \nas this, you are either going to raise taxes, cut benefits, or find \nsome new way to generate money into that system. My colleagues' program \nis not a way that puts money into the system. It takes money out of the \nsystem that then can be invested, that may have a good return, and if \nit\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\nhas a very good return, you are going to be the winner. If it goes soft \non you, if you happen to have a bad investment, you are a loser. You \nhave fewer benefits under Social Security, less money from your \ninvestments. The risk is there.\n  But I think we need to get down to basics. The Senator from South \nCarolina suggested earlier that we might as well have tax cuts; \notherwise, we will spend the money. But in the years when we were \ngenerating surpluses under President Clinton, before President Bush was \nelected, we had the largest increase in longevity in Social Security in \nmodern history. In a matter of 3 years, as we are building up \nsurpluses, not spending the money on tax cuts or new programs, Social \nSecurity is getting stronger by 8 years because we are being fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Now with President Bush, with the largest deficits in the history of \nthe United States brought on by a Republican President and a Republican \nCongress, Social Security is going the wrong way. The latest estimate \nsays it has lost a year in solvency. They are connected.\n  You cannot take the money and overspend on programs or on tax cuts \nand not have a negative impact on the Social Security trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 1 minute to address a \nquestion to the majority.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, given the fact the President has \nindicated that the privatized accounts do not solve the solvency \nproblem for Social Security, and given the fact that at this point \ncolleagues have said they are not interested in putting Social Security \nfirst before additional tax cuts or new mandatory spending, what would \nmy colleagues' proposals be at this point? Assuming the privatized \naccounts, as has been said--that is a philosophical difference; folks \nmay or may not wish to privatize Social Security, but it does not add a \nday to the solvency of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I ask my colleagues, what would your proposals to protect and secure \nSocial Security be for the future?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the question because I \nactually do have a proposal. The fact is, if you add personal savings \nwithin the current system, you do fix the system permanently. The \nexample on this chart is while right now the traditional benefits are \npaying 100 percent of our promise, and Social Security is a promise we \nneed to keep--Republicans are committed to it, and the President is, \nand that is why we are looking at this house that is on a cliff. We \nwant to figure out how to build a foundation that will keep it there \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  But if we allow personal accounts to work with the traditional \nsystem, when we get out to the year 2045, we not only have a \npermanently solvent system, we have one that is completely funded. In \nother words, it would meet the legal criteria of pension plans today.\n  I think all of my colleagues know that if corporate America asked us \nto set up a plan such as Social Security where we take workers' money \ntoday, we spend it all, and then we try to pay benefits out of future \nrevenues, we would say no and we would probably put them in jail.\n  The plans we are talking about eliminate risks. They guarantee a \nfuture benefit and they are slanted toward giving the poor a better \ndeal than they have had under the current system. We can design a \nSocial Security system with personal accounts that eliminate risk and \nhelp the poor more than this current program and make the program \npermanently solvent.\n  My question back to the Senator would be, if the Senator is not for \npersonal accounts--and I guess if the Senator is thinking the trust \nfund is going to pay benefits after 2017 even though last week the \nSocial Security actuaries in their report said in 2017 payroll taxes \nwill no longer be enough to pay promised benefits, so we will have to \nstart pulling money from the general fund--my question to the Senator \nis if the Senator does not want to put personal accounts into the \nsystem, which we continue to stress we are not taking money out, we are \nadding new money to the Social Security system, we are saving it in \npersonal accounts, we are welding it to the traditional system so that \nit will be stronger in the future, how is the Senator going to fix \nSocial Security and pay benefits in 2018?\n  Ms. STABENOW. With all due respect, I am trying to figure out the new \nmath in my head because the math that the Senator is talking about \ncertainly does not add up to anything that I have seen. I would \nencourage folks who are watching to go to democrats.gov and use the \ncalculator based on a 6-percent rate of growth that some financial \nfolks put together where they can put in their date of birth and their \naverage yearly earnings and find out for themselves how they would do. \nSo far we have not found anybody who does better under these privatized \naccounts.\n  So when one is talking about what we ought to do, we need to start \nwith the reality that the privatized accounts turn Social Security from \na guaranteed benefit into a guaranteed gamble, No. 1. Secondly, there \nis nothing in what the Senator is talking about that has a relationship \nto what we are hearing about these private accounts.\n  I said to Secretary Snow in a committee hearing that I understand \nfolks have to pay some of this back, so let me give an example. My \ndaughter is 25. Let us say I give her $1,000. At retirement I tell her \nI want the $1,000 back, 3-percent interest, plus inflation. Is that \nwhat you are talking about? And he basically said yes. He did not \ndisagree with that.\n  What we are seeing is a lot of hocus-pocus, a lot of where is the pea \non the table moving things around. Of course, we have nothing \nspecifically in writing yet from the President, which is one of the \nproblems. But what we are seeing is a lot of talk that does not have a \nrelationship to reality. The reality is that for the first time, in \n2017 we begin to dip into the surplus that the Senator and I have been \npaying into as baby boomers all of our working lives. It is a \ncommitment. It is a secured obligation and we are going to pay that to \nfolks.\n  So the question is, what happens in 2052 when that surplus is no \nlonger available? And if we can take privatization off the table, the \nSenator has very willing and able colleagues on this side of the aisle \nwho want to work with the Senator to do those things that will secure \nit for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The minority now has 1 minute to pose a question to the majority.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. President Bush created a commission that was stacked to \nbe for privatization and personal accounts, but notwithstanding that \nthe closest option to what the President has described, option 2 from \nthat Commission, says in the first 10 years $2 trillion would be added \nto the national debt, in the second 10 years $4.9 trillion to the \nnational debt. We have asked the administration repeatedly how are they \ngoing to deal with doubling America's national debt, doubling our \nindebtedness to the rest of the world. How can they believe America \nwill be stronger in years to come when America's mortgage grows and \nAmerica's mortgage holders, Japan, China, OPEC, Korea, and Taiwan, if \nthey end their love affair with the dollar, will sink us by demanding \nhigher interest rates to continue to finance our debt? How can this be \nfiscally conservative, I ask my Republican friends?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. This is really an interesting \nquestion, and I think everyone admits that there is a gap between the \namount of money coming in and the amount of money that we are going to \nneed to pay, and that is shown by this cash deficit. The fact is, we \nhave to somehow or another in Social Security bring these two lines \ntogether. I think everyone would agree that is the option.\n  Right now, the shortfall over the life of the program is $11 trillion \nbetween the revenue line and the benefit line--the benefit line being \nup here, the revenue line down here. How do we bring those lines \ntogether, and how do we keep it solvent in the future?\n  What the President suggested is that if we do some-- let us assume it \nis all borrowing. We cannot make any spending cuts. We borrow up to--\nagain, according to Alan Greenspan--$1 trillion to $2 trillion over the \nnext 15 to 20 years to prefund Social Security, just like we prefund \nevery other retirement system\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nin America. In fact, they are required by law to prefund. We put the \nmoney into a diversified portfolio of investments and then that \nborrowing at the beginning creates an elimination of the $11 trillion \nlong-term problem. So I would ask, is a $2 trillion investment now \nworth saving $11 trillion and making the system permanently solvent in \nthe future?\n\n  I would answer that question with a resounding yes, and we put the \nSocial Security system on stable funding forever and have it supported \nby ownership. Of course, we all know ownership has its privileges. One \nof the things is it can be passed to the next generation. One can do \nbetter than the current system promises and cannot pay for. Let me \nrepeat that. The promised benefits we cannot pay for for my generation \nand for future generations of Americans.\n  What we want to give is ownership to future generations. We want to \ngive them a good chance. This gamble--go to every union pension plan \nand tell them their union is gambling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Now my question. I asked this question, Senator DeMint \nasked the same question of both of my colleagues, and in neither \ninstance did we get a response. So I will give my colleagues one last \ntry. We asked, what would my colleagues do, what is their plan? I just \nwant to get the transcript. In neither case did either my colleague \nfrom Michigan or my colleague from Illinois put forward specifically \nwhat increases in taxes do they recommend, what reduction in benefits \ndo they propose, or how much are we going to tax existing Social \nSecurity benefits to make up the shortfall. Pick the date as to when my \ncolleagues want to solve the problem, whether they want to wait until \n2018 or 2042 or 2052, whatever the case may be. How are they going to \nsolve this problem that at least some on their side of the aisle admit \nexists?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will answer that for my colleague. As Senator Durbin \njust said to me on the side, it will not be privatization, and that is \nabsolutely true. The American people, American families, can absolutely \ncount on the fact that it will not be privatizing Social Security.\n  I would argue that the amendment we put up 2 weeks ago that simply \nsays in the overall budget process, which is the value system for our \ncountry, the blueprint, is represented in what we do in our Federal \ncheckpoint. The reality is, if we said we were going to take about 30 \npercent of what is being given over the next 75 years to those most \nblessed in this country, who are not worried about Social Security or \nMedicare or other kinds of opportunities, if we just ask them to take a \nlittle bit less, we would be able to secure Social Security for 75 \nyears.\n  The other thing I would say about the issue of asking folks about \npensions, we have all been told by our folks that retirement is about a \nthree-legged stool: Social Security, pension, and savings. When it \ncomes to savings, the risk is with us to save. I believe we ought to \ncreate more opportunities for that. When it comes to pensions today for \nworkers, it is becoming more of a risk for the worker, not a defined \nbenefit but a defined contribution.\n  The leg of the stool that has been secure, that we will fight to keep \nsecure, is Social Security. I will never forget people working for \nEnron who came into my office 2 years ago, men in their fifties who \nworked all their lives and played by the rules and invested in their \ncompany, and one man with tears in his eyes said to me: Thank God for \nSocial Security. It is the only thing I have left, and I never thought \nI would be in this situation.\n  Social Security is not a 401(k). It is not meant to be a pension \nsystem. It is America's families' life insurance policy, retirement \ndisability, and survivor's benefits. It has worked now for years and \nyears. The issue is how do we keep it going.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The minority \nnow has 2\\1/2\\ minutes to close.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my colleagues \nfor taking time for this debate. I don't know how much we have lit up \nthe place with our brilliance, but at least we did our very best to \nexplain our points of view.\n  My colleague from South Carolina uses an interesting analogy of the \nhouse sliding off the hill. What they have suggested for that house \nthat is starting to slide off the hill in privatizing Social Security \nis, before it slides off the hill, let's rip the roof off and start a \nfire in the kitchen. That is what privatization does. It doesn't create \na stronger foundation for Social Security or for that house. It makes \nit weaker. It weakens Social Security, it cuts benefits, it drives more \nseniors into poverty, and it creates $2 trillion to $5 trillion more in \ndebts.\n  If you want to make that house stronger, you have to backfill. You \nhave to take the money you took out of the Social Security trust fund, \nmoney you took out for tax cuts, money you took out for things we \ncouldn't afford to pay, money that has driven us into the deepest \ndeficits we have ever seen in America under this President. That is how \nyou backfill a foundation to save this house on the hill.\n  This debate is not about solvency. I think we know now that it is \nabout the legitimacy of Social Security. I believe in it. Most \nAmericans believe in it. It is a safety net we have counted on for \nalmost 65 years and we will continue to count on.\n  But some of my friends on the Republican side see the world much \ndifferently. They have what they call the so-called ownership society. \nIf you can just own it, then it has to be great. The model of the \nownership society is, just remember, we are all in this alone.\n  But we are not in this alone. When Franklin Roosevelt created Social \nSecurity, he said the American family, all workers, will contribute \nthrough their payroll to make sure, if all bets fail, if your pension \nsystem fails, if you don't have enough in savings, you can always count \non Social Security. That, he said, is what the American family needs.\n  They need it today more than ever. Pension systems are failing. These \ncorporations are going bankrupt and throwing their shareholders and \nretirees and employees to the wolves. We cannot do the same with Social \nSecurity.\n  We ought to be able to stand together and make even difficult \nchoices, as we did in 1983, when a larger number of Republican Senators \njoined Democratic Senators to find a bipartisan solution. Privatization \nis not the answer. Ripping the roof off that house and starting a fire \nin the kitchen is not going to make it any safer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority is now recognized for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes to close. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you again. I have enjoyed this tonight. Our talk, I \nguess, has gone in some interesting directions. My opinion is that \nSocial Security is now too expensive to be just an insurance policy. \nWhen Americans paid $60 a year when the program started, yes, maybe it \nwas an insurance policy. But today, with Americans averaging over \n$5,000 a year, for many it is their only savings plan. We cannot assume \nthat the average American can save, after we take 12.5 percent of their \nincome, additional money for retirement. We have to transform Social \nSecurity into a program that is not only secure but helps people create \nreal savings to build a foundation of the program.\n  We are as committed to Social Security as you are. In fact, we \nwouldn't be here talking today if Social Security was secure. In fact, \nwe see that it is running out of money, and the best way to fix it is \nto save some of the money that we are putting into Social Security.\n  I know there are plans that don't put people at risk because I have \none and several other Republicans do. The plan I have introduced, which \nhas been scored by the Social Security Administration, guarantees that \nno American will ever receive less from Social Security than is \npromised by the current system. It gives the poor larger accounts. It \nreduces the deficit for Social Security by two-thirds. It is a program \nthat makes every American a saver and investor.\n  In this country today, with so many Americans who do not own \nanything, the opportunity to own something, and for that ownership to \ngrow in wealth so that they can participate in a country\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\nas our economy flourishes, this is what Social Security can be in the \nfuture--just as secure, but it can contain real savings for the first \ntime.\n  That is all we are asking today. Let's not cut benefits. We don't \nwant to cut benefits. Let's not raise taxes. The problem with Social \nSecurity is that the foundation does not include real savings, and that \nis what we are proposing. Let's save Social Security with real savings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority is now recognized for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes to close.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank you and my colleagues very much. \nThis is an important debate, and I appreciate being able to participate \nin it.\n  The President's privatized accounts, we know, will do three things, \nand that is why my colleagues and I are opposed to the privatized \naccounts.\n  First of all, they will greatly increase the national debt. In fact, \ndo you know what folks are going to own with this? Seventeen thousand \ndollars more in debt for every man, woman, and child in the United \nStates. That is what they are going to own. It is a lot more debt and a \nlot higher interest rates as a result of this plan. This is a bad idea.\n  The other thing that doesn't make any sense to me is that right now \nSocial Security, which is retirement--and we do have a secured \nobligation to make sure that we pay it, but it is retirement, \ndisability, and it is a life insurance policy. For that we pay about a \nhalf a percent in administration. On average we are told that it could \nbe upwards of 20 percent, maybe 10, maybe 25, but we are told by the \nexperts, 20 percent in order to administer an annuity or other kind of \nprivate account.\n  One of the things I find interesting is that among folks who are \nreally pushing for this idea around here are those folks who would be \npaid to administer these accounts. I understand we now have something \nlike five financial services lobbyists for every one Senator now here \non Capitol Hill. Certainly there are folks who will make a lot of money \nfrom this, but it is wrong. This system works right now and we pay a \nhalf a percent.\n  The final thing I would say is it is estimated that the average \nperson over 20 years, the average retiree, will lose $152,000 under the \napproach the President is talking about. This is wrong. This is not \nbetter for people. This is, in fact, worse.\n  I agree with my colleagues, and in fact let me also say I would \nwelcome folks going to my Web site or any of my colleagues' Web sites \nto learn more about Social Security and the facts. We do need to be \nworking together, not only to secure Social Security for the future \npast 2052, but we also need to work on those other ideas that create \nopportunity for people. One of my great concerns is that one-third of \nthe cuts proposed by the President in the budget are in education. That \nis opportunity. That is the opportunity for ownership in the future. \nWhy don't we focus on jobs and health care and those things immediately \nthat need to be addressed?\n  We welcome those debates as well and we welcome working with our \ncolleagues to keep the security in Social Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nmajority has 2\\1/2\\ minutes to close. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my colleagues from Illinois and Michigan, and \nmy colleague from South Carolina and my colleague in the chair on this \ndebate. I think it was a good and spirited debate. Hopefully, we added \na little light to the issue. Let me try to focus a little bit.\n  The Senator from Illinois used a quote: We are not in it alone. If \nyou are a 20-year-old today, you are feeling pretty lonely because \nthere are only two of you going to be paying for every one retiree. \nWhen FDR said that, there were 42, and he could say we are not in it \nalone. You are pretty close to being in it alone today, and that is why \nwe need a different system, a system that prefunds, that actually uses \nthe money, the surplus today, and saves it for future retiree benefits.\n  We are not taking money out of the system. We are putting the money, \ninstead of for the Government to spend and giving an IOU to replace it, \nwe are putting it in real assets that will be real benefits when real \nworkers really retire.\n  Second, I want to comment on the cost of administering the program. \nThe cost of administering the program has been estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office, not at 20 percent--I can maybe understand \nthe difference--it is 20 basis points. That is .2 percent, not 20 \npercent. It is 20 basis points, which is .2 percent of the amount of \nmoney. So I believe that is a dramatic difference. It is actually less \nexpensive to administer this system than to administer the current \nSocial Security system.\n  The other thing I would like to mention, if we can go to the next \nchart, three times we asked the question, How are you going to fix the \nSocial Security system? The only answer we got was to repeal the Bush \ntax cuts which, of course, does nothing to the Social Security system \nbecause that money is not paid to the Social Security system. So \nrepealing the Bush tax relief would simply put more money in the \ngeneral fund, but it would have no impact at all, no actuarial impact \nat all on the Social Security system. So when the Senator from Illinois \nsaid we had to make difficult choices in 1983, that may have been the \ncase in 1983, but so far we have not heard word one of the difficult \nchoices that the other side would like to present to the American \npeople.\n  Several Republicans have come forward with plans, plan after plan \nafter plan of details of how we are going to save this program, and all \nwe have gotten from the other side is sniping at the plan that we put \nforward and no answers. If we do not solve the problem----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM [continuing]. Of what the promised benefits are, we are \nlooking at taxes of 18 to 20 percent if we wait until 2041 or later. \nThat is not a plan fair to future generations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3235-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity \nfor Senator Durbin and me to speak for a few minutes.\n  The purpose for my rising is to follow up on some remarks I made \nyesterday, Monday, on the floor of the Senate. The full transcript of \nthose remarks, which has to do with judges and recent decisions of the \nU.S. Supreme Court is available, of course, in the Congressional \nRecord, but it is also available on my official Web site for anybody \nwho would care to read it.\n  As a former judge myself for 13 years, who has a number of close \npersonal friends who still serve on the bench today, I am outraged by \nrecent acts of courthouse violence. I certainly hope no one will \nconstrue my remarks on Monday otherwise. Considered in context, I don't \nthink a reasonable listener or reader could.\n  As I said on Monday, there is no possible justification for \ncourthouse violence. Indeed, I met with a Federal judge, a friend of \nmine in Texas, this past week to make sure we are doing everything we \ncan to help protect our judges and courthouse personnel from further \nacts of violence. And like my colleague from Illinois, I personally \nknow judges and their families who have been victims of violence and \nhave grieved with those families. But I want to make one thing clear. I \nam not aware of any evidence whatsoever linking recent acts of \ncourthouse violence to the various controversial rulings that have \ncaptured the Nation's attention in recent years.\n  My point was, and is, simply this: We should all be concerned that \nthe judiciary is losing respect that it needs to serve the interests of \nthe American people well. We should all want judges\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nwho interpret the law fairly--not impose their own personal views on \nthe Nation. We should all want to fix our broken judicial confirmation \nprocess. And we should all be disturbed by overheated rhetoric about \nthe judiciary from both sides of the aisle. I regret that my remarks \nhave been taken out of context to create a wrong impression about my \nposition, and possibly be construed to contribute to the problem rather \nthan to a solution.\n  Our judiciary must not be politicized. Rhetoric about the judiciary \nand about judicial nominees must be toned down. Our broken judicial \nconfirmation process must be fixed once and for all.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business.\n  First, let me commend my colleague from Texas. I think his remarks \nyesterday were subject to interpretation which he obviously does not \nwant them to be, and I think he has clarified his position, and I am \nglad he has.\n  Some of the quotes in the newspapers were difficult to resolve, and \nthey seemed inconsistent with my knowledge of him, his service on the \ncourt of Texas, and his service with me in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I think he would understand, as I do, that I have a personal \ninterest in this issue.\n  I recommended the nomination of Joan Lefkow to the Federal bench in \nChicago. On February 28, a bitter plaintiff in a medical malpractice \nlawsuit murdered her husband and her 89-year-old mother. Judge Lefkow \nhad dismissed that individual's lawsuit. She was not engaged in \njudicial activism.\n  This tragic incident in my home State has been a wake-up call about \nthe need for more judicial security. I met with the Director of the \nU.S. Marshals Service to discuss it, and sent a letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee today urging that we allocate more funds to \nprotect our judges.\n  In mid-March, at a trial for rape in Georgia, a man took a gun, \nkilled a deputy, a court reporter, and a judge presiding over the rape \ntrial.\n  In both of those tragedies, the killers were driven not by political \nphilosophy but by inner demons. Neither of these incidents appear to be \npolitically motivated in any way whatsoever. They were horrible deeds \ncommitted by deranged men.\n  A recent New York Times article indicated that 10 State and Federal \njudges have been murdered since 1970. None were related to the judges' \npolitics or ideology. Rather, the murders were committed by embittered \nor mentally ill litigants in emotion-laden cases, many of which \ninvolved notions of self-esteem.\n\n  I hope Senator Cornyn's clarification now will make it clear to \neveryone who has followed this debate that we need to respect our \njudiciary and its independence, even when we disagree with their \ndecisions. I disagreed strongly with the decision of the Supreme Court \nin Bush v. Gore after the 2000 election. But never, ever did it cross \nmy mind, nor should it have crossed the mind of anyone feeling as I \ndid, that you should take it out on the judges. They are doing their \nduty. I may disagree with them, but to suggest that they should pay a \nprice for it is wrong.\n  Notwithstanding what I consider to be a very positive statement made \nby the Senator from Texas clarifying his position, I am afraid there is \nanother member of Congress from his State who has made even more \ntroubling remarks during the past week. Congressman Tom DeLay is the \nmajority leader in the House. In response to the death of Terri \nSchiavo, the House majority leader from Texas said:\n\n       We will look at an unaccountable, arrogant, out-of-control \n     judiciary that thumbed their nose at Congress and the \n     President.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The time will come for the men responsible for this to \n     answer for their behavior, but not today.\n\n  Mr. DeLay was asked whether the House would consider impeachment \nagainst the judges involved in the Schiavo case, and he said:\n\n       There's plenty of time to look into that.\n\n  This is not an isolated statement by Congressman DeLay. He has said \nthings such as this time and time again. He has said:\n\n       It's a sad day for America . . . The legal system failed \n     Terri Schiavo.\n\n  According to the New York Times, he said:\n\n       Congress for many years has shirked its responsibility to \n     hold the judiciary accountable. No longer.\n\n  Earlier this year, Mr. DeLay publicly condemned members of the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals for ``writing laws instead of interpreting \nlaws.''\n  When he was asked a few years ago about Federal judges by a reporter, \nhe said:\n\n       I woke up one day realizing the judiciary had turned \n     themselves into a regulatory branch.\n       We can impeach judges who get drunk, so why not impeach \n     those who get drunk with power?\n\n  In 1997, in reference to Federal judges, he said:\n\n       As part of our conservative efforts against [this] judicial \n     activism, we are going after judges.\n\n  DeLay also said the House Republican leadership was prepared to go \nafter activist judges ``in a big way.''\n  Then he went on to say in the Houston Chronicle:\n\n       For too long we've let the judicial branch act on its own, \n     unimpeded and unchallenged. And Congress' duty is to \n     challenge the judicial branch.\n\n  He went on to say in the Houston Chronicle in 1997:\n\n       I want to bring one (an impeachment) to prove my point. And \n     I want to make sure that one sticks.\n\n  He said he and other Republicans had a ``whole, big file cabinet \nfull'' of judges who may be candidates for removal.\n  This type of intemperate rhetoric, sadly, does great harm to the \nreputation of our judiciary, and the relationship between the \nlegislative branch and the judicial branches.\n  I have felt as strongly, I am sure, as he has about decisions made by \njudges, but those of us in positions of leadership should be careful \nabout the words we use, and that the actions we threaten are entirely \nconsistent with the law at every moment. What we have heard from \nCongressman DeLay when it comes to judges crosses that line way too \noften.\n  I think we understand that deranged people, for reasons beyond \npolitical speeches, beyond differences on political issues, will do \ntragic things, and often that violence is visited on public servants \ndoing their duty as judges serving America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/05/senate-section/article/S3236-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
