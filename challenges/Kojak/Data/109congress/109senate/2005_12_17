Mr. President, today I do not anticipate a lengthy \nsession, but we are here for important work. We need to pass a short-\nterm continuing resolution, and we are waiting for the House to send us \na joint resolution. We expect to clear a package of nominations this \nafternoon, and we will do that block of executive nominations by voice \nvote. We will also continue to process some of the other legislative \nitems that have been cleared and are ready to move.\n  Final discussions continue on the remaining must-do items, and I am \nhopeful that we will be soon able to take action on these items over \nthe next couple of days. Members will be asking about the schedule, and \nI will make further announcements shortly on tomorrow's lineup. I want \nto confer with the chairmen and principals involved in the negotiation \nand then say more at the close of business today. Again, we will wrap \nup our work today in as quick a time as possible, and Members should \nstay tuned as everything is finalized.\n  There is a lot of work going on in the Capitol today--until late last \nnight and until the early hours of the morning. Just last night and \nover the last several days we passed very important pieces of \nlegislation. If we look back on Friday, last night, we passed cord \nblood legislation, which opens up critical new research opportunities \nand clearinghouses for safe, ethically sound transplantation. That is \ngoing to save lives.\n  We passed the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005, which will provide a \nsecond major round of critical tax relief to our brothers and sisters \nin the gulf coast region.\n  We extended the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which takes another \nstep toward reducing taxpayers' risk and minimizing the Government's \ninterference with the private market.\n  We passed an important new provision in the Violence Against Women \nAct, which will protect rape survivors who have already been victimized \nonce by sexual assault.\n  We passed the Bahrain Free Trade Agreement this past week, which \nenhances our bilateral relationship with a strategic friend and ally.\n  I mention all of these because a lot of them we do actually in what \nwe call wrap-up or by unanimous consent but all are major pieces of \nlegislation. We now have, over the next several days--and I hope it is \nas few as possible--very important legislation on Defense, both \nappropriations and authorization, as well as the deficit reconciliation \npackage and nominations that I mentioned. So we have a lot of work to \ndo over the next several days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13948-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Through the Chair to the distinguished majority leader, \nthere is some confusion over here because at one time last night, on \nthe conference report on defense authorization--it was signed by \neverybody. Does the leader have the latest word on that? Senator Warner \nand Senator Levin, because they were trying to stick other stuff in the \nbill, were going to withdraw their signatures. Do we know if that \nhappened?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair, I know it has not passed \nthe House yet. I will have to check and see what the current status is \non the Department of Defense authorization. I will have to check and \nsee what the current status of that is. It was my understanding that \nwould be ready at some point--or as of late last night they would be \nready sometime today. The House has not yet acted on that.\n  Mr. REID. We hope to have the Defense appropriations bill tonight or \ntomorrow? When is that expected?\n  Mr. FRIST. Defense appropriations will likely be tomorrow. There are \nseveral items that remain to be wrapped up. Most of the meetings over \nthe course of last night and today have been with the objective of \nhaving that wrapped up as soon as possible, but that will much more \nlikely be tomorrow. It will not be tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Does the leader have some indication as to what the \nschedule will be Monday? The leader has indicated that there will be no \nvotes today or tomorrow. Are we going to have votes Monday?\n  Mr. FRIST. We know we are not going to have rollcall votes today. We \nwill be in a very short period of time today. I would think tomorrow, \ndepending on how things go over the next couple of hours, we would come \nin fairly late waiting on action from the House of Representatives. \nOnce we have a better feel when they are going to act tonight or in the \nmorning, we will set a time to open tomorrow.\n  We have not said no rollcall votes tomorrow, but we will be able to \nsay that for sure in just a bit, in all likelihood. Then I expect we \nwill need to come in early Monday and vote early Monday because at that \npoint in time we should have legislation coming from the House. So \nMonday is going to be a very full day. For right now--we can talk \nshortly if something else indicates otherwise--we would plan on voting \nMonday morning.\n  Mr. REID. I told my Senators on call that they should be ready to go \nMonday morning, by 10 or so. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. FRIST. I think that is a perfect goal and that we mutually share \nthat, that we could start voting as early as Monday morning. Since we \nwill be in tomorrow, if we can update that because most of our--many of \nour Senators are out around the country, we will do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13948-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13948-S13949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AVIAN FLU\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to make a very brief statement on an \nissue that I believe requires action before we leave. It is something \nwe have addressed on the floor of the Senate, actually in several \ndifferent capacities, but I want to restate the importance of that. It \nhas to do with a potential pandemic of an avian or bird influenza--the \nso-called bird flu. In the 20th century, we have had three influenza \npandemics. Remember, about 30,000 people in this country die every year \nfrom the seasonal flu. But superimposed on this seasonal flu, on three \noccasions in the last 100 years, there have been these pandemics. What \nour public health officials and what our scientists say is, for sure, \nwe are going to have another pandemic. The time is in the near future, \nand a pandemic is going to occur, but we don't know exactly when. The \nworst of the three pandemics in the last 100 years was in 1918, the so-\ncalled Spanish flu--although it was called the Spanish flu, it probably \nstarted actually in Kansas--but that flu went through our population in \na period of weeks and killed about half a million people; worldwide it \nkilled somewhere around 40 million people.\n\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Leavitt, warns \nif past is prologue, the world is overdue for another flu pandemic. I \nagree with that assessment. The pandemic will occur. We do not know \nexactly when. But we know we are drastically underprepared; not \nunprepared but underprepared. If we act with action now, we will be \nprepared. Preparation means much less destruction or potential \ndestruction by such a pandemic.\n  The avian flu over the last couple of years has spread from East \nAsia, to Romania, to Turkey. It looks and acts more similar to the \nvirus of 1918 than either of the other two pandemics, the one in 1957 \nand the one in 1968. If it achieves the final step in what becomes a \npandemic, that is, human-to-human transmission--the first couple of \nsteps are that it is a novel virus, a new virus, and that it spreads to \nother species, multiple species, and the third big step is \ntransmission, human-to-human transmission. In that case, the \nconsequences could be catastrophic both in loss of human life as well \nas in economic meltdown in many ways.\n  Recently, in the last several weeks, the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased a study which I had requested specifically on the economic \nimpact of a serious and a mild pandemic of avian flu. Their report \ndemonstrated--much higher than I expected--a 5-percent decline in our \ngross domestic product over the course of a year. That is about a $675 \nbillion hit if we were to have a severe pandemic of this avian flu. The \nclock is ticking. If a pandemic occurs and we are underprepared, if it \nwere to occur today and it were severe, the Congressional Budget Office \npredicts, with their best economists and access\n\n[[Page S13949]]\n\nto public health officials, that is what would occur.\n  We need to put the wheels in motion, so when and if that avian flu \nhits, we are prepared. If we are prepared, we diminish the economic \nimpact dramatically. If we do not act and that avian flu pandemic comes \nto our shores, we in this Senate will be rightly blamed for failing to \ndo our best to protect the American people, given what our scientists \nand public health officials say today. That finger will be pointing \nstraight at the Congress if we do not act. The good news is we will \nact. We plan to act in the bills that have come before the Senate in \nthe next couple of days. We need a six-prong approach. We need to \naddress communications, we need to address surveillance, we need to \naddress the appropriate research, we need to address the whole issue of \nantiviral agents, the Tamiflu, we need to address vaccines. Right now \nwe do not have any vaccines specific to a virus that would be \ntransmitted human to human. That has to be created after we identify \nthe virus. And the sixth component is what we call surge capacity, the \nstockpiling of antiviral agents and vaccines.\n  It may sound like a lot of moving parts, but between our researchers \nand public health officials, our entrepreneurs, our private sector, we \ndo have the intellect, the ingenuity, and the knowledge to get the job \ndone.\n  Our job as elected officials, my job as an elected official and my \njob as a physician is to see this thing through to make sure we are \nadequately prepared, and we can look our constituents in the eyes and \nsay we have done everything possible to see that we are prepared for \nsuch a pandemic. Our economy, our country, and our lives may depend on \nwhether we take action.\n  The President has laid out a comprehensive plan. It is our job to set \naside the appropriate resources but also to give the appropriate \nincentives to tackle this looming threat.\n  I refer to our colleagues to put aside partisan differences, to hold \ntogether, to protect the American people. The flu virus does not know \nwho is a Republican and does not know who is a Democrat. The people who \nsuffer will know who did not get the job done.\n  We do not need to panic. What we do need is to prepare ourselves. \nPreparation means action, action in the Congress. The American people \nare counting on it. That is exactly what we will do over the next \nseveral days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13949-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13949-S13953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            USA PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, unless the Congress acts, on December 31, \n2005, 16 different provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act will expire.\n  Two days ago we had a vote to determine whether a minority in the \nSenate would allow a bipartisan majority the chance to have an up-or-\ndown vote on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. As everyone knows, \nthat vote failed. Fifty-two senators voted to close off debate. There \nbeing a requirement of 60 votes to cut off debate, that threshold was \nnot met so we did not reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.\n  So here we are with the clock ticking, with America's security at \nrisk. We find ourselves in the incredible position of seeing certain \nordinary law enforcement tools that are used everyday in State and \nFederal courts all across this country will, in about 2 weeks, no \nlonger be available in the case of international terrorists or spies or \ncases involving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Perhaps the one provision of the PATRIOT Act that will expire that \ncauses most concern is the so called wall. That, of course, is the term \nused to describe what previously--before October of 2001--was a wall \nthat separated the sharing of information between our law enforcement \npersonnel and our intelligence authorities. It is clear, as the 9/11 \nCommission demonstrated, that this wall made us less safe. It was not \nrequired by the Constitution. It was not required by any provisions \npassed by this Senate and signed by the President. It was simply a \nchoice made by the Department of Justice to prevent the sharing of \ninformation.\n  We learned from the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and its \ninvestigation, as well as from by the terrible events of September 11, \nthe 9/11 Commission concluded this wall, which was not constitutionally \nrequired, prevented the sharing of information between law enforcement \nand intelligence authorities and this prohibition contributed to the \nterrible events on September 11.\n  It was imperative the Congress act as quickly and as carefully as \npossible to remove any impediments that were not otherwise mandated by \nthe Constitution from investigating and preventing future terrorist \nattacks against this country.\n  Those who have opposed this up-or-down vote in the Senate with regard \nto the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act are asking us to make a false \nchoice. In other words, they are saying if the PATRIOT Act is \nreauthorized, somehow Americans' civil liberties will be in jeopardy. \nThey are asking us--or telling us--that we have to choose between our \nnational security and our civil liberties. That, to repeat, is a false \nchoice.\n\n  The fact is, we can have a balanced reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct that will protect America from future terrorist attacks. We can \ncontinue to disrupt the terrorist cells both here at home and abroad \nthat endanger us and protect our civil liberties at the same time.\n  This country was founded upon a belief in individual freedom and the \nprotection of individuals against the overwhelming power of the \nGovernment. And we have, for more than 200 years, written into our \nlaws--not to mention the Constitution--various protections to make sure \nour civil liberties and our individual freedoms are protected.\n  But the No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government is to keep us \nsafe. There is no other responsibility that comes anywhere close to \nthat imperative. That is why I believe the PATRIOT Act must be \nreauthorized, and if we fail to act before these provisions expire on \nDecember 31, 2005, we will not have met our responsibilities. Indeed, \nwe will have contributed to making this country much more dangerous \nthan it would otherwise be.\n  Now, as we recall, after the terrible events of September 11, \nCongress, for 6 weeks, debated the original passage of the PATRIOT Act \nand, in a vote of 98 to 1, passed the PATRIOT Act. It provided that \nthese 16 provisions would expire at the end of this year. The vote to \nenact this legislation was 98 to 1 in the Senate, after 6 weeks of \ndebate. In the House, the vote was 365 to 66, again not quite as \noverwhelming as in the Senate, but it was a lopsided vote in favor of \npassing the PATRIOT Act. And it was signed into law on October 26, \n2001.\n  Now, I have been surprised at how much misunderstanding there is \nsurrounding the PATRIOT Act, how much outright mythology and \ndisinformation there has been by those who are not just concerned about \ncivil liberties, but those who are actually engaging in almost paranoid \ndelusions about what it is that the PATRIOT Act provides in terms of \nthe authorities to combat and to break up terrorist activities.\n  The fact is, anyone who has been involved with or even remotely \nacquainted with our criminal justice system knows and will recognize \nthat the provisions of the PATRIOT Act merely extended to national \nsecurity cases many of the tools that are used every day in courts all \nacross the Nation and throughout the States. So this breathlessness, \nthis sense of the existence of conspiracy theories, about the Federal \nGovernment deciding to suspend the civil liberties of the American \npeople in pursuit of terrorists, is pure fantasy.\n  I want to talk about the provisions that are being discussed so I \nthink at least those who are listening can understand there has been \ncareful thought and careful negotiations between the House and the \nSenate and there has been an awful lot of effort put into trying to \nstrike the right balance.\n  But what the critics are asking us to do is engage in a willing \nsuspension of disbelief. It is almost unthinkable to me that here we \nare, some 4 years after the terrible events of September 11th, debating \nthese common sense tools almost as if some have forgotten the lessons \nwe learned and lessons we should remember for the rest of our lives.\n\n[[Page S13950]]\n\n  I was not here in Washington on September 11. I was merely a \ncandidate for the Senate and the attorney general of my State in Texas \nat the time. I was in Austin, Texas when those planes hit the World \nTrade Center. We all recoiled in shock and in horror at those terrible \nevents. But I remember, since I have been here in Washington, the \nnumber of occasions where we have had warnings of intrusions into the \nairspace around this Capitol, where people here were running out of the \nCapitol, some in tears, out of fear that we were going to have another \nattack here at the Capitol.\n\n  As we know, but for the brave acts of some passengers on an airplane \nwho caused that plane to crash in Pennsylvania, it could have been that \nplane was meant for the White House or the U.S. Capitol, which would \nhave resulted in tremendous additional loss of human life.\n  So it is amazing to me--and I guess in some ways it is a sign of the \ntimes--that our memories are so short and that we need to be reminded \nabout the seriousness of the threat that still remains. We need not let \nour guard down, instead we need to continue to do everything that is \nhumanly possible to protect the American people against future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I know there are some who scoff at it and ridicule the threat, but I \nwould ask them to go back and to read the newspaper accounts, to see \nthe video replays of the terrible events of September 11, and then to \nreconsider. Those who fear that Government has turned into ``big \nbrother'' and is simply invading our bedrooms and our libraries and our \npersonal lives in ways that would shock all of us are engaging in, I \nthink, a fantasy.\n  When you look at the facts--and I would suggest facts are stubborn \nthings--we ought to look at the facts and the provisions that are being \ndebated and then ask ourselves: Aren't these the kinds of tools we \nwould want our law enforcement personnel to have to keep us safe?\n  I think the American people--when they understand, as they will \nbefore this debate has concluded, what is at stake here--would want us \nto act responsibly to extend and continue to provide these ordinary \nsorts of law enforcement tools to national security cases.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that a bipartisan majority of the Senate \nwould pass this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act if allowed to do so. \nBut, indeed, what we are seeing is a filibuster by a willful minority \nthat is blocking a bipartisan majority from even having the right to \ncast that vote. I recognize there are some people who have sincere \nbeliefs that reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act is not the right thing \nto do. While I strenuously disagree with them--and I would welcome a \nchance to debate with them here on the Senate floor the wisdom of that \ndecision--I respect their right to hold that opinion. But I do not \nrespect the minority when they block a bipartisan majority from having \nthe chance to vote on tools that, if not extended, will leave this \ncountry vulnerable to attack.\n  Again, I am confident that if we had a vote a bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate would see fit to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act and continue \nthese important protections for the American people. But we find \nourselves with the clock ticking, time running out, and America \npotentially endangered, if on December 31, 2005 these important \nprovisions expire because we in the Senate did not act. A direct \nconsequence of this action, or inaction, will endanger our country.\n  I would ask my colleagues: What has changed since that 98-to-1 vote \nin the Senate when, in October 2001, after 6 weeks of debate, the \nPATRIOT Act was passed? Are there reports of rampant abuses of the \nPATRIOT Act? No. Are there examples where Members can come to the floor \nand explain to us, that this is too much power for the Government to \nhave, or that somehow we have an imbalance in the power given to the \nGovernment, and that we need to strike a right and better balance?\n  The fact is, Mr. President, all of the skeptics have is speculation, \nconspiracy theories, and outright fantasy when it comes to the \npotential of abuse under any of these provisions of the PATRIOT Act. I \nam convinced that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the \nSenate, Senator Specter, and the conferees in the House and Senate have \ndone their very best given the nature of negotiations and compromise to \nstrike the best balance between civil liberties and the protection of \nthe American people. It would be a failure of responsibility and duty \nfor us not to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.\n  But I ask again, what has changed since September 11, 2001? What has \nchanged since October of 2001 to now lead some of our colleagues to say \nthat these provisions are unimportant, are not useful, or are no longer \nneeded? Has the threat of international terrorism receded? Has it gone \naway?\n  I looked on the Internet before I came here for a listing, because I \nwanted to make sure I had all of them, of suspected al-Qaida terrorist \nattacks across the globe since September of 2001.\n  In December 2001, a man tried to detonate a shoe bomb on a flight \nfrom Paris to Miami. I believe his name is Richard Reid. There was an \nexplosion in April of 2002 at an historic synagogue in Tunisia that \nleft 21 dead, including 14 German tourists. In May of 2002, a car \nexploded outside a hotel in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 14, including 11 \nFrench citizens. In June 2002, a bomb exploded outside the American \nconsulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing 12 people. In October 2002, a \nboat crashed into an oil tanker off the Yemen coast killing a single \nindividual. Then there were the nightclub bombings in Bali, Indonesia, \nthat killed 202 people, mostly Australian citizens, in October of 2002.\n  Then there was a suicide attack in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 16 in \nNovember of 2002. In May of 2003, suicide bombers killed 34, including \n8 Americans at housing compounds for westerners in Riyadh, Saudi \nArabia. In May 2003, 4 bombs killed 33 people, targeting Jewish, \nSpanish, and Belgian sites in Casablanca, Morocco. In August 2003, \nsuicide car bombers killed 12 people and injured 150 more at the \nMarriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia. In November 2003, explosions \nrocked a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, housing compound killing 17. In November \n2003, suicide car bombers simultaneously attacked two synagogues in \nIstanbul, killing 25 and injuring hundreds more. In November 2003, \ntruck bombs detonated at a London bank and British consulate in \nIstanbul, Turkey, killed 26. In March 2004, 10 bombs on 4 trains \nexploded almost simultaneously during the morning rush hour in Madrid, \nSpain, killing 202 and injuring more than 1,400 people. In May 2004, \nterrorists attacked a Saudi oil company office in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, \nkilling 22.\n  In June 2004, terrorists kidnaped and executed American Paul Johnson, \nJr., in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Then in September 2004, car bombs outside \nthe Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, killed 9. In December \n2004, terrorists entered the U.S. consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, \nkilling 9. In July 2005, bombs exploded on 3 trains and a bus in \nLondon, England, killing 52. In October 2005, 22 were killed by 3 \nsuicide bombs, again in Bali, Indonesia. Then most recently in November \n2005, 57 were killed at 3 American hotels in Amman, Jordan, including \nat a wedding party.\n  Mr. President, I go through this list not to just bore my listeners \nbut rather to recount in horrific detail the threat that still exists \nto America and American citizens and people all around the world by \ninternational terrorists. These are examples of what could happen on \nour own soil again if we let our guard down as we did before September \n11.\n  Just to remind my colleagues what we have been able to do because we \nhave been on our guard, because we have the PATRIOT Act, because we \nhave equipped our law enforcement and intelligence personnel with the \ntools necessary to identify and investigate and disrupt terrorist \nactivities, because we have been on the offensive in Afghanistan and \nIraq disrupting the ability of terrorists to train, recruit, and then \nexport their terrorist activities, because we have done all of those \nthings, America has not sustained another terrorist attack on our own \nsoil since September 11, 2001. But it is far from certain that it will \nnot happen again.\n\n  Some have said it is a matter of when, not if, America will be hit \nagain.\n\n[[Page S13951]]\n\nBut, thank goodness, because of the diligent efforts of men and women \nin our law enforcement agencies, in our intelligence agencies, the men \nand women in our military, and so many other people working together \ndiligently, we have protected Americans on our own soil. There have \nbeen at least 10 serious al-Qaida plots disrupted, including 3 al-Qaida \nplots to attack inside the United States since September 11.\n  In mid 2002, the United States disrupted a plot to attack targets on \nthe west coast of the United States using hijacked airplanes. The \nplotters included at least one major operational planner involved in \nthe events of September 11. In mid 2003, the United States and a \npartner disrupted a plot to attack targets on the east coast of the \nUnited States using hijacked commercial airplanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Then there is the Jose Padilla plot in May 2002. The \nUnited States disrupted a plot that involved blowing up an apartment \nbuilding in the United States using a dirty bomb or a radiation \ndispersal device. In mid 2004, the United States and our partners \ndisrupted a plot that involved urban targets in the United Kingdom. \nThese plots involved using explosives against a variety of sites. Then \nthere was a plot in Karachi, a plot at Heathrow Airport in London, \nanother UK plot in 2004, another Arabian Gulf shipping plot, one in the \nStraits of Hormuz in 2002, and a tourist site targeted by al-Qaida. In \n2003 there have been at least 10 disrupted terrorist attacks as a \nresult of the concerted efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence \npersonnel, at least 3 on American soil since September 2001.\n  I ask my colleagues who are blocking the vote on the renewal and \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act: What could they possibly be \nthinking to believe that we ought to voluntarily relinquish the tools \nthat have in part made it possible to keep us safe and to protect \nAmericans from these terrorist attacks?\n  I know, Mr. President, there are others in the Chamber who want to \nspeak on this or related issues. I want to close on one last red \nherring that has been raised.\n  As the New York Times reported, the President of the United States \nhas authorized, after counseling with the Department of Justice and \nvarious legal authorities, as well as consulting with Congress on up to \n12 occasions, the use of intercepted messages from the National \nSecurity Agency as part of our ongoing counterterrorism efforts. The \nNew York Times suggested that this was a secret way to threaten the \ncivil liberties of Americans. The fact is, as is now being revealed, \nCongress was consulted at least 12 times since September 11th about the \nPresident's authorization of these interceptions of communications, \ninterceptions which were not solely within the United States but were \nfrom known links to international terrorism in the United States and \nknown links with international terrorism overseas.\n  It is perhaps not a coincidence that just before the vote on cloture \non the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, the New York Times released \nthis story. Indeed, at least two Senators--I heard with my own ears--\ncited this article as a reason why they voted to not allow a bipartisan \nmajority to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. As it turns out, the author of \nthis article had turned in a book to his publisher 3 months ago. The \npaper failed to reveal that the story was tied to a book release and \nsale by the author James Risen. The title of the book is ``State of \nWar, the Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration.'' It is \nabout to be published by the Free Press in the coming weeks.\n  It is a crying shame that America's safety is endangered by the \npotential expiration of the PATRIOT Act in part because a newspaper has \nseen fit to release, on the night before the vote on the \nreauthorization of the Act, and as part of a marketing campaign for \nselling the book, something that is blatantly misrepresentative of the \nfacts and appears to be an attempt to strike terror or perhaps paranoia \ninto Senators and others out of some unrealistic and inaccurate concern \nfor invasion of civil liberties.\n  It is appropriate that Congress have hearings to look into this, but \nthe fact is, the President and his administration have briefed high \nranking Members of Congress on 12 occasions since this so-called secret \nprogram of intercepting communications between known terrorist contacts \nin the United States and overseas occurred.\n  When I came to Washington to serve in the Senate almost 3 years ago, \nsomeone jokingly referred to it as a logic-free zone where perception \nis reality. We all got a good laugh out of that. But the hysteria over \nthe USA PATRIOT Act and the fact that people have, in too many \ninstances, not focused on the hard-fought attempts to balance our \nsecurity with civil liberty concerns by hammering out thoughtful and \nuseful provisions is a disservice to the American people. It is not a \ntypical policy disagreement that we sometimes have about taxes or some \nother issue. This is one that has the grave potential of endangering \nAmerican lives because we know the terrorist threat exists. This threat \ncontinues to this day.\n  September 11, while it was 4 years ago, is not an isolated event, as \nthe listing I provided details. Terrorists will, if we let our guard \ndown, hit us again. Then I ask: Where will the blame lie? If we have \nfailed to do everything within our power to protect the American \npeople, we will have failed to discharge our duty in this body.\n  I hope our colleagues who are blocking a bipartisan majority from \ncasting a vote to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act which will prevent the \nexpiration of these 16 provisions will reconsider their decision. It is \nunthinkable to me that anyone would allow these provisions to expire. I \nrealize there are differences of opinion. I am happy to have this \ndebate. I understand that people have conscientiously held opinions \nthat are different than mine about the importance of this Act, but to \nblock a bipartisan majority from having the chance to vote is \nincredible.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Cornyn for his discussion of this \nimportant issue. If the people of America were to hear what he said and \nconsider those issues thoughtfully, their fears would be greatly \nrelieved. I am convinced there is nothing in this legislation that in \nany way jeopardizes the liberties we have.\n  The Senator from Texas served as attorney general for the State of \nTexas. He served on the Supreme Court of the State of Texas. He brings \ngood judgment and legal understanding to the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to listen to him.\n  Senator Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and certainly a \nperson who has been a champion of civil liberties all his career, has \nsaid that the bill we passed in this body by unanimous consent which \nwent to conference in order to work out differences with the House, \ncame back with 80 percent the provisions contained in the Senate bill \nuntouched, and very few changes in favor of the House version.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas, the bill we passed here by unanimous \nconsent, is that not the same bill he and I worked on in the Judiciary \nCommittee and that came out of the committee unanimously by an 18-to-0 \nvote after full discussion about those issues?\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Alabama is absolutely correct. He serves \nwith great distinction on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as does the \ncurrent occupant of the Chair. We all know that it is not the most \ncohesive committee in the Senate. As a matter of fact, we have some \npretty serious disagreements about important policy issues. But on the \nPATRIOT Act, under Senator Specter's guidance, with the ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, we were able to reach unanimity and pass the PATRIOT Act \nout of the Judiciary Committee. That would not happen, given the legal \nminds and the great advocates we have on the Judiciary Committee, if it \nwere not a good bill. To now suggest, as some have, that this has not \nbeen well thought through, that it is not carefully done, flies in the \nface of the facts.\n  If I may, Mr. President, through the Chair, I ask my friend from \nAlabama,\n\n[[Page S13952]]\n\nwho has been a distinguished U.S. attorney, served as attorney general \nof his State before coming to the Senate, and has a lot of experience \nin law enforcement, are the provisions of the PATRIOT Act that are \nbeing debated involving wiretaps and production of business records and \ndelayed notice search warrants, are these the sort of ordinary tools \nthat are available to prosecutors in State and Federal courts in \nregular, ordinary, vanilla criminal cases?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Texas. He is exactly correct. \nAs a former attorney general of Texas, he knows that every county \nattorney in America can go to a county judge and issue a subpoena for \nbank records, for medical records, for telephone toll records, for \nmotel records, for library records, and for bookstore records.\n  That is done every day and the standard is simply whether those \nrecords are relevant to an investigation that the Attorney General or \ndistrict attorney in any county in America is conducting. That is the \nway the system works. People act as if issuance of a subpoena for \nsomebody's records is a violation of a constitutional rights. That is \nbeyond my understanding.\n  So I certainly agree. In fact, with regard to a group of records, the \npower of the FBI to investigate terrorists, in some ways, is far less \nthan that of a county attorney. A 215 order includes health records, \nlibrary records, bookstore records--I hate to laugh, but--for which you \nhave to go to a court and get approval before they are issued. The \nlocal district attorney issue this type of order if he is investigating \nsomebody for failure to pay county taxes.\n  I want to ask the Senator about this. One distinguished Senator \nyesterday on the floor of the Senate declared that an FBI agent could \nwrite up a warrant and go out to search your house. With regard to the \ntwo categories of records I have mentioned, I add for the Record that \nthese are records not in the possession of a potential defendant or \nterrorist; these are records in the possession of a bank or a telephone \ncompany; they are not personal records. But with regards to personal \nrecords where the district attorneys in every county and any U.S. \nAttorney has to get a search warrant and has to have it approved by a \njudge, and in the case of the FBI, a Federal judge, they have to submit \nfacts under oath to justify the search, and those searches go to a \nperson's home, their automobile, or areas in which they have dominion \nand control. My question to the Senator is whether he is aware of \nanything in this legislation that in any way would undermine the \nstandard and burden on investigators before they get a search warrant \nof somebody's private property?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama he is \nprecisely correct. One of the things that has been carefully taken into \nconsideration in this legislation is to make sure whoever the \nindividual is or whoever's rights are at issue, that there is an \nopportunity to go to a judge--in this case, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court, a specialized court with jurisdiction over national \nsecurity cases--and to ask an impartial judge to intervene.\n  But some of our colleagues, it seems, have these fantasies about \nrogue law enforcement personnel with nothing better to do than running \nroughshod over the rights of American citizens. These are serious \nprofessionals. I know my colleague from Alabama, being a former U.S. \nattorney, has worked closely with the FBI and other Federal law \nenforcement officials. I ask him--and then I will certainly yield the \nfloor to him for any other remarks he cares to make--is there any basis \nto this idea that Federal law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and \nthe intelligence agencies, have nothing better to do or have so little \ndisregard for our laws and Constitution that they look for \nopportunities to trample on the rights of innocent American citizens?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. That is such a good question. I \nworked very closely on a daily basis with FBI agents for 15 years as a \nFederal prosecutor. Some of those agents remain good friends of mine. \nThey are people of high integrity and discipline. They follow the \nrules. Sometimes they shake their heads in wonderment at the \nregulations we place on them as they are out trying to protect America. \nBut they comply day after day with whatever rule it is. In fact, I \nguess some people may have thought when we created a wall between the \nCIA and the FBI, that if information were important, agents would not \npay much attention to that wall, and would share the information \nanyway. Surely the CIA would tell the FBI if they have information that \na dangerous cell may be operating in the U.S.; surely they would tell \nthem. But we prohibited it. There was a wall and this legislation tore \nit down. Before this wall was torn down, they did not share any \ninformation, regardless of how important it may have been.\n  I was on a show with a distinguished Member of this Senate who made \nthe comment that the people of his State didn't want the FBI patrolling \nnear their homes and searching their houses and getting delayed \nwarrants and staying in their houses and all these other things. I \ntalked to the Attorney General Gonzales today. He said two-tenths of 1 \npercent--2 out of 1,000 warrants issued in this country, are delayed \nwarrants. There probably hasn't been one issued in his State since the \nact was passed 4 years ago. The last thing the FBI would want to do is \nviolate the law, risk their careers, or waste their resources prowling \ninto the houses of Americans. To get a delayed notice warrant or any \nwarrant of this kind, they have to go to the court in advance. Then \nthey have to have additional proof if they want to delay the notice to \nthe person whose residence has been searched.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have \n2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Cornyn from Texas for his steadfast \nwork on this issue. He is an extremely hard-working Senator. He gets \nthese facts right. He is an extremely skilled lawyer and has a great \nlegal mind. I hope the people will listen to his remarks.\n  We have gone through this bill. This bill was carefully drafted the \nfirst time we voted on it. It came out of the Senate 4 years ago with \nonly one ``no'' vote. We have had 4 years of experience with it. It is \ngoing to expire the end of this calendar year. We passed our version of \nreauthorization by unanimous consent in this body. Our Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, which has some of the most civil libertarian lawyers in the \nSenate--in the country, for that matter--passed it out unanimously. I \nam shocked, surprised, and utterly disappointed that we went to \nconference--where we maintained position after position on our bill and \nthe House conceded time and time again on their bill, to the extent \nthat about 80 percent of the differing provisions were decided in favor \nof the Senate--and now have this unbelievable filibuster that blocked a \nbill which had so much bipartisan support, from coming up and being \nconsidered and given a vote.\n  I thank the Chair. I see the distinguished ranking Member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on the floor, Senator Levin. I am \ndelighted to yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my friend from \nAlabama.\n  One quick comment on the PATRIOT Act. Of course, everybody in this \nbody wants to renew the PATRIOT Act. That is not the issue. The issue \nis the contents of that act and whether this body ought to have an \nopportunity to debate some of the differences between the version that \ncame back to us from conference and the one that left the Senate. There \nare significant differences.\n  There is a bipartisan group that opposes the PATRIOT Act in its \ncurrent form. We all want to extend that act so there is no gap. Nobody \nwants a gap in coverage. Everybody agrees it should be extended. The \nquestion is, should it be extended for a short period of time to give \nthose of us who have questions and doubts about some of the provisions \nthat came back from conference that were not in the Senate version an \nopportunity to debate and hopefully change some of those versions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just 1 second on \nthat point?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I urge him to examine the legislation and to examine \nthe\n\n[[Page S13953]]\n\nchanges that are made. I know some have said they are significant. With \nthe Senator's legal skills and ability to analyze, I think he will find \nthey are not nearly as significant as some say. As a matter of fact, \nmost are very small. I believe he will feel comfortable in the end once \nagain voting for this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. I have, \nindeed, studied the version that has come back from conference. The \ndifferences are significant, indeed. They are very significant, so much \nso that some of the more conservative Members of this body have joined \nin a decision that we should have an opportunity to debate the PATRIOT \nAct conference report before it is enacted. We all want to extend it to \ngive us that opportunity. But this is not a Democratic or Republican \nopposition; it is a bipartisan group of Senators who have studied the \nconference report and have significant differences with it, and I am \none of those Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13953-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13953-S13956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a different bill, a \nbill we thought was finally put to bed yesterday. When we say ``put to \nbed,'' what we conferees mean is the conference is over and that all of \nthe members of the conference have signed the conference sheets, the \nsignature sheets which signify that document that is attached to those \nsheets is the final version and that then will be presented to both \nHouses for their consideration.\n  Senator Warner came to the Chamber last night to express his dismay \nwith what we understand now has happened in the House, and that is that \nthe House leadership is apparently toying with the idea, considering \nthe possibility of trying to insert in that conference report a totally \nunrelated bill that is not part of either the House or the Senate \nDefense authorization bill, which is totally unrelated to the subject \nmatter of the Defense Authorization Act.\n  To me, it is not important what the substance of the bill is that the \nHouse Republican leadership wants to attach. The principle is \nimportant. The principle is one of the fundamental principles under \nwhich we operate in this body and in this Congress, and that is, once a \nconference report is agreed to, once those signature sheets have been \nattached, nothing can just be inserted, unless, of course, the \nconference report is rejected or the report is referred back to \nconference.\n  There are rules that the House gets the conference report first, and \nthat allows that body to return a conference report for further \nconsideration. But what is happening here is not that there was going \nto be a conference report taken up in the House with a motion to refer \nback to conference to consider other material. Here, apparently, from \nwhat we understand, the House leadership was attempting to find some \nway to add significant legislation to a conference report on which the \nsignature sheet had already been signed by all of us.\n  Senator Warner came to the Chamber last night to express his dismay \nwith this process. As always, Senator Warner is extraordinarily \nhonorable. For him, it is not important what the subject matter of this \nadded legislation is. It is the principle involved. It is the process \ninvolved. We cannot possibly operate under a procedure where after a \nconference is over and the signature sheets are signed that then there \nis an effort made without, I guess, the body reopening the conference \nby sending it back to conference for reconsideration but just simply \nlooking for a mechanism to add legislation to a conference report which \nhad already been signed.\n  Senator Warner said something last night that I concur in 1,000 \npercent. In fact, everything he said last night I concur in 1,000 \npercent because he is a Senate man. He is an institution man. He loves \nthis institution. And the idea that we could have a process where a \nconference report is signed and then, somehow or other, through some \nmysterious mechanism or means, additional legislation is added to it \nwithout that conference being reorganized and the House, the first body \nthat receives this conference report, referring it back to conference, \nis a totally unacceptable process.\n  The chairman of our committee, Senator Warner, last night said he was \nnot going to accept this process. He would filibuster his own bill if \nit contained material we had not considered and was now showing up in a \nconference report. And I would join him in that filibuster. He would \nexercise the rules of this body to ask the Chair to rule that there is \nout-of-scope material in this conference report, and I would join him \nin asking the Chair to make such a ruling.\n  This is separate and apart from whether he or I agree with the \nmaterial which was proposed to be added. By the way, for whatever \nrelevance it has, I think probably both of us would be inclined to \nsupport the material which was intended to be added if it ever came to \nthe floor in a proper way. I don't want to commit myself to that \nposition because I haven't seen the actual material proposed to be \nadded, but what I know of the subject matter, it would be the type of \nchange in our law which I probably would support and, without speaking \nfor Senator Warner, I think he is probably inclined to support, too. \nThat is not the issue. We can't treat our colleagues that way. This is \na controversial matter which is proposed to be added. There is a very \nstrong debate over the subject matter.\n\n  Regardless of what our position is, as the chairman and ranking \nmember of this committee, we cannot bring back from the conference a \ndocument which contains material which had never been discussed in \nconference, never the subject of debate in either the House or the \nSenate, was not in the House or the Senate bill, and is totally \nnongermane to the subject matter of the conference report.\n  We all know there are items added to conference reports that were not \nin either bill. That happens. But under our rule, the only way it now \nhappens is if it is material to which everybody agrees. It cannot be \nmaterial which is not in agreement by the Members of the two bodies. We \ncannot possibly, as a matter of principle, have a process where a \nconference report comes back containing material not germane, not \nrelevant, not material to the conference, not the subject of either \nbill that passed either House, and which is added after the signature \nsheets have been signed.\n  I wanted to come to the Chamber and say what has happened because we \nheard this effort was being considered--just being considered--by the \nHouse Republican leadership. Senator Warner and I asked our staff to go \nover to the House and retrieve our signature sheets.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I already gave some remarks on the Senate \nfloor last night about my admiration for the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. My admiration of the senior Senator from Virginia \nis a volume. I think John Warner is what a Senator is all about, and I \nsaid that last night.\n  I say to my friend from Michigan, I have served in legislative bodies \na long time. I have been in public service for more than 40 years. And \nmy respect for the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee is \nequal to that of the senior Senator from Virginia. There is no better \nSenator than Carl Levin from Michigan--not today or ever. He is one of \nthe best ever.\n  The working relationship between Senator Warner and Senator Levin is \nwhat the Senate should be. But I want to say that what is going on in \nthis Congress is absolutely untoward. We have a Defense appropriations \nbill that will fund the military, some $450 billion, that is being held \nup by sticking onto that bill drilling in Alaska, drilling oil wells in \nAlaska.\n  There is a place for that legislation, but it should not hold up this \nbill, as it has been. As Lord Acton said, ``Power tends to corrupt, and \nabsolute power tends to corrupt absolutely.'' That is what we have a \nstudy of in here: The absolute power of the Republicans controlling the \nWhite House, the House, and the Senate is leading to a corrupt \nCongress.\n  To think that the rules mean nothing, throw them aside, let us change \nthem today, we are going to put something on the Defense appropriations\n\n[[Page S13954]]\n\nbill. The other aspect of the Defense authorization bill is taking care \nof our men and women who are fighting for us. It does things such as \ntaking care of pensions, changes in pay and equipment that the \nappropriations bill funds, which is what the Senator from Michigan and \nJohn Warner have done.\n  I saw the chairman of the Armed Services Committee as I was leaving \nthe House yesterday, the distinguished House Member from the San Diego, \nCA area, whom I served with, Duncan Hunter. I asked, how are we coming \non this? He said, it is done, it is just like this. One could not see \nthe line between his fingers.\n  Then we come back over here and it is not done. They are trying to \nstick into this some type of campaign finance reform. Think about that. \nANWR on the Defense appropriations bill and campaign finance in the \nDefense authorization bill. What is this Congress turning into?\n  It is almost Christmas and we cannot get our work done. The \nintelligence authorization bill--we have people giving these patriotic \nspeeches about all the things that need to be done. We cannot do the \nintelligence authorization bill. That is the bill that directs our \nintelligence-gathering activities in America. Why? Because they will \nnot let us talk about Abu Ghraib and what has gone on in the military \nprisons around the world. They will not let us do it, so they are not \ngoing to do the bill--they meaning the Republican leadership.\n  People complain about appropriations bills having stuff in them that \nthey should not. Well, anybody who has any thought of an appropriations \nbill being pork, wait until the scope of conference changes.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate at this time has \ntold me--and I have heard him give public speeches--about how he thinks \nthere should not be extraneous things in appropriations bills. Well, I \nsay to my distinguished friend, who is a medical doctor and extremely \nintelligent, if you cannot see the incongruity of allowing ANWR to be \nplaced on an appropriations bill, then you are a lot less intelligent \nthan I think you are. How could anybody allow this to happen?\n  Then the final thing I will mention briefly is the PATRIOT Act. The \nPATRIOT Act yesterday was brought to this Senate in the form of a \nconference report. A group of Democrats and Republicans felt the bill \nthat passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously, came to the \nSenate floor and passed unanimously and was taken to that place across \nthe aisle, the House of Representatives, the other body, and came back \nhere a different animal, is now a different bill. It was not the same \nthing. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved it unanimously and it \nwas approved unanimously in the Senate. It was different legislation.\n  That is why human rights and civil rights groups on the right and the \nleft politically opposed it. We did the right thing. We want the \nPATRIOT Act to be extended for 3 months to see if Senator Specter and \nSenator Leahy can work something out so that the problems with it--and \nthere are significant problems--can be worked out.\n  I do not appreciate insinuations and intimations that those people \nwho opposed cloture yesterday were unpatriotic. I am opposed to \nterrorists as much as anybody in this country. I voted for the first \nPATRIOT Act and I am glad I did. We sunsetted certain things in that \nfirst PATRIOT Act because we were pushed, because of the events of 9/\n11, to get the law changed so we could go after terrorists better than \nwe did. So do not come and give lectures about someone being more \npatriotic than others and understanding the terrorists more than \nothers. Everyone in this Senate, Democrat and Republican, is patriotic \nand opposes terrorists, these evil people around the world. We want to \ndo everything we can to defeat terrorists, but we want to do it \nrecognizing that we in America live by a document called the U.S. \nConstitution that directs what we do.\n  We can have security and we can have liberty at the same time. When \nwe start saying security is more important than the liberties of the \nAmerican people, this country is in trouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask a question of the Senator before \nhe yields the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time to the floor if I have \nany time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case I will not reclaim my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask the distinguished Democratic leader--he is a \ngreat and skilled advocate, and I know everybody is a bit frustrated at \nthe end of the session, but I do not think he meant to accuse the \ndistinguished Senator Cochran and the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, who have reached a little different conclusion than he \nwould, of being corrupt. He used that word twice. Perhaps it is \nimportant for us to recognize that there are a lot of disagreements \naround here.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to my friend. I respond this \nway: Corruption is more than money corruption. There is intellectual \ncorruption. The point I was making with the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, who I care a great deal about, is that people do not like the \nappropriations process because there is too much money being spent on \nextraneous matters that they feel are unimportant, such as a swimming \npool in Sparks, NV, or something such as that. I am saying if you do \nnot like that, then you are going to hate the process after this \nprecedent is overruled and you can put anything you want in an \nappropriations bill. There would be no scope of conference and that is \nwhat I said and that is what I meant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to respond. First, I think it is \nunfortunate when somebody is in the chair that such a statement was \nmade without thankfully someone else being in the Chamber to allow me \nthe opportunity to respond to it.\n  There is a lot wrong with the process in the Senate and I am sure the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada probably has an intellectual heads-up \non me. I do not doubt that. But what is wrong is deception, not policy \nchanges, and you have never heard this Senator say anything about \nproblems with putting policy riders on appropriations bills.\n  What I have been very clear about from the day I arrived in the \nSenate is that there should not be earmarks that are used in \npolitically beneficial ways for individual Members of the body because \nwhat that does, in fact, is put the country second and us first. It \nputs the next election ahead of the next generation.\n  To equate that with policy changes that go along and use my position \nas somebody who is fighting hard to change the appropriations process \nand to use me as an example, because you may not at this time be \nhappy--I am not happy we are here, I am not happy that anything gets \nstuck on anything, but I also recognize the history of things that have \ngone on in this body and the other body and how at the end of a session \nthings get tacked on to lots of things.\n  I will not be used, nor will I allow my position to be used, to wedge \nother people into thinking I am inconsistent, and I will defend \nthat. My consistent criticism of the appropriation process is on \nearmarks and on earmarks alone and us living within the amount of \nmoneys we have and not using the earmark process to advantage your own \npolitical career.\n\n  I want to make sure everybody in this country understands that what \nyou are talking about is something wholly different than that. This is \npolicy. I am not happy about any additional spending that is not paid \nfor, I don't care what bill it comes through, and I have made it very \nclear to my leadership, on any bill that comes out of this end-of-the-\nyear process.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I say through the Chair \nto the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, first of all, I thought I \nwas complimenting the Senator from Oklahoma. If I did not, I apologize. \nI thought explaining--maybe some people watching this don't know that \nyou are a medical doctor. I also would say to my distinguished friend \nthat when someone is presiding and their name is mentioned, they always \nhave the capacity to speak, not as a Presiding Officer but as a \nSenator. So you would have every right to respond if I said something \nwith which you disagreed.\n  I would say this. The reason I think you should check out what I said \nis\n\n[[Page S13955]]\n\nthat, under the present rules, you cannot put policy on appropriations \nbills. It is only for money matters. The Senator said he doesn't object \nto policy matters on appropriations bills. I do because right now it is \nnot within the scope of the rules. That is what they are attempting to \nchange here, and I think it is wrong.\n  I say, Mr. President, if I in any way embarrassed the Senator from \nOklahoma or said something that offended him, I apologize because I \ncertainly didn't mean to do that. I thought just the opposite, I was \ntrying to compliment him. Maybe I need a lesson in how to compliment \npeople, but that is what I was trying to do.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would tell the Senator from Nevada I \ntake no personal offense but would also state there hasn't been an \nappropriations bill coming out of this body in 20 years that hasn't had \npolicy changes directed and attached to it. They all do. If you \nseriously look at them, there are policy directions on every one of \nthem because the Congress spends all its time appropriating rather than \nauthorizing--the very issue the Senator from Michigan is talking about. \nConsequently, this year we are going to appropriate $190 billion on \nitems that are not even authorized.\n  The Senator from Nevada is gracious. I wanted to make sure my point \nwas clear on my position in terms of earmarks and spending. I don't \nlike this process any better than he does, but I am willing to do what \nwe need to do for our country to get it done. I don't want us to \ncorrupt the process, but I will tell you that the process needs to \ncompletely be revised in terms of appropriations. We should never be in \nthis position that we find ourselves today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair to the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, one reason I got on this subject is you were quoted \nyesterday--actually, it is now Saturday--you were quoted the day before \nyesterday saying:\n\n       It's wrong for members of Congress to use our troops as \n     political cover for new spending. . . . If Senators want to \n     pass additional funds related to hurricane relief or the \n     avian flu, for example, those measures should be amendable \n     and not attached to must-pass bills that cannot be amended.\n\n  That is my whole point. Why change the rules? I would further say \nthat I will not raise the Senator's name again other than the quote I \njust read here.\n  I am going to read a letter indicating that I am not out in left \nfield about complaining about what is happening to our defense \nlegislation, appropriations and authorization. I have a letter here \ndated December 17. I think today is the 18th. It is written to me and \nSenator Frist.\n\n       We are very concerned that the fiscal year 2006 Defense \n     Appropriations Bill may be further delayed by attaching a \n     controversial non-defense provision to the defense \n     appropriations conference report.\n\n  It is ANWR.\n\n       We know that you share our overarching concern for the \n     welfare and needs of our troops. With 160,000 troops fighting \n     in Iraq, another 18,000 in Afghanistan, and tens of thousands \n     more around the world defending this country, Congress must \n     finish its work and provide them the resources they need to \n     do their job.\n       We believe that any effort to attach controversial \n     legislative language authorizing drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge . . . to the defense appropriations \n     conference report will jeopardize Congress' ability to \n     provide our troops and their families the resources they need \n     in a timely fashion.\n       The passion and energy of the debate about drilling in ANWR \n     is well known, and a testament to vibrant debate in our \n     democracy. But it is not helpful to attach such a \n     controversial non-defense legislative issue to a defense \n     appropriations bill. It only invites delay for our troops \n     as Congress debates an important but controversial non-\n     defense issue on a vital bill providing critical funding \n     for our nation's security.\n\n  The final sentence:\n\n       We urge you to keep ANWR off the defense appropriations \n     bill.\n\n  Signed by:\n\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.) Joseph P. Hoar; General, \n     U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.) Anthony C. Zinni; Lieutenant \n     General, U.S Army (Ret.) Claudia J. Kennedy; Vice Admiral, \n     U.S. Navy (Ret.) Lee F. Gunn; and Stephen A. Cheney, \n     Brigadier General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)\n\n  That is what we are facing here. We have to get real. The rules we \nhave are rules that we should follow. The reason this body has worked \nso well for 216 years is that we have rules, and they are to be \nfollowed. The debate sometimes is arcane. It takes a long time. \nSometimes it is difficult to stop people from talking too much. But \nthose are the rules we have here, and we should follow them.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that on a Defense \nappropriations bill, we should not be debating ANWR. I say to anyone, \nanyone who is a Senator, we should not let this happen. I don't care \nwho puts it on the bill, no matter how powerful the person may be, we \nshould not allow that to happen. We should not allow that to happen. It \nis not good for this body, as seen by these senior military.\n  To put on Defense authorization campaign finance reform is absolutely \nwrong--wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first we thank the Democratic leader for \nsupporting the fundamental principle that has been violated with this \nauthorization bill. It is a very different principle from the one the \nPresiding Officer feels so passionately about. It is a principle which \nI have, I believe, never seen violated.\n  The Senator from Alabama, who is on the floor, and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who is on the floor--they signed a signature sheet, I \nbelieve, on our Defense authorization. I think every Republican and I \nthink every Democrat signed the signature sheet.\n  The issue which the Presiding Officer feels so passionately about, \nwhich is earmarks on an appropriations bill and items being added on an \nappropriations bill, raises a whole different issue under a different \nrule. I believe his passion on this issue is admired by many in this \nbody. But the principle that Senator Warner and I are talking about is \na principle which is embedded, it is so fundamental--that once a \nconference report is signed there is no way that it can be or should be \nchanged. No way can material be inserted in a conference report.\n  This is in all of our interests. If in the conference we decided to \nadd material which had not been discussed by either body, that would \nthen raise the issue in which the good Presiding Officer is very \npassionately involved. I share many of his concerns. That is not his \nissue. The conference did not add this material. This is not an earmark \nadded by the conference, which had never gone through either body. This \nis material that apparently the Republican leadership in the House \nwants to add after the conference is closed, after we signed the \nsignature sheets, without going through the process of sending the \nconference report to the House and having them refer it back to \nconference if they want to. None of us can accept that. As a matter of \nprinciple, we cannot accept that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this last hour is a good example of what \nwe have come to as a Senate and a Nation. I come to the Senate to \nsupport Senator Levin's statement and Senator Warner's statement. We \nhave had a knockdown drag-out over the authorization bill. Everyone \ngave and we got a product the country can be proud of.\n  What has happened, as Senator Levin has described, we cannot survive \npolitically if this is allowed to stand. A lawyer in private practice \ncould get disbarred for doing something such as this.\n  My understanding of what has happened--and if I am wrong, I \napologize, and I hope Senator Levin will correct me if I am wrong--\nthere was a matter added to the conference report totally unrelated to \ndefending our Nation that has a major policy decision--which I happen \nto support, by the way, but not under these circumstances--that \nbasically changes the entire political process if it is allowed to \nstand. None of us are safe. Our word means nothing and our signature \nmeans nothing if you can change the document after everyone agreed to a \ncertain set of facts.\n  This is a defining moment for the Senate and the House. If we do not \nfix this now, it is going to eat at us all and our country will suffer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, my understanding is there is an \neffort being made to insert material. It has not yet been inserted \nbecause Senator Warner and I, through our staff, asked our staffs to go \nover to the House and\n\n[[Page S13956]]\n\nwithdraw our signatures before the material could be inserted.\n  It was the effort to insert it, the threat to insert it which was \ntransmitted to Senator Warner and transmitted to me through him and \nthrough Congressman Skelton. This is not an effort on the part of \nChairman Hunter, by the way. As I understand it, it is the Republican \nleadership in the House that is determined to find a way to insert \nmaterial into the conference report after the signature sheets have \nbeen signed. That is what I know about it.\n  Senator Warner was so disturbed about it, I was so disturbed about \nit, we decided we were not going to take a chance. We cannot risk this.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator will yield, I wish every American knew \nwhat was in the Defense authorization bill. In the Defense \nauthorization bill are provisions to allow guard members and reservists \nto get health care for themselves and their families. They need it now \nmore than ever. They are authorizing bonus programs for people who are \nserving worldwide now who are overtasked and underpaid.\n  To take this bill that will authorize much-needed relief to the \ntroops in the field, that will keep our equipment modern, will allow us \nto aggressively deal with the war on terror, capture the moral high \nground with the McCain language, do the habeas reform package we worked \non--to have that come down by inserting something after the fact is a \nlow blow. It will eat away at the heart of this body.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my dear friend from South Carolina.\n  It is an effort we cannot allow to succeed. We are in bipartisan \nagreement on this issue. It is the deepest form of process where we \nmust be able to rely upon each other's commitment and signature. We \ncannot let that shake. There are all kinds of differences in this \nSenate. Sometimes between Democrats and Republicans, sometimes between \nDemocrats and Democrats, between Republicans and Republicans. There are \ndifferences between us and other Members of the Senate. When a \nsignature is affixed, when a conference report is signed, we cannot \npossibly contemplate any change in that conference report even if we \nagree with it.\n  By the way, as the Senator from South Carolina said, I believe I am \nin agreement with the principle of the material which they seek to add. \nI know Senator Warner told me he is in agreement with it in principle. \nIt is bedrock principles. You do not go deeper than this.\n  We also have a rule--I know the Presiding Officer is focused on the \nissue I want to spend 1 minute on--we have a rule relative to \nlegislating on appropriations, which the Senator made reference to in \nhis remarks. We also have rule XXVIII which has to do with material in \na conference report which is out of scope. That rule was abided by so \nthat if anyone ever made a point of order that material in a conference \nreport was out of scope, if the Presiding Officer ruled, the body would \nnot overrule the Presiding Officer.\n  But we made a mistake in the early 1990s when we overruled the Chair. \nThere is material added to conference reports all the time, by the way, \nwhich has the agreement of conferees, which is out of scope that has \nthe agreement of conferees. It might not have the agreement of everyone \nin the body, but everyone in the conference report agrees to it. That \nhappens all the time. But what never happened until that one moment in \nthe early 1990s, a point of order was made that there was material out \nof scope in a conference report and the point of order was sustained by \nthe Chair. The Chair was overridden. That created havoc around here. So \nmuch so that a few years later we restored the rule and we wiped out \nthe precedent which was created by overruling the Chair.\n\n  That is what the issue is in the defense appropriations bill. That is \nwhat this issue is going to be. That is different from legislating on \nan appropriations bill. Forgive me for getting into the details, but I \nspent a few days studying the difference and I don't want to waste my \neffort the last few days to try to understand this distinction. The \nissue on the appropriations bill, since all of us are friends and we \nare sitting here on a Saturday evening talking to each other this way, \nthe difference on the appropriations bill and not legislating--I forget \nthe number of the rule, but is not rule XXVIII--there is a different \nrule from the one that is at issue on defense appropriations.\n  The issue on the defense appropriations bill is whether we would \noverrule the Chair who will rule that the Arctic drilling issue is out \nof scope and out of order, and whether we are then going to override \nthat ruling and put us back in the same morass we were in in the early \n1990s, which caused us a few years later to reverse that precedent, \nundo that terrible precedent which actually made our rules into mush. \nWe cannot have a rule which sometimes applies and sometimes does not, \nwe override it every other day and restore it every other day. We \ncannot operate that way and hold our heads up as being legislators.\n  I thank my Chair and my friends for their patience. Let me close by \nconfirming what the Senator from South Carolina said about the \nimportance of the bill. It increases pay by 3.1 percent, which is half \na percent higher than inflation. We have been fighting for that a long \ntime. It increases the death gratuity to all active-duty deaths from \n$12,000 to $100,000, retroactive to the beginning of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. It authorizes a new special pay of $435 a month during \nhospitalization. It authorizes new leave for up to 21 days when \nadopting a child. We can go on and on. The Senator from South Carolina \nmentioned a few of them and my friend from Alabama knows this because \nhe works hard on these issues, too.\n  We are trying to put items in here in this bill which are good for \nthe troops, good for their families, good for the Nation, good for our \nsecurity. We cannot watch this effort go down the drain after it was \nsuch a tremendous effort made to finish this bill. We set a record, \nfolks. We had the shortest period of time to do an authorization bill \nand we had the record number of amendments that we were able to \nresolve. We set two records on this bill. Those records go down the \ndrain unless the House leadership decides they are not going to try to \ndo something that, as far as I know, has never been done before, which \nis to insert material in a bill somehow after the signature sheets have \nbeen signed.\n  There is a process. If the bill goes to the House and they want to \nrefer it back to conference to consider something, in scope or out of \nscope, that is their right. But when this threat came that they were \nlooking for a way to insert other matter into this conference report, \nafter we had signed the sheets, Senator Warner--I cannot pay enough \ntribute to Senator Warner--is taking a very strong stand against the \nleader of his own party and the House of Representatives. I commend him \nfor it. I hope the leadership of the House will relent and allow us to \nmove forward with this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will follow up on that. I think the \nHouse leadership and many on this side do feel the language would be \ngood for the country and it is the right thing to do. And if everybody \nagrees, a lot of things happen around here. But if Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner have concluded they do not want to discuss any \nadditional additions, it is not going to happen; it is just not going \nto happen. Unanimously, if anybody agreed to add something, something \nthat everybody likes, maybe it could occur. Sometimes one side has to \npush a little harder to make sure the other side understands how \nstrongly they feel about it. But at some point, if Senators Warner and \nLevin do not agree to this alteration, it is not going to be in the \nbill.\n  So as a legal principle, I know they used to always say: There ain't \nno harm in asking. So they have tried. But I am not sure it will work \nif we are not going to see their support for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13956-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13956-S13957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ABU GHRAIB\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will say something about Senator \nReid's, the Democratic leader's, reference to Abu Ghraib, suggesting \nthat this bill, the legislation in this Defense bill has been held up \nperhaps because nobody wants to do anything about what has been going \non in Abu Ghraib. Once again, it deeply concerns me. Once again, we are \nhaving the suggestion, if\n\n[[Page S13957]]\n\nnot a plain statement, that we need to pass legislation and we need to \nhave congressional hearings to stop things such as what occurred in Abu \nGhraib.\n  I was a member of the Armed Services Committee. I am a member of the \nJudiciary Committee. We have had about 20 hearings on Abu Ghraib. But \ndo you know how we found out about Abu Ghraib? We found out about it at \na press briefing in Baghdad by a U.S. Army general or colonel who said \nthey had reports of abuse at Abu Ghraib and they were taking steps to \ninvestigate it. And they did so. They found people had violated the \nlaw. They prosecuted them. A number of them are in jail this very day.\n  We did not need to pass one single law for that to happen because it \nwas in violation of military standards. In fact, none of the \nmistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib had to do with trying to \ninterrogate them. These people were not interrogators. They were prison \nguards, manning the prison at the graveyard shift, who lost their \ndiscipline, abused those prisoners, and had no real excuse for it. As \none of them said, Smith--I believe he was a sergeant--he said: We all \nknew there would be hell to pay if anybody found out what we did. It \nwas not approved. We were not ordered to do it. It was not part of our \nmilitary standard and training.\n  I remember, very vividly, during that time that an African-American \ncolonel in combat, as soldiers were taking hostile fire--they captured \nsomeone, one of the terrorists or bad guys--and he fired a gun beside \nhis head to frighten him and to get him to tell some information. There \nwas a life-and-death matter for his troops. They drummed him out of the \nservice. He never touched the guy. He never hurt him. It was a moment \nof passion and intense feeling and reaction to being in a life-and-\ndeath struggle. He is out of the military even though he had a quite \ndistinguished career.\n  Our military does not approve of abusing and torturing prisoners. In \nfact, we have a statute that defines torture, and they have worked hard \nto stay within it. People who do not stay within it get prosecuted. \nNow, we have ideas to go further, and that has been put as a part of \nthis bill, and it is going to become law. I hope it doesn't go too far. \nBut we have never approved of the kinds of things that went on in Abu \nGhraib. We have never approved of torture. We have a statute, passed by \nthis Congress, that prohibits torture by the military or anyone else. \nWe do not allow that. It is not part of our standards as a nation. But \nto say there can never be any stress on prisoners who have great \nintelligence, and who are threats to America, I don't think has been \nconsistent with the law of warfare.\n  I will note, parenthetically, that it became quite clear, as went \nthrough our hearings, that the Geneva Conventions, which protect \nsoldiers in lawful combat--those protections do not apply to these \nprisoners. They do not wear uniforms. They do not operate on behalf of \na state, a legitimate nation state, even a quasi-legitimate nation \nstate. They do not adhere to standards of behavior. They do not carry \ntheir guns openly and their weapons openly. They sneak around and \nmurder women and children, innocent civilians, contrary to the laws of \nwarfare. Therefore, they do not gain the protections of the Geneva \nConventions. But they are protected against torture, and they are \nentitled to that protection. They should be granted it. And if anybody \nviolates those standards, they are prosecuted by the U.S. military.\n  I think the military has taken far too much abuse on this. They did a \nhuge study of Guantanamo, Gitmo. I have been there twice. I know the \nstandards those guards operate under. They have a phrase they greet \neach other with when they see each other on the base, one soldier to \nanother. They say: Honor bound. And when they see you, they say: Honor \nbound, sir. They have high standards. They found three abuse cases, \nmost minor, that were discovered after a review down there, and \ndisciplinary action was taken concerning those. But they are not being \nmistreated every day, abused or tortured. I reject that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13957-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13957-S13959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I also say this. I am not aware of a \nsingle proponent of the PATRIOT Act who has accused any Member on the \nother side, or any Member who opposes the PATRIOT Act, of being \nunpatriotic. Where did that come from? I would like to search the \nRecord. I would like to see that. I do not think it has occurred. I \nhave not heard anybody over here say that. We say: You are wrong. We \nsay you are making a mistake, that you ought to reconsider, you ought \nto study the act and see that it does not threaten our liberties, that \nit is consistent with our constitutional protections this great Nation \nprovides.\n  If you do not pass it, I will repeat, this legislation will lapse as \nof December 31, and it will place our Nation at greater risk. There is \nno doubt about that. I would repeat, again, it is stunningly surprising \nto me that we end up, after the bill passed here unanimously in the \nSenate, unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, and it went to \nconference with the House of Representatives. At conference, most of \nthe disagreements were resolved in favor of our bill. Who has ever \nheard of a bill of this size that did not have some changes in \nconference? They were all minor. Most of the changes resulted in \nmovement toward the Senate bill.\n  Some of the provisions were left to be sunsetted in 4 years by the \nSenate bill. The House said they should be sunsetted in 10 years, so \nthey would stay in effect for 10 years before they would have a full \nup-or-down review for reauthorization. We said 4 years. So we went to \nconference, and we thought agreement had been reached on 7 years. After \nwe signed the conference report--Senator Kyl and others--we thought we \nhad an agreement at 7 years. This is what we normally do in these \ndeals, sort of split the difference when you can. And Senator Leahy and \nthe Democratic members had a fit. No, no, no, it had to be 4 years. It \nhad to be 4 years. And we argued that was not appropriate.\n  Senator Kyl and I, particularly, were involved in those discussions, \nbeing members of the conference committee. We thought 7 years was a \ngood compromise. That was the last issue to be decided, and we totally \nagreed to go to 4.\n  That was the Senate version exactly. They wanted 7 as a compromise. \nThe House wanted 10 in their bill. We ended up totally winning on the \nSenate position.\n  There was a dispute about delayed notification warrants. The Senate \nbill that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee and on the \nSenate floor said the warrant that is executed, after prior approval by \na U.S. judge who has made a specific additional finding on facts \npresented to that judge, is justified to delay notification to the \nperson's residence who is being served. In those circumstances, delayed \nnotification is essential because these matters are going to involve \ntremendous security and are of tremendous importance to an \ninvestigation of this kind. In the Senate, we decided that \ninvestigators should report back to the judge within 7 days. After 7 \ndays, you could then ask for an additional period of time before you \nnotified the person whose residence had been searched.\n  The House bill set the delayed notification period for 180 days. They \nsaid: In a terrorist investigation, you could delay notification to the \nperson whose house was searched for 180 days.\n  So we had a big brouhaha over that. We agreed to 30 days, which is \nfar closer to the Senate version than to the House. Frankly, it didn't \nmake a whole lot of difference because you have to have prior judicial \napproval to delay notice. And if you want to continue to delay notice, \nyou have to prove that there is an existing continuing threat and \ndanger. It is not a big deal.\n  This bill is about to expire, and those are the kinds of things that \nthey say are such tremendous changes that now we should not even get an \nup-or-down vote. The fact that we are going to allow this bill to \nexpire and not allow it to become law, will result in the wall going \nback up between the CIA and the FBI. That makes no sense.\n  Frankly, there are some things in here that worry me. One of the \nthings you have to do to delay notice or to not notify someone under a \n215 order is to have an agent certify that not doing would result in a \nthreat to America. It is hard to certify that. Some people think they \nwill just say it anyway.\n\n[[Page S13958]]\n\nThey can't just say it anyway. These are professionals. They know what \nthe standards are. They know that we have to have some proof to justify \ndelayed notice or non-notification. The notification question has to be \nso significant that they can articulate and have proof that it \nrepresents a threat to somebody. I think that is too high a standard in \nthese kinds of rare cases involving national security and the \ninvestigation of terrorism.\n  There is a show on one of the cable stations right now called \n``Sleeper Cell.'' They have an undercover operative in one of these \nterrorist cells, and he meets with them. That is something you would \nlove to see. One time I saw it. They had some hypothetical scene in \nwhich they said this was the only sleeper cell that they had ever \npenetrated. I don't know how many sleeper cells are penetrated today, \nbut that is a hard thing to do. It is hard to get somebody in one of \nthese closed, tightknit groups to know what they are doing. But if they \ndo, they can go into the person's house. They can go wherever they are \ninvited to go with the bad guys and record them if they have a \nrecorder. That is perfectly legitimate under the law. But you don't \noften have that. And so how do you protect America?\n  You have to have records and documents. You have to be able to obtain \nevidence. Someone says: This individual came into our neighborhood, our \ncommunity, Mr. FBI Agent. I just heard him talking. It sounded like he \nwas talking about maybe being a terrorist. He sounded like he was \ninvolved in terrorist talk.\n  What does that agent need to do? He needs to act quickly. What would \nbe one of the first things he would want to do? He is in contact with \nother terrorist groups. Is he communicating with terrorists around the \nworld? How would you find that out? You don't need to tap their phones. \nAll you would really need to do is obtain a subpoena for telephone toll \nrecords. A local county district attorney can subpoena telephone toll \nrecords to investigate an individual on a marijuana charge. Why in the \nworld couldn't an FBI agent be able to get a subpoena for these records \nif he certifies under oath that it is related to a national security \nmatter? Then if you see a bunch of telephone toll records between that \nindividual and a known terrorist organization somewhere, you know this \nis not just a tip, this is the real thing.\n\n  That is what goes on in our investigative agencies today. They are \nnot out there trying to snoop on your or my phone calls. They would be \nbored stiff listening to my phone calls.\n  This legislation is sound. It has been carefully debated. It came out \nof the Senate 4 years ago with only one ``no'' vote. It has even more \ncivil liberties protections in it now than it did then. We ought to be \npassing it. We don't need to allow this legislation to lapse.\n  I am chagrined that the leadership was virtually ambushed. From out \nof nowhere comes this full-fledged filibuster led by the Democratic \nside. Yes, there were four Republicans who voted against cloture. But \nonly 2 of the 45 Democrats voted to move the bill forward. It was \nbasically blocked by the Democratic Party. They had the votes to block \nit.\n  It is disappointing. We need not to allow this to happen. I hope my \ncolleagues will review the bill, that they will think about those \nagents out there this very day trying to protect us from harm, and that \nthey will consider carefully their votes. Let's move forward.\n  There is some thought that we can just moderate this bill some more, \nthat we will just keep on weakening the bill, and that will be the \nprice to pay for passing it. I don't think this bill needs to be \nweakened. I don't think it needs to be undermined any more than it is \nright now. It is a sound piece of legislation, and I will oppose that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to echo what Senator Sessions just \nsaid. I have tried to be involved with this detainee issue in as \nbalanced a way as I can. I don't want my country to go down the road of \nadopting the tactics of our enemy. That has never been the issue. We \nhave had some people who have done some bad things, and they have been \nprosecuted. But when you get editorials from major papers such as the \nNew York Times saying our troops routinely abuse people, that is \nludicrous. There have been thousands of people detained in this war. \nSome have been mistreated. We are prosecuting those people. We can do \nbetter, but we will do better. We are trying to get a grip on our \npolicies so that we cannot only live up to who we are as a people but \ndefend ourselves, too.\n  This enemy knows no bounds. This enemy is a ruthless enemy. They \ntrain each other to allege abuse. That is part of the al-Qaida manual. \nThey will say anything. We want a process to make sure that real \nallegations are dealt with honestly and that mere accusations do not \nrequire us to let these people go and not be able to defend ourselves.\n  This editorial refers to the so-called war on terror. That is a \nmindset we need to reject. This is not a so-called war.\n  I just got back from Iraq. It is a real war. Five minutes before the \npolls opened, they lobbed a shell over where we were staying. One \nmarine was injured. It is a real war to him and to all the other people \nwho have been wounded and to the families who have lost their loved \nones. It is a real war to the 3,000 people killed on 9/11 and their \nfamilies. It is a real event. We are at war.\n  I am insistent that my country live up to its obligations under \ntreaties, the law of armed conflict. I am equally insistent that our \nlaw reflect we are at war.\n  Senator Sessions is a former U.S. attorney.\n  We are not fighting crime here, we are fighting a war or terror. The \nPATRIOT Act is not about prosecuting people who are involved in \ncriminal enterprises. The PATRIOT Act is about preventing the \ninfiltration of our country by a foreign enemy who wants to blow us up \nand kill Americans.\n  During World War II, the War Powers Act was passed, and that makes \nthis bill look like the ACLU. There were some very strong measures \ntaken after Pearl Harbor, and they worked. The Germans and Japanese \ninfiltrators were caught and our country, for the most part, was not \ninfiltrated. The FBI and other organizations did a marvelous job \nprotecting us against ruthless enemies, the Nazis and the Japanese.\n  This enemy is just as ruthless. We don't have to pick and choose \nbetween abandoning the rule of law and civil liberties. We don't have \nto choose between letting people go or anything goes. That is not the \nchoice. The PATRIOT Act is a balance. Here is what I worry the most \nabout: As we try to straighten out past mistakes, as we try to come up \nwith new policies, I worry that we are slowly but surely losing the \nidea that we are at war. That is beginning to fade, and we are \napproaching this problem we face called terrorism as if it were a \ndomestic criminal event. If we do that, our enemy will have \nopportunities they do not deserve. Our people will suffer.\n  So count me in and sign me up for adhering to the law of armed \nconflict and for maintaining the moral high ground. But I reject an \neffort to criminalize what I think is world war III.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. CHAMBLISS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will ask him to tell us how many years \nhe has been a U.S. Army JAG officer. He has been so familiar with all \nthese issues and has provided much leadership to it with some great \nideas in recent weeks on some of the amendments he has offered. I think \npeople need to listen to what he said about the difference between war \nand criminality.\n  The President said at the beginning that we cannot treat this as \ncrime; this is war. I think the Congress was all for it. We all said \n``yes.'' And now these issues arise again. I thank the Senator for \nsharing that. I had one more question I wanted to raise with him.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the compliment. I don't want to defame the \nArmy. I am in the Air Force. I have been in the Air Force as an Active-\nDuty Reserve lawyer for 20-something years. By no means am I an \ninternational expert, but I feel as though I am going to get a master's \ndegree in this type of law when this is all over. The bottom line is, I \nhave a general understanding of how the law of armed conflict works \nversus domestic criminal law because that is what I used to\n\n[[Page S13959]]\n\ndo. That is what I kind of still do. I understand the difference \nbetween defensive measures. Keeping an enemy from infiltrating a \ncountry is a different need than trying to domestically control the \nbehavior of your own citizens. Sometimes your own citizens jump sides \nand join the enemy. When they do that, I don't have a lot of sympathy \nfor them. So we have a different task at hand.\n  This is not regulating U.S. domestic criminal enterprises. This is \ntrying to stop an enemy that is hell-bent on coming back. And they are \ncoming. They are here. Thanks to fighting them hard, we have stopped \nthem for 4 years. But it is inevitable that we are going to hit again.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was pleased to be able to join with Senator Graham \nand Senators Lieberman, Bayh, Brownback, and a number of other \nSenators, in forming a caucus or a group to treat the energy threats to \nthis country as a national security threat. Now I think it is \nunfortunate--and it is a complex Senate that we are operating in \ntoday--that ANWR legislation will be a part of that bill. I wish it did \nnot have to be, but things boiled down at the end of the session to \nthat way. I would like to have the Senator share some thoughts on the \nphilosophy of that bipartisan group that energy is security for our \nNation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for the question. I think we have \ncome to the conclusion, after $3-a-gallon gas, oil and gas prices are \nalso good domestic politics because we all got our heads handed to us \nat home. Everybody is upset. If you are working in South Carolina \nmaking $7, $8, $10-an-hour and gas is $3 a gallon, it really hits home. \nWhat we came together on is trying to find a political solution to the \ndomestic problem. What Senator Sessions indicated is that we came \ntogether on the fact that if we are this dependent as a Nation on \nMideast oil, fossil fuels, 10 or 20 years from now, we have done our \nNation a disservice because our national security interest is best \nserved when we can be independent from forces we cannot control. We \nshould, as a Nation, a long time ago have become more energy \nindependent. It is a national mistake, from a security perspective, to \nhave this much dependence on fossil fuels from a region that is this \nvolatile. It weakens our ability as a Nation to protect ourselves.\n  In that regard, some Republicans and Democrats have come up with a \nproposal to be aggressive to wean us off Mideast foreign oil because it \nreally does hurt our national security interest. We should not be this \nbeholden to any region of the world for everyday functions in this \ncountry.\n  A final thought about the PATRIOT Act. Those who oppose it, I respect \nyou for standing up for the American way, civil liberties. But there \nhas to be a balance here. When I go to the library, I don't want to be \nbothered. Let me tell you, if there is a reason to believe somebody is \ngoing to the library or using everyday life in America as a tool to \ninfiltrate our country and do damage, I think we have to have a balance \nbecause they are here. The Presiding Officer knows better than I that \nthey are here. The hijackers of 9/11 had multiple driver's licenses. \nThey know how to game the system. They know how to get access to our \ntechnology and our science. If we don't have the common sense to have a \nbalanced approach to get ahead of them, and if we play this game that \nthis is crime and not a war, we are going to empower them beyond what \nis reasonable.\n  If we leave as a body and let this act expire because we cannot find \ncommon ground, then I think we have done the country a great \ndisservice, and the enemy would appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding--and I ask the Chair if this is correct--that a Presiding \nOfficer, under the rules of the Senate, is not allowed to engage in \ndebate other than to object to motions in his capacity from the State \nfrom which he comes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedent of the Senate, the \nPresiding Officer has no right to engage in conversation with Senators \non the floor. He should not participate in debate.\n  Mr. COBURN. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. However, a Senator may vote from the chair.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair. In the earlier discussion we had, it \nwas stated by the minority leader that the Presiding Officer can debate \nfrom the chair. I did not think that was right. In fact, it is not \ncorrect.\n  I want to wrap up with a couple of thoughts. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion this evening about process and precedent and keeping your \nword. As we think about what that means to our country, we ought to go \na little further back and think about the heritage that has been given \nto this country by those who came before us. I want to characterize a \ncouple points of that.\n  One is doing whatever we have to do, including personal sacrifice, to \nassure opportunity and a great future for those who follow.\n  It seems to me, as we get hung up on a discussion of process, that we \nought to pay as much attention to heritage. I mean by that, we are \nhaving trouble passing the Labor-HHS bill. It is the first bill to come \nthrough this Senate in a number of years that doesn't have any earmarks \non it. I suspect the reason people don't want to vote for it is because \nthey did not get the political benefit of placing the public's dollars \nto their own political advantage.\n  The other point is we hear debate that it does not supply enough. The \nreal heritage that came before us is Members of this body making the \nhard choices--not easy choices, hard choices--about priorities. We are \nat such a point that this next year is going to be a very difficult \nyear for us in terms of how we pay for a war, how we pay for Katrina, \nand the related items we have an obligation to pay for, and not \ndiminish the opportunity and the future of our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  I think we would be very wise to not put the purity of our own \nprocess ahead of our basic morality and ethics of maintaining the \nheritage this country has.\n  I will not say any more. I know we are about to wrap up, and I \nappreciate the time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13959-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13959-S13960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JIM SCHLINKMANN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life of a public \nservant who worked in one of the most beautiful corners of Nevada, \nGreat Basin National Park. James ``Jim'' Schlinkmann was chief ranger \nof the park and passed away while returning home from an assignment on \nthe National Park Service Team assisting with Hurricane Wilma recovery.\n  I met Jim several times at the park, most recently during this year's \nFourth of July weekend when I traveled out to Baker, NV, for the grand \nopening of the new Great Basin Visitor Center. On that day, Jim \npersonally presented me with a spectacular photo of a Great Basin \nNational Park icon, an ancient bristlecone pine.\n  I have an especially clear recollection of that day, and of Jim, \nbecause the opening of the new visitor center was such a special event. \nCowboy poetry was read, patriotic songs were sung, and friends came \ntogether to celebrate the tremendous landscape that exists at Great \nBasin National Park. The picture that Jim presented to me is now \nhanging in my Reno office and is a joyful reminder of that day and of \nthe last time I got to visit with Jim.\n  I know from my conversations with Jim and from the park's \nsuperintendent that Jim loved the mountains of Great Basin National \nPark where he spent the last 5 years. He will most definitely be \nremembered fondly there. And I will remember his dedicated public \nservice at Great Basin and all the many parks he served during his 23-\nyear career.\n  Some of Jim's many accomplishments include his expertise as a rock\n\n[[Page S13960]]\n\nclimber that allowed him to make enormous contributions to the National \nPark Service technical rescue program. Jim helped develop some of the \nfirst organized technical rescue courses at Joshua Tree National Park \nand for 7 years was a lead instructor for the National Park Service \nTechnical Rescue Course, which is taught annually at Canyonlands \nNational Park.\n  Before coming to Great Basin, Jim served as the chief ranger at \nDevils Tower National Monument in Wyoming. The former superintendent of \nDevils Tower recalls Jim as an outstanding liaison to both the climbing \ncommunity and to the American Indian community. In addition to his \ntours of duty at Great Basin, Joshua Tree and Devils Tower, Jim also \nserved as a ranger at Shoshone National Forest, Denali National Park \nand Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  Jim Schlinkmann was a man who dedicated himself to protecting the \nvery best of America's lands and who represented the very best of \nAmerica's spirit.\n  I will miss seeing him on my next visit to Great Basin National Park. \nAnd I will be thinking about him the next time I look up at the \nremarkable snow-covered peaks of the south Snake Range.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13960-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SANDY LEE AVANTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a woman who has \ndedicated herself to serving the people of Nevada and who has left a \nlasting impact through her work in government.\n  Ms. Sandy Lee Avants was born and raised in Phoenix, AZ. Following \ngraduation from Arizona State University, she moved to Las Vegas. As a \ntestament to Sandy's character, within the first month of her residence \nin Las Vegas, she immediately became involved in the local community \nthrough service clubs.\n  Sandy has had success both in her professional life and in public \nservice. Following a prosperous private business enterprise, she began \nher career in Nevada's government when Senator Richard Bryan was \nserving as Governor. Governor Bryan then appointed Sandy to be chairman \nof the State of Nevada's Commission on Ethics in 1983 and in 1986 \nappointed her as the administrator of the Real Estate Division. In \n1987, Sandy became the first woman to head a State law enforcement \nagency when she became the administrator of the Taxicab Authority.\n  Sandy's accomplishments came at a time when Nevada needed them the \nmost. Her most recent appointment was to the Transportation Service \nAuthority, TSA, in Nevada, where she served as the deputy commissioner, \ncommissioner, and chairwoman. At TSA, she administered and enforced \nNevada's law related to passenger transportation, household goods \nmovement, and car towing companies. Additionally, she ensured that \nconsumers utilizing these services were protected. Sandy has met the \nneeds of a rapidly growing public and shown her professionalism and \ncommitment to Nevada and its people.\n  Those are a few of the many visible contributions that Sandy made to \nthe community, but her most important contributions were made outside \nof the public eye. Sandy was a founding member and president of the \nGreater Las Vegas Women's League. She is also a founding member of the \nInternational Association of Transportation Regulators, and a Community \nAdvisory Board at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. During her time \nin Nevada, Sandy enrolled in various courses at the National Judicial \nCollege and received certification as an administrative law judge and \nmentor. From 1999 through 2002, Sandy worked closely with me in \nWashington, DC, creating congressional legislation to improve \ntransportation in Nevada.\n  I have known Sandy for many years and recognize the many \ncontributions she has made to the community. Sandy's hard work and \ncharacter have left a lasting impression on our State and community.\n  Sandy recently retired from the Nevada State government, but I am \nsure that she will continue working in public service through her \nnumerous volunteer positions. The State of Nevada is fortunate to have \nSandy Avants. I offer her my gratitude and wish her all the best as she \nembarks on new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13960-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FULL FUNDING FOR PANDEMIC FLU PREPAREDNESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Earlier today, Senator Frist spoke about the importance of \npreparing our Nation for the serious and growing threat of an influenza \npandemic.\n  Members of this body made pandemic flu a priority when it unanimously \nadopted an $8 billion amendment to combat avian flu offered by Senate \nDemocrats.\n  I hope that Senator Frist will join me in standing by this commitment \nand will work to ensure that Congress provides for the full $8 billion \nAmerica needs to begin addressing this critical issue before we \nadjourn.\n  The avian flu has spread to 15 countries and killed 70 of the 137 \nindividuals it has infected. Scientists are warning that it is only a \nmatter of time before this virus mutates to a new strain that will \nallow for sustained human-to-human transmission and cause the next \npandemic.\n  The human and economic impact of an influenza pandemic on our Nation \nwould be devastating.\n  According to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office, a \nsevere flu pandemic could infect 90 million U.S. residents and 2 \nmillion would die.\n  Thirty percent of the workforce would become ill and those who \nsurvived would miss 3 weeks of work. This lost productivity and \ndecrease in consumer spending could cause a $675 billion reduction in \nU.S. gross domestic product and move the Nation into a recession.\n  Perhaps the only thing more troubling than the human and economic \nconsequences of an avian flu pandemic is the fact that our Nation is \ndangerously unprepared to deal with it.\n  We are not dedicating enough resources to global surveillance \nactivities that allow us to detect and contain an outbreak of avian \nflu.\n  If we are unable to contain a pandemic overseas, our strongest \ndefense at home will be an effective vaccine. However, our domestic \nvaccine manufacturing capacity is so inadequate it could take nearly a \nyear to produce and distribute a vaccine.\n  Effective drugs that can slow the spread of a pandemic until a \nvaccine is developed are only available for 2 percent of our \npopulation.\n  Finally, all of these problems are compounded by the fact that our \npublic health infrastructure cannot handle a pandemic and the medical \ncommunity, businesses, and general public must be better prepared for a \npandemic.\n  All of these facts are reasons why Congress must immediately address \nthe avian flu threat and why the Senate voted to do just that earlier \nthis year.\n  I am troubled by reports that congressional Republicans are on the \nverge of approving about half of the amount approved by the Senate.\n  Senator Frist rightly pointed out that the threat of pandemic flu is \nnot and should not be a partisan issue. A pandemic strain of flu will \nnot distinguish between Democrats or Republicans.\n  That is why I hope that Senator Frist will stand with me and will \ncontinue to fight for the full funding level approved by the Senate so \nour Government may begin to prepare and protect our Nation from this \nlooming threat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13960-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13960-S13963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STEM CELL THERAPEUTIC AND RESEARCH ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act of 2005, which would establish a national \ncord blood stem cell bank. This legislation was agreed to last night \nduring wrap-up under unanimous consent.\n  I would like to congratulate the majority leader and all parties \ninvolved in yesterday's achievement, which resulted in passage of the \ncord blood bill. As you will recall, it was just 2 days ago that the \nother side, through the junior Senator from Iowa, reaffirmed their \nobjections to consideration of this important legislation.\n  Their objections, it seems, were not substantive as this legislation \nhas been championed by Members from both sides of the aisle and as \nfurther evidenced by the lifting of objections and\n\n[[Page S13961]]\n\nthe cord blood bill passing without any opposition. Passage without any \nopposition in the Senate is truly rare. Rather, the other side's \nobjections were tied to their support for additional funding of highly \ncontroversial destructive human embryonic stem cell research, which \ndespite sufficient funding and years of research has yet to cure--or \neven treat--one human patient yet.\n  Clearly, the other side wants a vote on their embryonic stem cell \nlegislation, which requires the destruction of young human lives. On \nthe other hand, I and many of my colleagues would also like for us to \nhave an up-or-down vote on the Human Cloning Prohibition Act or the \nHuman Chimera Prohibition Act, but we have been denied this by the \nother side. There will be a time for a vigorous debate on all of these \nissues next year, and I look forward to engaging in that debate.\n  However, ethical, noncontroversial cord blood stem cell research \nshould not have been made the political football that it was for the \nintervening months between House passage of the bill in May and \nyesterday's action in the Senate. Once again, I would like to commend \nall of my colleagues for depoliticizing the issue of cord blood. \nPatients will be benefited almost immediately, and, yes, more kids' \nlives will be saved because we passed this bill yesterday, rather than \nsometime next year. I applaud the other side for recognizing this fact.\n  Yesterday, the junior Senator from Iowa took to the floor and \nchallenged my statement from Thursday evening that ``more kids will die \nif we don't take up the cord blood bill.'' I would merely like to spend \na few minutes highlighting the truth of my statement.\n  Cord blood stem cell research involves the blood from human umbilical \ncords. Cord blood contains a high number of pluripotent stem cells; and \nit is currently treating real people and saving many lives.\n  Contemplation of cord blood stem cell's therapeutic power is \nsomething that many in my office are currently contemplating, as at \nleast five staff members or their spouses are expecting babies right \nnow. We even thought that one of them was coming a few nights ago, but \nit was a false alarm.\n  Unlike human embryonic stem cells, which require the destruction of \nyoung human beings, umbilical cord blood stem cells are completely \nethical as their derivation and use results in no harm to any human \nbeings. Cord blood has incredible therapeutic power.\n  To better harness the power of cord blood, thereby saving more lives, \nthe cord blood bill that passed last night was essential. While I had \nworked closely with Senator Specter in channeling appropriation funds \nto establish a national cord blood stem cell bank, without the \nauthorizing legislation, which we passed last night, these funds did \nnot have the necessary structure to be effective.\n  However, should the House send the bill to the President tonight--as \nwe expect--a structure will go into effect that will immediately begin \ncollecting cord blood units and making them available to Americans \nsuffering from a variety of diseases from blood cancers to neurological \ndiseases. Without the structure that cord blood bill provides, many \nfewer patients will benefit and some waiting on cord blood will die.\n  To highlight this, I will share a few stories of real people who have \nbeen successfully treated with cord blood stem cells.\n  The first story is of Keone Penn, a young man cured of sickle cell \nanemia a disease that afflicts more than 70,000 Americans, particularly \nAfrican Americans. Keone, of course, tells his story the best; so \nlisten to his testimony before a Senate Science Subcommittee hearing \nthat I chaired on June 12, 2003:\n\n       My name is Keone Penn. Two days ago, I turned 17 years old. \n     Five years ago, they said I wouldn't live to be 17. They said \n     I'd be dead within 5 years. I was born with sickle cell \n     anemia. Sickle cell is a very bad disease. I had a stroke \n     when I was 5 years old. Things got even worse after that. My \n     life has been full of pain crises, blood transfusions every \n     two weeks, and more times in the hospital than I can count. \n     The year before I had my stem cell transplant, I was in the \n     hospital 13 times. I never was able to have a normal life. My \n     stem cell transplant was not easy, but I thank God that I'm \n     still here. I will graduate from high school this year. I \n     want to become a chef because I love to cook. I think I'm \n     pretty good at it. Sickle cell is now a part of my past. One \n     year after my transplant, I was pronounced cured. Stem cells \n     saved my life.\n\n  It is important to realize though that cord blood treats many other \ndiseases. Consider the story of Erik Haines, who received a successful \ncord blood stem cell transplant to treat Krabbe disease. Krabbe disease \nis an often fatal neurological disease. This helps to illustrate how \nbroadly effective cord blood stem cells really are.\n  Erik Haines made medical history at age 2 when he became one of the \nfirst cord blood transplant patients at the University of Minnesota on \nJuly 24, 1994. Erik had suffered from the genetic blood disorder Krabbe \ndisease, from which his younger brother Adam died. Since his umbilical \ncord blood transplant, annual exams at the University of Minnesota are \nnot full of foreboding or anxiety; and check-ups with Erik's \npediatrician likewise seem routine. Also, like many boys, Erik enjoys \nbaseball, soccer, and swimming. Erik's father Paul Haines says:\n\n       The only real lasting effects are complications from the \n     radiation he received--small cataracts. He wears glasses and \n     has a little trouble seeing the board from the back of the \n     room.\n\n  Both Keone and Erik's treatments took place in the 1990s, and cord \nblood stem cell research has made even greater progress since then. We \nlearn of new, exciting developments every month.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, we heard about this on local DC television \nstations.\n  On November 30, 2005, two local DC TV stations reported on separate \nlife saving cures emerging from umbilical cord blood stem cells. \nChannel 7 focused on the Korean cord blood stem cell treatment for \nspinal cord injury and the procedure's first U.S. patient, a Virginia \nwoman.\n  Channel 4 highlighted two children in a local family--Riverdale, MD--\ncured of SCIDS--severe combined immune deficiency syndrome--also known \nas ``bubble boy disease'' by cord blood from unrelated donors.\n  And on October 23, 2005, the Chicago Tribune reported:\n\n       Cord blood is surprising researchers with previously \n     unrecognized healing powers that go far beyond its known \n     effectiveness against childhood leukemia and some other \n     disorders. Early research in animals suggests that cord blood \n     may provide a new bounty of cures and treatments for many \n     other medical conditions, including heart attack, Parkinson's \n     disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy, \n     diabetes, spinal cord injury and amyotrophic lateral \n     sclerosis . . . In May, the New England Journal of Medicine \n     published a study showing that a cord blood transplant \n     performed as soon as possible after birth can, for the first \n     time, stop the deadly course of Krabbe disease.\n\n  There are thousands of testimonies of the efficaciousness of cord \nblood stem cells. There are also innumerable new stories and medical \njournal articles on amazing advances in disease treatments in real \nhuman patients with cord blood stem cells.\n  There are more than ample, documented medical articles, on which I \nbase my claim that because the Senate acted and passed the cord blood \nbill this week, more kids' lives will be saved.\n  As for speculative, destructive, human embryonic stem cell research, \nthere is not yet even one patient trial with embryonic stem cells for \nany disease; and it is not for lack of years of research, \nprohibitions--there are none--or lack of funding. It is because \nembryonic stem cells form cancers and tumors due to their immature \nstate. Regarding destructive human embryonic stem cell research, even \nthe prestigious journal Science acknowledged on June 17, 2005, that:\n\n       It is nearly certain that the clinical benefits of the \n     research are years or decades away. This is a message that \n     desperate families and patients will not want to hear.\n\n  With last night's passage of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research \nAct, the Senate formally recognized the lifesaving value of cord blood \nstem cell research. I have worked closely with Senator Specter over the \npast few years to appropriate nearly $20 million for the purpose of \nestablishing a national cord blood bank. And I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation that passed out of \nthis chamber last night.\n  I am also proud that we were able to move in a bipartisan manner on \nthis legislation. Working alongside Senators Hatch, Dodd, Specter, \nHarkin, Enzi, and Frist on this issue was a\n\n[[Page S13962]]\n\npleasure and helps to demonstrate that the two parties can work \ntogether effectively.\n  Everybody wins with cord blood stem cell research. Patients win \nbecause they receive successful treatments and cures. Human dignity \nwins because cord blood stem cell research respects all human life and \ndoes not kill the young human embryo, as is the case with human-\ndestructive embryonic stem cell research.\n  Cord blood doesn't just hold promise. Cord blood is producing real \ntreatments and even real cures for a variety of maladies afflicting \nreal people right now. Passage of this bill should be celebrated, and I \ncommend my colleagues for this wonderful achievement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Chairman Specter \nand Chairman Roberts for their extraordinary work in forging a \nconference report on the reauthorization of certain provisions of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act. I remain disappointed that many concessions were made \nto minority members of the conference which not only did not result in \ntheir support of the conference report but which, in my judgment, are \nunwise on the merits.\n  On November 17, I wrote to the conferees identifying some of these \nunwise concessions. They included: a three-part test for relevance in \nsection 215; additional reporting requirements and inspector general \naudit provisions; sunsetting the ``lone-wolf'' wolf FISA warrant \nprovisions; thirty day initial limit on delayed notice search warrants; \napplying minimization provisions to subpoenas; and the deletion of \nimportant death penalty provisions which were contained in the House \nversion.\n  In my letter, I urged that no further concessions be made. Yet \nfurther concessions were made. These additional concessions include \nstripping a criminal penalty of up to 1 year imprisonment for a knowing \nand willful violation of the nondisclosure provision of national \nsecurity letters. This makes a mockery of the nondisclosure provision \nitself.\n  Despite these significant accommodations which were made in the \ninterest of bipartisan compromise, I am distressed to learn that, even \nnow, certain of my colleagues are not only still opposing this bill, \nbut are urging further delay, further compromise, and further weakening \nof the bill. This effort should be soundly rejected by this body. \nHowever, should there be a delay, and the opportunity for additional \nchanges to the conference report, I will urge that we revisit these \nill-advised concessions already made and that they be deleted from the \nbill. That said, I hope that we do not go down that road. I hope that \nboth sides will rise above our particular preferences for a perfect \nbill, and vote for the good of the Nation and its citizens who have \nbeen protected by this historic legislation for the last 5 years.\n  I am also disappointed that certain of my colleagues have seen fit to \noppose the conference report over a single issue--the appropriate \nstandard of judicial review of the national security letters \nnondisclosure provisions. These opponents would ask courts to assess \npotential damage to national security rather than the officials in our \nGovernment in the intelligence and diplomatic community who are the \nonly ones capable of making such determinations based on all available \nintelligence and investigative information.\n  While I am not pleased with every provision of this final bill, some \nof which I have just reviewed, on balance I am satisfied that overall \nthe final language agreed to represents a reaffirmation of the Nation's \ncommitment to modernization of our criminal and intelligence \ninvestigative laws and commonsense law enforcement\n  The USA PATRIOT Act provisions, which Congress wisely passed \nfollowing the terrorist attacks on our soil and the callous murder of \ninnocent civilians, have stood the test of time. The act's provisions \nhave helped to keep us safe and to protect our liberties which were \njeopardized, not by expanded governmental authority, but by violent \nattacks against our way of life by terrorists.\n  Those who urge further changes and further weakening are, in my \njudgment, playing a dangerous political game, intended or not, at the \nexpense of our national security and our personal liberties--liberties \nprotected by the commonsense provisions of the PATRIOT Act. Provisions \nof the act have been utilized to accomplish amazing victories in the \nwar on terrorism and to keep us safe and free. Let me highlight just a \nfew from information provided by the Department of Justice:\n  The Department of Justice successfully dismantled a Portland, OR, \nterror cell known as the ``Portland Seven.'' Members of this terror \ncell had attempted to travel to Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 to take up \narms with the Taliban and al-Qaida against United States and coalition \nforces fighting there. The USA PATRIOT Act information-sharing \nprovisions were critical in taking down the Portland cell.\n  The Department of Justice successfully convicted members of an al-\nQaida cell in Lackawanna, NY, that involved several residents of \nLackawanna who traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 to receive training at \nan al-Qaida-affiliated camp near Kandahar. Five of the Lackawanna Six \npleaded guilty to providing material support to al-Qaida, and the sixth \npleaded guilty to conducting transactions unlawfully with al-Qaida. \nThe USA PATRIOT Act information-sharing and national security letter \nprovisions were critical to this case.\n\n  The Department of Justice successfully prosecuted the so-called \nVirginia Jihad case involving members of the Dar al-Arqam Islamic \nCenter, who trained for jihad in Northern Virginia, including eight \nindividuals who traveled to terrorist training camps in Pakistan or \nAfghanistan between 1999 and 2001. Six of the defendants have pleaded \nguilty and three were convicted in March 2004 of charges including \nconspiracy to levy war against the United States and conspiracy to \nprovide material support to the Taliban. The USA PATRIOT Act was \ncritical to this case.\n  In May of 2003, Ahmed Omar Abu Ali was arrested after having sought \nout and joined an al-Qaida cell in Medina, Saudi Arabia, where he \nreceived training in weapons, explosives, and document forgery. He, \nalong with other members of the cell, began to develop plans for \nseveral potential terrorist attacks against the United States, \nincluding a plot to assassinate President Bush. Abu Ali was recently \nconvicted in Federal district court.\n  On November 23, 2005, Uzair Paracha was convicted in New York of all \nfive counts in an indictment that included charges of conspiracy and \nproviding material support to al-Qaida. Paracha traveled to the United \nStates in February 2003 to assist al-Qaida, including posing as a \nperson Paracha knew to be an al-Qaida associate, obtaining immigration \ndocuments that would permit that al-Qaida member to enter the United \nStates, and conducting financial transactions involving the al-Qaida \nassociate's bank accounts.\n  The Department of Justice also indicted Mohammed Junaid Babar for \nmaterial support of al-Qaida after he arranged for a month-long jihadi \ntraining camp, at which attendees received training in basic military \nskills, explosives and weapons. Among the attendees were individuals \nwho were plotting to bomb targets abroad. Babar pleaded guilty to \nproviding material support, among other charges, and cooperated with \nongoing investigations.\n  New York defense attorney Lynne Stewart, Mohammed Yousry, and Ahmed \nAbdel Sattar were recently convicted by a jury of material support \ncharges in connection with passing messages to a terrorist \norganization, known as the Islamic Group, from Sheik Abdel Rahman, the \nIslamic Group's imprisoned leader. Abdel-Rahman is serving a life \nsentence plus 65 years for his role in terrorist activities, including \nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Sattar was also convicted \nof conspiring to kill persons in a foreign country and for solicitation \nof crimes of violence.\n  On October 24, 2005, the Department of Justice announced the historic \nextradition of the notorious Taliban-linked narcoterrorist Baz \nMohammad. Mohammad has been indicted for allegedly manufacturing and \ndistributing tens of millions of dollars worth of heroin in Afghanistan \nand Pakistan. He was closely aligned with the Taliban and other \nIslamic-extremist groups in Afghanistan, providing financial support to \nthe Taliban with proceeds from heroin sales in the United States.\n\n[[Page S13963]]\n\n  John Walker Lindh, the ``American Taliban'' captured on the \nbattlefield in Afghanistan, pleaded guilty to supporting the Taliban \nand has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. As part of his plea \nagreement, Lindh has provided information about training camps and \nfighting in Afghanistan.\n  Another potentially devastating attack was averted when Richard Reid, \nthe so-called shoe bomber, was foiled in his attempt to detonate a bomb \non American Airlines flight 63 during flight. Reid was charged as a \ntrained terrorist for this attempted terrorist attack. He pled guilty \nto all charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment on January 30, \n2003.\n  The Department of Justice successfully detected and disrupted \nsinister plans in Lodi, CA. Hamid Hayat was indicted and charged with \nmaterial support to terrorists after he allegedly attended a terrorist \ntraining camp in Pakistan in 2004 and returned to this country with the \nintent of committing jihad against America. Additional associates have \nbeen deported and one charged with two counts of lying to Federal \nagents.\n  In United States v. Odeh, a naroterrorism case, investigators used a \ncourt-issued delayed-notice search warrant to search an envelope mailed \nto a target of the investigation. The search confirmed that the target \nwas operating an illegal money exchange to funnel money to the Middle \nEast, including to an associate of an apparent Islamic Jihad operative \nin Israel. The delayed-notice provision allowed investigators to \nconduct the search without compromising an ongoing wiretap on the \ntarget and several confederates.\n  The information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement \npersonnel made possible by USA PATRIOT Act section 218 was useful in \nthe investigation of two Yemeni citizens, Mohammed Ali Hasan Al-Moayad \nand Mohshen Yahya Zayed, who were charged in 2003 with conspiring to \nprovide material support to al-Qaida and Hamas. Following their \nindictment, Al-Moayad and Zayed were extradited to the United States \nfrom Germany, and both were convicted in March 2005 of conspiring to \nprovide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\n  The Department of Justice used USA PATRIOT Act section 218 to gain \naccess to intelligence that facilitated the indictment of Enaam Amaout, \nthe executive director of the Illinois-based Benevolence International \nFoundation, BIF. Arnaout had a long-standing relationship with Osama \nbin Laden and used his charity organization both to obtain funds \nillicitly from unsuspecting Americans for terrorist organizations, such \nas al-Qaida, and to serve as a channel for people to contribute money \nknowingly to such groups. Arnaout ultimately pleaded guilty to a \nracketeering charge, admitting that he diverted thousands of dollars \nfrom BIF to support Islamic militant groups in Bosnia and Chechnya. He \nwas sentenced to more than 11 years in prison.\n  The broader information sharing made possible by USA PATRIOT Act \nsection 218 also assisted the prosecution in San Diego of several \npersons involved in an al-Qaida drugs-for-weapons plot, which \nculminated in two guilty pleas. Two defendants, Muhamed Abid Afridi and \nIlyas Ali, admitted that they conspired to distribute approximately \nfive metric tons of hashish and 600 kilograms of heroin originating in \nPakistan to undercover U.S. law enforcement officers. Additionally, \nthey admitted that they conspired to receive, as partial payment for \nthe drugs, four Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that they then intended \nto sell to the Taliban, an organization they knew at the time to be \naffiliated with al-Qaida. Afridi and Ali pleaded guilty to the felony \ncharges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and \nconspiracy to distribute heroin and hashish. The lead defendant in the \ncase is currently awaiting trial.\n  Section 218 of the PATRIOT Act was critical in the successful \nprosecution of Khaled Abdel Latif Dumeisi, who was convicted by a jury \nin January 2004 of illegally acting as an agent of the former \ngovernment of Iraq as well as two counts of perjury. Before the gulf \nwar, Dumeisi passed information on Iraqi opposition members located in \nthe United States to officers of the Iraqi Intelligence Service \nstationed in the Iraqi mission to the United Nations. During this \ninvestigation, intelligence agents conducting surveillance of Dumeisi \npursuant to FISA coordinated and shared information with law \nenforcement agents and prosecutors investigating Dumeisi for possible \ncriminal violations. Because of this coordination, law enforcement \nagents and prosecutors learned from intelligence agents of an \nincriminating telephone conversation that took place in April 2003 \nbetween Dumeisi and a coconspirator. This phone conversation \ncorroborated other evidence that Dumeisi was acting as an agent of the \nIraqi government and provided a compelling piece of evidence at his \ntrial.\n  The use of cigarette smuggling to fund terrorism has been of grave \nconcern. On January 23, 2003, in United States v. Akhdar, et al., the \nDepartment of Justice indicted members of an organization that smuggled \nlow-taxed and untaxed cigarettes from State to State to evade sales \ntax. The defendants produced counterfeit tax stamps, obtained \ncounterfeit credit cards, laundered money, obstructed justice, and \ncommitted arson, and many are suspected of having links to and \nfinancing the terrorist organization Hizballah. As the investigation \nhas continued, additional indictments have been filed, and many \ndefendants have pleaded guilty to charges including RICO violations and \nmaterial support.\n  Investigators have also been able to avert potentially devastating \nattacks on our children. Ahmed Hassan al-Uqaily, an Iraqi national, \nspoke of ``going jihad,'' and arranged to procure pistols, machine \nguns, grenades and a ``tank missile,'' while suggesting he might target \nseveral Jewish schools in the Nashville area. An undercover agent \ncompleted the deal, posing as the weapons supplier, and the Iraqi \nnational agreed to pay $1,000 for two machine guns, ammunition and \ninert grenade components. The aspiring terrorist was arrested on \nOctober 7, 2004, and was sentenced on October 24, 2005, to 57 months in \nprison.\n  The PATRIOT Act has kept us free and kept us safe, and is doing so \nday in and day out. It is essential that this Congress renew this \nhistoric legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. We \nowe no less to the future generations of Americans and the freedom-\nloving peoples of the world. The stakes are too high to ignore our \nobligation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13963-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13963-S13964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, a very brief comment on this time of year, \nwith a few reflections on a very special time--Hanukkah.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity, once again, to visit the \nState of Israel. I say without reserve, the land of Israel touches my \nsoul. It does so when you are there and you have that opportunity to \nvisit the Old City, to visit the Western Wall.\n  I took the opportunity to meet with Israelis from all walks of life, \nvisiting several of the hospitals there, and visiting my professional \ncolleagues in medicine. I came to appreciate even more deeply the 4,000 \nyears of distinct and vibrant Jewish culture, as well as the Jewish \npeople's hopeful triumph over adversity and persecution.\n  So now, as Jews all over the world begin to prepare for the \ncelebration of Hanukkah, which this year begins on December 25, I \ninvite my colleagues to reflect on its meaning and its relevance to the \ncontinuity of Jewish culture and survival.\n  The First Book of Maccabees, a venerated ancient text, tells the \nstory of a revolt against a tyrant, the King Antiochus. King Antiochus \nwas a tyrant, a cruel leader, who attempted to outlaw the practice of \nJudaism, to forbid the study of Torah, and to compel, to force the \nworship of idols.\n  Joined by corrupt politicians in the land of Judea, he succeeded for \na time. Eventually, however, a popular uprising, led by a group who \ncalled themselves the Maccabees--and that translates into ``hammer''--\nexpelled his forces and reclaimed the Temple that became the center of \nthe Jewish faith.\n  Upon entering the desecrated Temple, Jewish soldiers and priests \ndiscovered that the eternal flame within had extinguished. The last \nstores of oil, those last little bits of oil, would only keep the lamp \nlit for a single day.\n  They lit the lamp with the oil that was left, and then something \nmiraculous happened. According to the ancient writings, instead of \nburning down, the lamp oil continually filled and refilled and \nrefilled, and the light in the Temple burned for 8 full days.\n  One can think of this story of faith and perseverance as truly \nemblematic of the Jewish journey. Just as, by God's grace, the lamp was \ncontinually filled, continually replenished, so, too, has the Jewish \nculture continued to thrive.\n  In honor of the rededication of the Temple and the Miracle of the \nLights, Jews all over the world celebrate Hanukkah by lighting a \nMenorah and drawing their families close.\n  Children play games and exchange gifts and, as every Jewish family \nknows, potato latkes and donuts cooked in oil are holiday favorites.\n  As those of us who are Christian celebrate the birth of Jesus this \nChristmas, let us also reflect on the story of Hanukkah and the ways in \nwhich the Almighty touches our daily lives.\n  I do wish my fellow Americans of the Jewish faith a happy Hanukkah \nand a safe, prosperous holiday season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/17/senate-section/article/S13969-2", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 6 P.M.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
